00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.190

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and so the main thing I felt about the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.650 
and so the main thing I felt about the
game<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.410> Newcastle<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:13.310> that<00:00:14.310> we<00:00:14.430> did<00:00:14.670> I'm

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
game and Newcastle was that we did I'm

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.440 
game and Newcastle was that we did I'm
what<00:00:15.930> I<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.139> pleased<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.380> our<00:00:16.650> defense<00:00:17.450> I

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
what I was pleased with our defense I

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.179 
what I was pleased with our defense I
thought<00:00:18.990> vimala<00:00:19.320> Michelle<00:00:19.890> needed

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
thought vimala Michelle needed

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.880 
thought vimala Michelle needed
particularly<00:00:20.640> well<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:22.260> thought<00:00:22.410> Chesney

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
particularly well and I thought Chesney

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.980 
particularly well and I thought Chesney
showed<00:00:23.449> good<00:00:24.449> judgment<00:00:25.760> in<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.150> wealth<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
showed good judgment in all of wealth in

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.349 
showed good judgment in all of wealth in
the<00:00:28.109> few<00:00:28.320> situations<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:29.190> he<00:00:29.789> had<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> deal

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the few situations that he had to deal

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.220 
the few situations that he had to deal
with<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.430> there<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:32.699> nice<00:00:33.230> interplay

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
with and there was some nice interplay

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.009 
with and there was some nice interplay
down<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.070> wings<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:36.180> gervinho<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
down the wings with gervinho and

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.150 
down the wings with gervinho and
arshavin<00:00:37.559> swapping<00:00:38.210> sides<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.860> it's<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
arshavin swapping sides and it's just a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.530 
arshavin swapping sides and it's just a
shame<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.399> there<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.820> no<00:00:41.970> real<00:00:42.210> final

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
shame that there was no real final

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.069 
shame that there was no real final
product<00:00:43.320> there<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.770> no<00:00:43.950> good<00:00:45.410> final<00:00:46.410> ball<00:00:48.079> we

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
product there was no good final ball we

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
product there was no good final ball we
looked<00:00:49.350> rather<00:00:50.040> hollow<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.700> middle<00:00:50.820> which

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
looked rather hollow in the middle which

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
looked rather hollow in the middle which
has<00:00:51.540> supposed<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.170> expected<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
has supposed to be expected when you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.410 
has supposed to be expected when you
don't<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.809> desk<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:56.840> jack<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> middle

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
don't have desk or jack in the middle

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.979 
don't have desk or jack in the middle
and<00:01:01.219> that<00:01:02.219> means<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.610> i<00:01:03.030> don't<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.870> sort

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and that means that i don't know we sort

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.660 
and that means that i don't know we sort
of<00:01:04.110> look<00:01:04.289> creatively<00:01:04.890> stunted<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.520> no

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of look creatively stunted with no

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.559 
of look creatively stunted with no
people<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.300> strings<00:01:07.009> in<00:01:08.009> midfield<00:01:08.190> and

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.029 

apart<00:01:12.569> from<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.470> thought<00:01:13.800> we<00:01:13.890> did

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
apart from that I I thought we did

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.199 
apart from that I I thought we did
really<00:01:14.280> well<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:15.149> kept<00:01:15.420> possession<00:01:17.209> pretty

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:18.209 
really well we kept possession pretty

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:23.540 
really well we kept possession pretty
well<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:20.190> rosettes<00:01:20.670> key<00:01:20.910> looks<00:01:21.679> great<00:01:22.679> in

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
well I think rosettes key looks great in

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.040 
well I think rosettes key looks great in
the<00:01:23.759> middle<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.149> looks<00:01:24.179> far<00:01:24.539> better<00:01:24.569> than<00:01:24.869> he

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
the middle it looks far better than he

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.499 
the middle it looks far better than he
ever<00:01:25.170> has<00:01:25.440> playing<00:01:25.770> anywhere<00:01:26.429> else<00:01:26.700> he's<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
ever has playing anywhere else he's a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.380 
ever has playing anywhere else he's a
good<00:01:27.599> tackler<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:29.060> although<00:01:30.060> he<00:01:30.149> they<00:01:30.240> get

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
good tackler and although he they get

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.930 
good tackler and although he they get
booked<00:01:30.660> when<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.709> time<00:01:32.009> god<00:01:32.429> I<00:01:32.459> remembered

Barton<00:05:10.479> did<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.870> I'm<00:05:10.960> hoping<00:05:11.380> that<00:05:12.060> he<00:05:13.060> gets

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
Barton did and I'm hoping that he gets

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.939 
Barton did and I'm hoping that he gets
some<00:05:13.419> kind<00:05:13.570> of<00:05:13.690> retrospective<00:05:14.050> punishment

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
some kind of retrospective punishment

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.980 
some kind of retrospective punishment
but<00:05:15.250> at<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.550> same<00:05:15.760> time<00:05:16.150> Gervinho<00:05:16.780> is<00:05:16.870> now

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
but at the same time Gervinho is now

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.909 
but at the same time Gervinho is now
going<00:05:17.199> to<00:05:17.260> be<00:05:17.349> banned<00:05:18.340> for<00:05:19.000> three<00:05:19.180> games<00:05:19.479> and

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.940 

so<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:52.540> final<00:05:52.750> thing<00:05:52.930> that<00:05:53.110> really<00:05:53.380> gets<00:05:53.590> me

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
so the final thing that really gets me

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.900 
so the final thing that really gets me
