 delivered the money for the acquisition 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.070
 of the cars but really the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.280
 vehicles are donated by a 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.860
 dealer in exchange for advertising 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.159
 every way the expense has been deducted 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.170
 of the contributions of the then leader what 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.320
 happened with the money that the leader gave 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.140
 for such awards when reviewing the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.810
 invoices of the tickets the entity observed 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.520
 that some of the athletes 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.950
 Internationals report up to three 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.710
 passages with the same itinerary without 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.200
 justification some that money 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.600
 was canceled to the travel agency with 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.450
 credit card and then reinstated to 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.340
 a third person who appears as 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.140
 representative of the athletes what 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.610
 indicates that the monies were not 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 managed from a checking account 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.080
 specific to the contract that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.360
 allowed to exercise a clear report of 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.790
 the transactions as it should be for the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.190
 handling of public monies 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.930
 and has always delivered the money in 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.970
 effective but in the foundation 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.370
 roadrunners of colombia or contractor 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.430
 has made the transactions by means of 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.190
 third-party credit cards in 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.600
 As regards advertising, it was determined that 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.270
 invoices that support the expenses 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.490
 made by this concept do not allow 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.860
 identify in detail the cost 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.500
 real advertising that paid the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.090
 institute of recreation and sports in 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700
 Regarding the number of registrations 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.260
 free was established that the listing 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.240
 of people benefited with the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.620
 free inscriptions for the media 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.870
 marathon of bogota 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.600
 apparently delivered by the leader of 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.530
 they received them from other sponsors and 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.950
 not as this entity indicates 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.750
 the comptroller's office there is evidence that 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.030
 legal nature ceases to be without 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.000
 profit motive to become a 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.010
 taxpayer over income tax 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.280
 there is no tax payment for these 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 negotiations clarify that those who 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.660
 we publish this message we are not 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.200
 accusing the leader of the foundation 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.360
 roadrunners of colombia as athletes and 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.640
 as citizens we only demand clarity 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.370
 Regarding this document issued 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.120
 by the Comptroller of Bogota dated 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.220
 September 15, 2011 we claim the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.650
 public pronouncement of leader of iu 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.209
 of the Roadrunner Foundation 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.489
 clarification that gives us the confidence 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.800
 enough to continue participating with 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.050
 pride in such an important event that 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.570
 relieves the image of Bogota before the world 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.640
 because the media have not 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.920
 spread this news 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.440
 we invite you to read carefully the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.890
 document of the comptroller whose link 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.290
 we also attach is extensive are 36 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.880
 pages but it is important that you 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.880
 be duly informed
