everything<00:00:17.730> piff<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.180> was<00:00:18.300> actually<00:00:19.189> almost<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
everything piff it was actually almost a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
year ago completely and I think this has

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.839 
year ago completely and I think this has
a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> lot<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.689> answers<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.849> questions

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
a lot of lot of answers to questions

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.210 
a lot of lot of answers to questions
that<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.420> had<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.019> zombies<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.010> could

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that we have had for zombies this could

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.220 
that we have had for zombies this could
be<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> answer<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:29.970> why<00:00:30.420> everything<00:00:31.019> doesn't

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
be the answer to why everything doesn't

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
be the answer to why everything doesn't
make<00:00:31.470> sense<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.160> are<00:00:32.309> zombies<00:00:32.730> fan
