 we win crown exercise room bar 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.350
 grosseto perra 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.540
 grasshopper is the eurocar translation because our students will do me 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.440
 to see 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.760
 as always luster have the ingredients and then run peacereporter - 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.269
 professor in new orleans and in the 50s at least what was said was invented 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.409
 a new orleans in the 50s and for a decade been one of the most cocktails 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.149
 drunk 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.579
 in the united states then from the united states arrived in europe well a cocktail 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.109
 also very suitable for example for women because it hunts the flavors 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.229
 sweet cienma gare while I could choose 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.510
 nicolÃ² so we explain to you ingredients are simple are 3 that 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.350
 suits in which proportions because they are two centimeters of milk cream and 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.250
 fresh 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.009
 here then we approach the workbench 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.460
 this is milk cream and it takes two centilitres and then 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.420
 photo two inches of green mint cream than a liqueur 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.789
 and 200 liters of light cocoa cream is another liqueur 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.140
 here is a very alcoholic, moderately alcoholic drink 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.840
 on average because unlike the others portal as always manhattan 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.749
 then the manhattan medium or the same martini I have vodkatini 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.320
 are cocktails is a cocktail + 6 with martini this instead very sweet 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.190
 because they are sweet liqueurs and from what could be deceiving because being sweet 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.120
 it tends to deceive taste and so maybe I had two of these 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.560
 because using - alcohol is not really so average alcoholic pupae 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.039
 it's fine even at all hours after meal 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:26.769
 youcat because it was presented by a famous toray grandmother 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.730
 an equally famous film at xeronina with robert de niro a film at the end 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.830
 90's . de 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.110
 explain the interrogations to me 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.220
 he didn't read them because they always prepared this cocktail he was forced to 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.330
 to really speak a parody also of the ring that loved the talking cricket 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.959
 the talking cricket 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.689
 eg we have learned e 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.980
 i am our strength and kate morton center 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.519
 then we put some cream to start with 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.690
 let's repeat the cream dance 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.290
 2 cl gray man 2 milk cream cells we added this liqueur 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.149
 with mint in what quantity always two centimeters two centimeters of payment 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.399
 Now let's proceed with our talented woman 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:15.669
 and with the z 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.499
 micro 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.909
 hyenas 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:20.899
 then 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 we eliminate excess water 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.909
 and let us go against it 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.889
 and this is the memento dilemma for ascertaining 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.399
 how you do it 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.939
 if this movement 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.230
 lets live it is used above all for cocktails with ingredients 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:41.240
 very dense 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.409
 so that I am 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.620
 hardly amalgamates a thousand and then oh well then in the first use leaves 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.309
 that continental is much simpler than already complex words 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:52.950
 stendo of third must be 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.889
 prepared for the worst we say so the blanket is always the classic 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.949
 cocktail glass that is not the original attention martini cup placed 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.089
 original martini 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:04.139
 he was Lombard 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.879
 today caracol kaita wines, however, if we want to get into details 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.210
 perfect portal because these are the measures 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.029
 but excuse me if 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:16.709
 we can all say that you don't complain to the barman s 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.090
 we come buy it as if we see better 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.219
 if we arrive 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.379
 this is the right dose maybe even a little less but not the right dose this 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.430
 you never get to serve up to the top 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.100
 very well so we have to stay let's say a finger below the 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.500
 They will give our glass our electron staff - taste insurance 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.450
 absolute 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.570
 exquisite a heady flavor of mint that 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.409
 you have to take and then cheers for everyone with this 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.009
