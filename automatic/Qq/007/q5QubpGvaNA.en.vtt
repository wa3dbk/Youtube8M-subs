measurements<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.300> our<00:00:10.110> suit<00:00:11.010> jackets<00:00:11.490> and

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
measurements of our suit jackets and

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.330 
measurements of our suit jackets and
blazers<00:00:11.820> are<00:00:12.330> taken<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.960> way<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:14.099> can

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
blazers are taken this way you can

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.540 
blazers are taken this way you can
measure<00:00:14.549> your<00:00:15.540> items<00:00:15.990> at<00:00:16.139> home<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.619> compare

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
measure your items at home and compare

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.630 
measure your items at home and compare
them<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.150> ours<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:19.199> believe<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
them to ours I believe that this is the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.029 
them to ours I believe that this is the
best<00:00:20.970> way<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.570> determine<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> size<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
best way to determine the size and

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.370 
best way to determine the size and
whether<00:00:23.730> or<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.390> item<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:24.840> thing<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
whether or not the item will thing and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.160 
whether or not the item will thing and
best<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:26.340> everything<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.539> sell<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
best of all everything that we sell is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.939 
best of all everything that we sell is
measured<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> same<00:00:28.920> way<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:30.529> we're<00:00:31.529> trying<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
measured the same way so we're trying to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.840 
measured the same way so we're trying to
establish<00:00:32.360> some<00:00:33.360> consistency<00:00:34.520> I'm<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
establish some consistency I'm going to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
establish some consistency I'm going to
start<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.239> taking<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> couple<00:00:36.780> measurements

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
start with taking a couple measurements

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.830 
start with taking a couple measurements
while<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.710> hanging<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:39.239> measurements<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
while it's hanging up the measurements I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.810 
while it's hanging up the measurements I
take<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.320> paying<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> length

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
take when it's paying up are the length

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
take when it's paying up are the length
of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> jacket<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.710> length<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
of the jacket and the length of the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.610 
of the jacket and the length of the
jacket<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.789> taken<00:00:45.600> from<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> bottom<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.469> the

your body so holding it straight again I
get<00:02:50.459> 20<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> quarter<00:02:55.670> I'd<00:02:56.670> also<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:57.180> to

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
measurement if I stretch the fabric it

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.179 
measurement if I stretch the fabric it
goes<00:05:58.699> to<00:05:58.849> 23<00:05:59.389> and<00:05:59.539> a<00:05:59.569> half<00:05:59.750> but<00:06:00.169> just<00:06:00.830> holding
