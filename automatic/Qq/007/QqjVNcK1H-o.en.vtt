let's<00:00:53.520> take<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:55.250> which<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
let's take this off which I think the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.729 
let's take this off which I think the
people<00:00:56.699> at<00:00:56.789> Gamestop<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.469> idiots<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.559> don't

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
people at Gamestop are idiots and don't

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.139 
people at Gamestop are idiots and don't
know<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:58.920> they're<00:00:59.010> talking<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.730> they

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
know what they're talking about but they

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.250 
know what they're talking about but they
gave<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.570> supposed<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
gave me this supposed to be for the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100 
gave me this supposed to be for the
shotgun<00:01:02.180> our<00:01:03.180> argue<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.899> tell<00:01:04.019> them

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
shotgun our argue with them is tell them

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.420 
shotgun our argue with them is tell them
that<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.379> probably<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.010> pre-order

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that this is probably not the pre-order

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
that this is probably not the pre-order
code<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> shotgun<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.960> probably

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
code for the shotgun this is probably

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.410 
code for the shotgun this is probably
just<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.500> paper<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.950> stuck<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
just a paper they stuck on to it that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.910 
just a paper they stuck on to it that
tells<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.780> pre-order<00:01:10.170> now<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
tells you pre-order now and get the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.200 
tells you pre-order now and get the
in-game<00:01:11.250> shotgun<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:13.020> doesn't<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.409> any

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
in-game shotgun this doesn't have any

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.410 
in-game shotgun this doesn't have any
code<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.420> whatsoever

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
code on it whatsoever

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
code on it whatsoever
it<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.600> talks<00:01:18.750> about<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> game<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it just talks about the game so this

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.440 
it just talks about the game so this
person<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.640> stuck<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> they

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
person they just stuck on to it they

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.190 
person they just stuck on to it they
don't<00:01:21.600> even<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:21.869> they're<00:01:21.960> talking

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
don't even know what they're talking

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.580 
don't even know what they're talking
about

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
about

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.899 
about
I<00:01:22.619> probably<00:01:22.979> ought<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.280> back<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> store

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I probably ought to go back to the store

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.200 
I probably ought to go back to the store
and<00:01:26.600> pick<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.939> actual<00:01:30.920> code<00:01:31.920> itself<00:01:32.310> but

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and pick up the actual code itself but

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.460 
and pick up the actual code itself but
that's<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.509> box<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.350> guys

reviews they gave it a nine point three
which<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.210> found<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.689> be<00:02:05.780> really<00:02:06.310> good

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
which I found to be really good

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.469 
which I found to be really good
considering<00:02:07.700> that's<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.970> highest<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.330> think

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
considering that's the highest I think
