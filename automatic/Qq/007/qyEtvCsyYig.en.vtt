00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
would be disappointed if the chase

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.859 
would be disappointed if the chase
hadn't<00:01:52.009> ended<00:01:52.159> at<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:52.430> point<00:01:52.820> but<00:01:53.600> there<00:01:53.780> we

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
hadn't ended at that point but there we

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
he's an AI man I'm just human is the way

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.260 
he's an AI man I'm just human is the way
because<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.490> way<00:01:58.579> you<00:01:58.640> played<00:01:58.909> this<00:01:59.060> game

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
because of the way you played this game

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.300 
because of the way you played this game
yeah<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:00.590> very<00:02:00.799> very<00:02:00.890> first

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
yeah so this is the very very first

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.399 
yeah so this is the very very first
thing<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.670> do<00:02:01.820> as<00:02:01.939> a<00:02:01.969> cop<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:02.780> similar<00:02:03.109> to<00:02:03.140> the

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
thing you do as a cop but similar to the

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.639 
thing you do as a cop but similar to the
one<00:02:03.799> of<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.979> things<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.340> criterion<00:02:04.939> kind<00:02:05.119> of

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
one of the things that criterion kind of

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.789 
one of the things that criterion kind of
leaves

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
leaves

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.859 
leaves
I<00:02:06.890> stayed<00:02:07.310> very<00:02:07.340> well<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.909> burnout<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.690> then

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
I stayed very well in burnout and then

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.260 
I stayed very well in burnout and then
brought<00:02:09.020> in

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
brought in

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.990 
brought in
-<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.530> need<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:10.560> speed<00:02:10.860> games<00:02:11.130> even<00:02:11.790> though

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
- the need for speed games even though

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.480 
- the need for speed games even though
this<00:02:12.090> isn't<00:02:12.270> protein<00:02:12.690> game<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.130> kind<00:02:14.400> of

so you know just judged constant yeah
you'll<00:02:32.070> be<00:02:32.100> driving<00:02:32.520> down<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.730> road<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.270> you'll

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
you'll be driving down a road and you'll

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.300 
you'll be driving down a road and you'll
drive<00:02:33.720> past<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.080> speed<00:02:34.350> camera<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.190> most

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
drive past a speed camera like and most

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.710 
drive past a speed camera like and most
wanted<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.850> will<00:02:36.000> track<00:02:36.210> how<00:02:36.330> fast<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
wanted in it will track how fast you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.090 
wanted in it will track how fast you
were<00:02:36.810> going<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.170> it'll<00:02:37.380> compare<00:02:37.680> your<00:02:37.860> speed

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
were going and it'll compare your speed

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.040 
were going and it'll compare your speed
so<00:02:38.310> were<00:02:38.430> your<00:02:38.520> friends<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.570> start<00:02:39.990> a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
so were your friends so you can start a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.420 
so were your friends so you can start a
race<00:02:40.230> by<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:40.620> hitting<00:02:40.740> someone<00:02:41.160> or<00:02:41.280> just

race by just hitting someone or just
going<00:02:41.670> near<00:02:41.880> them<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.330> then<00:02:42.390> they<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.870> it

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
going near them and then they can it

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.630 
going near them and then they can it
yeah<00:02:43.230> because<00:02:43.500> presumably<00:02:43.770> they<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.280> say<00:02:44.400> no

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
yeah because presumably they can say no

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
story because the story would just be an

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.480 
story because the story would just be an
engine<00:03:03.210> going<00:03:04.130> ten<00:03:05.130> hour

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
engine going ten hour

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.760 
engine going ten hour
but<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:06.360> else<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.720> there<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.080> do<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.530> I

good timing and there are you know like
I<00:03:13.890> mentioned<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.220> speed<00:03:14.430> cameras<00:03:14.940> there's

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.199 
I mentioned the speed cameras there's
definitely<00:03:15.480> no<00:03:15.600> see

again
of<00:05:45.570> armineh<00:05:45.960> ratio<00:05:46.200> again<00:05:46.410> there<00:05:46.650> resets<00:05:47.040> no

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
race will always be different because

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.130 
race will always be different because
you'd<00:05:50.970> be<00:05:51.090> in<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.210> different<00:05:51.420> stretch<00:05:51.810> of<00:05:51.960> road

a<00:05:55.290> bit<00:05:55.530> better<00:05:56.010> now<00:05:56.340> I<00:05:56.370> wonder<00:05:56.550> if<00:05:56.670> you'd<00:05:56.790> see

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
when we get ahead of it I've got 50,000

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.500 
when we get ahead of it I've got 50,000
speed<00:05:59.370> points<00:05:59.550> now<00:05:59.820> so<00:06:00.000> I'm<00:06:00.090> getting<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.390> hang

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
speed points now so I'm getting the hang

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.450 
speed points now so I'm getting the hang
of<00:06:00.630> it<00:06:00.780> so<00:06:01.050> this<00:06:01.200> is<00:06:01.350> a<00:06:01.380> bit<00:06:01.620> more<00:06:01.800> an<00:06:01.920> exciting
