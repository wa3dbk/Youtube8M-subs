I<00:00:57.559> particularly<00:00:58.559> care<00:00:58.769> for<00:00:58.799> weighted

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I particularly care for weighted

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.390 
I particularly care for weighted
pressure<00:00:59.489> plates<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.119> this<00:01:00.750> configuration

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
pressure plates in this configuration

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.880 
pressure plates in this configuration
but<00:01:02.400> you<00:01:02.549> can<00:01:02.699> easily<00:01:03.150> use<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> slabs<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:04.710> one

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
but you can easily use the slabs the one

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.649 
but you can easily use the slabs the one
advantage<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> slabs<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
advantage about the slabs is that you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.690 
advantage about the slabs is that you
can<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:07.049> tilt<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.950> toward<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> inner

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
can actually tilt them toward the inner

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
can actually tilt them toward the inner
sides<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> door<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> outer<00:01:10.290> sides<00:01:10.619> of

sides of the door or the outer sides of

sides of the door or the outer sides of
the<00:01:10.890> door<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.549> create<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> handle<00:01:12.119> effect<00:01:12.600> the

the door to create a handle effect the
next<00:01:13.860> model<00:01:14.039> is<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> variation<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:15.060> typical
