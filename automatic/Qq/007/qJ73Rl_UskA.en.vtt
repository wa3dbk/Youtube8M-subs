00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.160 

and<00:02:29.319> then<00:02:29.620> if<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.129> work<00:02:30.730> if<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.330> if<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.959> work

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170

and then if you work if it's if you work
the<00:02:32.530> following<00:02:33.519> row<00:02:33.970> as<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.300> knit<00:02:34.900> row<00:02:35.010> then<00:02:36.010> it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the following row as a knit row then it

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.839 
the following row as a knit row then it
will<00:02:36.610> give<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.819> nice<00:02:37.180> edge<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:41.080> where

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
will give a nice edge like this so where

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.300 
will give a nice edge like this so where
this<00:02:42.849> is<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.060> side<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.310> original

this is the side of the the original

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.890 
this is the side of the the original
fabric<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.180> where<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:46.599> picked<00:02:46.810> up

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
finished edge doing something like a

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.830 
finished edge doing something like a
button<00:03:58.959> band<00:03:59.290> picking<00:03:59.919> up<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.099> button<00:04:00.370> band<00:04:00.840> it

button band picking up a button band it
can<00:04:02.260> be<00:04:02.410> really<00:04:03.000> important<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.239> pick<00:04:04.450> up

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
can be really important that you pick up

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.659 
can be really important that you pick up
stitches<00:04:05.260> at<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.590> proper<00:04:05.980> rate<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:08.669> sometimes

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
stitches at the proper rate so sometimes

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.940 
stitches at the proper rate so sometimes
you<00:04:10.000> need<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.239> pick<00:04:10.359> up<00:04:10.419> like<00:04:10.780> three<00:04:11.410> stitches

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
you need to pick up like three stitches

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.050 
you need to pick up like three stitches
for<00:04:12.130> every<00:04:12.310> four<00:04:12.579> rows<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.810> as<00:04:14.139> you<00:04:14.590> look<00:04:14.880> if<00:04:15.880> we

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
for every four rows so as you look if we

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.210 
for every four rows so as you look if we
spread<00:04:16.359> apart<00:04:16.690> this<00:04:16.959> edge<00:04:17.200> stitch<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:18.039> can

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
spread apart this edge stitch you can

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.000 
spread apart this edge stitch you can
see<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.669> there's<00:04:19.139> there's<00:04:20.139> like<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.709> whole

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
see that there's there's like a whole

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.370 
see that there's there's like a whole
little<00:04:21.370> ladder<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.690> if<00:04:22.750> we<00:04:22.840> turn<00:04:23.020> swatch<00:04:23.349> right

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
little ladder so if we turn swatch right

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.159 
little ladder so if we turn swatch right
side<00:04:23.710> up<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.070> we<00:04:24.880> spread<00:04:25.300> this<00:04:25.450> out<00:04:25.660> pull<00:04:26.050> the

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
side up and we spread this out pull the

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.839 
side up and we spread this out pull the
edge<00:04:26.289> stitch<00:04:26.620> out<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.039> can<00:04:27.220> see<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.669> there's

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
edge stitch out you can see that there's

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:34.379 
edge stitch out you can see that there's
a<00:04:27.940> whole<00:04:28.410> ladder<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.800> stitches<00:04:30.280> between<00:04:33.389> so

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
a whole ladder of stitches between so

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.360 
a whole ladder of stitches between so

use the crochet hook it's a little more

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.730 
use the crochet hook it's a little more
fiddly<00:04:49.510> at<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.810> beginning<00:04:50.170> but<00:04:50.410> it<00:04:50.560> works

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
fiddly at the beginning but it works

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.950 
fiddly at the beginning but it works
really<00:04:50.830> well<00:04:51.100> so<00:04:51.480> used<00:04:52.480> to<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.630> crochet<00:04:52.840> hook

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
stick it through the next ladder hole

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.490

pull<00:04:57.400> up<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.640> stitch<00:04:59.160> and<00:05:00.810> slip<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:02.140> with

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
pull up a stitch and slip it with

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.240

correct<00:05:03.040> orientation<00:05:03.220> on<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.900> needle<00:05:05.250> so

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
correct orientation on to the needle so

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.980 
correct orientation on to the needle so
then<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.640> do<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:06.910> next<00:05:06.940> one<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:10.630> yarn<00:05:10.960> is

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
then I do the next one this yarn is

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.560 
then I do the next one this yarn is
really<00:05:11.230> grippy<00:05:11.610> okay<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:12.670> that's<00:05:12.940> three<00:05:13.240> and

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
really grippy okay so that's three and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.870 
really grippy okay so that's three and
then<00:05:14.170> if<00:05:14.290> you're<00:05:14.410> doing<00:05:14.620> picking<00:05:15.340> picking<00:05:15.670> up

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
then if you're doing picking picking up

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.340 
then if you're doing picking picking up
stitches<00:05:16.030> at<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.300> rate<00:05:16.480> of<00:05:16.630> every<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.230> know

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
stitches at the rate of every you know

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.320 
stitches at the rate of every you know
three<00:05:17.590> stitches<00:05:17.830> every<00:05:18.220> four<00:05:18.460> rows<00:05:18.730> then<00:05:19.180> you

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
three stitches every four rows then you

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.920 
three stitches every four rows then you
would<00:05:19.480> skip<00:05:19.810> this<00:05:20.020> next<00:05:20.320> hole<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:21.660> go<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.720> the

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
would skip this next hole and go to the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.800 
would skip this next hole and go to the
one<00:05:23.080> after<00:05:23.320> and<00:05:24.240> pick<00:05:25.240> up<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.570> stitch<00:05:27.630> put<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.720> on

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
one after and pick up a stitch put it on

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.620 
one after and pick up a stitch put it on
your<00:05:28.960> needle<00:05:31.650> it's<00:05:32.650> two<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.520> then<00:05:34.120> we'll<00:05:34.240> do<00:05:34.390> a

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
your needle it's two and then we'll do a

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:52.040 
your needle it's two and then we'll do a
third<00:05:35.440> one<00:05:38.730> before<00:05:39.730> we<00:05:40.180> skip<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.720> next<00:05:40.870> one

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.290 

so<00:05:52.710> what<00:05:52.949> it<00:05:53.039> does<00:05:53.190> is<00:05:53.340> it<00:05:53.460> pushes<00:05:53.699> this<00:05:54.060> edge

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
so what it does is it pushes this edge

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.670 
so what it does is it pushes this edge
stitch<00:05:54.740> to<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:55.860> back<00:05:57.110> which<00:05:58.110> makes<00:05:58.349> a<00:05:58.470> nice

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
stitch to the back which makes a nice

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.610 
stitch to the back which makes a nice
clean<00:05:59.340> line<00:05:59.669> on<00:05:59.729> the<00:06:00.000> front<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.539> when<00:06:01.500> you

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
clean line on the front and when you

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.159 
clean line on the front and when you
work<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.979> button<00:06:02.250> band<00:06:02.460> from<00:06:02.759> there<00:06:03.030> you<00:06:03.990> get

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
work the button band from there you get

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:17.450 
work the button band from there you get
a<00:06:04.409> really<00:06:05.039> nice<00:06:05.340> joint<00:06:06.240> between<00:06:06.659> the<00:06:06.870> two

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.520 

you
