00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.910
 we will learn how to use plastic 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.959
 crazy also called crazy plastic so 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.309
 in fact it's just small 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.609
 plastic sheets draw you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.379
 above 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.460
 then you cook them and that 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.320
 becomes small plastic objects 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.669
 all hard so you can do it 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.599
 absolutely what you want 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.730
 today me I'm going to make myself a 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.130
 little keychain so you take your 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.550
 leaf a support it will take you 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.140
 to write a color and that's all so 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 you can notice that on your 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.280
 leaf there is a phase that shines and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 a matt face so we will be doing 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.800
 was drawn on the side matt not the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.800
 shiny side 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.010
 as I told you what I'm going 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.690
 to do it is a little keychain so I 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 am going to draw forbidden this game puts you 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.340
 the photo for those who do not know 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.310
 this is the series doctor who 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.110
 so a little cleft keychain key so 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.730
 it's gone the drawing you can 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.610
 do so as I told you to create 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.589
 a color or felt indelible 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.150
 here we go away from these two 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.150
 things there otherwise it will not work 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 or of course the pencil lines at 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.360
 paper at the start are totally there 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.920
 do not worry about a goal anyway 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.580
 you will go back over there after 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.580
 no worries 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.460
 so you are surely in the process of 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.960
 to say that my drawing is still very 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.329
 very big for just a little 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.700
 keychains the first thing to know 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.939
 with the crazy plastic is that it 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.359
 shrinks by at least 70% during the 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.700
 baking 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.950
 so you're going to need a super design 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.719
 super big if you want a little 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.340
 Keychain so it's a bit of a pity 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.079
 because suddenly used a lot of 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.079
 paper but it's really worth it 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.459
 I decided to use some of the 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.799
 two to do a little bit more 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:57.450
 color differences but the 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.450
 markers it works very very well 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 years 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.800
 but 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.870
 so from time to time I use a 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.580
 black felt to make the contours of 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.270
 my drawing will be much better 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.270
 after cooking 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.580
 more than one thing to know too this is 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.830
 do not forget to do his drawing at 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.240
 backwards since the brilliant phase will be 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.430
 the prettiest after cooking 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.100
 so be sure do not forget to 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.560
 to make your drawing upside down is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.270
 the same here I write something if you 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.890
 want to write something remember 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.890
 not have to write it upside down 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.650
 you 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.360
 this is this phase iib commettra 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.780
 face us once cooking at 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.730
 finished so then do not forget to 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.560
 make the hole to slip the key ring 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.000
 so I'm using a small tool for 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.290
 scrapbooking you can also 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.290
 use a small performance 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.040
 then you cut out your little drawing 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.410
 and you put it in the oven for five 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.780
 minutes at thermostat 175 so during the 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.550
 baking your plastic will take some 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.710
 forms a little weird and crooked 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.090
 it's totally normal for example the 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.310
 little white that is basically it is supposed 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.020
 to be raw is totally flat so there he 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.090
 is completely chubby it's 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.070
 normal once cooking is 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.350
 finished you go out your objects and you 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.810
 the flattened so that it is flat and 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.220
 this is finished 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.050
 you have your little things to climb in 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.040
 key ring in stern necklace 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.040
 as you please
