real time sticky traps think of a

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.110 
real time sticky traps think of a
landmine<00:02:40.530> system<00:02:41.099> where<00:02:41.370> you're<00:02:41.549> dropping

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
drop the stickies where they are running

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.399 
drop the stickies where they are running
kind<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> breadcrumb<00:02:59.970> trail<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:01.049> you

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
kind of like a breadcrumb trail to you

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.470 
kind of like a breadcrumb trail to you
so<00:03:01.980> pretend<00:03:02.310> you're<00:03:02.370> Hansel<00:03:02.879> and<00:03:03.030> Gretel<00:03:03.359> and

so pretend you're Hansel and Gretel and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.599 
so pretend you're Hansel and Gretel and
the<00:03:04.140> person<00:03:04.409> chasing<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.099> witch<00:03:05.430> and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
you're dropping these stickies down so

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.170 
you're dropping these stickies down so
when<00:03:07.409> they<00:03:07.500> walk<00:03:07.709> over<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.099> trail<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:09.150> can

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
when they walk over the trail you can

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.270 
when they walk over the trail you can
detonate<00:03:09.629> it<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.590> might<00:03:10.769> not<00:03:10.920> kill<00:03:11.129> them

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
detonate it and it might not kill them

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.830 
detonate it and it might not kill them
for<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.430> first<00:03:11.670> sticky<00:03:11.970> or<00:03:12.120> even<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.420> second

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
for the first sticky or even the second

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.809 
for the first sticky or even the second
sticky<00:03:13.200> but<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.739> lot<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:13.980> times<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.430> only<00:03:14.549> takes

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
sticky but a lot of times it only takes

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.670 
sticky but a lot of times it only takes
two<00:03:15.090> or<00:03:15.120> three<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:16.140> for<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.409> most<00:03:16.560> part

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
two or three and but for the most part

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.710 
two or three and but for the most part
people<00:03:16.950> will<00:03:17.159> still<00:03:17.430> chase<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.910> so

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
people will still chase you so

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.839 
people will still chase you so
definitely<00:03:19.260> check<00:03:19.349> out<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.950> breadcrumb

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
definitely check out the breadcrumb

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.360 
definitely check out the breadcrumb
trail<00:03:20.880> in<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.930> quotes<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.739> guess<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.160> could<00:03:23.280> be

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
trail in in quotes I guess that could be

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.000 
trail in in quotes I guess that could be
what<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.609> what<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.819> is<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.530> second

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
what of what it is but the second

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.710 
what of what it is but the second
technique<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.489> want<00:03:26.639> to<00:03:26.700> talk<00:03:26.849> about<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.239> one

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
technique I want to talk about is one

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.030 
technique I want to talk about is one
that<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> lot<00:03:28.049> of<00:03:28.079> people<00:03:28.319> do<00:03:28.410> anyways<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:28.980> I

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
that a lot of people do anyways but I

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.229 
that a lot of people do anyways but I
want<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.310> cover<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.609> just<00:03:29.790> because<00:03:30.060> some

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
want to cover it just because some

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.030 
want to cover it just because some
people<00:03:30.480> still<00:03:30.720> don't<00:03:30.900> do<00:03:31.109> it<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.379> is<00:03:31.889> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
people still don't do it it is the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.610 
people still don't do it it is the
blind-fire<00:03:32.669> technique<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.410> where

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
blind-fire technique and that is where

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.379 
blind-fire technique and that is where
if<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.799> know<00:03:35.340> there<00:03:35.669> are<00:03:35.760> people<00:03:35.879> around<00:03:36.269> a

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
if you know there are people around a

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.809 
if you know there are people around a
corner<00:03:36.629> don't<00:03:37.500> try<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:37.859> make<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.069> trap<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
corner don't try and make a trap on the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.309 
corner don't try and make a trap on the
right<00:03:39.060> side<00:03:39.359> or<00:03:39.629> wait<00:03:39.810> for<00:03:39.840> them<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.109> come

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
right side or wait for them to come

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.550 
right side or wait for them to come
around<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:41.370> shoot<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.879> a<00:03:41.970> space<00:03:42.389> across<00:03:43.169> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
around just shoot in a space across the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.619 
around just shoot in a space across the
corner<00:03:43.889> or<00:03:44.040> around<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.639> corner<00:03:44.970> where<00:03:45.480> you

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
corner or around the corner where you

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.000 
corner or around the corner where you
know<00:03:45.870> people<00:03:46.199> are<00:03:46.319> going<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.530> be<00:03:46.650> because

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
know people are going to be because

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.920 
know people are going to be because
think<00:03:47.280> about<00:03:47.459> every<00:03:47.970> single<00:03:48.150> choke<00:03:48.569> point<00:03:48.810> in

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
think about every single choke point in

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.229 
think about every single choke point in
team<00:03:49.139> fortress<00:03:49.500> there's<00:03:50.370> always<00:03:50.730> going<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.090> be

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
team fortress there's always going to be

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.509 
team fortress there's always going to be
a<00:03:51.269> ton<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.750> people<00:03:52.079> around<00:03:52.680> certain<00:03:53.010> corners

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
a ton of people around certain corners

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.849 
a ton of people around certain corners
especially<00:03:54.480> on<00:03:54.629> payload<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.230> especially<00:03:55.560> on

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
especially on payload and especially on

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.890 
especially on payload and especially on
control<00:03:56.370> point<00:03:56.639> so<00:03:57.329> once<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.660> get<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
control point so once you get the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.780 
control point so once you get the
knowledge<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.410> maps<00:03:58.709> definitely<00:03:59.579> use

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
knowledge of the maps definitely use

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.699 
knowledge of the maps definitely use
this<00:03:59.970> blind-fire<00:04:00.419> technique<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.230> that

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
this blind-fire technique and that

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.710 
this blind-fire technique and that
follows<00:04:02.190> up<00:04:02.400> with<00:04:02.430> another<00:04:03.060> technique<00:04:03.569> and

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
follows up with another technique and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.180 
follows up with another technique and
it's<00:04:03.840> not<00:04:03.959> even<00:04:04.079> really<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:04.349> technique<00:04:04.739> but

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
it's not even really a technique but

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.259 
it's not even really a technique but
still<00:04:05.430> there<00:04:05.579> are<00:04:05.609> people<00:04:05.849> that<00:04:05.910> don't<00:04:06.180> have

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
still there are people that don't have

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.699 
still there are people that don't have
this<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.900> was<00:04:07.079> one<00:04:07.199> of<00:04:07.230> those<00:04:07.379> people<00:04:07.590> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
this and I was one of those people that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.129 
this and I was one of those people that
originally<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.579> did<00:04:09.090> not<00:04:09.239> have<00:04:09.449> this<00:04:09.599> enabled

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
originally I did not have this enabled

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.000 
originally I did not have this enabled
turn<00:04:10.919> on<00:04:11.280> hit<00:04:12.209> sounds<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:13.260> go<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.470> Advanced

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
turn on hit sounds you go to Advanced

how<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.540> turn<00:04:15.720> on<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.019> numbers<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> damage

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
how to turn on the numbers the damage

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.430 
how to turn on the numbers the damage
numbers<00:04:17.039> so<00:04:17.699> go<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:17.970> Advanced<00:04:18.510> Options<00:04:18.599> turn

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.170 
numbers so go to Advanced Options turn
on<00:04:19.620> play<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.949> sound<00:04:20.280> when<00:04:20.549> an<00:04:20.639> enemy<00:04:20.760> has<00:04:21.000> said

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
on play a sound when an enemy has said

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.149 
on play a sound when an enemy has said
it's<00:04:21.329> something<00:04:21.510> like<00:04:21.719> that<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.740> damage

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
it's something like that and the damage

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.580 
it's something like that and the damage
numbers<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:23.640> text<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.539> want<00:04:24.900> both<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.440> those

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
numbers as text you want both of those

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.500 
numbers as text you want both of those
especially<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.729> first<00:04:27.120> one

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
especially the first one

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.330 
especially the first one
because<00:04:28.080> what<00:04:28.260> this<00:04:28.410> allows<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.860> do<00:04:29.100> is

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
because what this allows you to do is

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.820 
because what this allows you to do is
blind<00:04:29.820> fire<00:04:30.090> around<00:04:30.480> corners<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.110> get<00:04:31.710> the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
blind fire around corners and get the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.350 
blind fire around corners and get the
ding<00:04:32.070> sound<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.550> know<00:04:32.640> okay<00:04:32.970> there's<00:04:33.150> people

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
ding sound and know okay there's people

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.820 
ding sound and know okay there's people
there<00:04:33.630> let<00:04:33.840> me<00:04:33.900> shoot<00:04:34.050> more<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.410> kill<00:04:34.620> four

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
there let me shoot more and kill four

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.460 
there let me shoot more and kill four
people<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.670> it<00:04:36.120> did<00:04:36.240> take<00:04:36.450> me<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.600> long<00:04:36.870> time<00:04:36.900> to

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
people and it did take me a long time to

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.960 
people and it did take me a long time to
turn<00:04:37.620> those<00:04:37.860> on<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.400> really<00:04:38.730> don't<00:04:38.880> know

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
turn those on and I really don't know

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.700 
turn those on and I really don't know
why<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.180> think<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.600> just<00:04:39.780> didn't<00:04:40.110> like<00:04:40.230> change

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
why I think I just didn't like change

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.120 
why I think I just didn't like change
but<00:04:42.020> this<00:04:43.020> is<00:04:43.140> going<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.320> wrap<00:04:43.470> up<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.770> video

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
but this is going to wrap up the video

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.370 
but this is going to wrap up the video
guys<00:04:44.460> thank<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.180> much<00:04:45.720> for<00:04:45.930> watching<00:04:46.290> I
