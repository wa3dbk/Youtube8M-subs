00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.089
 and then what we have heard 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.109
 that they have a new technician 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.949
 they have done 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.050
 three four parties 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.050
 I think they lost 3 and they won 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.619
 they hate it by trying to give a new shape to football 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.250
 hiring organizing I heard him speak to the president 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.100
 of the federation of the ins but logically 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.170
 this 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.980
 we are more concerned about us for our team to render 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.740
 all right 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.050
 and if the team performs well I think things will turn out well 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.370
 honduras world were very strong were not very strong 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.640
 p 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.480
 have a 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.570
 long 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.790
 work behind 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.790
 this one for at least three years after a year and a half 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.689
 it was a world cup has players playing in europe 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.810
 the action occurred when it was born 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 the players with international experience 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.680
 0 I repeat again 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.750
 was in the fourth game you have to play it we do not have all the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.870
 good will to be good things 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.720
 percent are showing the boys if he's stuck in 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.590
 in what is the selection 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.550
 it was us playing japan cup which is a much harder team more 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.920
 strong maybe 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.210
 from Honduras 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.710
 the ii symposium ties with 5 6 son who never 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.300
 I had played in the national team 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.940
 I had never traveled by plane 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.630
 And things went very well thanks 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.440
 now we go players with more experience of the earthquake a bit 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.840
 a mix of 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.320
 of the teams 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 who went to the united states and to japan 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.110
 and I think that little by little we will be getting closer 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 what we want
