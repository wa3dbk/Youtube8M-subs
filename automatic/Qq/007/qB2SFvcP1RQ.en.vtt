 Well here it is over 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.110
 This deck is of good quality 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 Other 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.460
 I would like to teach that there are various combinations of product locations 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.620
 To do is buy and sell Mr.

 I was able to fish 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.300
 I think it is better to increase this 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.810
 Increase this 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.810
 With this 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.760
 This is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.760

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.260
 The other creature When you put in effect say you battle zone have put into the battle zone this 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.370

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.720
 Excuse me 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:59.850
 When this creature or any other creature is put into the battle zone 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.729
 1 card draw then 1 card from my deck 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.400
 woman 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.479
 Place this card in the mana zone when you want to get rid of this card. 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.200
 Put at the bottom 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.200
 To say is 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.840
 Four 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.910
 Oh this guy 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.910
 The effect of the warrior pile is 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:36.420
 Mana Loss can be from 1 to 3 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.060
 You must send it to the graveyard after using manners in any of Annie 1 to 3. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.459
 Summon 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.459
 I have been following the accumulated 40,000 do 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.799
 I will pay 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.069
 You will be sent the card graveyard 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.069
 In began to something 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.460
 Mr. Up Snake 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.020
 Put out 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.640
 effect 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.630
 1 draw and 1 charge 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.980
 Around here around here is also strong stable this card 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.790
 I can not get enough of Miramis 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.690
 It is Mr. brother deck was by attack in the Snake 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.690
 This is also strong 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.580
 Oh dear 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.250
 Here Rahea rice but I think that it is better not to change because here is quite strong 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.930
 That's pretty strong 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.730
 Oh dear 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.730
 If you explain to stock 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.950
 with this 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.730
 In a row 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.930
 I think this is strong because you can cast a spell 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:47.430
 In the case of 2x 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.430
 This is a card that can be either 1 to brother or any card 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.890
 It looks stronger than the warrior army, but maybe the wheel pile is better 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.330
 At last 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.920
 As snake and the synergy bite 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.160
 Maybe this one 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.160
 I think it is better for me to do more samurai tremors 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:15.349
 Well there are super dimensions nowadays 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.349
 Super dimension seems to enter in this stage 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.859
 I think this deck is pretty strong 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:32.880
 Well reduce the super dimension Maha Heller is quite strong in the current environment for the time being 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.700
 If it is after sherlock 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.100
 I think it's good 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.950
 This is about 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:45.470
 Is the present environment interesting card? 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:50.060
 This has a gauntlet-like effect and when tacking this creature 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:57.850
 Each player turns the first card from the top of his deck face up 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:57.850
 If the card is different in cost for both spells, some children are more expensive 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.870
 The players who have to face up may be cast in not a cost Schaller 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.190
 Both cards you have for your friend 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:17.070
 If the creatures have different powers, the larger creatures of the par are 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:18.390
 It is good for players who made it for Table 9 to introduce to Cost City Ahara w Breaker 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.740
 This guy 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.830
 if 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.420
 I haven't got it here yet 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:30.120
 This is the card for Zenith. 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:33.020
 Well year was the card of Zenith 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.900
 Attack 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:41.969
 If Zenith is a partner creatures most likely a now N Tokoru flexible 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.659
 Ah par also win at a high 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.659
 Take out 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.000
 Ah 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.589
 And 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:54.589
 I'm sorry I've changed my voice I'm not coughing for a while 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.720
 Yes i'm ok 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.390
 I would like to introduce decole decolle 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.660
 What is Zenith? 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:11.080
 Pi was summoned in the pack and will release this time 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:17.020
 It will be effective when summoned and put out in the battle zone 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:21.210
 Its Cinque apprentice This is what is Nde activate this even this because 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.210
 This is also this but with this 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.810
 Zeni speed
