we've<00:00:11.320> got<00:00:11.559> basically<00:00:12.190> three<00:00:12.400> key<00:00:12.580> components

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
we've got basically three key components

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.759 
we've got basically three key components
that<00:00:13.179> make<00:00:13.330> up<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.869> weather<00:00:14.019> system<00:00:14.410> that<00:00:14.559> is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
that make up the weather system that is

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.439 
that make up the weather system that is
the<00:00:14.889> visual<00:00:15.070> effects<00:00:15.429> so<00:00:15.699> in<00:00:15.789> the<00:00:15.879> droids<00:00:16.119> the

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
weather system of that massive effect it

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.600 
weather system of that massive effect it
has<00:00:34.719> on<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.930> gameplay<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:35.920> just<00:00:36.100> changes<00:00:36.550> the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
has on the gameplay it just changes the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.459 
has on the gameplay it just changes the
attitude<00:00:37.120> of<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.270> car<00:00:37.539> completely<00:00:37.840> in<00:00:38.200> terms

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
attitude of the car completely in terms

attitude of the car completely in terms
of<00:00:38.559> driving<00:00:38.710> in<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.430> dryer<00:00:39.789> or<00:00:39.940> fully<00:00:40.420> wet<00:00:40.600> or

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
of driving in the dryer or fully wet or

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.540 
of driving in the dryer or fully wet or
partially<00:00:41.350> damn<00:00:41.530> track<00:00:41.860> so<00:00:42.160> it's<00:00:42.280> all<00:00:42.370> about

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
partially damn track so it's all about

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.889 
partially damn track so it's all about
the<00:00:42.730> sort<00:00:42.940> strategy<00:00:43.359> elements<00:00:43.659> are<00:00:43.780> those

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
the sort strategy elements are those

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.720 
the sort strategy elements are those
points<00:00:44.230> where<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.649> tracks<00:00:45.309> changing<00:00:45.640> from

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
points where the tracks changing from

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.209 
points where the tracks changing from
wet<00:00:45.909> to<00:00:45.940> dry<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.929> track<00:00:47.170> will<00:00:47.350> evolve<00:00:47.589> as<00:00:48.010> each

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
wet to dry the track will evolve as each

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.160 
wet to dry the track will evolve as each
car<00:00:48.579> individually<00:00:49.329> drives<00:00:49.600> on<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.929> surface

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
car individually drives on that surface

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.399 
car individually drives on that surface
and<00:00:50.739> yet<00:00:51.730> very<00:00:51.760> very<00:00:52.300> accurate<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:53.140> track

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
and yet very very accurate the track

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.469 
and yet very very accurate the track
surface<00:00:53.679> actually<00:00:54.159> knows<00:00:54.309> how<00:00:54.339> wet<00:00:54.699> is<00:00:54.879> you'll

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
surface actually knows how wet is you'll

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.000 
surface actually knows how wet is you'll
actually<00:00:55.600> find<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.289> game<00:00:56.469> is<00:00:56.649> on<00:00:56.769> wet

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
actually find that the game is on wet

actually find that the game is on wet
tires<00:00:57.249> on<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.640> drawing<00:00:57.850> track<00:00:58.149> will<00:00:58.359> try<00:00:58.510> and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569 
tires on the drawing track will try and

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:59.880 
tires on the drawing track will try and

they know by the radar where the weather
is<00:01:07.810> coming<00:01:08.080> in<00:01:08.320> from<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:08.770> how<00:01:08.890> long<00:01:09.040> it's

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
is coming in from and how long it's

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.010

going to last and that's something they

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.750 
going to last and that's something they
will<00:01:11.140> be<00:01:11.260> added<00:01:11.920> into<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.220> game<00:01:12.340> as<00:01:12.610> well

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
will be added into the game as well

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.940 
will be added into the game as well
you'll<00:01:13.360> be<00:01:13.510> aware<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.080> what<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.530> webos<00:01:14.800> of

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
you'll be aware of what the webos of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.770 
you'll be aware of what the webos of
doing<00:01:15.310> roughly<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.000> then<00:01:16.360> you<00:01:16.450> can<00:01:16.600> make<00:01:16.720> your

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
doing roughly and then you can make your

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.730 
doing roughly and then you can make your
court<00:01:17.140> just<00:01:17.410> like<00:01:17.440> you<00:01:17.650> win<00:01:17.800> in<00:01:17.890> real<00:01:18.010> life

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
court just like you win in real life

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.410 
court just like you win in real life
when<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.860> system<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.280> set<00:01:21.490> up<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.790> be<00:01:22.030> linear

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
when the system is set up to be linear

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.570 
when the system is set up to be linear
dynamic<00:01:22.840> or<00:01:23.080> career<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.800> changes<00:01:24.280> over<00:01:24.310> time

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
dynamic or career it changes over time

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.750 
dynamic or career it changes over time
so<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:26.110> go<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.290> spa<00:01:26.680> typically<00:01:27.520> very

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
so you go to spa typically very

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.280 
so you go to spa typically very
unpredictable<00:01:28.090> trunk<00:01:28.630> then<00:01:28.870> you<00:01:28.930> need<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.170> be

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
unpredictable trunk then you need to be

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.530 
unpredictable trunk then you need to be
prepared<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.740> author<00:01:30.430> your<00:01:30.670> car<00:01:30.910> balance<00:01:31.300> as

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
prepared to author your car balance as

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.440 
prepared to author your car balance as

the race between progresses so that when

you've<00:01:37.640> got<00:01:37.760> a<00:01:37.790> you've<00:01:38.120> got<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.300> car<00:01:38.510> set<00:01:38.720> up

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
you've got a you've got a car set up
