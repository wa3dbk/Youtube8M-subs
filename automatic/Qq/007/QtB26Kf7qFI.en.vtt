00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 and 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.820
 well I believe that the victory received 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.270
 to trust me more and after that 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.850
 it was seen that I learned a lot 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.340
 seeing in group and in head then I 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.730
 I think friend from that side has gone 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.400
 improving something very nice but I 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.430
 personally and the whole team what 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.980
 we had very present was how badly what 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.740
 took place in 2012 marked by the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.530
 injuries leave those 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.400
 and oysters get to the next year more 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.670
 strong on the other side there's no 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.110
 to make that victory was like me 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.690
 I want the reward for her about 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.490
 everything and for all the equipment that was followed 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.410
 believing in it in addition in particular it was 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.450
 a very nice race very fought in 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.890
 that nobody gave him a meter that level 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.300
 of self confidence for any 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.300
 elite athlete is very good 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.200
 at this time to see that it believed the 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.450
 more secure and to be more constant over 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.450
 the bike is more confident 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.439
 especially sometimes very thin and has 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.560
 A lot goes through the curve but it makes you very 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.509
 pretty very plastic is a pilot that 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.509
 like what you do on the track 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.570
 good as a person a 10 not very good 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.150
 person and above all very happy a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.650
 girl's letter 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.320
 we are seeing it grow here in the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.050
 team since 2011 at the same time 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.150
 that as a pilot as a person is worth and is 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.580
 a person who has loved a lot 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.619
 in the team that we have seen it 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.050
 us his growth as a pilot but 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.120
 also personal and now that we have 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.120
 all is a very close relationship 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.629
 here a year I think I hope to see me 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.790
 in the world and learn with colors 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.969
 mentos 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.659
 with marquez 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:33.069
 well behind it many years and we're going 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.109
 watching the steps they take every day 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.500
 learn more every day improvement over the 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:41.310
 motorcycle and every day grows as a pilot in the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.790
 world and winning 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.900
 of course it's not going to be there 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.670
 to be a comparsa that will surely have 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.069
 your process as for any pilot 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.520
 Rookie is clear but he will 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.520
 safe
