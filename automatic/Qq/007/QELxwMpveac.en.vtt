excited to do on this project were to

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.090 
excited to do on this project were to
take<00:01:05.480> these<00:01:05.690> pre-rendered<00:01:06.410> assets<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:06.950> get

them<00:01:07.250> into<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.490> real-time<00:01:07.850> environment<00:01:08.120> and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
them into the real-time environment and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.700 
them into the real-time environment and
it<00:01:08.540> allowed<00:01:08.720> us<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.900> tell<00:01:09.140> stories<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.680> way

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
we just haven't been able to do before

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.850 
we just haven't been able to do before
these<00:01:11.480> assets<00:01:11.840> are<00:01:11.960> extremely<00:01:12.440> large<00:01:12.650> and

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
these assets are extremely large and

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.920 
these assets are extremely large and
really<00:01:13.310> hard<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.610> deal<00:01:13.790> with<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.180> in<00:01:14.810> the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
really hard to deal with and in the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.120 
really hard to deal with and in the
real-time<00:01:15.260> environment<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:15.770> were<00:01:15.860> able<00:01:15.950> to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
real-time environment we were able to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.590 
real-time environment we were able to
create<00:01:16.280> these<00:01:16.430> cinematics<00:01:17.180> that<00:01:17.270> last<00:01:17.450> little

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
create these cinematics that last little

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.750 
create these cinematics that last little
much<00:01:18.080> longer<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.800> we<00:01:19.100> were<00:01:19.160> able<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.460> explore

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
much longer and we were able to explore

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.250 
much longer and we were able to explore
stories<00:01:20.360> from<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.660> different<00:01:20.930> angle<00:01:20.990> and

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
stories from a different angle and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.600 
stories from a different angle and
really<00:01:21.470> dig<00:01:21.680> out<00:01:21.890> these<00:01:22.190> situations<00:01:24.550> able<00:01:25.550> to

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
really dig out these situations able to

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.610 
really dig out these situations able to
take<00:01:25.730> these<00:01:25.910> super<00:01:26.660> high-res<00:01:27.050> maps<00:01:27.320> and

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
take these super high-res maps and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.380 
take these super high-res maps and
meshes<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.010> extract<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.790> information<00:01:28.850> and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
meshes and extract that information and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.340 
meshes and extract that information and
get<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.600> into<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.810> real-time<00:01:30.140> environment

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
get it into the real-time environment

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.780 
get it into the real-time environment
when<00:01:30.890> we<00:01:30.979> actually<00:01:31.100> started<00:01:31.490> seeing<00:01:31.700> this

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
when we actually started seeing this

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.610 
when we actually started seeing this
stuff<00:01:31.910> being<00:01:32.300> rendered<00:01:32.510> in<00:01:32.720> real<00:01:32.870> time<00:01:33.110> we

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
stuff being rendered in real time we

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.700 
stuff being rendered in real time we
were<00:01:33.770> super<00:01:34.310> excited<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.470> pretty<00:01:36.590> much

displacement work is Kerrigan we have

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.580 
displacement work is Kerrigan we have
the<00:03:05.100> concept<00:03:05.459> done<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:07.050> concept<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.530> be

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
the concept done and the concept can be

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.580 
the concept done and the concept can be
a<00:03:08.040> great<00:03:08.430> amount<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.790> detail<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.330> then<00:03:09.750> we<00:03:09.989> we

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
kind of exploring some ideas so we we

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.030 
kind of exploring some ideas so we we
came<00:03:33.900> up<00:03:33.930> with<00:03:34.170> something<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.650> director

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
came up with something that the director

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.550 
came up with something that the director
was<00:03:35.190> really<00:03:35.459> happy<00:03:35.670> with<00:03:35.940> another<00:03:36.560> concept

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
was really happy with another concept

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.229 
was really happy with another concept
artist<00:03:37.950> was<00:03:38.100> able<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.459> take<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.670> actual

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
artist was able to take that actual

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:49.580 
artist was able to take that actual
completely<00:03:39.570> different<00:03:39.870> level

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.339 

so<00:03:50.590> 3d<00:03:51.159> pre-production<00:03:51.870> or<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.989> previous

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
so 3d pre-production or the previous

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.770 
so 3d pre-production or the previous
process<00:03:53.560> is<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.370> basics<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:55.000> creating<00:03:55.540> the

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
process is the basics of creating the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.020 
process is the basics of creating the
film<00:03:56.140> for<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.440> first<00:03:56.620> time<00:03:56.739> in<00:03:56.950> 3d<00:03:57.250> one<00:03:57.879> of<00:03:57.970> the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
film for the first time in 3d one of the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.250 
film for the first time in 3d one of the
main<00:03:58.209> things<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.599> get<00:03:58.750> out<00:03:58.870> of<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.049> three

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
main things to get out of the three

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.399 
main things to get out of the three
pre-production<00:03:59.709> is<00:04:00.129> camera<00:04:01.090> space<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.659> how

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
pre-production is camera space and how

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.440 
pre-production is camera space and how
the<00:04:02.470> camera<00:04:02.890> tells<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.250> story<00:04:03.459> once<00:04:04.330> the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
the camera tells the story once the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.080 
the camera tells the story once the
basics<00:04:04.780> are<00:04:04.900> there<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.290> put<00:04:05.470> into<00:04:05.650> place<00:04:06.090> then

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
basics are there you put into place then

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.729 
basics are there you put into place then
we<00:04:07.269> start<00:04:07.510> assembling<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.080> scene<00:04:08.260> we<00:04:08.440> started

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
we start assembling the scene we started

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.140 
we start assembling the scene we started
laying<00:04:08.920> characters<00:04:09.459> in<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:09.849> making<00:04:10.000> a

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
laying characters in and making a

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.229 
laying characters in and making a
composition<00:04:10.660> out<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:12.549> basically<00:04:12.819> pose

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
composition out of it you basically pose

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.089 
composition out of it you basically pose
a<00:04:13.330> character<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:13.930> put<00:04:14.110> in<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.260> scene<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.650> the

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
a character you put in the scene and the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.379 
a character you put in the scene and the
composition<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.640> strong<00:04:15.819> then<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.120> can<00:04:16.269> move

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
composition is strong then you can move

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.000 
composition is strong then you can move
on<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.630> animating<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:17.229> do<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.620> general

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
on to animating and do a general

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.310 
on to animating and do a general
animation<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:18.970> getting<00:04:19.239> staging<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.169> main

actions<00:04:20.709> in<00:04:20.829> there<00:04:20.949> will<00:04:21.459> start<00:04:21.669> gathering

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
actions in there will start gathering

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.730 
actions in there will start gathering
reference<00:04:22.419> will<00:04:22.990> leave<00:04:23.110> in<00:04:23.229> grab<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.500> camera

animation that way film reference is

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.270 
animation that way film reference is
something<00:04:32.229> we<00:04:32.320> use<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.530> lot<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.889> helps<00:04:33.130> us

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
something we use a lot and it helps us

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.400 
something we use a lot and it helps us
get<00:04:34.060> through<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.300> lot<00:04:34.449> of<00:04:34.570> ideas<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:35.080> see<00:04:35.229> what

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
get through a lot of ideas and see what

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:48.120 
get through a lot of ideas and see what
looks<00:04:35.919> good<00:04:36.010> on<00:04:36.250> camera<00:04:36.430> what<00:04:36.729> does

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.770 

we<00:04:49.130> had<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.699> three<00:04:49.910> main<00:04:50.060> characters<00:04:50.210> Tyga

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
we had the three main characters Tyga

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.930 
we had the three main characters Tyga
strainer<00:04:51.199> and<00:04:51.470> carryin<00:04:51.979> all<00:04:52.160> in<00:04:52.699> the<00:04:52.789> same

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.110 
strainer and carryin all in the same
space<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.710> we<00:04:54.710> needed<00:04:54.949> to<00:04:55.100> show<00:04:55.310> an<00:04:55.639> emotional

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
space and we needed to show an emotional

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.939 
space and we needed to show an emotional
battle<00:04:56.270> between<00:04:56.539> all<00:04:56.840> three<00:04:56.990> of<00:04:57.050> them<00:04:57.259> we

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
battle between all three of them we

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.379 
battle between all three of them we
needed<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.250> show<00:04:58.430> Rainer's<00:04:58.819> longing<00:04:59.180> for

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
needed to show Rainer's longing for

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.839 
needed to show Rainer's longing for
carrion<00:04:59.690> over<00:04:59.900> all<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.169> time<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.849> the

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
carrion over all the time and the

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.249 
carrion over all the time and the
finality<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.449> actually<00:05:02.840> getting<00:05:02.960> what<00:05:03.229> he

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
finality of actually getting what he

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.010 
finality of actually getting what he
wanted<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:03.800> we<00:05:04.430> also<00:05:04.580> needed<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.150> show<00:05:05.870> the

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
wanted and we also needed to show the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.629 
wanted and we also needed to show the
double<00:05:06.259> cross<00:05:06.410> between<00:05:06.650> tuckus<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:07.370> raining

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
double cross between tuckus and raining

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.510 
double cross between tuckus and raining
and<00:05:08.349> we<00:05:09.349> had<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.560> do<00:05:09.710> this<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.039> these<00:05:10.220> large

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
and we had to do this in these large

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.390 
and we had to do this in these large
metal<00:05:10.789> suits<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.470> so<00:05:12.470> we<00:05:12.590> really<00:05:13.009> relied<00:05:13.370> on

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
metal suits and so we really relied on

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.490 
metal suits and so we really relied on
with<00:05:13.759> this<00:05:13.880> close<00:05:14.210> intimate<00:05:14.750> shots<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.289> the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
with this close intimate shots of the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.830 
with this close intimate shots of the
facial<00:05:15.680> expression<00:05:16.250> so<00:05:16.970> we<00:05:17.090> dug<00:05:17.270> deeply<00:05:17.569> into

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
facial expression so we dug deeply into

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.249 
facial expression so we dug deeply into
the<00:05:17.870> acting<00:05:18.319> and<00:05:18.560> we<00:05:19.370> dug<00:05:19.490> deeply<00:05:19.820> into<00:05:20.150> I

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
the acting and we dug deeply into I

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.230 
the acting and we dug deeply into I
direction<00:05:21.259> speaking<00:05:21.949> getting<00:05:22.880> a<00:05:22.940> lot<00:05:23.060> of<00:05:23.150> the

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
direction speaking getting a lot of the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.640 
direction speaking getting a lot of the
body<00:05:23.419> language<00:05:23.630> through<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.110> eyes<00:05:24.259> and

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
body language through the eyes and

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.469 
body language through the eyes and
getting<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.669> lot<00:05:25.820> of<00:05:25.849> the<00:05:26.000> believability

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
getting a lot of the believability

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.950 
getting a lot of the believability
through<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.080> flush<00:05:27.349> eNOS<00:05:27.620> of<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.860> face<00:05:28.960> once

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
through the flush eNOS of the face once

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.170 
through the flush eNOS of the face once
you<00:05:30.710> tell<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.009> story<00:05:31.250> cleanly<00:05:31.729> and<00:05:31.849> clearly

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
you tell the story cleanly and clearly

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.200 
you tell the story cleanly and clearly
in<00:05:32.509> 3d<00:05:32.930> then<00:05:33.620> we<00:05:34.099> can<00:05:34.280> distribute<00:05:34.699> all<00:05:35.060> these

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
in 3d then we can distribute all these

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.410 
the back and down the spine so that
presented<00:06:19.960> a<00:06:20.320> unique<00:06:21.280> and<00:06:21.580> difficult

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
presented a unique and difficult

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.000 
presented a unique and difficult
challenge<00:06:22.840> for<00:06:23.080> us<00:06:23.110> to<00:06:23.410> keep<00:06:23.620> that<00:06:23.800> whole

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
challenge for us to keep that whole

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.210 
challenge for us to keep that whole
thing<00:06:24.280> together<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:24.940> rigid<00:06:25.930> and<00:06:26.230> still<00:06:27.070> able

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
thing together and rigid and still able

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.540 
thing together and rigid and still able
to<00:06:27.490> act<00:06:28.170> still<00:06:29.170> able<00:06:29.290> to<00:06:29.440> give<00:06:30.310> the

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
to act still able to give the

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.040 
to act still able to give the
performance<00:06:30.880> that<00:06:31.270> the<00:06:31.420> animator<00:06:31.780> was

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
performance that the animator was

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.330 
performance that the animator was
looking<00:06:32.380> forward

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
looking forward

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.520 
looking forward
so<00:06:33.910> we<00:06:34.000> have<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.240> simulation<00:06:34.780> process<00:06:35.050> and

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
so we have the simulation process and

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.710 
so we have the simulation process and
that's<00:06:36.130> that's<00:06:36.490> the<00:06:36.699> process<00:06:36.880> of<00:06:37.210> deforming<00:06:37.660> a

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
that's that's the process of deforming a

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.600 
that's that's the process of deforming a
character<00:06:38.169> using<00:06:38.650> a<00:06:39.510> simulator<00:06:40.979> so<00:06:41.979> the

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
character using a simulator so the

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.610 
character using a simulator so the
character<00:06:42.970> of<00:06:43.000> Carrigan<00:06:43.479> presented<00:06:44.410> a<00:06:44.500> number

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
character of Carrigan presented a number

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.129 
character of Carrigan presented a number
of<00:06:44.860> different<00:06:44.979> challenges<00:06:45.699> for<00:06:45.940> us<00:06:46.020> not<00:06:47.020> the

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
of different challenges for us not the

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.070 
of different challenges for us not the
least<00:06:47.320> of<00:06:47.470> which<00:06:47.530> is<00:06:47.680> she's<00:06:48.370> seen<00:06:48.699> in<00:06:49.080> three

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
least of which is she's seen in three

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.379 
least of which is she's seen in three
different<00:06:50.290> forms<00:06:51.150> throughout<00:06:52.150> the

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389 
different forms throughout the

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.020 
different forms throughout the
cinematics<00:06:52.960> so<00:06:53.770> another<00:06:54.010> another<00:06:54.699> simulation

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
cinematics so another another simulation

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.300 
cinematics so another another simulation
tasks<00:06:55.690> that<00:06:55.780> were<00:06:55.900> responsible<00:06:56.500> for<00:06:56.830> is<00:06:57.250> a

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
tasks that were responsible for is a

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.300 
tasks that were responsible for is a
simulation<00:06:57.669> of<00:06:58.389> all<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:58.900> hair<00:06:59.260> and<00:06:59.560> all<00:07:00.010> the

simulation of all the hair and all the

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.250 
simulation of all the hair and all the
shows<00:07:00.520> so<00:07:00.850> in<00:07:01.120> Kerrigan's<00:07:01.840> dream<00:07:02.080> for

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
shows so in Kerrigan's dream for

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.710 
shows so in Kerrigan's dream for
instance<00:07:02.590> you<00:07:02.740> see<00:07:03.210> carrie<00:07:04.210> Ann<00:07:04.389> running

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
instance you see carrie Ann running

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.530 
instance you see carrie Ann running
around<00:07:05.050> wind<00:07:05.620> blowing<00:07:05.979> around<00:07:06.240> dust<00:07:07.240> blowing

around wind blowing around dust blowing
around<00:07:07.690> that<00:07:08.020> presented<00:07:08.350> some<00:07:08.680> challenges

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 
around that presented some challenges

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.240 
around that presented some challenges
for<00:07:09.729> us<00:07:09.850> because<00:07:10.060> we<00:07:10.389> really<00:07:10.660> needed<00:07:10.930> to<00:07:11.250> work

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
for us because we really needed to work

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.010 
for us because we really needed to work
