 the denomination according to the confectioners arrives 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.940

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.320
 outside but also in their families in 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.320

 by doing it good , the 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.689
 prestige although the denomination of 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.670
 origin strengthens a commercial sector of 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.220
 the ligua according to the mayor of the commune and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.709
 other items that need visibility 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.139
 the estate was approaching one 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.549
 from the premises of these manufacturers 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.530
 heavy that refuse to disappear

 for his circus collection our 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.159
 traditions that you have from the 90 the 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.590
 manufacturers and the saler built in a 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.709
 low sales due to the entry 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.200
 of import products themselves 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.389
 businessmen also many of them do not 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.359
 they could be reconverted easier for 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.519

 economic difficulties and we had to 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.330
 the few that we were to press 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.300

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.430
 the item is reborn little by little and I believe
