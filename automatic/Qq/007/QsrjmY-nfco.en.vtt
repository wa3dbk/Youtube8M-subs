00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the work so the best ways to let it hang

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.220 
the work so the best ways to let it hang
down<00:00:38.040> completely<00:00:38.850> down<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> bottom<00:00:39.570> that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
down completely down at the bottom that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.670 
down completely down at the bottom that
puts<00:00:40.649> extra<00:00:41.219> stress<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:42.510> biceps<00:00:42.750> you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
take it from there then lift it up to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.709 
take it from there then lift it up to
the<00:00:45.930> top<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.429> top<00:00:47.609> now<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.690> of

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the top right up to the top now one of

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.880 
the top right up to the top now one of
the<00:00:48.870> things<00:00:48.929> i<00:00:49.170> want<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> show<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> if

the things i want to show you is if
you're<00:00:50.039> making<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> muscle<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.449> thing<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
you're making a muscle the thing that

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.569 
you're making a muscle the thing that
you<00:00:51.960> would<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> would<00:00:53.039> actually<00:00:53.309> take

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
you would do is you would actually take

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.549 
you would do is you would actually take
the<00:00:53.760> muscle<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.719> would<00:00:54.899> make<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> muscle

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the muscle and you would make the muscle

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
the muscle and you would make the muscle
like<00:00:55.679> that<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.219> pulling<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> ton<00:00:56.940> of

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
like that so you're pulling a ton of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.750 
like that so you're pulling a ton of
show<00:00:57.210> off<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.570> other<00:00:57.690> words<00:00:57.929> okay<00:00:58.640> when<00:00:59.640> you're

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
show off in other words okay when you're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.220 
show off in other words okay when you're
doing<00:00:59.969> your<00:00:59.999> weights<00:01:00.359> try<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.140> exactly

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
doing your weights try and do exactly

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.040 
doing your weights try and do exactly
the<00:01:01.649> same<00:01:01.679> so<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> weight<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
the same so you take the weight from the

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.509 
the same so you take the weight from the
bottom<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> danglers<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.280> about<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
bottom and the danglers for about a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.240 
bottom and the danglers for about a
second<00:01:06.030> then<00:01:06.780> lift<00:01:07.050> it<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.560> make<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
second then lift it up and make the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.969 
second then lift it up and make the
muscle<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> top<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.409> order<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.770> get

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
muscle at the top but in order to get

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.910 
muscle at the top but in order to get
that<00:01:11.010> extra<00:01:11.520> bit<00:01:11.930> raise<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:12.960> elbows<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.740> well

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that extra bit raise your elbows as well

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.790 
that extra bit raise your elbows as well
so<00:01:14.820> you're<00:01:15.000> doing<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.780> motion<00:01:16.020> down

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
so you're doing that kind of motion down

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.999 
so you're doing that kind of motion down
for<00:01:17.130> about<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.370> second<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> top<00:01:19.500> make

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
for about a second up to the top make

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.209 
for about a second up to the top make
the<00:01:20.310> muscle<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.969> then<00:01:21.600> give<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.049> extra

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
the muscle and then give it that extra

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.530 
the muscle and then give it that extra
by<00:01:23.219> doing<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.729> you're<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
by doing that you're going to get a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.380 
by doing that you're going to get a
great<00:01:25.110> workout<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.710> your<00:01:25.740> biceps<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:27.210> other

alternate dumbbells the one I like is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.660 
alternate dumbbells the one I like is
where<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> actually<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.380> rotate<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.460> wait<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
where you actually you rotate the wait a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.029 
where you actually you rotate the wait a
little<00:01:38.939> bit<00:01:39.149> that<00:01:39.869> seems<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.320> put<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
little bit that seems to put more of a

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.209 
little bit that seems to put more of a
pressure<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:42.329> biceps<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.469> I<00:01:43.500> kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> put

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
pressure on your biceps so I kind of put

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.099 
pressure on your biceps so I kind of put
