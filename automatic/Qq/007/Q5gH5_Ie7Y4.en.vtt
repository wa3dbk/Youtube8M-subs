 you are here castilla with our good 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.689
 let's play testing the cause mode of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.540
 the salivation fairy a week ago or 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.550
 I do not know how much exactly it seems little and 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.900
 Well I wanted to see some of this 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.239
 individual I think what I will give something 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.739
 collective because this game mode I think 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.079
 which is more for more players than 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.899
 individual because it's super complicated and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.690
 super difficult and good because the mere fact 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 for which I will prove what I am going to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.199
 try it but from what I've seen in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.629
 internet is quite complicated and 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.059
 quite difficult the thing to endure 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.359
 a lot and already with two slopes 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.950

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.870
 come technical m 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.040
 as I have seen and as I understand it is necessary 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:12.010
 go kill before it runs out 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.010
 time you have to invent especially catch 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.140

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.160

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.160
 from us borrower 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.280
 14 then the more you hold on more 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.740
 time and more skills are giving you your 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.740
 lightweight that if I know that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.360
