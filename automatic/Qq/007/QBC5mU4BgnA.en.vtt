I<00:00:43.850> had<00:00:44.180> droops<00:00:44.510> fine<00:00:44.780> crawling<00:00:45.260> around<00:00:45.350> and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
I had droops fine crawling around and

I had droops fine crawling around and
everything<00:00:46.129> works<00:00:46.399> good<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:46.670> come<00:00:47.659> up<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:47.899> a

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
vertical wall and your front end pushes

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.219 
vertical wall and your front end pushes
against<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.440> climb<00:00:51.739> up<00:00:52.729> it<00:00:53.059> or<00:00:53.839> if<00:00:54.079> you're

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
against it to climb up it or if you're

front<00:00:57.199> end<00:00:57.350> just<00:00:57.379> wants<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.829> pull<00:00:58.039> all<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.429> way

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
front end just wants to pull all the way

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.049 
front end just wants to pull all the way
up<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.199> to<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.350> end<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.949> shock<00:01:01.670> length

up to the to the end of the shock length

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.889 
up to the to the end of the shock length
and<00:01:03.910> that<00:01:04.910> throws<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.479> center<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.810> gravity

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
and that throws the center of gravity

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.279 
and that throws the center of gravity
back<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:06.890> up<00:01:07.399> way<00:01:07.670> high<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:08.300> want<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.170> keep

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
back and and up way high I want to keep

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.380 
back and and up way high I want to keep
it<00:01:09.470> down<00:01:09.649> when<00:01:09.950> I'm<00:01:10.039> when<00:01:10.820> I'm<00:01:10.970> doing<00:01:11.270> that

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
it down when I'm when I'm doing that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.790 
it down when I'm when I'm doing that
climbing<00:01:11.899> or<00:01:12.020> whatever<00:01:12.259> I<00:01:12.350> want<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.590> front

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
climbing or whatever I want the front

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.840 
climbing or whatever I want the front
end<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.009> stay<00:01:13.250> down<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:15.009> also<00:01:16.009> I<00:01:16.310> still<00:01:16.640> want

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
end to stay down and also I still want

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.550 
end to stay down and also I still want
it<00:01:16.909> to<00:01:17.000> droop<00:01:17.330> at<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.600> same<00:01:17.810> time<00:01:18.110> when<00:01:18.409> I'm

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
it to droop at the same time when I'm

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.399 
it to droop at the same time when I'm
flexing<00:01:19.490> or<00:01:20.110> articulating<00:01:21.110> or<00:01:21.170> whatever

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
flexing or articulating or whatever

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.660 
flexing or articulating or whatever
through<00:01:22.539> obstacles<00:01:23.539> so<00:01:25.240> what<00:01:26.240> I'm<00:01:26.360> doing<00:01:26.720> is

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
through obstacles so what I'm doing is

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.600 
through obstacles so what I'm doing is
taking<00:01:28.670> some<00:01:30.220> Springs<00:01:32.680> from<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.979> pen

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
taking some Springs from a pen

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.450 
taking some Springs from a pen
I<00:01:35.700> found<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.660> type<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.960> pen<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.220> just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I found this type of pen this is just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.100 
I found this type of pen this is just
your<00:01:38.610> basic<00:01:38.750> Vic<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.610> found<00:01:42.600> two<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> them

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
your basic Vic and I found two of them

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.370 
your basic Vic and I found two of them
of<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.190> same<00:01:44.220> kind<00:01:44.900> got<00:01:45.900> several<00:01:46.320> different

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
of the same kind got several different

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.890 
of the same kind got several different
types<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.100> Springs<00:01:47.400> had<00:01:47.640> been<00:01:47.790> found<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.750> I'm

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
types of Springs had been found but I'm

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.350 
types of Springs had been found but I'm
only<00:01:49.020> doing<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.440> front<00:01:49.680> ones<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:51.090> only

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
only doing the front ones the only

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.860 
only doing the front ones the only
problem<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.830> front<00:01:53.190> I<00:01:53.870> leave

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
problem I have is with the front I leave

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.050 
problem I have is with the front I leave
it<00:01:54.990> back<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.470> same<00:01:58.520> I've<00:01:59.520> heard<00:01:59.729> it's<00:01:59.880> better

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
it back the same I've heard it's better

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.420 
it back the same I've heard it's better
to<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.330> stiffer<00:02:00.870> up<00:02:01.229> front<00:02:01.740> than<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.160> back

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
to have stiffer up front than out back

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.360 
to have stiffer up front than out back
as<00:02:02.820> well<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.080> I'm<00:02:04.200> putting<00:02:04.470> thicker<00:02:04.710> shock<00:02:05.100> oil

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
as well so I'm putting thicker shock oil

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.870 
as well so I'm putting thicker shock oil
in<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> front<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:07.340> maybe<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.700> more

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
in the front and maybe a little more

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.020 
in the front and maybe a little more
preload<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.780> sure<00:02:09.990> yet<00:02:10.550> I'm<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> set<00:02:11.940> it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
preload not sure yet I'm going to set it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.460 
preload not sure yet I'm going to set it
up<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.209> little<00:02:12.270> differently<00:02:12.750> than<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.959> had<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.320> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
up a little differently than I had it it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
up a little differently than I had it it
was<00:02:13.590> working<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.430> I'm<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.150> try

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
was working good but I'm going to try

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.840 
was working good but I'm going to try
this<00:02:15.420> out<00:02:15.750> see<00:02:16.080> how<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.290> works

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
this out see how it works

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.600 
this out see how it works
I've<00:02:18.600> had<00:02:18.750> quite<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.110> few<00:02:19.320> people<00:02:21.230> show<00:02:22.230> me<00:02:22.410> this

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
I've had quite a few people show me this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.970 
I've had quite a few people show me this
online<00:02:23.610> or<00:02:24.180> whatever<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.410> not<00:02:25.560> really<00:02:25.830> my

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
online or whatever so it's not really my

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.290 
online or whatever so it's not really my
idea<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:27.170> I'm<00:02:28.170> gonna<00:02:28.410> try<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.830> out<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.340> two<00:02:30.150> of

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
idea but I'm gonna try it out on two of

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.290 
idea but I'm gonna try it out on two of
these<00:02:30.390> pens<00:02:30.750> two<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.560> same<00:02:31.800> Springs

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
these pens two of the same Springs

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.610 
these pens two of the same Springs
they're<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> little<00:02:33.480> longer<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.230> spring

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
they're a little longer of a spring

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.530 
they're a little longer of a spring
which<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.430> what<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.610> want<00:02:35.940> because<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.239> was<00:02:36.360> gonna

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
which is what I want because I was gonna

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.949 
which is what I want because I was gonna
put<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> limiter<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.709> as<00:02:38.420> well<00:02:39.420> with<00:02:39.750> it

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
put a limiter in there as well with it

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.990 
put a limiter in there as well with it
which<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> piece<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.920> fuel<00:02:41.220> tubing<00:02:41.670> from<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
which is a piece of fuel tubing from the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.809 
which is a piece of fuel tubing from the
Nitro<00:02:43.519> just<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.670> little

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
Nitro just a little

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.699 
Nitro just a little
a<00:02:45.879> little<00:02:46.390> tiny<00:02:46.569> piece<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:46.989> field<00:02:47.349> tubing<00:02:48.299> but

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
a little tiny piece of field tubing but

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.110 
a little tiny piece of field tubing but
instead<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:50.980> now<00:02:51.189> these<00:02:51.430> can<00:02:51.639> press<00:02:51.879> down

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
instead of that now these can press down

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.580 
instead of that now these can press down
to<00:02:53.280> about<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.340> quarter<00:02:55.120> inch<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.599> size<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.290> I'll

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
to about a quarter inch in size so I'll

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.339 
to about a quarter inch in size so I'll
have<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:57.129> little<00:02:57.760> less<00:02:57.939> articulation<00:02:58.840> which<00:02:59.170> is

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
have a little less articulation which is

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.670 
have a little less articulation which is
better<00:02:59.879> too<00:03:00.879> much<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.450> not<00:03:01.749> good<00:03:01.840> these<00:03:02.439> things

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
better too much is not good these things

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.449 
better too much is not good these things
articulate<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.819> know<00:03:04.659> like<00:03:05.260> no<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.189> it's

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
articulate to know like no and it's

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.970 
articulate to know like no and it's
ridiculous<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.389> a<00:03:07.799> little<00:03:08.799> less

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
ridiculous but a little less

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.860 
ridiculous but a little less
articulation<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:09.939> actually<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> good<00:03:11.170> thing<00:03:11.379> I

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
articulation is actually a good thing I

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.349 
articulation is actually a good thing I
hear<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.959> over<00:03:14.139> and<00:03:14.290> over<00:03:14.349> from<00:03:15.359> professionals

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
hear it over and over from professionals

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.099 
hear it over and over from professionals
and<00:03:16.599> online<00:03:17.230> people<00:03:17.560> who<00:03:18.659> have<00:03:19.659> some<00:03:19.930> pretty

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
and online people who have some pretty

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.689 
and online people who have some pretty
nice<00:03:20.290> crawlers<00:03:20.829> so<00:03:21.040> I'm<00:03:21.790> going<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.150> try<00:03:22.419> it<00:03:22.480> out

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
nice crawlers so I'm going to try it out

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.580 
nice crawlers so I'm going to try it out
what<00:03:24.699> I<00:03:24.730> did<00:03:24.939> was<00:03:25.090> take<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.329> shock<00:03:26.169> apart

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
what I did was take the shock apart

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.479 
what I did was take the shock apart
here's<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.219> body<00:03:27.659> and<00:03:28.659> here<00:03:30.419> take<00:03:31.419> this<00:03:31.659> off

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
here's the body and here take this off

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.159 
here's the body and here take this off
this<00:03:33.489> goes<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.000> screws<00:03:34.269> onto<00:03:34.449> the<00:03:34.659> bottom<00:03:35.049> of

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
this goes the screws onto the bottom of

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.459 
this goes the screws onto the bottom of
the<00:03:35.519> shaft<00:03:36.519> which<00:03:37.120> sticks<00:03:37.449> out<00:03:37.629> of<00:03:37.900> here<00:03:38.260> of

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:38.469 
the shaft which sticks out of here of

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.059 
the shaft which sticks out of here of
course

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
course

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.319 
course
and<00:03:39.819> there's<00:03:40.000> your<00:03:40.120> shock<00:03:40.419> we<00:03:40.750> unscrew<00:03:41.260> that

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
and there's your shock we unscrew that

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.649 
and there's your shock we unscrew that
this<00:03:43.329> whole<00:03:43.569> thing<00:03:43.810> just<00:03:43.959> slides<00:03:44.290> right<00:03:44.560> out

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
this whole thing just slides right out

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.120 
this whole thing just slides right out
and<00:03:46.659> then

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
and then

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.050 
and then
slip<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.120> spring<00:03:50.670> over<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.790> shaft

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
slip this spring over the shaft

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.199 
slip this spring over the shaft
underneath<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.390 

piston

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
piston

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:11.890 
piston
and<00:03:59.700> then<00:04:00.000> reinstall

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:23.070 

and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.529 

now<00:04:23.560> have<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.919> shock<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.520> has<00:04:24.699> internal

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
now have a shock that has internal

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.270 
now have a shock that has internal
spring

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.180 

just<00:04:28.760> pull<00:04:29.030> back<00:04:29.470> still<00:04:30.470> comes<00:04:30.710> out<00:04:30.830> part<00:04:31.130> of

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
just pull back still comes out part of

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.970 
just pull back still comes out part of
ways<00:04:34.510> should<00:04:35.510> work<00:04:35.690> pretty<00:04:35.930> good<00:04:36.050> some

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
ways should work pretty good some

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.540 
ways should work pretty good some
thicker<00:04:37.220> oil<00:04:38.050> some<00:04:39.050> low<00:04:39.260> c40<00:04:39.919> weights<00:04:40.160> there

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
thicker oil some low c40 weights there

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.300 
thicker oil some low c40 weights there
the<00:04:40.700> 30<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.210> I<00:04:41.270> have<00:04:41.450> in<00:04:41.600> there<00:04:41.780> now<00:04:41.960> so<00:04:42.310> I'm

going<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.460> keep<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.820> 30<00:04:44.090> weight<00:04:44.180> in<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.510> back

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
going to keep the 30 weight in the back

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.800 
going to keep the 30 weight in the back
40<00:04:45.380> in<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.560> front<00:04:46.240> internal<00:04:47.240> Springs<00:04:47.600> in<00:04:47.780> the
