to learn controlling more muscles in our
chest<00:00:22.509> movements<00:00:23.259> now<00:00:23.860> we<00:00:24.279> have<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.550> test

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
chest movements now we have the test

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.729 
chest movements now we have the test
list<00:00:25.300> and<00:00:25.570> we<00:00:25.630> can<00:00:25.750> do<00:00:25.869> small<00:00:26.020> things<00:00:26.199> with

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
list and we can do small things with

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.490 
list and we can do small things with
these<00:00:26.949> we<00:00:27.489> can<00:00:27.550> actually<00:00:27.759> do<00:00:28.090> small<00:00:28.779> movements

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
these we can actually do small movements

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.620 
these we can actually do small movements
of<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:29.770> shuts<00:00:30.009> up<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:30.489> small<00:00:31.150> movements<00:00:31.570> of

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
of the shuts up and small movements of

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.810 
of the shuts up and small movements of
the<00:00:31.720> chest<00:00:31.990> down<00:00:32.320> with<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:32.949> chest<00:00:33.280> lift<00:00:33.580> and

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
the chest down with a chest lift and

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.600 
the chest down with a chest lift and
chest<00:00:34.059> drop<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.440> way<00:00:35.559> I<00:00:35.589> do<00:00:35.920> this<00:00:36.129> is<00:00:36.370> why

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
chest drop the way I do this is why

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
small movements of that so the checks

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.360 
small movements of that so the checks
will<00:00:48.610> go<00:00:48.820> up<00:00:49.210> into<00:00:49.480> small<00:00:50.079> movements<00:00:50.680> we<00:00:51.039> do

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
will go up into small movements we do

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.060 
will go up into small movements we do
they<00:00:51.489> count<00:00:51.730> sometimes<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.360> do<00:00:52.539> three<00:00:53.070> frames

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070
