00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
called a gamma lid it provides an

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.429 
called a gamma lid it provides an
airtight<00:00:26.220> seal<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.869> also<00:00:27.869> an<00:00:27.990> easy<00:00:28.140> way<00:00:28.380> to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
airtight seal and also an easy way to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.859

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
that the gamble it is gasketed as you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.400 
that the gamble it is gasketed as you
can<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.610> also<00:00:35.790> threaded<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.780> when

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.160 
anyways so inside of this pocket mylar
bag<00:01:16.290> now<00:01:17.330> normally<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.479> would<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.720> sealed

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
bag now normally this would be sealed

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
bag now normally this would be sealed
okay<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.479> gyro<00:01:25.049> sealer<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.460> there's<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
okay so the gyro sealer and there's a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.819 
okay so the gyro sealer and there's a
lot<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> different<00:01:27.420> brands<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
lot of different brands out but this is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.310 
lot of different brands out but this is
a<00:01:28.860> plastic<00:01:29.759> material<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.509> it'll<00:01:30.750> melt<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
a plastic material and it'll melt and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.920 
a plastic material and it'll melt and
seal<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:31.890> across<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:33.150> before<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> seal

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
seal right across that now before I seal

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.480 
seal right across that now before I seal
this<00:01:34.220> okay

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
this okay

you<00:01:35.880> want<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> put<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.020> called<00:01:37.259> an

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you want to put your what is called an

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.700 
you want to put your what is called an
oxygen<00:01:38.040> absorber<00:01:38.670> inside<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.990> what

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
oxygen absorber inside of it and what

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
oxygen absorber inside of it and what
that<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.310> usually<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.150> it's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that is is that's usually you know it's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.819 
that is is that's usually you know it's
iron<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.939> looks<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> small<00:01:45.840> red<00:01:46.170> aspirin

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
iron and looks like a small red aspirin

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
iron and looks like a small red aspirin
and<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.970> put<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> inside<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.750> seal<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> up

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and you put it inside there seal it up

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.770 
and you put it inside there seal it up
and<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.340> oxidizes<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.210> burns<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and it it oxidizes and burns up all the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.530 
and it it oxidizes and burns up all the
oxygen<00:01:51.899> inside<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> back<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.270> bunka

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
oxygen inside the back and the bunka

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.690 
oxygen inside the back and the bunka
okay<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.930> preserve

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
okay so you know it's going to preserve

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.889 
okay so you know it's going to preserve
it's<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> increase<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> shelf<00:02:00.509> life<00:02:00.689> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
it's going to increase the shelf life of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.410 
it's going to increase the shelf life of
the<00:02:00.960> food<00:02:01.549> now<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.759> thing<00:02:02.909> about<00:02:02.969> oxygen

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the food now one thing about oxygen

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.870 
the food now one thing about oxygen
absorbers<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:05.219> need<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> make<00:02:05.610> sure<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
absorbers is you need to make sure you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.770 
absorbers is you need to make sure you
have<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> right<00:02:06.270> size<00:02:06.659> or<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
have the right size or the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.600 
have the right size or the
or<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.289> you're<00:02:08.440> using<00:02:09.420> okay<00:02:12.300> all<00:02:13.300> right<00:02:13.420> so
