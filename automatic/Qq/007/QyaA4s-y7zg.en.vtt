 focused on the world of gaming to which 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.879
 you play we played, I started the keyboard 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.890
 105 keys and is in Spanish 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.929
 completely Spanish we have the Ã± and the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.929
 defeat or the seplan and every one we call 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.500
 It has the small characteristics 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.020
 initials would be compatibility with 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.870
 the windows vista windows 7 and windows 8 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.489

 games and quick actions and all this not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.820
 for another be it from the box 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.920
 we found the instructions very 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.420
 basic or descriptions about your 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
 functionality in both Spanish 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.729
 Italian Castilian as in the Greek 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.770
 as portuguese and a small map 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.820
 schematic of what the keyboard is like this 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.600
 above what they indicate to us 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600
 Specifications 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.680
 here we have the keyboard three keyboard 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.190
 colors completely a slate gray 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.050
 mate blackboard the black gloss and for the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.600
 zone that wraps the keys is 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.270
 bright bright and this orange this 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.710
 orange that is called mechanical attention 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.020
 also gloss and that moves the areas of 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.150
 macro the keys to everything that is the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.820
 multimedia button area 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.470
 right next we have what would be the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.510
 two buttons that do not graduate the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.390
 intensity of the LEDs think that the 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.040
 keyboard consists of led lights and here 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.760
 as we have discussed the keys 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.130
 memory for the three options 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.740
 that we have a lock key to 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.700
 block game after calling it you can say 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.290
 what are we going we are playing a game 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.750
 well when we trust him he explained 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.510
 us a notification that does not change 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.920
 the screen there is a game interrupt 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.420
 do not 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.370
 the keyboard do not forget that it is mechanical 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.340
 it is not membrane, it is a 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.830
 much faster response in terms of 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.080
 that kind of keyboards with this one 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.849
 agility a greater response at the time 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.980
 to play and have better results 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.080
 our games and we have the keyboard 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.190
 it's worth everything that came in the 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.650
 box 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.650
 we have obviously clear hands 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.170
 from here we can check a little bit like that 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.819
 more closely all that will be the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.610
 wiring a warm one thick thickness 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.750
 important with its two usb ports 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.629
 connected to the tower of our pc here 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.130
 you have it from the same orange besides 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:10.480
 what and books and what surrounding the keys 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.190
 it's a very very striking that makes it very 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.830
 identifies the keyboard with that color not and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.020
 here right here we have a usb port 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.880
 that is a bit hidden right now 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.130
 usb port on which we can count 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.320
 from our headphones to our 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.670
 mouse or any USB device that 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.980
 let's have 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.590
 keyboard just below and a few scripts 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.480
 apart from it the considerable weight that 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.550
 prevents us when we are playing 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.160
 move us to slide from one side to 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:43.360
 another and here the palm rest that is mate 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.360
 it took completely matter of flight 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.710
 also has the scripts that we have 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.710
 commented at the same time as the keyboard 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.160
 from here correct and another here like 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.160
 another the corner 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.760
 always the instructions of the tec in the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.780
 booklet the drivers do not come in 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.940
 packages are downloaded directly 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.190
 from the website and tec is a 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.640
 momentary are very light although without 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.560
 they directly windows 7 and windows 8 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.410
 and storytellers recognize without any 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.140
 problem the device and the workshops 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.090
 are in case you want to program the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.810
 Functions for games always 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.810
 recommendable 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.220
 just the back of the keyboard the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.220
 screams that we mentioned before 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.240
 have 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:48.059
 I spoke with a very very important thickness 

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:50.039
 Here we have everything that would be 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:53.309
 significance is in another voltage number 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.439
 As standard, the model keyboard is 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:59.789
 small let's say slit regatta that we 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:01.050
 makes the adjustment part for the cable 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.899
 in this case you are watching the cable but 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.709
 says that 35 is a cable cordoned off a 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:06.709
 thick cable 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.539
 so you can see how good that 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.459
 contributors here of the crips that 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.339
 We were talking about the keyboard and the legs 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.839
 only the legs to level or to 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.960
 give a little more height to our 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:23.889
 keyboard that persone 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.889
 important 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.080
 good here and then a little 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:44.150
 difference had comparative between what 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:46.490
 which would be the 710 plus and the 110 110 not 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.620
 has LED backlighting this 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.949
 if you do not see it on here but the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:56.689
 lighting is far superior to that of 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.440
 models each one because it comes differentiated 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:02.450
 always with your 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.470
 distinctive badge of modern when 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.050
 guys, I hope you liked the 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.090
 description that you enter a lot more 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.730
 information about this keyboard is a 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.980
 wonder compared to others that I have 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.690
 proved very happy with its result 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.840
 we'll see the next video up 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.840
 soon 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.180
 with the
