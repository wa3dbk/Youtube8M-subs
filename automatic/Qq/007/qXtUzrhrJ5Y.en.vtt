00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.140
 welcome and tubs apples if you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.720
 watched my previous videos 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.320
 You probably know that the interface ios 7 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.759
 heavily borrowed from shouting sitting in 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.349
 Today's review I will talk about 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.950
 extending the course of the ages which will help 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.730
 turn 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.960
 rs6 in the seven of course when changing 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.510
 interface can not escape from 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 omnipresent winterboard exists 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.099
 great theme called ios 7 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 she will do the most necessary 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.060
 Us changes as you can see themes change 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.430
 most standard icons 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.329
 application items in the settings menu 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
 battery alarm as well as other little things 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.500
 the only thing that is not quite in it 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.059
 believable so is the lock screen 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.340
 to change it we use another 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.730
 Theme for winterboard called 7 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.590
 lockscreen order to receive 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 screen notification center access 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.010
 lock we need jailbreak 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.010
 tweak called 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.160
 as you remember, you can unlock s7 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.910
 Not only with the place where before 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.960
 there was a slider 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.670
 well, just squeezed the screen to the right such 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.680
 You will have an unlock method 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.860
 after installing the expansion Murloc screen 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.760
 to unlock to add to ios 6 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.740
 control panel 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.530
 no tweaks yet 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.330
 extensions mimic its functionality 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.450
 can add several extensions 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.500
 to the notification center for the player on my 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.979
 look is best used 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.660
 extension ensign musik testers design 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.260
 certainly not exactly like the seven 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.210
 however, the functionality can be 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.590
 listen and rewind tracks as well 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.320
 share them on social networks 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.660
 and to get the right switches 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.600
 It is necessary to install a tweak called 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.369
 pension settings appearance in buttons 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.710
 become like sevens after installation 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.430
 first in our review tweak for 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.840
 winterboard called 7 theme for their 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.300
 use just go to settings 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.630
 and settings and in the corresponding item 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.649
 choose the desired type size itself 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.000
 notification center 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.440
 changes from century to mancy and us to 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.390
 get the semblance of new apple ovsky 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.450
 Folders install the extension under 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.000
 folder name enhancer 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.209
 in my opinion it works even better 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.610
 as-7 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.900
 because at the same time you have on the screen 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.860
 16th place 9 icons and also the dock is visible 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.650
 the ability to run an application from 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.280
 him this kind of not only changes the external 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.080
 folder view 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 it also allows you to add 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.310
 unlimited number of icons in them 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.970
 after its installation in folders appears 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.970
 page 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.220
 and you noticed a live icon 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.810
 hours on with tidy 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.940
 this is another topic for winterboard under 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.590
 name live blog 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.010
 it allows you to choose light or dark 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.870
 clock 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 as well as turn on or off the second 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.290
 arrow 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.760
 most noticeable improvement rs7 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.780
 happened in the menu navigation 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.520
 the ability to swipe back in 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.730
 previous item apple clearly 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.260
 borrowed an extension from your run 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.150
 Tweak integrates not only into the system and 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.680
 most standard applications and of 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.020
 may work in some third-party 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.310
 programs 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.930
 In my opinion it is very convenient when 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.060
 using the phone with one hand 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.950
 especially when it comes to the fifth iphone 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.960
 do not need a finger stretch to the top left 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.750
 corner just enough to make a swipe 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.420
 now look carefully at the background 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.470
 desktop 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.240
 depending on the position of the phone in 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.850
 space wallpaper as it changes its 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.270
 tilt angle such effect adds 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.770
 jailbreak tweak called type and 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.360
 the extension has three simple sliders 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.140
 that allow you to customize the effect by 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.030
 fit as you know apple a7 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.160
 restricted the use of this feature to 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.400
 old versions of iPhones but jailbreak tweak 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.200
 there is no such limitation more than 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.680
 remembered the new operating system 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.820
 this is a semi transparent keyboard background 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.040
 this effect can be obtained with 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.500
 tvika color keyboard and installed 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.500
 extensions for it and weight transparent 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.570
 theme authors as-7 for winterboard 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.540
 thought a lot of little things but quite 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.220
 forgot about the new sliders to get 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.260
 it is enough to install another topic 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.770
 for winterboard called rs7 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.450
 the theme slider with her sliders will turn 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.050
 from bulk flat and will not 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.890
 stand out from the general concept of the seven 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.770
 at presentation 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.870
 7 fell out strongly boasted new panel 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.950
 multitasking 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.720
 as you can see she is pretty strong 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.840
 reminds jailbreak tweak called 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.400
 as a switcher extension except for such 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.650
 mode allows you to display programs 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.940
 grid and also closes them not only 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.940
 Swipe up but down 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.110
 all themes set for winterboard 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.150
 it is desirable to install it in such 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.030
 okay like me so they don't 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.040
 overlapped each other here you 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.590
 You can change the settings for life 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.110
 club maybe just turn off live 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.470
 Watches make them dark or light and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.210
 also with or without second hand 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.020
 see topic 7 is broken into several 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.640
 points 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.790
 each of which can be included or 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.470
 turn off individually to end 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.150
 the whole picture looked holistic and 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.800
 really reminded 7 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.170
 will also need to change 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.020
 system font available this through 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.700
 byte program he tweak it 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.480
 it will be necessary to establish a separate 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.790
 font as-7 fund it is completely identical 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.690
 shift you 7 and has the support of Russian 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.690
 and english 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.380
 now quickly go through the settings 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.720
 All tweaks will be displayed 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.030
 notification center on the lock screen 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.760
 in addition to its direct destination has 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.950
 a number of additional card features 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.840
 switcher will not only activate 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.240
 card switching but also add 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.380
 cross off application as well 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.380
 the name of the program itself 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.589
 color keyboard extension is pretty 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:32.449
 serious she has a number of who can 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:33.199
 install third-party themes and other 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.999
 developers 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.419
 In addition, it allows you to manage 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:40.339
 keyboard different modes deep and 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.959
 besides giving a three-dimensional effect 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:45.229
 the desktop is no bigger 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:47.089
 can not boast but much 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.839
 settings has a tweak holder enhancer 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:52.789
 which we use for pumping folders 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:54.739
 the Murloc screen extension to unlock also 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.779

 it distinguishes them from the settings 

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:24.019
 as-7 as you can see every tweak can 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:25.999
 install or delete individually 

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:29.689
