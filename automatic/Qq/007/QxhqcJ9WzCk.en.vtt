because it's very useful and very
interesting<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:18.240> let's<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:20.520> time<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
interesting so let's do it the time to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.679 
interesting so let's do it the time to
show<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.109> move<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.769> there<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.789> go<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.539> got

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
show the move and there we go so we got

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.529 
show the move and there we go so we got
the<00:00:24.779> ordinary<00:00:25.230> deck<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.560> cards<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:27.210> if<00:00:27.359> I

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the ordinary deck of cards and if I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.450 
the ordinary deck of cards and if I
spread<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> cards<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.710> will<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
spread the cards you will see that the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.970 
spread the cards you will see that the
cards<00:00:29.849> are<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.029> perfect<00:00:30.769> numerical<00:00:31.769> order

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
cards are in perfect numerical order

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.700 
cards are in perfect numerical order
there<00:00:32.460> are<00:00:32.579> hearts<00:00:32.850> from<00:00:33.210> Ace<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> King<00:00:33.719> space

King and clubs from Ace to King so we
got<00:00:40.500> perfect<00:00:40.820> numerical<00:00:41.820> order<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.360> now

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
got perfect numerical order and now

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.540 
got perfect numerical order and now
we're<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> destroy<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.980> order<00:00:44.370> by

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
we're going to destroy this order by

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.150 
we're going to destroy this order by
mixing<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> cards<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.170> go<00:00:46.379> so

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
stealing the perfect numerical order

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
stealing the perfect numerical order
there<00:01:08.189> are<00:01:08.220> hearts<00:01:08.549> from<00:01:08.880> Ace<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> King<00:01:09.380> space

guys how this technique works right now

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.980 
guys how this technique works right now
let's<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.460> it

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
let's do it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.050 
let's do it
alright<00:01:48.990> guys<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.680> time<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.250> explain<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
alright guys it's a time to explain the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.789 
alright guys it's a time to explain the
move<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.180> I've<00:01:54.180> gotta<00:01:54.619> do<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
move and there we go so I've gotta do it

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.640 
move and there we go so I've gotta do it
in<00:01:55.950> slow<00:01:56.130> motion

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
in slow motion

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.920 
in slow motion
and<00:01:57.980> you<00:01:58.280> can<00:01:58.460> understand<00:01:59.000> everything<00:01:59.450> how<00:01:59.780> it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
and you can understand everything how it

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.040 
and you can understand everything how it
works<00:02:00.200> okay<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.400> now<00:02:01.760> of<00:02:02.120> course<00:02:02.180> we<00:02:02.750> start

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
works okay so now of course we start

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.840 
works okay so now of course we start
with<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.320> grip<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.950> can<00:02:04.160> hold<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.550> cars

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
with the grip so you can hold the cars

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.760 
with the grip so you can hold the cars
like<00:02:05.150> this<00:02:05.390> or<00:02:05.900> whatever<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.590> feel

any<00:02:13.970> how<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.640> okay<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.150> other<00:02:17.300> hand<00:02:17.630> serves<00:02:17.960> as

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
any how so okay the other hand serves as

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.920 
any how so okay the other hand serves as
a<00:02:18.200> plate<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:21.080> always<00:02:21.470> under<00:02:22.930> cards

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930
