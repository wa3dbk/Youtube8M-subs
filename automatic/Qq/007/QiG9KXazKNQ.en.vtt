00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
image I just paste it and block it so

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.279 
image I just paste it and block it so
it's<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.810> doesn't<00:01:42.990> move

you<00:02:21.470> know<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.920> hand<00:02:22.130> painting<00:02:22.550> doesn't

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
you know like the hand painting doesn't

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.820 
you know like the hand painting doesn't
give<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.270> because<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.260> know<00:02:24.380> like<00:02:24.680> the

perfection<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.520> gives<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.940> working<00:02:26.480> with

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
perfection that gives you working with

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.150 
perfection that gives you working with
vectors<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.580> will<00:02:28.610> never<00:02:28.940> have<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.390> by<00:02:30.160> human

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
vectors you will never have it by human

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.270 
vectors you will never have it by human
hand<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.820> think<00:02:31.970> two<00:02:32.600> are<00:02:32.900> two<00:02:33.080> different<00:02:33.500> ways

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
hand I think two are two different ways

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.970 
hand I think two are two different ways
of<00:02:34.660> express<00:02:36.790> yourself<00:02:37.790> as<00:02:37.970> an<00:02:38.120> artist<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.980> but

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
of express yourself as an artist and but

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.520 
of express yourself as an artist and but
they<00:02:40.100> are<00:02:40.160> completely<00:02:40.610> different<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.530> and

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
they are completely different and and

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.220 
they are completely different and and
are<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.920> fantastic<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:44.300> able<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.780> use

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
are just fantastic to be able to use

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.850 
are just fantastic to be able to use
both<00:02:45.470> of<00:02:45.680> them<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.840> 90%<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.960> times<00:02:48.260> on<00:02:48.440> product

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
both of them so 90% of times on product

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.660 
both of them so 90% of times on product
I<00:02:49.280> will<00:02:49.880> work<00:02:50.290> using<00:02:51.290> my<00:02:51.740> sketches<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.340> will

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
I will work using my sketches that will

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.590 
I will work using my sketches that will
be<00:02:52.820> retransform<00:02:53.420> using<00:02:54.340> Adobe<00:02:55.340> Illustrator
