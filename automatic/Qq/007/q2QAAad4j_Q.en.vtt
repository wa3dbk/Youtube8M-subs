00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.620
 life is also really like 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.820
 a train and I know that this story is going 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.250
 to like a lot 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.370
 it is the train of life 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.170
 notice that it is true when we enter 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.080
 to our life when we get to the train 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.450
 of life do not reside our parents and 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.119
 they go in the same car as us and we 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.800
 we are very excited and we believe that they 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.539
 are going to be eternal that are going to be us 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.760
 accompanying all the way 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.770
 during the entire trip 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.290
 but the truth is very different and many 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.440
 they already lived it one day they get off to 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.239
 never again to get on 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.570
 and we suffer a lot but we have left 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.310
 our memories the values 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.329
 to the train of life our 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.850
 siblings friends the person who decides 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.280
 share with you the trip and feel 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.039
 your side your wife your husband 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.530
 your best friends that ironies of the 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.719
 life because sometimes the people we love 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.000
 which is found in other wagons and 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.950
 we can go to visit them sometimes we go to 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.860
 Sometimes we forget 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.050
 we forget that they are in another wagon and weird 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.670
 time we go and the day we go the seat 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.610
 next door is occupied by another 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.870
 person and nothing else we sigh and say 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 it seems to me that I have not been a good friend 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.480
 for you 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.810
 you know what the big question is 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.920
 we do not know what day we're going to go down 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.680
 when are we going to get to the station 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.930
 final this is a big question and 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.670
 priore tantito that we do not know 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.250
 We want to know when our beings 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.170
 dear ones are going down and we believe that 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.730
 they are eternal and to continue with 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.020
 we have to take care of details 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.150
 to say that I want to be expressive to say 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.659
 that you are an important part of my life if 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.520
 do not get enough 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.409
 but I 'm sure one day we're going to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.359
 get to the station at the end 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.219
 is going to stop our life train 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.719
 we will go down and those beings will be 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.060
 who came forward with arms 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.280
 open and they will tell us how it went 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.140
 you enjoy the road and they are going to hug me 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.610
 and my mommy is going to fill me with kisses 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.940
 I'm safe 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.640
 but also be in that final station goes 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.230
 to be our creator I do not know 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.630
 I want to imagine what the trial is like 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.610
 final but what I am sure 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.640
 boys boys is he's going to ask me 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.950
 accounts of how happy we were that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 so happy very much that yes I will ask 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.840
 count how much I loved how much I wanted how much 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.640
 it transcended in others that so happy 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.940
 did people going in my car and 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.550
 in other wagons you left a trace that way 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.080
 it's like you're going to judge in love you know 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.660
 I wish that all of you heart 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.520
 Have a happy trip to God 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.140
 bless your steps that God bless 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.140
