comments and feedback I've heard from

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.090 
comments and feedback I've heard from
people<00:00:18.390> who<00:00:18.840> are<00:00:19.020> actually<00:00:19.320> teaching<00:00:19.920> and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
people who are actually teaching and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.609 
people who are actually teaching and
I'll<00:00:20.279> say<00:00:20.490> things<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.850> all<00:00:21.570> those<00:00:22.050> students

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
I'll say things like all those students

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
I'll say things like all those students
today<00:00:22.740> they've<00:00:23.189> been<00:00:23.400> raised<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.880> television

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
today they've been raised on television

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.630 
today they've been raised on television
so<00:00:24.930> they<00:00:25.080> only<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> attention<00:00:26.400> span<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
so they only have a attention span of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.370 
so they only have a attention span of
five<00:00:26.970> minutes<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.930> change

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
five minutes and then you have to change

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.349 
five minutes and then you have to change
you<00:00:29.010> know<00:00:29.130> change<00:00:29.400> direction<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.210> I've

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you know change direction and I've

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.749 
you know change direction and I've
actually<00:00:30.510> heard<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.349> people<00:00:31.669> who<00:00:32.669> are

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
actually heard of people who are

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.850 
actually heard of people who are
designing<00:00:33.149> learning<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.960> students<00:00:34.320> who<00:00:34.469> are

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
designing learning for students who are

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100 
designing learning for students who are
saying<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.120> impact<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.809> TV

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
saying that because of the impact of TV

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.290 
saying that because of the impact of TV
our<00:00:37.290> brains<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.980> evolved<00:00:38.640> differently<00:00:38.820> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
our brains have evolved differently and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.810 
our brains have evolved differently and
so<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:41.010> build<00:00:41.190> lesson<00:00:41.579> plans

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
so now we have to build lesson plans

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.569 
so now we have to build lesson plans
where<00:00:42.059> every<00:00:42.360> five<00:00:42.600> minutes<00:00:43.040> something<00:00:44.040> new

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
where every five minutes something new

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
where every five minutes something new
and<00:00:44.910> engaging<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.960> distracting<00:00:46.559> happens

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
and engaging and distracting happens

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.910 
and engaging and distracting happens
it's<00:00:47.340> simply<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:47.879> true<00:00:48.379> what's<00:00:49.379> happening<00:00:49.800> is

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it's simply not true what's happening is

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.459 
it's simply not true what's happening is
that<00:00:49.950> we're<00:00:50.670> still<00:00:50.910> using<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:52.020> kind<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
that we're still using the kind of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
that we're still using the kind of
teaching<00:00:53.070> methods<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.820> used<00:00:54.030> 80<00:00:54.390> years

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
teaching methods that we used 80 years

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.630 
teaching methods that we used 80 years
ago<00:00:54.960> some<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.500> us<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.739> using<00:00:56.070> curricula<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
ago some of us are using curricula that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
ago some of us are using curricula that
are<00:00:56.910> 30<00:00:57.149> years<00:00:57.210> old<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.320> because

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
are 30 years old and I know this because

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
are 30 years old and I know this because
I've<00:00:58.770> seen<00:00:59.100> them<00:00:59.309> I've<00:01:00.090> built<00:01:00.300> lesson<00:01:00.660> plans

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
I've seen them I've built lesson plans

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.420 
I've seen them I've built lesson plans
from<00:01:01.199> them<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:02.160> high<00:01:02.370> school<00:01:02.640> students<00:01:03.000> so

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
from them for high school students so

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.730 
from them for high school students so
when<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.610> look<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:06.090> where<00:01:06.960> our<00:01:07.200> learning<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
when you look at where our learning is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.429 
when you look at where our learning is
coming<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.090> basically<00:01:09.540> we're

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
coming from which is basically we're

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
coming from which is basically we're
going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> preach<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:10.979> people<00:01:11.520> because<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.330> are

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
going to preach to people because we are

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.120 
going to preach to people because we are
the<00:01:12.510> subject<00:01:13.170> matter<00:01:13.260> experts<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.979> there's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the subject matter experts and there's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.620 
the subject matter experts and there's
nowhere<00:01:14.400> else<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.540> this

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
nowhere else they can go to get this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
nowhere else they can go to get this
information<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:16.710> still<00:01:16.950> teaching<00:01:17.310> people

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
information we're still teaching people

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580 
information we're still teaching people
like<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.210> we're<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:18.960> providing<00:01:19.170> we're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
like that and we're not providing we're

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.070 
like that and we're not providing we're
not<00:01:19.710> adding<00:01:19.890> value<00:01:20.040> we're<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.780> showing<00:01:21.780> them

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
not adding value we're not showing them

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.810 
not adding value we're not showing them
how<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> valuable<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.250> their<00:01:23.430> lives<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
how this is valuable in their lives and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.010 
how this is valuable in their lives and
we're<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.090> building<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> kinds<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> skills

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
we're not building the kinds of skills

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.560 
we're not building the kinds of skills
that<00:01:25.350> they<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:25.830> away<00:01:26.070> right<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:27.299> into

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that they can take away right right into

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.780 
that they can take away right right into
their<00:01:27.720> own<00:01:27.900> lives<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.380> use<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.250> that's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
their own lives and use and that that's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
their own lives and use and that that's
proof<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.630> proof<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.110> what

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
proof that's that proof that what

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.670 
proof that's that proof that what
they're<00:01:32.009> learning<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.400> valuable<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:34.140> mean

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
they're learning is valuable and I mean

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.149 
they're learning is valuable and I mean
if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.250> want<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.939> how<00:01:36.240> committed<00:01:37.159> young

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
if you want to know how committed young

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.140 
if you want to know how committed young
