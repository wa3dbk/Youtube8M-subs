follows kevin healey's philosophy let's

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.420 
follows kevin healey's philosophy let's
say<00:01:04.979> he's<00:01:05.159> his<00:01:05.339> protege<00:01:06.590> Kevin<00:01:07.590> Keeley<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
say he's his protege Kevin Keeley was a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
say he's his protege Kevin Keeley was a
high<00:01:08.909> school<00:01:08.970> football<00:01:09.299> coach<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.990> believe<00:01:10.229> his

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
high school football coach I believe his

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.160 
high school football coach I believe his
record<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:11.010> 71<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.670> 16<00:01:12.180> his

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
record was I think 71 in 16 his

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.219 
record was I think 71 in 16 his
philosophy<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.760> never<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.970> kickoffs<00:01:15.390> either

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
philosophy was never do kickoffs either

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.080 
philosophy was never do kickoffs either
kicking<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> bounds<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.460> onside<00:01:17.820> kicks

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
kicking out of bounds or do onside kicks

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
kicking out of bounds or do onside kicks
this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.689> obviously<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:19.259> high<00:01:19.350> school<00:01:19.590> never

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
this is obviously for high school never

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.190 
this is obviously for high school never

on<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.659> field<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:29.250> go

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
on the field you go for it actually go

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.620 
on the field you go for it actually go
for<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.610> fourth<00:01:29.820> down<00:01:29.850> no<00:01:30.090> matter<00:01:30.210> what

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
for it on fourth down no matter what

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.700 
for it on fourth down no matter what
that<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.200> his<00:01:31.320> philosophy<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that was his philosophy but and like I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.240 
that was his philosophy but and like I
said<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.189> whole<00:01:35.460> onside<00:01:35.850> kick<00:01:36.119> stuff<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:37.250> took

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
said the whole onside kick stuff I took

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
said the whole onside kick stuff I took
this<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.240> maneuvered<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.380> bit

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
this and maneuvered it a little bit

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740 
this and maneuvered it a little bit
towards<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.250> statistical<00:01:42.090> aspect<00:01:42.509> because<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
towards a statistical aspect because I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.800 
towards a statistical aspect because I
also<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.200> some<00:01:43.380> other<00:01:43.439> stuff<00:01:43.710> about<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
also have some other stuff about that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.109 
also have some other stuff about that
anywhere<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> field<00:01:46.200> fourth<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.770> fiber

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
anywhere on the field fourth and fiber

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
anywhere on the field fourth and fiber
shorter<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.990> no<00:01:49.079> matter<00:01:49.200> where

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
shorter you go for it no matter where

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.649 
shorter you go for it no matter where
you<00:01:49.470> are<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> field<00:01:50.329> fourth<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.540> eighth
