what<00:00:00.630> is<00:00:00.860> hyper-threading

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:05.049 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.540 

hyper-threading<00:00:06.049> is<00:00:06.710> the<00:00:07.100> biggest

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
hyper-threading is the biggest

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.780 
hyper-threading is the biggest
difference<00:00:07.910> between<00:00:08.000> the<00:00:08.780> core<00:00:09.230> i5

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
difference between the core i5

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.299 
difference between the core i5
processors<00:00:10.790> and<00:00:11.120> the<00:00:11.660> i7<00:00:12.410> processors<00:00:13.070> from

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
processors and the i7 processors from

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.400 
processors and the i7 processors from
Intel<00:00:13.789> but<00:00:14.600> a<00:00:14.660> lot<00:00:14.809> of<00:00:14.840> people<00:00:15.139> don't<00:00:15.350> know

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
Intel but a lot of people don't know

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.500 
Intel but a lot of people don't know
what<00:00:15.529> hyper<00:00:15.770> threading<00:00:16.279> is<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.970> it<00:00:17.390> was<00:00:17.449> a

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
what hyper threading is and it was a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.109 
what hyper threading is and it was a
feature<00:00:17.779> that<00:00:17.930> was<00:00:18.140> on<00:00:18.850> processors<00:00:19.850> even

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
feature that was on processors even

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.279 
feature that was on processors even
before<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:20.600> i5<00:00:21.050> in<00:00:21.290> the<00:00:21.350> i7<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:23.570> way<00:00:23.690> I<00:00:23.720> like

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
before the i5 in the i7 the way I like

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.560 
before the i5 in the i7 the way I like
to<00:00:24.320> think<00:00:24.590> of<00:00:24.770> hyper<00:00:25.039> threading<00:00:25.670> is<00:00:25.880> the

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
to think of hyper threading is the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.130 
to think of hyper threading is the
ability<00:00:26.870> to<00:00:27.230> use<00:00:28.030> the<00:00:29.030> all<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:29.660> functions

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
ability to use the all of the functions

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.279 
ability to use the all of the functions
of<00:00:30.350> a<00:00:30.619> processor<00:00:31.190> at<00:00:31.280> the<00:00:31.400> same<00:00:31.610> time<00:00:32.110> we<00:00:33.110> often

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
of a processor at the same time we often

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.110 
of a processor at the same time we often
think<00:00:33.469> of<00:00:33.710> processors<00:00:34.399> in<00:00:34.550> terms<00:00:34.820> of<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
think of processors in terms of the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.779 
think of processors in terms of the
number<00:00:35.390> of<00:00:35.480> cores<00:00:35.809> they<00:00:36.170> have<00:00:36.440> but<00:00:36.949> their<00:00:37.280> sub

number of cores they have but their sub

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.049 
number of cores they have but their sub
cores<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.839> sub<00:00:39.499> instruction<00:00:40.339> sets<00:00:40.730> in

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
your belly and pat your head you can't

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.700 
your belly and pat your head you can't
mix<00:01:10.159> certain<00:01:10.700> types<00:01:10.969> of<00:01:11.180> processes<00:01:11.930> like<00:01:12.409> I

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
mix certain types of processes like I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.090 
mix certain types of processes like I
can't<00:01:13.399> play<00:01:13.700> piano<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.299> rub<00:01:14.990> my<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.590> Pat<00:01:15.890> my

can't play piano and rub my and Pat my

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.429 
can't play piano and rub my and Pat my
head<00:01:16.130> because<00:01:16.610> I<00:01:17.180> need<00:01:17.780> both<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.170> those

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
head because I need both of those

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.359 
head because I need both of those
resources<00:01:19.570> but<00:01:20.570> because<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:20.979> slicing<00:01:21.979> which

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
resources but because of slicing which

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.999 
resources but because of slicing which
is<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.000> ability<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.570> break<00:01:23.780> processes<00:01:24.560> up<00:01:24.770> or

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
is the ability to break processes up or

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.219 
is the ability to break processes up or
the<00:01:25.100> queue<00:01:25.430> of<00:01:25.729> processes<00:01:26.509> up<00:01:26.810> into<00:01:27.200> different

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
the queue of processes up into different

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.099 
the queue of processes up into different
things<00:01:28.180> hyper-threading<00:01:29.180> can<00:01:29.780> give<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.020> a

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
things hyper-threading can give you a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.889 
things hyper-threading can give you a
lot<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:31.240> extra<00:01:32.240> power<00:01:33.130> basically<00:01:34.130> for<00:01:34.399> free<00:01:34.899> if

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
lot of extra power basically for free if

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.260 
lot of extra power basically for free if
you've<00:01:36.140> got<00:01:36.170> something<00:01:36.590> like<00:01:37.270> antivirus

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
you've got something like antivirus

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.179 
you've got something like antivirus
running<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.810> background<00:01:38.960> most<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.100> what

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
running in the background most of what

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.209 
running in the background most of what
it's<00:01:40.369> doing<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:41.320> comparing<00:01:42.320> spots<00:01:42.890> on<00:01:43.100> the

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
it's doing is comparing spots on the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.560 
it's doing is comparing spots on the
hard<00:01:43.429> drive<00:01:43.640> against<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:45.490> library<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.640> known

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
hard drive against a library of known

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.080 
hard drive against a library of known
bad<00:01:48.049> things<00:01:48.850> that's<00:01:49.850> not<00:01:50.060> very

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
bad things that's not very

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.359 
bad things that's not very
computationally<00:01:50.749> intense<00:01:51.740> but<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.039> hard

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
computationally intense but it's hard

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.260 
computationally intense but it's hard
driving<00:01:52.850> tense<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:53.979> what<00:01:54.979> happens<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.999> says

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
driving tense so what happens is it says

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.639 
driving tense so what happens is it says
you<00:01:56.960> some<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.320> oh<00:01:57.520> but<00:01:58.659> don't<00:01:59.659> use<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.049> CPU

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
you some I oh but don't use the CPU

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.819 
you some I oh but don't use the CPU
because<00:02:00.979> I'm<00:02:01.100> playing<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.520> game<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.060> so

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
because I'm playing this game and so

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.200 
because I'm playing this game and so
basically<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:04.009> reads<00:02:04.249> from<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:04.759> hard<00:02:04.999> drive

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
basically the reads from the hard drive

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.320 
basically the reads from the hard drive
happened<00:02:06.079> when<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.380> game<00:02:06.619> has<00:02:07.069> spare<00:02:07.819> cycles

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
happened when the game has spare cycles

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.490 
happened when the game has spare cycles
for<00:02:08.539> whatever<00:02:08.810> reason<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:10.300> can<00:02:11.300> be<00:02:12.050> stacked

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
for whatever reason and can be stacked

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.190 
for whatever reason and can be stacked
so<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.040> your<00:02:13.190> better<00:02:13.640> optimized<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.840> using

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
so this your better optimized and using

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.030 
so this your better optimized and using
more<00:02:15.770> of<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.250> processor<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.940> you
