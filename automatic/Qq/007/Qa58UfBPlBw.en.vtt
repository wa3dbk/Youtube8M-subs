all<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> paper<00:02:29.790> has<00:02:30.500> good<00:02:31.500> contact

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
all down so the paper has good contact

00:02:32.160 --> 00:03:01.740 
all down so the paper has good contact
with<00:02:32.310> food<00:02:33.150> scraps

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.509 

where<00:03:02.050> I<00:03:02.080> took<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:02.500> lid<00:03:02.680> off<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:03.069> this<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.400> put

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
where I took the lid off of this and put

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.869 
where I took the lid off of this and put
the<00:03:03.640> gamma<00:03:03.849> lid<00:03:04.120> on<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:05.379> Chuck<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.040> trim

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
the gamma lid on I just Chuck and trim

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.949 
the gamma lid on I just Chuck and trim
the<00:03:07.030> edges<00:03:07.209> off<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.760> lid<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> little<00:03:10.090> bit<00:03:10.239> so

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
the edges off of the lid a little bit so

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.990 
the edges off of the lid a little bit so
that<00:03:10.989> lay<00:03:11.680> down<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.129> there<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.640> don't<00:03:12.700> have

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
that lay down in there and I don't have

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.550 
that lay down in there and I don't have
to<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:14.319> keep<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.310> air<00:03:15.519> out<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:18.180> really<00:03:19.560> when

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560

this<00:03:20.709> bucket<00:03:21.099> gets<00:03:21.310> full<00:03:23.580> when<00:03:24.580> this<00:03:24.670> bucket

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
this bucket gets full when this bucket

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.680 
this bucket gets full when this bucket
gets<00:03:25.299> filler<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:27.099> let<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.459> sit<00:03:27.819> for<00:03:28.150> two

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
gets filler and you let it sit for two

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.710 
gets filler and you let it sit for two

check on the liquid down at the bottom

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.949 
check on the liquid down at the bottom
because<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:39.849> don't<00:03:40.090> want<00:03:40.239> that<00:03:40.390> getting<00:03:40.720> too

awfully<00:03:54.160> bad<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.989> test<00:03:56.260> is<00:03:56.440> going<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.680> come

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
awfully bad the test is going to come

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.860 
awfully bad the test is going to come
when<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.190> get<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.519> bucketful<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.480> it's<00:03:58.629> it's

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
when I get this bucketful and it's it's

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.470 
when I get this bucketful and it's it's
two<00:03:59.079> weeks<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.680> then<00:04:00.340> we<00:04:00.370> get<00:04:00.609> it<00:04:00.760> out<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.150> put

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
two weeks and then we get it out and put

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.900 
two weeks and then we get it out and put
it<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.840> soil<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.880> is<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.510> Bokashi

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
it in the soil so that is the Bokashi

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.319 
it in the soil so that is the Bokashi
composting<00:04:07.560> next<00:04:08.560> step<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.549> as<00:04:09.910> soon<00:04:10.090> as<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.269> get

okay a little addendum on a blog site
called<00:04:26.800> paper<00:04:27.099> Bokashi<00:04:27.810> he<00:04:28.810> dries<00:04:29.229> his

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
called paper Bokashi he dries his

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.379 
called paper Bokashi he dries his
newspapers<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.400> course<00:04:30.610> he<00:04:30.700> does<00:04:30.910> his<00:04:31.120> whole<00:04:31.360> I

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
newspapers of course he does his whole I

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.969 
newspapers of course he does his whole I
did<00:04:31.750> my<00:04:31.870> shredded<00:04:32.200> I<00:04:32.410> don't<00:04:32.560> see<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:32.860> it

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
did my shredded I don't see that it

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.800 
did my shredded I don't see that it
makes<00:04:33.130> that<00:04:33.310> much<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.639> a<00:04:33.700> difference<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.780> I

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
makes that much of a difference so I

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.629 
makes that much of a difference so I
brought<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.169> bag<00:04:35.410> out<00:04:35.620> set<00:04:36.130> it<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.430> table

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
brought a bag out set it on the table

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.520 
brought a bag out set it on the table
and<00:04:36.849> kind<00:04:37.090> of<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.389> shredded<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.840> out<00:04:37.990> as<00:04:38.229> hot

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
and kind of just shredded it out as hot

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.930 
and kind of just shredded it out as hot
as<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.830> is<00:04:38.950> out<00:04:39.130> here<00:04:39.190> today<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.610> shouldn't

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
as it is out here today it shouldn't

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.900 
as it is out here today it shouldn't
take<00:04:40.000> any<00:04:40.240> time<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.539> dry<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.729> they'll<00:04:42.729> be

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
take any time to dry so they'll be

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.460 
take any time to dry so they'll be
easier<00:04:43.240> than<00:04:43.419> trying<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:44.050> keep<00:04:44.200> it<00:04:44.349> in<00:04:44.380> the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
easier than trying to keep it in the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.100 
easier than trying to keep it in the
refrigerator<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:46.270> I'll<00:04:46.479> come<00:04:46.660> out<00:04:46.780> here<00:04:47.020> every

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
refrigerator so I'll come out here every

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.800 
refrigerator so I'll come out here every
so<00:04:47.349> often<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.860> move<00:04:48.220> things<00:04:48.460> around<00:04:48.639> and<00:04:49.090> wait

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
so often and move things around and wait

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.240 
so often and move things around and wait
until<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.110> gets<00:04:50.200> good<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.590> dry<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:50.800> then<00:04:50.979> pack

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
until it gets good and dry and then pack

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.110 
until it gets good and dry and then pack
it<00:04:51.570> in<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.780> bags<00:04:52.990> again<00:04:53.260> so<00:04:53.979> that<00:04:54.520> that<00:04:54.880> will

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
it in the bags again so that that will
