00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
parents that we've not thought through

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819

yet that's going to come back and bite

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.340 
yet that's going to come back and bite
accessible<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:45.149> pair<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.960> could<00:00:46.140> say

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
accessible as pair up so I could say

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.779 
accessible as pair up so I could say
that<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.100> switch<00:00:47.340> over<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that and then they switch over to the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.130 
that and then they switch over to the
home<00:00:48.000> button<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> left<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.020> are<00:00:49.079> only

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
home button on the left there are only

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.779 
home button on the left there are only
two<00:00:49.410> buttons<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:50.309> i<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.670> really

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
two buttons which i think is really

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.330 
two buttons which i think is really
important<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.780> overload<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
important with it's not to overload it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.160 
important with it's not to overload it
and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.850> you've<00:00:53.969> got<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.090> touch<00:00:54.629> playback

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and then you've got one touch playback

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.430 
and then you've got one touch playback
so<00:00:55.649> they've<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> 1.4<00:00:56.820> sized<00:00:57.120> screen<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
so they've got a 1.4 sized screen and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.979 
so they've got a 1.4 sized screen and
then<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> does<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.160> photo<00:00:59.520> show<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.180> and
