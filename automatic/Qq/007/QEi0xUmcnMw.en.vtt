00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
expecting this when I when I opened up

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.920 
expecting this when I when I opened up
my<00:01:18.750> steam<00:01:19.290> account<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> public<00:01:20.850> now<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.750> a

my steam account to the public now but a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.080 
my steam account to the public now but a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
to me and that's really really good but

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
to me and that's really really good but
the<00:01:27.960> downside<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.040> now<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.610> more

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the downside to this is I now have more

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.109 
the downside to this is I now have more
games<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.290> play<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.880> near<00:01:33.030> future

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
games then I can play in the near future

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.929 
games then I can play in the near future
actually<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.770> guys<00:01:35.009> were<00:01:35.460> thinking<00:01:35.670> of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
actually so you guys were thinking of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.370 
actually so you guys were thinking of
buying<00:01:36.090> me<00:01:36.270> something<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.960> might<00:01:37.110> want<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
buying me something you might want to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
buying me something you might want to
think<00:01:37.500> twice<00:01:37.619> he<00:01:38.250> probably<00:01:38.820> better<00:01:39.270> off

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
think twice he probably better off

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
think twice he probably better off
saving<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:40.140> money<00:01:40.259> spending<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.340> something

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
saving your money spending on something

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.789 
saving your money spending on something
you<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> chance<00:01:43.590> at

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
you want because there is a chance at

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.219 
you want because there is a chance at
the<00:01:43.890> moment<00:01:44.369> any<00:01:44.549> game<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> buy<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.930> may<00:01:46.170> be

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the moment any game you buy me it may be

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
the moment any game you buy me it may be
months<00:01:46.619> before<00:01:47.009> i<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.820> even<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
