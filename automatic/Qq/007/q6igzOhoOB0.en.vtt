rushing me as a short guy trying to go

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.820 
rushing me as a short guy trying to go
up<00:00:43.520> top<00:00:43.760> I'm<00:00:44.660> simply<00:00:44.960> going<00:00:45.080> to<00:00:45.140> use<00:00:45.320> my<00:00:45.500> double

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
up top I'm simply going to use my double

jab<00:00:45.980> defensively<00:00:46.550> to<00:00:46.700> step<00:00:47.030> off<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:47.510> I<00:00:48.110> take

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
jab defensively to step off and I take

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.230 
jab defensively to step off and I take
one<00:00:48.560> step<00:00:48.800> backwards<00:00:49.100> that's<00:00:49.640> it<00:00:49.940> because<00:00:50.090> I

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
one step backwards that's it because I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.760 
one step backwards that's it because I
don't<00:00:50.300> want<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.660> get<00:00:50.810> second<00:00:51.170> step<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.500> let's

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
don't want to get second step so let's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.110 
don't want to get second step so let's
go<00:00:51.950> something<00:00:52.280> like<00:00:52.310> this<00:00:52.430> blue<00:00:52.820> for<00:00:53.030> your

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
go something like this blue for your

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:02.189 
go something like this blue for your
slow<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:57.290> then<00:00:57.440> we<00:00:57.530> resume<00:00:57.890> position

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.320 

now<00:01:02.710> if<00:01:03.039> I<00:01:03.219> one<00:01:03.429> finger<00:01:03.760> second<00:01:04.150> step

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
now if I one finger second step

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.170 
now if I one finger second step
backwards<00:01:04.900> I<00:01:05.229> would<00:01:06.130> step<00:01:06.369> to<00:01:06.520> my<00:01:06.640> left<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.150> my

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
backwards I would step to my left to my

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.090 
backwards I would step to my left to my
right<00:01:07.330> for<00:01:07.869> me<00:01:08.049> these<00:01:08.320> would<00:01:08.439> be<00:01:08.619> to<00:01:08.680> step<00:01:08.920> to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
right for me these would be to step to

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.940 
right for me these would be to step to
my<00:01:09.250> right<00:01:09.549> and<00:01:09.820> we'll<00:01:09.939> do<00:01:10.119> something<00:01:10.450> like

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
my right and we'll do something like

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
my right and we'll do something like
for<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.130> second<00:01:11.549> step<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.210> step<00:01:15.450> off<00:01:15.659> again

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
for my second step and I step off again

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.730 
for my second step and I step off again
I<00:01:18.200> step<00:01:19.200> off

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I step off

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.929 
I step off
I<00:01:20.390> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> pivot<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:22.020> left<00:01:22.350> off<00:01:23.310> my<00:01:23.580> second

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I want to pivot to my left off my second

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.580 
I want to pivot to my left off my second
double<00:01:24.149> jab<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.630> looks<00:01:24.930> something<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.229> this

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.139

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
even the left or right uppercut show you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.370 
even the left or right uppercut show you
again<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:41.189> board<00:01:41.460> goes<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:41.880> well<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.899> go<00:01:43.170> on

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
again the board goes as well or go on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
again the board goes as well or go on

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
mix it up if I know let's go for the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.529 
mix it up if I know let's go for the
head<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.380> use<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.789> my<00:01:47.789> second<00:01:48.119> double<00:01:48.330> jab

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
head I can use that my second double jab

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.690 
head I can use that my second double jab
the<00:01:49.229> job<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:49.679> a<00:01:49.710> lower<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.220> straight<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> the

the job got a lower go straight to the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.469 
the job got a lower go straight to the
bottom<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.330> it<00:01:51.390> looks<00:01:51.539> like<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:53.210> can<00:01:54.210> drop

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
the body is crucial when fighting sure

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.960 
the body is crucial when fighting sure
about<00:02:04.679> keeping<00:02:05.009> over<00:02:05.250> small<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.670> doesn't

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
about keeping over small it doesn't

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.650 
about keeping over small it doesn't

matter you can let that go over faster

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.130 
matter you can let that go over faster
done<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.850> can<00:02:15.030> mix<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.299> up<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.660> can

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
done and then I can mix it up I can

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.820 
done and then I can mix it up I can
pivot<00:02:16.320> off<00:02:16.560> first<00:02:16.859> and<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.310> step

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
pivot off first and I can step

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.930 
pivot off first and I can step
that's<00:02:18.070> really<00:02:18.220> right<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.550> body<00:02:23.700> almost<00:02:24.700> a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
that's really right to the body almost a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.530 
that's really right to the body almost a
beach

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.759 

that's<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.720> way<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.930> can<00:02:32.110> use<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> double<00:02:32.470> jab

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
that's the way you can use a double jab

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.210 
that's the way you can use a double jab
remember<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.190> double<00:02:33.370> jab<00:02:33.900> comes<00:02:34.900> out<00:02:35.220> comes

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
remember the double jab comes out comes

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.900 
remember the double jab comes out comes
back<00:02:36.340> halfway<00:02:37.410> step<00:02:38.410> back<00:02:38.680> then<00:02:39.010> go<00:02:39.250> ahead<00:02:39.430> or

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
back halfway step back then go ahead or

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.720 
back halfway step back then go ahead or
step<00:02:40.239> into<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.720> go<00:02:40.900> again<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.459> really

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
step into it go again you have to really

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.869 
step into it go again you have to really
fast<00:02:42.970> blow<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> from<00:02:43.840> here<00:02:44.250> here<00:02:45.250> twice<00:02:45.610> that's

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
fast blow it from here here twice that's

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.180 
fast blow it from here here twice that's
a<00:02:45.970> long<00:02:46.150> period<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.510> time<00:02:46.569> so<00:02:47.440> Polly<00:02:47.830> comes<00:02:48.069> on

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
a long period of time so Polly comes on

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.180 
a long period of time so Polly comes on
the<00:02:48.310> end<00:02:48.549> step<00:02:48.970> hop<00:02:49.239> great<00:02:49.510> let<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.319> go<00:02:50.470> from

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
the end step hop great let it go from

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.759 
the end step hop great let it go from
the<00:02:51.310> halfway<00:02:51.519> position<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:53.379> that's<00:02:53.500> some<00:02:53.739> of

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
the halfway position and that's some of

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.259 
the halfway position and that's some of
the<00:02:53.830> ways<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.160> go<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> jab<00:02:54.700> folks
