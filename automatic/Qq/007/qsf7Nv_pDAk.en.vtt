00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 do not 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.150
 and that just as there are bands of agents 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.889
 serums and subscribers of youtube I hope 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.990
 that they are having a great time and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.170
 well then in this video we will see 10 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.910
 Things you should know about ayo 7 and 1 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 reads as number 1 is what 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.090
 is the new interface of ayo 7 not like 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.400
 we all know the design has been redefined 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.680
 completely in 97 incorporating a 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.780
 minimalism that fills every corner 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.210
 of the new system and well then in the 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.760
 aspect that is simply great with 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.489
 a new typography much cleaner and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.230
 stylized fantastic new icons 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.780
 transparencies to be always in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
 context with our content and some 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.999
 animations that overflow with sympathy and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.249
 freshness and good because the orphism scrum 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.620
 has totally disappeared leaving 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.719
 to a new intuitive cleaner system 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 and more cheerful obviously and good at 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.170
 second place we have what is the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 control center this is completely 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.999
 new for us good give us new 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 For since in some clicks did the 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.299
 what does this control center do but 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.060
 Well this will already come so 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.190
 intuitive in what is our year 7 and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 well with that 7 comes one of the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.690
 more sounded by the headlights of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.460
 adwords control center from 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.080
 now some of the most adjustments 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.030
 used as what is wifi 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.070
 Bluetooth brightness the camera or the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.140
 lantern are available from 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.420
 any part of the system with just 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.910
 drag the finger from the part 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.520
 inferior and good in third place we have 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.650
 what is the new multitasking and good 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 then again there is or 7 has solved 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.970
 another of the most criticized points of the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 apple operating system multitasking 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.320
 now all applications can 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.230
 make use of it thus eliminating the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.850
 restriction imposed apple further 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.950
 has completely redesigned the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.410
 multitasking going on to show a system 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.900
 of cards with a preview of 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.729
 the application and well then from 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.979
 now will be our applications will be 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.380
 as simple as sliding any of 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.120
 these cards up and well then 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.220
 in fourth place we have what that 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.100
 fails and well then safari is also 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.630
 has completely redesigned incorporating 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.000
 finally the screen navigation 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.070
 complete and the unification of the bar 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.440
 search when we use safari in 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.960
 May 7 the browser detects 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.000
 when we slide some page and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.090
 automatically hides the top bar 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 and lower to see all the content 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.510
 also incorporates a new system of 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.970
 wheel shape loans much more 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.890
 visual and fast finally by touching 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.960
 over the search bar shows us 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.870
 our favorites and bookmarks for 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.880
 have quick access to them and good in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.010
 fifth place of new blocks the airbag 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.050
 and well, the air drop allows us 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.270
 share the content that we have in 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.250
 our iphone or ipad so much more 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.990
 quick and easy once we have 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.000
 selected the photographs that 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.120
 we want to share there are drugs we 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.040
 locate the closest contacts and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.900
 Well, they also have an agent 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.690
 road by of course obviously this goes 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.820
 to be this year 7 with them 7 since not 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.740
 It can not be done at 7 with her 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.010
 fell 6 does not have this feature 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.590
 of airsoft and well that will give us the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.360
 option to share with them that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.970
 he is super good and good in 6th place 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.160
 we have what is the camera and photos and 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.350
 well, the camera on 17 has 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.060
 different filters that can be added 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.910
 in real time so we can take 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.860
 every photograph of us 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.780
 the application interface is also 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.640
 has remodeled agree with the rest of the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.090
 system and now we can move 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.130
 between video other picture and photo 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.870
 panoramic sliding the diego the 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.820
 Photo application now allows 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.280
 organize all our catches of 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.680
 way much more orderly and efficient in 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.170
 mind at times and places and well then 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.180
 in seventh place we have well and good 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.340
 then the virtual assistant can now 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.100
 meet our requests with a 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.480
 male or female voice and well then to 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.000
 the time that there are new ones 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.370
 services and functions like tell us that 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.320
 go on twitter or turn off or on 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.960
 wifi the application interface 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.200
 also this is new and now it shows 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.580
 a sound wave if it's going to be 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.500
 completely completely redesigned 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.240
 great dry truth in the image 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.220
 what am I showing you next 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.350
 is super general as we can see the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.270
 design is super nice and good because in 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.220
 eighth place we have in what is itunes 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.020

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.540
 us and well the rumored so 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.280
 music service in 'streaming' 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.170
 apple has come from the hand 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.500
 the radio and good for the moment the service 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.690
 It is only available in the USA 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.880
 fortunately but at the moment and good 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.610
 Well, but once you export to the rest of 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.590
 countries we can have access to hundreds 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.110
 of thousands of stations depending on 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.780
 our musical tastes and well then 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.340
 we can also create our 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.740
 own music stations and 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.750
 share them with the rest of the world and 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.600
 Well, the best of all is about 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.060

 from now on our iphone or ipad 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.990
 will be a little bit more secure and someday 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.000
 we got to lose because when 7 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.190
 nobody will be able to access the content of this 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.740
 of your device without having your idea 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.050
 Well, and the password is incredible, 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.080
 something so simple has not had not been 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.479
 implemented before and good finally the 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.260

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.890
 will have certain limitations as per 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.410
 example on the iphone we will not be able to 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.090
