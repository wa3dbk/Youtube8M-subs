 responsible gaming at least in part 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.660
 of the originality of the experience of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.370
 endless bioshock game

 the combination of weapons and powers 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.730
 in fact for a whole series of 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.590
 particular offensive opportunities and 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.060
 fun to use leaving the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.310
 freedom for the player to choose how 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.020
 face every fight and are in charge of 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.670
 various type from the classic lightning that 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.110
 they shock the shock wave that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.940
 raises half from opponents 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.440
 passing through shields that absorb the blows 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.180
 enemies with the possession of the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.650
 opponents and much more 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.300
 to enrich a formula that up to here 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.850
 reproposes roughly the mechanics of 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.500
 plasmid on three lisabeth the girl 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.720
 it does not represent the classic supporting actor 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.880
 to protect but on the contrary takes the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.920
 role of support characters thank you 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.660
 his powers can indeed visit others 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.340
 reality taking away resources from 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.440
 launch yourself during clashes like 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.700
 ammunition or medical supplies 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.530
 also thanks to the splits 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.000
 dimensional present in the levels and in 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.620
 able to materialize according to 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.299
 our turret covers controls 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.580
 machine guns or other elements of the 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.350
 scenario the enemies will attack the number 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.790
 rather conspicuous from a certain point in 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.890
 forward accompanied by mini bosses 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.630
 somewhat difficult that they will require 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.940
 make the most of every resource a 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.200
 arrangement in and completed levels 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.180
 then rails will be present 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.310
 suspended to which one can hook 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.480
 to cover the distances short time is 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.370
 but definitely more fun 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.019
 exploit during the clashes for 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.940
 keep moving and make it like that 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.620
 life difficult for our enemies 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.510
 the belly of infinite bioshock is not 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.860
 always perfectly calibrated while i 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.989
 powers could have been more 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.610
 also some original and imaginative 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.590
 ideas like the Elizabeth itself or the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.930
 rails are not used throughout 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.910
 their potential, however, dominates the different ones 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 facets of the gaming system vi 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.310
 are some moments that each piece finds 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.200
 your own place 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.090
 exaltation the adrenaline rise to 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.920
 stars and the title in rational succeeds in 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.290
 expressing the best of oneself could be 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.610
 Opinion as compared to others 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.319
 there are no chapters in the series 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.670
 been true evolutions never seen the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.079
 gameplay so different from the mass 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.299
 of the shooters the feeling of 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.920
 freshness and novelty remains consistent 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.930
 there is then left a little dumbfounded 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.250
 role played by sundberg the hero 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.590
 volatile that towered in the 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.789
 spectacular presentation trailers 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.380

 tested version and that pc clearly 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.070
 higher than the console ones above all 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.810
 due to definitely more textures 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.030
