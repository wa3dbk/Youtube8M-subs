 according to my criteria this game has a score of 8 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.100
 his graphs were ruined by the exeso of 3d 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.219
 its playability is medium since it almost moves very slowly 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.799

 for me since it has excellent graphics and very good gameplay but 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.250
 what it grabs with taking out the boxes and their plot which was to go from a point to 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.890
