00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello girls how are you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.030
 today I asked a little differently I will 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.379
 to take a review of the lipsticks here is in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.959
 avon pencil is the line between this wave 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.480
 they call super court pencils 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.589
 are four colors and now'll show 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 you zoom each color and nawa a consumption 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.490
 more about yourself what I found you 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.499
 You want to know, you also keep watching. 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.800
 this video he hit the cruise was pink 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:34.680
 classic it is a rosinha very clear is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.719
 those shades that when you pass you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.140
 it gets a little pale then who to take 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.750
 watch out for some like not skin 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.649
 I think it does not even look legal anymore. 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.570
 I do not use that kind of rose much 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.140
 some girls commenting among the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.120
 blogs that they layer too much the skin 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.399
 on the menu with your that because I just 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.309
 exfoliate so well treated 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.620
 so the coverage was great, the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.830
 The second one I used was the one from Xique 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.360
 in bullet it is a very dark brown but 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.340
 on my lips and we do not notice the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.710
 difference because my lips of action 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.480
 more pulled to brown the tone is more 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 pulled by a street see is not so 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.730
 so I did not feel much 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.450
 difference but he gave a uniform is 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:25.020
 so I thought it 's a basic recipe 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.050
 does not change so much I loved it very discreet 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.750
 This perfect coral when I saw myself 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.720
 I thought it was a red son but 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.900
 he also attends an orange little in 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.160
 mouth he knows how much taste 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.410
 little red that was hot 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.420
 or because you have a fever 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.730
 although I talked about it because you traveled 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.090
 a lot then he gets this little red one 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.940
 so discreetly reminded me of the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.470
 I think it's benitez benefit 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.720
 which is the liquid that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.820
 it looks like an enamel you can spend so much 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.640
 on the lips and in the cheek and give a 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.320
 so much red very very beautiful I 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.450
 I liked the bill a lot 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.690
 the red striking own name says I 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.000
 I'm with him and he's so super super 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.220
 food is easy to pass 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.130
 I've used it all day and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.110
 it is both him and others the duration is 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.300
 Who is not nothing extraordinary? 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.680
 even though this line does not come from a 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.780
 long lasting is just the same sells 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.970
 The practicality of having a collapse 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.700
 put anywhere and it gives a 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.000
 little thing but only that red mark 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.030
 here it is very strong earth in our 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.210
 vermilion puts talking I used one day 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.160
 all and so start it retouch 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.110
 So how practical is it for me? 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.920
 bag that you touch when you 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.330
 want to 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.390
 something else that I also felt when 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.490
 I know it is that my lips get more 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.110
 is and does not get so heavy you know 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.510
 it does not look like you have a lipstick 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.880
 that sometimes some printing lipsticks 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.970
 It's a heavy thing or I 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.950
 bothering and this is not his stuff 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.160
 here is a plastic quino 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.709
 I think a lot of people do not know if 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.980
 ends up that the bar can point or not 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.230
 and may is you normally point 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.739
 that makeup pointer people have 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.840
 the part that is large from smallest 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.120
 You can use everything, yes, talking long. 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.440
 found on the comic books of oea and only 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.670
 from 1390 so look there and it is 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.380
 this girls 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.750
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.459
 video who liked the one enjoy 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.380
 so our channel if you do not explain 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.050
 yet because we're going to do that anymore 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.930
 like those from both patton reviews 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.799
 also recent enamel coming around 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:51.330
 The kiss until the cover was legal. 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:56.060
 great rain as it also attests one 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:02.660
 That you can not give testimony 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.660
 in the native mirror is everyone, right? 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:16.590
 At the end of December he is super into 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:16.590
 high now is not school enough
