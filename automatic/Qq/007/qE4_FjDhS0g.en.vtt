00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.440
 personal hello all right there again is 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.630
 she'll be talking about today march 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.730
 re 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.700
 many people have asked me to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.940
 make a video talking about reverse 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.740
 It's distance is how it's done 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.090
 I will need to do what he is doing. 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.949
 passing to you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.880
 I want to send a hug first 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.090
 to a person who asked me 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 myerson whistles the image an embrace of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.980
 good blood 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.410
 I want to send a hug too for flowers. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.600
 beautiful is the channel name is beautiful flowers 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 come there visit her 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.210
 ok so come're talking about 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 reverse gear confesses to reverse I 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.440
 I have to do it first. 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 let me give you a touch there 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.289
 a repair did not sing in shorts 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.359
 The Bermuda Adventure is with the knee. 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.539
 injured and half-leg and half -legged 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.790
 bike suffered a motorcycle accident and right 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.049
 then come back when it's over then 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.140
 I'm very comfortable. 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.299
 What do you do in this video for you? 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.170
 let's go then back to the first 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.740
 thing 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.049
 the traffic code says that the distance 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.070
 that we can walk in reverse 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.009
 is the minimum necessary to make a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.490
 maneuver so I can down a street 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.619
 all in reverse when there is no 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.170
 distance required for you 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.369
 make a move I have a money 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.290
 He says what I mean 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.110
 more behind than you are 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.439
 crazy is that you like to be a street 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.250
 whole in reverse gear not only with the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.450
 Okay, that does not exist, there's no such thing. 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.460
 business 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.200
 the detran does not allow it is 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.479
 completely wrong 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.320
 the time required at a distance 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.420
 necessary to make a maneuver 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.580
 Example, okay, I'll try to get in the car. 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.300
 even difficult 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.280
 how to demonstrate with you well 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.150
 I called the car 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.640
 I'm going to get the reverse right, I 'm tired, okay? 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.790
 before someone can singer without belt to 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.350
 all showing a check ok then ok 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.530
 the distance required to make a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.530
 new 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.349
 This is because I want to make the maneuver that 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.349
 such 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.360
 but it 's a solid business 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.740
 the note that I stopped here on the bend I 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.820
 realize that it is a curve then the 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.880
 observe how to do the following 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.520
 can come a vehicle should now and hit 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.960
 on the rear so do not reverse 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.900
 on a curve 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.100
 another thing what not to do let's go 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.100
 Suppose you want to go there? 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.810
 so what should not be done 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.270
 so you can not do it i 'm 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.710
 on a curve 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.710
 Let's say you want it back. 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.270
 even worse is you make regret 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.710
 and sometimes you do it because you look 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.990
 He sees a car there and looks at the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.510
 post back will try to make a maneuver 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.840
 in the vehicle in reverse 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.310
 MÃ¡rio's rock of certain can not because the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.310
 Brazilian will hit the post 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.320
 the right is 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.150
 well have to be very careful ok then 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.360
 said Alexandre 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.620
 how do I give reverse spends 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.520
 video on reverse 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.240
 Then the video is just that not 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.070
 gives a reverse curve does not make this 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.810
 maneuver near post 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.140
 because you do not know how to control the 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:51.990
 acceleration and does not have a pump at 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:55.630
 from view the rear goes straight on the pole 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.850
 distance to the minimum needed to 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.950
 a maneuver again 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.340
 I'm here next to the curve I want 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.900
 turn back 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.080
 I want to go there so what I want 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.080
 do 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.370
 chandra, I can turn back 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.440
 reverse gear 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:31.120
 Look, you can turn back the march. 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:35.270
 and I can look at the internal rearview mirror 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.770
 can and should only thing that can not is 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.700
 one hand is holding here in the 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.560
 right wheel and the other hand examines 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.020
 in the ride-on seat 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:51.220
 this can not and should be with both 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.220
 hands on the steering wheel toward the head 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.390
 looking back 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.780
 then this person 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.830
 I ran the distance I needed to 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.720
 I can do the maneuver here so that 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.720
 I could get out of the tub and now 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.849
 Okay, people, I hope I can take it. 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.580
 any doubts about the reverse 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:47.909
 ok minimum distance is your safety 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.789
 because it is already difficult to drive 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:51.720
 looking forward as looking more 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:55.440
 behind 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.629
 Okay, everything is taken care of very slowly. 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.849
 looking at the mirrors always a kiss 

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:01.849
 A hug until next Christmas.
