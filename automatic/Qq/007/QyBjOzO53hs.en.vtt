00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.430
 so welcome to the next 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.919
 player review still that one of the match 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.570
 houellebecq finally has a 1 80 eur vj 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.059
 rating doing 87 tempo 140 and 79 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.640
 46 o'clock working rescue fund agreed 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.350
 three stroke and took me as many 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.930
 60 km but also costs in three games 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.090
 given four gates and two templates 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.400
 In addition, thanks to the price rangers 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 not found in the first week 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.789
 that's why the video is really great 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.719
 very late that he already has one or two 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.340
 weeks out there and that's quasi 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.200
 knows the story is in the last 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.940
 hit him in the meantime with him 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.860
 not going off because of the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.440
 minimum immediate purchase price offer 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.090
 can he just does not want to leave and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.620
 the feature is just can not 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.780
 loose every review almost back 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.300
 reinhold capture is indeed 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 Just give it a try 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.420
 to what then 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.160
 houellebecq man of the match on the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 Place more for is in form reviewed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.840
 but really good and be one of the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 match the much better I have to say 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.660
 the best thing about him is definitely the one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.990
 conclusion with his right foot is that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.159
 a bombproof affair 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.540
 98 percent of the balls made so that a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.520
 but very sure the 16 high snaps 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 surplus power to even 85 so 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.020
 that even comes to me partially clear 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.100
 higher than the firepower makes the team 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.140
 definitely with the conclusion if he 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.610
 not precise on women or can 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.650
 just wants to shoot with the power of the Rhine 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.060
 Waal on and then go even more balls 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.470
 pure and he can do better with it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.210
 Longchance definitely make the goods 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.500
 not quite as good at first 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.659
 sustained increase in the end also 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.360
 quite well made so definitely also 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.890
 not impossible with him next 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.210
 positive form is definitely his 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.009
 dribble a bit skeptical 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.439
 because we want laws a bit 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.970
 Every now and then but there has me 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.500
 then he completely convinced 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.729
 partly with his three skills 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.329
 yes the best of it made what you 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.460
 can make 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.250
 has had great ball management in 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.509
 make one-on-one with him 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.159
 that was pretty good so first 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.450
 times in dribbling is in it then he is 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.299
 really hard to separate from the ball 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.890
 all or a really good one 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.329
 I can say that two-combat-leadership 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 So he does not let that easily 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.420
 losing weight is quite a good thing 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.280
 also play ball around the ball 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.690
 and then just yourself 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.619
 to make any actions by 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.890
 has run 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.530
 very high speed also with 87 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.950
 very fast and that helps her too 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.830
 in very many situations so there can 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.810
 not just positive points too 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.549
 Tempo really good that they talk in 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.400
 real situation easy if he 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.019
 Fast is a good dribbling 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.659
 and then not so easy from the forest 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.599
 so really very hard 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.920
 somehow get rid of the ball that is 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.659
 really easy with it just by 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.129
 to run and just graduate too 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.170
 then find it with him as I said before 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.180
 really very very strong so 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.620
 then a very good pass and is 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.940
 just had a super ball advantage 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.359
 the sharks work too 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.950
 because a bit split you know 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.420
 the sharks are working every now and then 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.790
 there is not so very far ahead 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 but rather the hanging tip but 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.640
 that's not negative because first of all awesome 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.959
 Walks when to a counter 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.970
 for example, that's what it's all about 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.659
 play because you can truly wonderful 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.209
 set scene 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.620
 but it has so slowly recited 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.540
 Attack is just a bit 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.890
 it does not even sag that way 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.239
 Of course, I would prefer to be negative 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.159
 It's easy to record in the front 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.840
 you can just go through the 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.160
 ball pass and that he then the ball 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.150
 distributed further and that was easy 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.519
 everything really very good second 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.900
 require three games done and that 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.500
 is simply a legitimate synonymous 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.400
 tactics was with houellebecq as 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.169
 Central striker plays to make such a 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.510
 Ball distributor Ball distributor to roll 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:34.370
 give if he can really too 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.419
 very very accurately addressed 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.950
 window contacts no problem with it me 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.019
 Part pass in scene 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.120
 So there's the next positive point 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.530
 and he is a really great one 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.049
 play stations in the air 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.489
 with 182 just neat pleasant 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.970
 great times a great leap and 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.160
 looking forward 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.379
 a very very high header precision 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.889
 So the end of 95 is really 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.199
 very very high 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.540
 and that we win even in the game 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.340
 relatively often battles in the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.470
 air and saw with his concession can 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.790
 meanwhile often easy easy 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.250
 press over the line 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.139
 and that's why very much there too 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.430
 accept a pleasant that the 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.019
 can flank formats and not so 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.280
 really in the complicated attack 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.349
 harmless negative points are at 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.169
 they really only three stars 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.150
 skates thus expelled from the train 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.739
 good and that would probably be the one 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.240
 humanity can no longer cope 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.699
 give my body even better than with 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.319
 him make one it still has the slightly 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.630
 players to come over and 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.910
 that's why year 34 I'll do it 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.979
 a bit annoying our record yes 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.590
 that already noticed the left foot was 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.720
 in phases, really the right one 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.720
 clearly inferior and one has thought 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.310
 so with the right really a force of 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.099
 type with left is already critical though 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.860
 I have to say that the guy was right 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.150
 heavily deformed directly the 97 why 97 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.400
 years into the mentioned negative 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.949
 Cheerful holds and the price 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.880
 Rangers is just as much as you have to 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.590
 wait for him first 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:05.199
 you spent so much money on him 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:07.120
 and now dont get that stupid but that 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.770
 It was from this player review I hope 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.060
 he liked it , he describes 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.770
 definitely in the comments 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.740
 as you factory man of the match, he received 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.650
 should have played him 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.490
 I was so good or he was like that 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.900
 and then I can write income 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.979
 So again , so all you will be up 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.449
 every case comes in shape and space 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.169
 castro probably also everything else 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.370
 in the comments 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.259
 and then I would have a 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.380
 wonderful day and say temporarily 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.380
 at least
