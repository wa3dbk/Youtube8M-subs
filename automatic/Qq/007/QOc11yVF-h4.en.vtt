lock toolbox tool box alarm tool box

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.150 
lock toolbox tool box alarm tool box
alarm<00:00:16.039> and<00:00:16.430> I<00:00:17.260> guess<00:00:18.260> it<00:00:18.380> makes<00:00:18.530> sense<00:00:18.770> is<00:00:19.010> it

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
alarm and I guess it makes sense is it

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.460 
alarm and I guess it makes sense is it
is<00:00:19.550> it<00:00:19.820> designed<00:00:20.150> just<00:00:20.660> for<00:00:20.810> toolboxes

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
is it designed just for toolboxes

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.140 
is it designed just for toolboxes
oh<00:00:21.500> it's<00:00:21.830> anything<00:00:22.070> you<00:00:22.220> want<00:00:22.490> that<00:00:22.700> is<00:00:22.910> can<00:00:23.090> be

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
oh it's anything you want that is can be

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.670 
oh it's anything you want that is can be
a<00:00:23.210> metal<00:00:23.450> surface<00:00:23.630> or<00:00:23.990> it<00:00:24.110> can<00:00:24.289> be<00:00:24.500> a

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
a metal surface or it can be a

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.660 
a metal surface or it can be a
nonmetallic<00:00:25.220> surface<00:00:25.850> so<00:00:26.690> a<00:00:27.490> generator<00:00:28.490> in

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
nonmetallic surface so a generator in

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.880 
nonmetallic surface so a generator in
the<00:00:28.760> back<00:00:28.940> or<00:00:29.470> basically<00:00:30.470> anything<00:00:30.740> that's

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
the back or basically anything that's

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.490 
the back or basically anything that's
magnetic<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:31.520> sticks<00:00:31.699> to<00:00:31.760> yes<00:00:32.149> and<00:00:32.449> so<00:00:32.989> how<00:00:33.470> is

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
magnetic and sticks to yes and so how is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.680 
magnetic and sticks to yes and so how is
it<00:00:33.620> triggered<00:00:33.980> by<00:00:34.700> this<00:00:34.760> fob<00:00:35.090> we<00:00:35.300> arm<00:00:35.510> and

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
it triggered by this fob we arm and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.040 
it triggered by this fob we arm and
disarm<00:00:35.810> it<00:00:36.170> was<00:00:36.829> it<00:00:36.950> arm<00:00:37.070> though<00:00:37.899> there's<00:00:38.899> no

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
disarm it was it arm though there's no

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.319 
disarm it was it arm though there's no
so<00:00:39.649> if<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:41.829> had<00:00:42.829> 100<00:00:43.280> decibel<00:00:43.640> alarm<00:00:43.670> hit<00:00:44.239> me

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
so if it had 100 decibel alarm hit me

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.680 
so if it had 100 decibel alarm hit me
again

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
again

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.490 
again
I<00:00:44.720> want<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:44.930> hear<00:00:45.020> what<00:00:45.110> hundred<00:00:45.350> decibels

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
I want to hear what hundred decibels

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.190 
I want to hear what hundred decibels
like<00:00:48.010> we've<00:00:49.010> established<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:50.210> it's<00:00:50.329> loud<00:00:50.540> all

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
like we've established it it's loud all

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.860 
like we've established it it's loud all
right<00:00:51.320> loud<00:00:51.469> enough<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:51.969> if<00:00:52.969> it's<00:00:53.180> attached<00:00:53.540> to

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
right loud enough so if it's attached to

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.680 
right loud enough so if it's attached to
anything<00:00:54.290> that<00:00:54.500> tilts<00:00:55.040> removes<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.820> it's

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
anything that tilts removes and it's

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.780 
anything that tilts removes and it's
tilted<00:00:57.050> removed<00:00:57.320> it's<00:00:57.770> tilted<00:00:58.160> tilting<00:00:58.579> shock

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
tilted removed it's tilted tilting shock

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.330 
tilted removed it's tilted tilting shock
sensor<00:00:59.180> tilting<00:00:59.840> shock<00:01:00.050> sensor<00:01:00.500> okay

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
sensor tilting shock sensor okay

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.100 
sensor tilting shock sensor okay
now<00:01:01.610> as<00:01:01.850> far<00:01:02.000> as<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.210> toolbox<00:01:02.570> itself<00:01:02.870> goes

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
now as far as the toolbox itself goes

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.259 
now as far as the toolbox itself goes
this<00:01:03.320> one<00:01:03.530> well<00:01:04.309> this<00:01:04.399> one<00:01:04.549> has<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> lock<00:01:04.909> on<00:01:05.089> it
