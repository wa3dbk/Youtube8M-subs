00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.039
 and 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.640
 let's start using a timer to 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.880
 the eyes that is a declarant is 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.590
 important if you are going to use pigments 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.190
 place a good primer so they can 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.680
 fix the pigments in the eyelid well 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.559
 the pigments are usually very volatile and 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.350
 very loose that are very different from a 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.080
 compact shadow then we need 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.670
 have a good foundation on the eyelid I'm going to 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.400
 take my first pigment this is from 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.090
 maybelline and I'm going to place it on the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.770
 capita see very little and then that is 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.620
 the trick girls so they are not 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.610
 stain the whole face put a little bit of 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.790
 pigment and tap it to remove 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.590
 the excess is super important that they do 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.440
 this so that when you put the brush 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.020
 Eyelid does not fall on the eyelid 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.570
 pigments on the skin staining them the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.759
 base or your concealer so I'm 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.420
 putting this bronze color first in 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.250
 all my concave look I'm going to place a 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.159
 little bit more emphasizing the part 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.439
 left 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.770
 giving a little bit more intensity to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.770
 little bit 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.730
 then I'm going to take a clean brush and 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.860
 I'm going to blur the top part of the 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.500
 eyebrow bone so there is a 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.540
 little bit more perfect and there I am 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.000
 placing a second layer but with a 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.580
 brush if you notice a little bit more 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.430
 pointy and a little more compact and 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.700
 this is going to give you a little more 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.890
 intensity to the external bird and the concave 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.230
 but we still use the same 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.320
 Color of the pigments tattoo 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.350
 of maybelline I will do exactly what 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.720
 same in the lower eyelid see without 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.420
 fears girls pass the brush in round 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.910
 see they go from bottom to top in 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.130
 round again and again 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.160
 then I'm going to take this sponge that is 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.200
 Wet or wet and I'm going to wet my brush 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.590
 and I'm going to take this brand pigment 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.690
 mack that is like a great baby color 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.570
 precious a little metallic and I'm going to 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.200
 place here in the part of the external view 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.390
 and slightly put it in the concave now 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.510
 I wet the brush because when I wet the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.120
 brush the pigment is more intense 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.360
 first intensifies the color of the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.670
 second fixed pigment better and third 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.620
 it has a longer duration and see 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.500
 making the same movement 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.049
 and there are the colors I will go back to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.030
 wet a brochita note this is a 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.310
 little girl of the brand knicks and I'm going to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.280
 take this pigment from the brand inglott 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.849
 it's a black with bright in look what 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.569
 precious and I'm going to intensify this area 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.780
 here the external line of the tabs 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.000
 see up and down only as to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.480
 give a little bit of intensity to this 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.489
 area we place with the wet shade as 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.790
 I tell them to intensify and then with 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:28.540
 this dry broach we are going to disperse that 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.440
 black shadow slightly by the concave and 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.100
 towards the external view 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.100
 and it stays that way 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.400
 I'm going to take this brand pigment 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.750
 mack that is this color is like a 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.880
 lovely lucuma color very cute this we 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.780
 gives a little bit of warmth in the part 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.290
 superior and we are going to place it here 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.510
 slightly not much but this is going to 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.640
 give a very rich transition color 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.819
 we are also going to put it on the eyelid 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.819
 lower 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.750
 and it will be like that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.640
 huge do not worry about this after 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.190
 we will polish everything for the end 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.650
 then I'm going to take this here, that 's a 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.200
 pigment brand inglott see this 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.500
 metallic color please is 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.510
 awesome very cute this color and 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.540
 now we are going to wet quite well 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.810
 our brush I will moisten the 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.360
 enough is a 239 of mac and once 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.430
 that is well wet we are going to place it 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.280
 in the pigment and the comedy we started it 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.620
 to apply on the mobile eyelid this we 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.419
 is going to give a little light 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.760
 amazing and how can you tell 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.370
 the pigments are not always metallic 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.490
 there are always matt pigments too 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.650
 they are the most common but there are and then I go 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.520
 to put this metal pop also in 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.180
 this area and also in the lacrimal 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.180
 look 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.590
 and then I'm going to do an outline 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:07.400
 delgadito that is a gel eyeliner 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.980
 then I'm going to check my tabs and I'm going to 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.030
 put also a mascara 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.770
 but then let's put some 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.840
 False eyelashes too as they can 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.220
 see the same pigments fall on the 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.160
 well girls and me that's why 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.620
 I recommend that when you work with 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.370
 pigments advance the base and the concealer 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.800
 the last ok for this to not stain 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.210
 I'm placing the false eyelash of 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.960
 amd 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.330
 maximum the truth and what we are going to do 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.520
 now he is corrector, look now is the 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.720
 time to place the corrector what 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.669
 polish well and this is the end they are going to 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.000
 see how everything is very polished and very 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.280
 clean look cute I love to work 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.020
 with pigments girls is a little 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.360
 complicated because they just have 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.880
 a lot fall but I hope that with these 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.400
 tips has helped us a little bit more 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.500
 I send a kiss I hope you like the video 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.830

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.830
 chao chao
