00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
thing worth it also is the one tweak

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.990 
thing worth it also is the one tweak
that<00:02:46.800> Apple<00:02:47.130> could<00:02:47.250> implement<00:02:47.580> without

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that Apple could implement without

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.060

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
making one change to it and it would be

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.010 
making one change to it and it would be
perfect<00:02:50.490> for<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.000> amount<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.420> does<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.840> runs

perfect for the amount it does it runs

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.170 
perfect for the amount it does it runs
