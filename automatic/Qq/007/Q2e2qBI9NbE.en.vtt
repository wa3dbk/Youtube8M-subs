see most Martha so today we are doing
the<00:00:21.840> transportation<00:00:22.710> pack<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.670> first<00:00:24.119> we

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the transportation pack and up first we

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.140 
the transportation pack and up first we
have<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.019> more<00:00:25.289> Pistons<00:00:25.769> mod<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.029> two

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
have the more Pistons mod now I like two

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.509 
have the more Pistons mod now I like two
more<00:00:27.240> fish<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.630> mod<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.859> right<00:00:29.160> here

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
more fish this mod and here right here

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.840 
more fish this mod and here right here
is<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.789> double<00:00:30.090> piston<00:00:30.390> which<00:00:31.140> extend<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
is the double piston which extend to the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.790 
is the double piston which extend to the
triple<00:00:33.180> piston<00:00:33.690> which<00:00:34.350> extends<00:00:35.309> 3<00:00:36.200> and<00:00:37.200> last

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
triple piston which extends 3 and last

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.350 
triple piston which extends 3 and last
but<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.100> least<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> quadruple

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
but not least we have the quadruple

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.479 
but not least we have the quadruple
piston<00:00:39.719> which<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.469> imagine<00:00:40.649> would

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
piston which as you can imagine would

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.660 
piston which as you can imagine would
extend<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:43.950> over<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
extend for so then over here we have the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790 
extend for so then over here we have the
ship<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.420> super<00:00:45.780> pissed<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> super

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
ship the super pissed now the super

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
ship the super pissed now the super
piston<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.430> normally<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.480> need<00:00:49.200> those

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
piston like normally you need those

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.000 
piston like normally you need those
blocks<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.199> words<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> lover<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
blocks on the words like the lover and a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.650 
blocks on the words like the lover and a
ladder<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:53.879> usually<00:00:54.030> break<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
ladder like they usually break on a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
ladder like they usually break on a
super<00:00:54.899> piston<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.680> activated<00:00:56.100> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
super piston so when you activated it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.340 
super piston so when you activated it
pushes<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.020> then<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
pushes up and then we have the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
pushes up and then we have the
gravitational<00:00:59.070> fiscal<00:00:59.370> now<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.390> flick

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
gravitational fiscal now when you flick

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
gravitational fiscal now when you flick
the<00:01:00.629> gravitational<00:01:01.469> piston<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.460> launches

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the gravitational piston it launches

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.820 
the gravitational piston it launches
like<00:01:03.059> Santa's<00:01:03.870> affected<00:01:04.229> by<00:01:04.320> gravity<00:01:04.379> wants

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
like Santa's affected by gravity wants

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.399 
like Santa's affected by gravity wants
to<00:01:04.979> sand<00:01:05.309> into<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> air<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.930> one's<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.200> fun

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
to sand into the air so that one's a fun

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
to sand into the air so that one's a fun
one<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.740> also<00:01:07.770> flings<00:01:08.400> mobs<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.119> player<00:01:09.330> so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
one it also flings mobs and player so

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.380 
one it also flings mobs and player so
that's<00:01:10.229> actually<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:11.040> cool<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.150> over

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that's actually really cool one and over

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.640 
that's actually really cool one and over
here<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.750> doing<00:01:12.960> some<00:01:13.110> testing<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> see

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
here I was doing some testing to see

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
here I was doing some testing to see
what<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.220> these<00:01:14.430> Christians<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
what I can do with these Christians and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
what I can do with these Christians and
I<00:01:15.090> made<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.659> door<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.530> could<00:01:16.680> probably<00:01:16.890> make

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
I made a door you could probably make

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.490 
I made a door you could probably make
bigger<00:01:17.310> doors<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:19.020> kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
bigger doors of this this kind of what I

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
bigger doors of this this kind of what I
made<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.890> far<00:01:20.100> basically<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.060> quadruple

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
made so far basically just quadruple

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
made so far basically just quadruple
Pistons<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> bag<00:01:22.409> pushing<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.189> wall

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
Pistons at the bag pushing up a wall

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.070 
Pistons at the bag pushing up a wall
forward<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.390> down<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> hallways

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
forward and you can go down the hallways

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.710 
forward and you can go down the hallways
here<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.740> either<00:01:25.860> side<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:27.509> over<00:01:27.689> here

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
here on either side and then over here

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.490 
here on either side and then over here
kinda<00:01:28.380> did<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.890> school<00:01:29.220> stand<00:01:30.090> thing<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:31.259> if

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
kinda did the school stand thing here if

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.990 
kinda did the school stand thing here if
you're<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.680> legging<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.280> much<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> goes<00:01:32.850> in

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you're not legging that much it goes in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.370 
you're not legging that much it goes in
a<00:01:33.060> row<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.780> reason<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.259> was

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a row but for some reason it was

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.359 
a row but for some reason it was
glitching<00:01:35.150> don't<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.329> why<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.159> over

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
glitching don't know why and then over

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.330 
glitching don't know why and then over
here<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.930> Yogscast<00:01:40.500> did<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.159> kinda

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
here I the Yogscast did this and I kinda

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.090 
here I the Yogscast did this and I kinda
just<00:01:41.579> wanted<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> test<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.890> kind

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
just wanted to test this but it's kind

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.090 
just wanted to test this but it's kind
of<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.600> bouncy<00:01:45.600> pad<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> bunch<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
of like a bouncy pad with a bunch of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
of like a bouncy pad with a bunch of
gravitational<00:01:47.640> pistons<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.270> works<00:01:48.509> best<00:01:48.840> on

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
gravitational pistons in a works best on

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
gravitational pistons in a works best on
iron<00:01:49.530> golems<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.310> I'll<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.880> an<00:01:51.030> iron

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
iron golems so I'll just make an iron

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:01.560 
iron golems so I'll just make an iron
golem<00:01:51.420> right<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.210> yeah
