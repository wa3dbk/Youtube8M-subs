pixel<00:06:09.060> density<00:06:09.539> might<00:06:09.870> not<00:06:10.139> impress<00:06:10.710> though

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
pixel density might not impress though

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.740 
pixel density might not impress though
just<00:06:11.460> because<00:06:11.819> of<00:06:12.029> your<00:06:12.150> VGA<00:06:12.599> display<00:06:14.509> it<00:06:15.509> may
