00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.370
 hey people welcome to my video 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.210
 diary to my preparation on the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.460
 lines ram 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.290
 now it is just under two weeks 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.830
 So yesterday it was exactly two weeks to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.900
 to the fight 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.880
 unfortunately I am still a bit 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.720
 affected by my bruise am 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 thigh 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 I ran after yesterday again 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.670
 80 kilometers approximately but pretty much 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.160
 painful in the thigh, too 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 That's why I stopped 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.630
 I have the whole thing again with one 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.360
 app tested measured 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.460
 This time, I once again runtastic 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 used because that's the best one 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.969
 somehow you have found yourself and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.370
 yes , I measured that in 52 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.629
 minutes 8 miles and 57 miles 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.649
 thereby made 92 height meters 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.480
 average speeds were 99 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.449
 km / h 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.699
 then i still have sports tracker 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.290
 I used a new app 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.360
 I've tried it recently 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.280
 but forget about starting so completely 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.909
 does not work this time it has 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.619
 is working 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 the results are a bit 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.090
 so weird also shows a bit 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.860
 other results than runtastic 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.520
 example is displayed to me is mine 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.530
 top speed were 31 km h and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.140
 I'm not really sprinting 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.570
 somehow on the track or I am 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.610
 Run a little bit steady with somehow 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.180
 I think about ten cameras between 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.299
 that, for example, weird value and yes 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 the time me also 200 meters closer than 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.579
 fantastic at and generally also one 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.740
 a little bit confusing because of that 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:47.070
 I would not necessarily like you now 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.930
 call favorit but yes runtastic 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.409
 still the best app i find 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.579
 until now 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.439
 I will continue to do so 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.790
 use to eat my runs because 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.500
 The thigh yesterday really 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.729
 I was really hurt 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.469
 not run around me today 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.880
 to regenerate a bit only 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.110
 I did a bit of course training 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.899
 made things where it did not hurt so much 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.510
 has a spring and a bit 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.740
 half hour about here 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.290
 back home on the hometrainer 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.640
 bike driven around anyway know what 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.590
 for the endurance though I do 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.940
 could not walk 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.770
 and tomorrow I will be new again 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.260
 start and see if it will 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.700
 again without pain I work 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.650
 Hope your training is better 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.570
 and you did not hurt yourself and 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.340
 knows how to work hard for the next day 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.360
 Iran if she joins us or 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.560
 general condition to improve 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.270
 if you like the video anyway 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.160
 although I do not really have anything 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.810
 that's why they go up there 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.700
 Who else has any questions? 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.050
 write it in the comments I will 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.000
 Try it out the next time 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.440
 is a well-run therefore a 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.900
 small camera I am s.der chest 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.640
 attach and also try one 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.800
 incorporate some obstacles in my 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.010
 and see if it somehow 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.510
 hinders the camera or not and if 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.790
 then everything will go well then I will 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.709
 probably also when hiking itself 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.900
 wear and run my whole with it 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.540
 So missing if I'm interested 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.820
 would next time again a resp 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.500
 goes on main channel and watched videos 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.850
 otherwise I wish you much fun 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.970
 while exercising and see you at 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.970
 next
