00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.460
 and 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.090
 and well hello to all and cyril we get 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.340
 found today dia for the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.470
 second episode of the series the half 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.500
 god is with us I have listened to you 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.640
 gesture and the euro to make for 450 credit 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.200
 and vorm that's it too and ingame remains 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.649
 a little story to have a bit of 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.920
 collective 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.410
 the main goal already is to have 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.970
 the fastest a collective to 100 of the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.010
 unless we get closer 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.210
 we will start with a very first 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.700
 match the guys in the face dream game 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.520
 to a fairly easy team frankly 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.990
 all in all a team who me who 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.670
 did not really scare me too much 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.100
 I was just a little afraid of the five 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.050
 defenders it's true but otherwise it's 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.540
 a team not bad except that I have a 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.130
 team at 77.2 collective so that's where 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.960
 that the problem will arise 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.610
 I will have to compete against 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.610
 divisional teams 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.170
 this is including with teams at his 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.360
 collective passing my opponent 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.570
 opens the scoring in the second minute of 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.009
 Thu 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.030
 you will see that during my three 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.009
 matches that I will do during this 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.830
 episode I want to stay a lot of goals 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.930
 quite quickly palacio along the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.610
 line palacio in speed palacio he goes 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.970
 center for the bolt head the ten who 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.700
 score two goals at 0 22nd it was not 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.690
 I really did not play 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.250
 this team did not scare me 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.760
 but especially Jallet had of 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.380
 collective 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.479
 alas did everything but when when when 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.040
 we are pissed robin van persie of kind 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.420
 he will dribble three four players there 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.729
 will hit and only scored as soon 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.080
 the commitment van persie assign too much 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.190
 four players simply a 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.860
 big outside strike left foot 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.710
 little net right and half time we 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.540
 has two nozzles to one is led even if he has 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.799
 been a little in our favor here in Geneva 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.680
 the name environment valves 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.380
 unpronounceable 26 then launch their 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.240
 deep affair and radiating 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.430
 stop it but this union will push 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.320
 with van persie van persie when he is 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.390
 in the surface only if he is hebei 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.340
 mark that's just tip 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.689
 persie is really the place 2 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.220
 million happily he's there I 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.470
 really count on him on this series 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.439
 it is he who will bring me we saw the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.239
 more points that's for sure end of time 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.950
 there is no 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.989
 progression because we are in division so 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.720
 draw is to be knowing that I have 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.920
 a team at 60 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.160
 ten goals I believe a little bit at the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.560
 60th I do not know how hard it'll be 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.150
 to be very very very very hard so he goes 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.710
 must really hang on 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.420
 first episodes were pretty 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.080
 difficult unfair one can pass from 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.270
 good teams 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.370
 especially I'll have to get to 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.720
 faster to faster at 102 collective 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.700
 story to compete anyway what 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.860
 the collective is really difficult 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.150
 by the way here I did a little 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.260
 match I won a little over 500 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.970
 credits I bought myself mathieu 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.500
 homo flamini ground for that door 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.970
 collective a little to everyone 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.830
 you will see that he is going to be really 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.990
 really decisive the second match on 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.910
 play at home it's perfect I 82 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.370
 collective now and I was falling face 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.760
 a team like the mother a team in 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.470
 site simply at 80 from 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.160
 collective but there is still a lot 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.200
 of bronze 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.670
 we start from the beginning of the 3rd 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.350
 minute of his valves that will be called van 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.030
 persie and van persie the volley 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.610
 under the crossbar 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.050
 thank you thank you very much thank you robin van 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.650
 happily he's here 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.490
 the addition would have looked he scored 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.840
 I know more how much purpose to I you 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.640
 might do that for next episode 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.600
 puts in really scoring a lot of purpose 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.820
 very important goals 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.019
 at the same time we lead 1-0 to 52e van 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.820
 persie in the surface relationship that is going 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.560
 dribble tyrant and surface and who is going 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.140
 to move art frankly I had 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.370
 believed that having a penalty is a bit 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.470
 litigious in support of passing 69th my 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.970
 central defender who is basic 1 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.850
 defense place takes a second 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.070
 yellow card in red card at the 70th 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.200
 here we are led we lead 1-0 played at 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.970
 10 against May 11 but van persie passes 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.830
 always so powerful that he will 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.140
 score a small goal quietly there 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.250
 avoid the exit of the guardian frankly 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.380
 van persie who will be really 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.420
 the key element of this series 1 I hope 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.670
 we want what will bring me to 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.220
 the division quite easily so 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.110
 victory to whom a little bit a pain that that 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.130
 it's a bit difficult as we played 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.380
 ten for more than 20 minutes 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.299
 although still well released thank you 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.030
 man of match 1 it's quite 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.310
 logic is waiting 70 years credit here and I 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.440
 I told myself empty a little third 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.470
 ensures his life the video will be a little 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.790
 too short so first victory in 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.360
 this end first victory in this 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.660
 vision 10 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.500
 I bought manga mbiwa to bring a 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.390
 little more of the collective 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.060
 story of strengthening this team on 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.770
 now love to 86 of the collective ago 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.270
 alas alas 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.410
 there is I leave you a moment 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.259
 of attention look at the screen at this 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:48.039
 now we're going to have the guys face a 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:50.440
 team that will cause me a lot of 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.150
 problems I could do it on 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.840
 my account and easily manage me in 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.520
 division 1 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.680
 you'll see guys this is a 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.599
 extraordinary team I will play well 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.490
 safe at home against paris currencies 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.590
 saint germain have already announced the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.319
 color announces credits and lega 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.340
 his sick teams a team of 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:12.180
 series with a balotelli boussens tevez 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.190
 native india and an asif basta 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.560
 Successive I believe may have life 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.569
 in short, a marchisio invites to a defense 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.849
 asks a very very difficult team 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.520
 alas from the second minute of play it's good 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.830
 sure I do not know who that is barzagli 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.849
 in these clinics that marks from the 3rd 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.500
 or play on a corner we knew 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.409
 difficult we will take the water from the 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.460
 start here at the 9th the resumption of valves 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.440
 I do not know what his name is 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.909
 it's easier to go to heaven and 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.419
 the 23rd lega 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:42.370
 here is this past balotelli that opens 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.870
 his own meter 2 to 0 and see the 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.370
 guy who will do all the time all the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.740
 time deep debate like this 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.650
 have a chance to do that it's going to happen 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.069
 and di natale and that puts the 30 before the 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.289
 half time 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.060
 it's a frankly cut off 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.169
 I will take risks after the 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.060
 reprise 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.860
 I take notes as fast 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.539
 but when you have a problem who is who is 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.279
 this is robin van persie who we 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.889
 raise a little in the game quickly 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.779
 as soon as the second door is taken 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.650
 the 48th thank you van persie who makes us 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.360
 return 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.890
 of firm foot in this match we have when 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.870
 even put 40 minutes to go in and that's 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.430
 far from being finished by holding power 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.040
 beauty who marks what booty I was 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.360
 really disgusted I do not want to 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.280
 success but hey I was really 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.010
 angry and the small mistake of his defense 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.170
 either where my striker van van grieken 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.550
 so his pals who decides is going 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.200
 mark he has a van again 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.370
 persie recovers a round ball persie 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.170
 who was born a base said van persie in 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.240
 power and one goes persie who scored 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.150
 so the least important of the 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.560
 video of the third match 4-3 in the 76th and 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.020
 I'm going to play everything for the 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.310
 mark and there a little coffee a little 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.720
 coffee age but they only have shares 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.550
 and actions these unique family flames 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.830
 who is hitting it is against family there she 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.930
 art struck the mother and idealization the 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.600
 guys and equalization in the 90th 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.550
 but he script went through there and my 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 opponent will prevail 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.680
 unfortunately to the 81 19 years old we 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.880
 could say one of two goals of 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.030
 additional time it's the 99th 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.140
