00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.859
 very well we are seeing the alignment 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 who is driving for this Wednesday 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:11.730
 in the trial with European is not necessary 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.610
 there is talk that ochoa will play 45 and 45 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.130
 for now not though there was 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 also the other tendency that they would be 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.510
 the 90s finally to crown and to the local or 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.210
 not for guillermo ochoa I think playing 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.910
 90 here we are not going to anything 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.830
 relevant what Andrew saved good is 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.990
 the position in which Miguel wants it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.890
 herrera and so said it already three save the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.690
 mixed zone I love myself I come to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.790
 look for a position I already said to create 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 de rafa are looking for substitutes 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.520
 any 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 I see still very much above miguel 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.370
 layún de andrés saved for the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.350
 serious lane position 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.000
 the natural profile of saved does 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
 attractive and a current guy in europe 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.370
 is not to throw yourself in there you can trace 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.430
 a right player to do especially 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.950
 for the matches you have to score 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.570
 and in the scoring equation I think that 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.730
 can take advantage to saved 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.510
 that is the ability to mark not at 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:14.850
 setback but I do not work in his vocation 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.890
 what happens is that tomorrow has saved 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.930
 throw the foundations of the side 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 Galician masters is because he has not 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.330
 operated from lateral and says now that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:29.070
 you feel better in this position the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.290
 Miguel himself can put the cross to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.420
 several European footballers for the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.610
 position of not being required be I 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.770
 for example I do not see running in the cup of 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:46.320
 tomorrow world will have to be exceptional 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:50.100
 his acting as well is difficult 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.020
 because the meeting here by regular to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.910
 this of herrera above here not 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 because hector herrera on the line of 4 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.840
 the decade he left and left 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.130
 zavala in contention 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.080
 left can play without any 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.580
 problem either in 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.090
 this middle field that handles with black 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.179
 medina 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.369
 and hector herrera and leaves on the bench 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.929
 gullit I think it's one of those that has 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.910
 a place insured and that's why it leaves 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.910
 outside to see the others 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.400
 because he sacrifices chapo by sending him 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.810
 for the cost of the left so that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.129
 Herrera occupies that position by right 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.000
 because on the left he always plays at 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.430
 goal and rock 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.920
 but it will not be medina angle mounts and for 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.510
 that but I do not lose right by 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.489
 left exactly and in the middle of 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.049
 they go black medina here yes mounts 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.180
 I think that that is the one that is going to 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.260
 be when the position with both herrera 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.630
 as with him 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.190
 because it is the world of the homeless world 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.130
 having is feeling can do 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.170
 activities double the owner of the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.390
 interior is the eye that must be put 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.220
 a lot of tension in the three of the bottom I 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 I think that is glimpsed for which 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.319
 could be the titular defense of the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.269
 Mexican team with him with hector 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.069
 Moreno with Diego Reyes and with Rafael 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.780
 marquez would falter we would give to see 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.780
 how this one came king to weak galeano 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.820
 you have to see it now the situation is that 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.620
 here is making a switch miguel 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.720
 herrera because a tan is going to put 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.730
 mark for left and diego kings what 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.980
 he's going to score he's going to score by right 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.720
 diego in america on the scoreboard by 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.600
 left and that marker position by 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.860
 The Masagro Mores has left 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.630
 I believe that the hierarchy is respected 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.630
 of colors is above the no 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.610
 I think it happens there we can say 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.959
 that they are or kings ways kings do not have 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.850
 So much trouble is the same for left or 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.830
 right is a technical name has 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.380
 very much the containment magazine then 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.880
 it does not hurt the three 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.950
 Central do not know how to play well with the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.709
 ball have the three lefties swarthy and 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.140
 sea ​​that have long strokes kings is the 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.570
 that can be thrown from time to time 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.940
 create the line and the only thing that I see 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.900
 there is nothing else about Paul aguilar he is going 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.180
 to be the owner of the selection 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.650
 Mexican but I still can not find a 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.140
 substitute for paul's position 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.580
 aguilar is going to approve rogelio chávez in 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.200
 the game against the united states 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.480
 It seems to me that this call is very 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.459
 sung like that rogelio could reach the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.080
 world cup but to paul aguilar me 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:17.260
 it seems that you need to find 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:19.269
 they take your breath away that you saved 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.580
 to go to the World Cup with those 3 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.530
 it covers two positions just because 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.060
 everything is saved and from the process 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.710
 previous remember that by right not 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:39.730
 have found or have been tested and 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:43.320
 try but I see myself more rogelio chávez 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.320
 really to get there
