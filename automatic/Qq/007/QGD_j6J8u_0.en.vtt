 bc sowing for activity friends 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.669
 pleasantly surprised by your position 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:13.839
 some comments 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.070
 thoughts are produced and made it a lot 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.679
 think Mary Andriyash wrote not 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.669
 what brand when your home and family will 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:22.840
 surrounded by opponents with 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 weapons significantly explain what you don't 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.539
 is right 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.669
 for now the state in which will be just 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.490
 live 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.240
 and that you have nothing to do with those who 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.640
 takes for resurrection there 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.250
 at the top of the questions that I am of course 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.440
 thought about which intentionally did not 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.520
 affect the first release 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.380
 unconditionally if I get cornered 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.500
 I will seek 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.100
 certainly if I attack my house 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.490
 I will not defend 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.660
 if on a similar city 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.080
 to my country 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.540
 Yes, it seems to work from 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.190
 fatness is another thing that maria times 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.890
 changing and primitive in arms already 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.520
 no one is attacked freely if and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060
 happens only in those countries where if 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.060
 there is no and there is no democracy, but we have no oil like 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.010
 Akimova again democracy 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370
 so it's a dream but it's unlikely that how 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.200
 500 years ago the goal is to get our 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.990
 wealth the Turks will attack us we and 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.790
 so regularly listed part 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.550
 our profit 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.270
 buying their fruits and vegetables 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.570
 dressed as values 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.970
 relax and resorts 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.130
 so absolutely without bloodshed we 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.010
 regularly deduct money Germany 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.110
 Japan for cars in a career for household 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.080
 usa technique for fast food soda 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 blockbuster 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.700
 the most dangerous soldiers now looks not 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 So 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.140
 weapons are new PR technologies 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.310
 campaigns it need to invest 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.450
 army 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.119
 In my opinion such a country as it could 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.200
 no need to do 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.350
 another thing 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.299
 it would be better if the young guys were taught how 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.369
 emergency action 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.780
 situations and save the lives of victims 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.600
 It turns out to be much more necessary than the military 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.830
 mastery

 Oleg wrote a word 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.519

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.599

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.459
 roof over your head until it reached 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.519
 at least some action from the field and 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.329
 how after that 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.120

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:43.339
 paid 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.379
 Soviet time yes the state gave 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.769
 citizen more but the ratio 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.319
 earned cash received was 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.329
 much more 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.739
 now the state takes less and 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.540
 gives less 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.609
 but those services that 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.569
 still remain free 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.900
 also paid by us from our own 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.409

 foreign music even our want 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.339
 so that the ratio was 50 to 50 but that's 

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:37.309
 the result of globalization every

 be realistic 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.770
 in two hundred years we will all be one nation 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.900
 and we will speak the same language 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.420

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.440
 such thoughts 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.440
 it is premature 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:34.629
 I quote without a bill to argue with an idiot 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.339
 maybe only an idiot for some reason I think that 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:38.710
 its keyboard is social 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.259
 competition is stupid by definition 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.330
 and taking off and

 if serious 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.550
 I'm very happy, but I'm not a patriot separately
