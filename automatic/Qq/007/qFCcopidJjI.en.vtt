welcome<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.099> hard<00:00:08.280> science<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> show<00:00:08.820> where

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
welcome to hard science the show where

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.040 
welcome to hard science the show where
we<00:00:09.000> use<00:00:09.179> just<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.450> little<00:00:09.630> bit<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.809> knowledge

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
we use just a little bit of knowledge

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.749 
we use just a little bit of knowledge
about<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.500> world<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.920> bend<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.429> our<00:00:11.550> whim

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
about the world to bend it to our whim

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.879 
about the world to bend it to our whim
I'm<00:00:12.000> Anthony<00:00:12.300> I'm<00:00:12.660> Tara<00:00:12.990> Tara<00:00:13.320> have<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.650> ever

I'm Anthony I'm Tara Tara have you ever

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.279 
I'm Anthony I'm Tara Tara have you ever
considered<00:00:14.160> all<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.150> different<00:00:15.509> ways<00:00:15.690> we

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
considered all of the different ways we

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.160 
considered all of the different ways we
get<00:00:16.470> light<00:00:16.890> yes<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:18.240> now<00:00:18.480> right<00:00:18.810> after<00:00:19.080> you

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
get light yes just now right after you

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.170 
get light yes just now right after you
asked<00:00:19.320> me<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.470> question<00:00:19.590> okay<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.580> let's<00:00:21.060> go

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
asked me that question okay so let's go

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.950 
asked me that question okay so let's go
through<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.390> couple<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.689> them<00:00:21.779> there's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
through a couple of them there's

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.630 
through a couple of them there's
bioluminescence<00:00:22.769> about<00:00:22.949> fireflies<00:00:23.400> yeah

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
bioluminescence about fireflies yeah

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.880 
bioluminescence about fireflies yeah
father's<00:00:24.240> incandescent<00:00:24.840> light<00:00:25.410> bulbs

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
father's incandescent light bulbs

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.700 
father's incandescent light bulbs
there's<00:00:26.099> phosphorescence<00:00:27.019> CRT<00:00:28.019> monitors<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
there's phosphorescence CRT monitors and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.209 
there's phosphorescence CRT monitors and
my<00:00:29.550> favorite<00:00:30.140> chemiluminescence<00:00:31.219> caustics

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
my favorite chemiluminescence caustics

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.880 
my favorite chemiluminescence caustics
and<00:00:32.489> since<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.149> our<00:00:33.270> favorite<00:00:33.739> we<00:00:34.739> should

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and since it's our favorite we should

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.319 
and since it's our favorite we should
show<00:00:35.070> off<00:00:35.219> how<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> works<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.149> big

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
show off how it works in a really big

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.670 
show off how it works in a really big
way<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.239> first<00:00:42.450> glow<00:00:42.629> sticks<00:00:42.960> were<00:00:43.170> patented

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
way the first glow sticks were patented

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.970 
way the first glow sticks were patented
by<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> US<00:00:44.250> Navy<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> 1970s<00:00:45.780> as

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
by the US Navy in the 1970s as

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.950 
by the US Navy in the 1970s as
chemiluminescent<00:00:46.980> signaling<00:00:47.610> devices

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
chemiluminescent signaling devices

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.790 
chemiluminescent signaling devices
chemiluminescence<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.379> chemical

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
chemiluminescence is the chemical

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
chemiluminescence is the chemical
reaction<00:00:50.190> between<00:00:50.309> two<00:00:50.760> substances<00:00:51.449> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
reaction between two substances that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
reaction between two substances that
gives<00:00:51.989> off<00:00:52.199> light<00:00:52.410> without<00:00:53.399> using<00:00:53.850> any<00:00:54.030> heat

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
gives off light without using any heat

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.930 
gives off light without using any heat
in<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.989> case<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:55.800> substances<00:00:56.250> are<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
in this case the two substances are the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.599 
in this case the two substances are the
hydrogen<00:00:57.510> peroxide<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.350> emulsifier<00:00:58.949> inside

hear when you crack a glow stick is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.410 
hear when you crack a glow stick is
actually<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.799> glass<00:01:11.040> violent<00:01:11.640> side<00:01:11.820> breaking

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
actually the glass violent side breaking

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.910 
actually the glass violent side breaking
which<00:01:12.750> releases<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> dec<00:01:13.500> phenyl<00:01:13.799> oxalate

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
which releases the dec phenyl oxalate

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.969 
which releases the dec phenyl oxalate
into<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> hydrogen<00:01:15.119> peroxide<00:01:15.299> solution

these<00:01:50.700> bad<00:01:50.880> boys<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.329> you're<00:01:51.960> literally

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
these bad boys up you're literally

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:22.100 
these bad boys up you're literally
screwing<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> pixels<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.700> drew

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.760 

I<00:02:22.820> think<00:02:23.820> that's<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:24.720> right<00:02:24.780> let's<00:02:25.590> hit

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
I think that's it all right let's hit

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.040 
I think that's it all right let's hit
the<00:02:25.830> lights

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
the lights

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.320 
the lights
yeah<00:02:30.800> has<00:02:31.800> got<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.070> be<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> largest<00:02:32.670> glowing

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
yeah has got to be the largest glowing

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.090 
yeah has got to be the largest glowing
