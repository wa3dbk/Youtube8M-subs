know<00:00:34.820> I'm<00:00:34.970> not<00:00:35.210> self-sufficient<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:35.960> don't

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
know I'm not self-sufficient I don't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.810 
know I'm not self-sufficient I don't
grow<00:00:36.290> everything<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:37.070> think<00:00:37.370> even<00:00:37.580> a

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
grow everything but I think even a

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.300 
grow everything but I think even a
little<00:00:38.120> bit<00:00:38.390> here<00:00:38.990> and<00:00:39.140> there<00:00:39.230> goes<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.070> long

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
little bit here and there goes a long

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.700 
little bit here and there goes a long
way<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.090> each<00:00:41.600> time<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:41.870> do<00:00:42.110> do<00:00:42.290> something<00:00:42.320> of

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
way and each time you do do something of

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.170 
way and each time you do do something of
yourself<00:00:43.010> whether<00:00:43.190> it's<00:00:43.370> growing<00:00:43.550> herbs<00:00:43.850> or

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
yourself whether it's growing herbs or

shoes<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.870> all<00:00:48.050> counts<00:00:48.410> a<00:00:48.770> little<00:00:49.340> bit<00:00:49.610> growing

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
shoes it all counts a little bit growing

shoes it all counts a little bit growing
a<00:00:50.180> little<00:00:50.300> bit<00:00:50.450> and<00:00:51.110> for<00:00:51.290> self-sufficiency

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
a little bit and for self-sufficiency

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.880 
a little bit and for self-sufficiency
and<00:00:52.550> kind<00:00:52.760> of<00:00:53.170> reducing<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.260> little<00:00:54.560> bit<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.800> the

to<00:01:11.750> go<00:01:12.020> now<00:01:12.620> this<00:01:12.830> container<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.520> have

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
to go now this container I have

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.520 
to go now this container I have
literally<00:01:14.810> just<00:01:14.930> got<00:01:15.230> from<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.250> tip<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:17.530> was

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
literally just got from the tip it was

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.660 
literally just got from the tip it was
thrown<00:01:18.710> out<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:18.980> a<00:01:19.100> whole<00:01:19.220> lot<00:01:19.400> of<00:01:19.520> other

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
thrown out of a whole lot of other

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.010 
thrown out of a whole lot of other
plastic<00:01:20.150> goods<00:01:20.330> that<00:01:20.570> weren't<00:01:20.780> being

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
plastic goods that weren't being

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.650 
plastic goods that weren't being
recycled<00:01:21.440> I<00:01:21.770> might<00:01:21.950> add<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:23.270> we've<00:01:23.450> rinsed

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
recycled I might add so we've rinsed

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.590 
recycled I might add so we've rinsed
give<00:01:23.930> it<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.110> good<00:01:24.500> rinse<00:01:24.710> out<00:01:24.980> I<00:01:25.280> think<00:01:26.180> someone

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
give it a good rinse out I think someone

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.040 
give it a good rinse out I think someone
was<00:01:26.690> just<00:01:26.840> using<00:01:27.230> it<00:01:27.350> for<00:01:28.540> cuttings<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.780> stuff

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
was just using it for cuttings and stuff

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.600 
was just using it for cuttings and stuff
like<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.440> because<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:30.710> had<00:01:30.830> some<00:01:31.040> soil<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.520> it

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
like that because it had some soil in it

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.180 
like that because it had some soil in it
and<00:01:31.760> what-have-you<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.930> I've<00:01:33.230> got<00:01:33.440> it<00:01:33.470> now<00:01:34.130> the

and what-have-you so I've got it now the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.500 
and what-have-you so I've got it now the
potting<00:01:34.610> mix<00:01:34.760> I've<00:01:34.909> got<00:01:35.090> in<00:01:35.210> there<00:01:35.390> I've<00:01:35.450> got

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
potting mix I've got in there I've got

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.480

two-thirds pudding mix and one-third
garden<00:01:37.880> soil<00:01:38.150> just<00:01:38.420> because<00:01:38.659> it's<00:01:38.960> outside

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
garden soil just because it's outside

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.870 
garden soil just because it's outside
potting<00:01:40.430> mix<00:01:40.580> is<00:01:40.760> great<00:01:41.000> but<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.600> be<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.810> bit

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
potting mix is great but it can be a bit

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.700 
potting mix is great but it can be a bit
free<00:01:43.880> lomi<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:44.720> drains<00:01:44.990> bit<00:01:45.290> too<00:01:45.440> quickly

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
free lomi just drains bit too quickly

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.550 
free lomi just drains bit too quickly
for<00:01:46.070> my<00:01:46.400> liking<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.510> I<00:01:47.570> always<00:01:48.080> add<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.320> little

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
for my liking so I always add a little

something like that

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.670 
something like that
just<00:05:43.599> make<00:05:43.750> sure<00:05:43.780> they're<00:05:44.110> not<00:05:44.199> buried

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
just make sure they're not buried

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.909

underneath<00:05:45.009> the<00:05:45.819> mulch<00:05:46.469> cool<00:05:47.469> so<00:05:47.680> if<00:05:47.770> you've

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
underneath the mulch cool so if you've

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.890 
underneath the mulch cool so if you've
only<00:05:47.979> got<00:05:48.129> a<00:05:48.250> small<00:05:48.400> space<00:05:48.900> container

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
only got a small space container

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.330 
only got a small space container
gardening<00:05:50.379> is<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.560> way<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.740> go<00:05:50.919> now<00:05:51.159> this

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
gardening is the way to go now this

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.529 
gardening is the way to go now this
depth<00:05:51.909> at<00:05:52.120> this<00:05:52.270> is<00:05:52.479> about<00:05:53.610> 300<00:05:54.610> ml<00:05:54.789> deep<00:05:55.060> so

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
depth at this is about 300 ml deep so

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.089 
depth at this is about 300 ml deep so
it's<00:05:55.659> pretty<00:05:55.900> deep<00:05:56.080> so<00:05:56.349> in<00:05:56.590> theory<00:05:56.830> you<00:05:56.979> could

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
it's pretty deep so in theory you could

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.890 
it's pretty deep so in theory you could
have<00:05:57.219> a<00:05:57.280> potato<00:05:57.669> plant<00:05:57.940> in<00:05:58.270> here<00:05:58.509> you<00:05:58.780> could

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
have a potato plant in here you could

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.670 
have a potato plant in here you could
have<00:05:58.990> some<00:05:59.199> carrots<00:05:59.620> herbs<00:06:00.250> of<00:06:00.610> course
