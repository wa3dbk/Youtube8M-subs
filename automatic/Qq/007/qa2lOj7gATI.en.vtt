horrible

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.990 
horrible
now<00:02:01.649> there's<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.950> few<00:02:02.130> reasons<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
now there's a few reasons for that the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.450 
now there's a few reasons for that the
first<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> lot<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.590> apps<00:02:04.829> like<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.310> be

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
first is a lot of apps like to be

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.059 
first is a lot of apps like to be
considered<00:02:05.850> unidentified<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.619> they

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
considered unidentified and so they

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.940 
considered unidentified and so they

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
show their exact

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.630 
show their exact
appname<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:14.380> for<00:02:14.770> example<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.130> just<00:02:15.340> typed<00:02:15.490> in

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
appname so for example I just typed in

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.790 
appname so for example I just typed in
jelly<00:02:15.850> jump<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.300> as<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.480> can<00:02:16.600> see<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:17.230> we

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
jelly jump and as you can see here we

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.480 
jelly jump and as you can see here we
got<00:02:17.830> jelly<00:02:18.310> jelly<00:02:18.550> crush<00:02:19.290> which<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.280> first

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
got jelly jelly crush which is the first

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.520 
got jelly jelly crush which is the first
result<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.480> can<00:02:22.600> see<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.960> jelly<00:02:23.230> jump

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
result and you can see that jelly jump

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.480 
result and you can see that jelly jump
isn't<00:02:23.770> isn't<00:02:24.580> listed<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.590> what<00:02:27.400> I'm

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
way that I like to use to actually find

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.100 
way that I like to use to actually find
these<00:02:34.360> unidentified<00:02:34.690> apps<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.420> now<00:02:37.840> we're<00:02:38.020> in

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
these unidentified apps so now we're in

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.350 
these unidentified apps so now we're in
the<00:02:38.230> Google<00:02:38.560> Play<00:02:38.710> Store<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.280> as<00:02:39.850> you<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.180> see

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
the Google Play Store and as you can see

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.670 
the Google Play Store and as you can see
this<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> app<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.260> was<00:02:41.380> talking<00:02:41.530> about

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
this is the app that I was talking about

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.330 
this is the app that I was talking about
jelly<00:02:42.280> jump<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.510> can<00:02:43.660> see<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.290> is

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
jelly jump and you can see that it is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.650 
jelly jump and you can see that it is
number<00:02:45.340> 10<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.850> top<00:02:45.970> three<00:02:46.390> games

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
number 10 in the top three games

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.140 
number 10 in the top three games
currently<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.410> it's<00:02:47.980> on<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.250> rise<00:02:48.460> so<00:02:49.030> this

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
currently and it's on the rise so this

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.700 
currently and it's on the rise so this
would<00:02:49.300> be<00:02:49.420> an<00:02:49.540> excellent<00:02:49.960> opportunity<00:02:50.650> to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
would be an excellent opportunity to

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.730 
would be an excellent opportunity to
advertise<00:02:50.980> specifically<00:02:51.970> in<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.240> app<00:02:52.570> as<00:02:53.050> we

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
advertise specifically in this app as we

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.080 
advertise specifically in this app as we
know<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.950> gets<00:02:54.100> more<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.310> more<00:02:54.400> popular

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
know it gets more and more popular

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.790 
know it gets more and more popular
so<00:02:55.870> we'll<00:02:55.960> do<00:02:56.080> is<00:02:56.170> we'll<00:02:56.260> go<00:02:56.380> ahead<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.590> click

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
on jelly jump here and as you can see

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.510 
on jelly jump here and as you can see
down<00:03:01.150> at<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.360> bottom<00:03:01.420> here<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.740> game<00:03:03.010> already

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
down at the bottom here the game already

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.420 
down at the bottom here the game already
has<00:03:03.670> 5<00:03:04.510> million<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.680> 10<00:03:05.920> million<00:03:06.190> downloads

which<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.210> pretty<00:03:07.420> good<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:08.020> I'm<00:03:08.290> pretty<00:03:08.530> sure

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
which is pretty good and I'm pretty sure

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.780 
which is pretty good and I'm pretty sure
it's<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> lot<00:03:08.980> higher<00:03:09.160> than<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.460> because<00:03:09.610> this

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
it's a lot higher than that because this

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.720 
it's a lot higher than that because this
only<00:03:09.970> updates<00:03:10.560> every<00:03:11.560> week<00:03:11.590> or<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.370> this

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
only updates every week or so and this

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.510 
only updates every week or so and this
thing's<00:03:12.970> been<00:03:13.120> on<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.360> rise<00:03:13.510> quite<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.870> bit<00:03:14.520> at

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
thing's been on the rise quite a bit at

what<00:03:37.480> we'll<00:03:37.630> do<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.780> we'll<00:03:38.110> copy<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.650> to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
what we'll do is we'll copy it to

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
impressions a month now I believe Google

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.120 
impressions a month now I believe Google
Display<00:05:00.480> Network<00:05:00.630> only<00:05:01.320> updates<00:05:01.920> these

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
Display Network only updates these

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.050 
Display Network only updates these
numbers<00:05:02.760> once<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.270> month<00:05:04.460> however<00:05:05.460> we<00:05:05.910> know

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
numbers once a month however we know

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.730 
numbers once a month however we know
that<00:05:06.090> jelly<00:05:06.570> jump<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.960> on<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.170> rise<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:07.620> these

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
that jelly jump is on the rise so these

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.230 
that jelly jump is on the rise so these
numbers<00:05:07.920> are<00:05:08.160> probably<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.490> lot<00:05:08.640> higher<00:05:08.910> now

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
numbers are probably a lot higher now

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.810 
numbers are probably a lot higher now
the<00:05:10.050> reason<00:05:10.680> you'd<00:05:10.830> want<00:05:11.100> to<00:05:11.190> advertise<00:05:11.610> on
