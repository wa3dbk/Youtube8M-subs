00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.250 

but<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.740> spike<00:01:32.480> that<00:01:33.480> does<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.840> trick

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:51.460 

there's<00:01:37.260> no<00:01:37.440> resisting<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> spike

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.670 

you<00:01:51.980> can't<00:01:52.250> take<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.700> in<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.300> noggin<00:01:53.680> even
