00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
we've kind of been calling them like

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.810

turn-based<00:00:28.560> arcade<00:00:29.070> online<00:00:29.519> multiplayer

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820

games something like that there's

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.600 
games something like that there's
probably<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.980> better<00:00:32.099> word<00:00:32.279> out<00:00:32.460> there

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
probably a better word out there

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.090 
probably a better word out there
somewhere<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.480> kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.870> genre<00:00:34.100> but

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
somewhere for this kind of genre but

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740 
somewhere for this kind of genre but
that's<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.399> we're<00:00:35.489> looking<00:00:35.790> at<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that's what we're looking at and as I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.940 
that's what we're looking at and as I
said<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.079> ready<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.800> gonna

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
said it's ready to go so I was gonna

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.310 
said it's ready to go so I was gonna
boot<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.360> show<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.719> how<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
boot this up and then show you how it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.400 
boot this up and then show you how it
goes<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.850> essentially<00:00:42.570> you're<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
goes so essentially you're gonna have to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.440 
goes so essentially you're gonna have to
play<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.770> with<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> friend<00:00:44.129> which<00:00:44.640> none<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.300> my

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
play this with a friend which none of my

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
play this with a friend which none of my
friends<00:00:45.690> actually<00:00:46.110> currently<00:00:46.680> play<00:00:47.039> this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
friends actually currently play this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.500 
friends actually currently play this
game<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.640> I've<00:00:47.700> been<00:00:47.789> playing<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.090> random

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
game so I've been playing with random

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930 
game so I've been playing with random
strangers<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> I'm<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.579> ahead<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.730> show

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
strangers so I'm gonna go ahead and show

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.400 
strangers so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.329> works<00:00:51.390> essentially<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> idea

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you how this works essentially the idea

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.799 
you how this works essentially the idea
is<00:00:53.039> exactly<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> same<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.449> something<00:00:54.690> like

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
is exactly the same as something like

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
is exactly the same as something like
draw<00:00:55.020> something<00:00:55.530> where<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.489> are<00:00:56.610> trying<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
draw something where you are trying to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.599 
draw something where you are trying to
get<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:58.170> friends<00:00:58.680> your<00:00:58.859> playmates<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
get your your friends your playmates to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.470 
get your your friends your playmates to
guess<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> word<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.120> works

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
guess a word so the way that this works

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.950 
guess a word so the way that this works
is<00:01:03.979> you<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.400> actually<00:01:05.610> spell<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.540> clue

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
is you have to actually spell out a clue

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
is you have to actually spell out a clue
which<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.530> guess<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.740> could<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.189> ahead<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
which I guess I could just go ahead and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
which I guess I could just go ahead and
show<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.670> create<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> game<00:01:09.450> else<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> by<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
show you create a game else in it by a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.240 
show you create a game else in it by a
random<00:01:11.420> um<00:01:13.369> let's<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.880> play<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.130> then<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
random um let's see so play and then you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
random um let's see so play and then you
choose<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> word<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.060> I've<00:01:18.119> got<00:01:18.240> education

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
choose a word so I've got education

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.960 
choose a word so I've got education
which<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.409> easy<00:01:19.619> word<00:01:19.920> sixth<00:01:20.400> sense<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
which is an easy word sixth sense and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.300 
which is an easy word sixth sense and
Odyssey<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.000> actually

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
Odyssey and then you have to actually

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.260 
Odyssey and then you have to actually
pick<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> these<00:01:26.640> first<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> try<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
pick one of these first and try to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.969 
pick one of these first and try to
search<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.110> six<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:28.950> be

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
search one to go with six will be

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.429 
search one to go with six will be
honesty<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.670> hope<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> best<00:01:30.229> see<00:01:31.229> there

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
honesty and hope for the best see there

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.600 
honesty and hope for the best see there
goes<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.950> lot<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> stuff<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.150> hope<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> use

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
goes a lot of stuff that I hope to use

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.770 
goes a lot of stuff that I hope to use
so<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> idea<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> spill<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> clue

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so the idea is that you spill in a clue

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.510 
so the idea is that you spill in a clue
which<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.619> by<00:01:37.770> simply<00:01:37.950> tapping<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
which you do this by simply tapping this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.100 
which you do this by simply tapping this
know<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> r<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.329> words<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> cannot

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
know if you r your words that you cannot

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and so that on the flip side you are

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.960 
and so that on the flip side you are
going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:16.319> doing<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.310> exact<00:02:17.550> opposite

everything else about the game is pretty

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:07.759 
everything else about the game is pretty
good<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.630> let's<00:04:00.630> see<00:04:05.510> anyway<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.780> will<00:04:07.410> actually

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
good so let's see anyway I will actually

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.509 
good so let's see anyway I will actually
maybe<00:04:08.070> do<00:04:08.280> this<00:04:08.400> one<00:04:08.610> later<00:04:08.850> okay<00:04:09.780> back<00:04:10.519> so

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519

about<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:12.989> actually<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:13.920> guess<00:04:14.040> we<00:04:14.160> do<00:04:14.250> have

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
about it and actually I guess we do have

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.830 
about it and actually I guess we do have
one<00:04:14.549> more<00:04:14.579> thing<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.030> say<00:04:15.150> which<00:04:15.329> is<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.630> fact

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
one more thing to say which is the fact

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.659 
one more thing to say which is the fact
that<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.049> app<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.530> free<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.160> App<00:04:17.280> Store<00:04:17.310> so

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
that the app is free in the App Store so

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.740 
that the app is free in the App Store so

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
player pool too especially within our

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
core group of friends which is something

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.970 
core group of friends which is something
that's<00:04:37.200> pretty<00:04:37.560> much<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.680> only<00:04:37.770> thing

holding back can't say that and that's

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.380 
holding back can't say that and that's
pretty<00:04:40.830> much<00:04:40.920> it<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:41.640> it's<00:04:41.760> good<00:04:41.940> value<00:04:42.060> good
