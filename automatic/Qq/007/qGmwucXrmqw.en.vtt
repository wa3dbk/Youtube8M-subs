gel just to sort of isolation coat means

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.030 
gel just to sort of isolation coat means
that<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:30.029> protecting<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.990> painting<00:00:31.679> from

and<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.730> gonna<00:00:59.910> give<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.660> sort<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> reflective

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and it's gonna give a sort of reflective

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.789 
and it's gonna give a sort of reflective
quality<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> light<00:01:03.809> light<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.650> through

quality with a light light going through

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.160 
quality with a light light going through
it<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.409> has<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:08.159> UV<00:01:08.640> resistance<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
it it is has some UV resistance it is

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.830 
it it is has some UV resistance it is
waterproof<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:12.000> flexible<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
waterproof and actually flexible if you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.660 
waterproof and actually flexible if you
needed<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> would<00:01:14.010> work<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
needed it to be so it would work on a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
needed it to be so it would work on a
flexible<00:01:15.180> surface<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> little<00:01:16.890> tricky

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
flexible surface it's a little tricky

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.109 
flexible surface it's a little tricky
though<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.729> application<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:19.790> takes<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.939> lot

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
though the application and takes a lot

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.870 
though the application and takes a lot
of<00:01:21.150> product<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.740> buy<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.460> larger

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
of product so I buy it in larger

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.010 
of product so I buy it in larger
containers<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.600> some<00:01:27.810> right<00:01:27.990> here

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
containers and I have some right here

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.429 
containers and I have some right here
and<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:30.560> have<00:01:31.560> blocked<00:01:32.400> off<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:34.020> rest<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.350> my

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and I have blocked off the rest of my

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.789 
and I have blocked off the rest of my
studio<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:36.390> dogs<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:37.409> come<00:01:37.650> in

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
studio so that my dogs don't come in

big<00:01:42.840> floppy<00:01:43.380> tails<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.630> my<00:01:45.630> painting<00:01:46.110> it's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
big floppy tails in my painting it's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.980 
big floppy tails in my painting it's
happened<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.149> see<00:01:48.329> how<00:01:48.479> thick<00:01:48.810> it's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
happened so you can see how thick it's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.120 
happened so you can see how thick it's
like<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.829> maple<00:01:50.549> syrup<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.590> I'm<00:01:52.590> pouring<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130

on pretty generously you really have to
have<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.829> place<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.780> work<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.560> some

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
have a place to work I have some

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
have a place to work I have some
visqueen<00:02:00.240> sort<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.840> plastic<00:02:01.439> underneath<00:02:01.740> this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
visqueen sort of plastic underneath this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
visqueen sort of plastic underneath this
because<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.700> gonna<00:02:02.909> drip<00:02:03.149> off<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.390> sides

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
because it is gonna drip off the sides

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.410 
because it is gonna drip off the sides
and<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:05.040> gonna<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:06.860> messy<00:02:08.000> so<00:02:09.000> I'm

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
and it's gonna be really messy so I'm

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.710 
and it's gonna be really messy so I'm
moving<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.080> around<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:11.220> will<00:02:11.580> settle<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.569> mean

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
moving it around it will settle I mean

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.100 
moving it around it will settle I mean
it's<00:02:12.930> called

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
it's called

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.770 
it's called
self-leveling<00:02:15.110> because<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:17.450> know<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.660> will

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
self-leveling because you know it will

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.180 
self-leveling because you know it will
sort<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.500> level<00:02:18.890> out<00:02:20.349> you<00:02:21.349> can<00:02:21.440> see<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.860> really

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
sort of level out you can see it really

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.440 
sort of level out you can see it really
moves<00:02:22.400> slowly<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:24.190> gently<00:02:25.190> nudge<00:02:26.150> it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
moves slowly you have to gently nudge it

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.350 
moves slowly you have to gently nudge it
around<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:28.160> can<00:02:28.190> also<00:02:28.489> pick<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.180> board<00:02:29.420> up

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.039 

let<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.390> run<00:02:35.890> now<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.040> looks<00:02:37.370> milky<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.900> know

white you would think oh my god I'm

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.880 
white you would think oh my god I'm
covering<00:02:41.540> my<00:02:41.569> painting<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:42.290> it's<00:02:42.440> going<00:02:42.769> to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
covering my painting but it's going to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.020 
covering my painting but it's going to
dry<00:02:43.129> completely<00:02:43.610> clear<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:48.790> like<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.970> said

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
dry completely clear and like I said

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.380 
dry completely clear and like I said
it's<00:02:50.750> going<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:52.030> give<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.769> depth<00:02:55.390> you

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
it's going to give you this depth you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.600 
it's going to give you this depth you
know<00:02:56.420> between<00:02:56.769> this<00:02:57.769> depth<00:02:58.129> that<00:02:58.459> you're

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
know between this depth that you're

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.940 
know between this depth that you're
looking<00:02:59.000> through<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.720> there's<00:03:00.560> something

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
looking through and there's something

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.569 
looking through and there's something
about<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.900> that's<00:03:02.900> um<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:04.220> really

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
about that that's um that really

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.280 
about that that's um that really
enhances<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.620> color<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:08.480> your<00:03:08.660> painting<00:03:08.989> now

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
enhances the color of your painting now

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.160 
enhances the color of your painting now
I<00:03:10.099> can<00:03:10.760> see<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.329> I<00:03:11.480> don't<00:03:11.870> know<00:03:11.959> if<00:03:12.079> you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
I can see and you I don't know if you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.600 
I can see and you I don't know if you
can<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:12.530> probably<00:03:12.799> can't<00:03:13.040> see<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.400> but

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
can you probably can't see this but

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.430 
can you probably can't see this but
there<00:03:13.790> are<00:03:13.819> little<00:03:14.030> bubbles<00:03:14.269> forming<00:03:14.989> in<00:03:15.110> here

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
there are little bubbles forming in here

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.170 
there are little bubbles forming in here
and<00:03:16.780> because<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.109> so<00:03:18.470> viscous<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.670> so

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
and because this is so viscous it's so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.420 
and because this is so viscous it's so
thick<00:03:20.630> those<00:03:20.959> bubbles<00:03:21.470> are<00:03:21.590> not<00:03:21.650> going<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.220> pop

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
thick those bubbles are not going to pop

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.920 
thick those bubbles are not going to pop
on<00:03:22.670> their<00:03:22.850> own<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> trick<00:03:25.489> for<00:03:25.519> that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
on their own and I have a trick for that

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.490 
on their own and I have a trick for that
once<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.049> get<00:03:27.230> this<00:03:28.060> stuff<00:03:29.060> kind<00:03:29.389> of<00:03:29.569> spread

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
once I get this stuff kind of spread

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.009 
once I get this stuff kind of spread
around<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:31.190> I'm<00:03:31.700> letting<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.389> run<00:03:32.569> off<00:03:32.780> the

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
around and I'm letting it run off the

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.930 
around and I'm letting it run off the
sides<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.799> because<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.310> have<00:03:34.489> this<00:03:34.700> plastic

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
sides so because I have this plastic

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.379 
sides so because I have this plastic
down<00:03:35.359> underneath<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:37.489> can<00:03:37.670> just<00:03:37.849> go<00:03:38.000> right<00:03:38.239> off

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
down underneath it can just go right off

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:45.490 
down underneath it can just go right off
the<00:03:38.420> sides<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:44.090> I'm<00:03:44.239> using<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:44.780> foam<00:03:45.079> brush

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
the sides and I'm using this foam brush

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.539 
the sides and I'm using this foam brush
it<00:03:45.739> just<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:47.209> know<00:03:47.239> it's<00:03:47.930> not<00:03:48.859> gonna<00:03:49.069> streak

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
it just you know it's not gonna streak

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.370 
it just you know it's not gonna streak
at<00:03:49.760> all<00:03:49.910> not<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.180> there<00:03:50.569> would<00:03:50.780> if<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.109> did

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
at all not that there would if you did

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.860 
at all not that there would if you did
use<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.709> regular<00:03:51.950> brush<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.579> probably<00:03:53.540> wouldn't

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
use a regular brush it probably wouldn't

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.620 
use a regular brush it probably wouldn't
streak<00:03:54.410> anyway<00:03:54.889> because<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.489> whole<00:03:56.269> point<00:03:56.569> of

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
streak anyway because the whole point of

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.949 
streak anyway because the whole point of
this<00:03:56.810> stuff<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.290> self<00:03:57.560> leveling<00:03:58.069> right<00:03:58.310> so

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
this stuff is self leveling right so

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.720 
this stuff is self leveling right so
those<00:03:59.959> little<00:04:00.139> marks<00:04:00.560> kind<00:04:00.919> of<00:04:01.010> disappear<00:04:01.519> as

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
those little marks kind of disappear as

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
those little marks kind of disappear as
it<00:04:02.329> settles<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:07.030> afterwards<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.299> I'm<00:04:08.540> going<00:04:08.690> to

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
it settles so afterwards so I'm going to

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.659 
it settles so afterwards so I'm going to
show<00:04:09.349> you<00:04:09.380> this<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.950> then<00:04:10.040> make<00:04:10.459> another

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
show you this and then make another

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.129 
show you this and then make another
little<00:04:11.060> video<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.450> show<00:04:11.569> you<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.870> finish

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
little video to show you the finish

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.110 
little video to show you the finish
because<00:04:12.380> when<00:04:13.010> this<00:04:13.160> is<00:04:13.340> finished<00:04:13.549> it's<00:04:13.970> going

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
because when this is finished it's going

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.330 
because when this is finished it's going
to<00:04:14.209> be<00:04:14.299> a<00:04:14.329> really<00:04:14.750> really<00:04:14.989> high<00:04:15.470> gloss<00:04:15.859> and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
to be a really really high gloss and

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.270 
to be a really really high gloss and
that's<00:04:16.459> not<00:04:16.700> necessarily<00:04:17.120> what<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:17.930> want<00:04:18.289> for

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
that's not necessarily what I want for

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.140 
that's not necessarily what I want for
my<00:04:19.459> finish<00:04:21.340> but<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.370> love<00:04:22.820> this<00:04:23.300> depth<00:04:24.760> that

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
my finish but I love this depth that

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.230 
my finish but I love this depth that
so<00:04:26.780> when<00:04:27.020> I'm<00:04:27.110> finished<00:04:27.470> with<00:04:27.590> this<00:04:27.980> I'm<00:04:28.730> going

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
so when I'm finished with this I'm going

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.860 
so when I'm finished with this I'm going
to<00:04:29.830> lightly

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
to lightly

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.590 
to lightly
abrade<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.199> surface<00:04:33.639> with<00:04:34.639> steel<00:04:35.000> wool<00:04:35.300> and

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
abrade the surface with steel wool and

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.820 
abrade the surface with steel wool and
then<00:04:36.260> I'm<00:04:36.380> going<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.650> apply<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:37.340> cold<00:04:37.729> wax<00:04:38.060> paste

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
then I'm going to apply a cold wax paste

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.219 
then I'm going to apply a cold wax paste
for<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.919> finish<00:04:40.310> which<00:04:40.669> gives<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.449> you<00:04:42.169> know

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
for the finish which gives it you know

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.200 
for the finish which gives it you know
it<00:04:42.380> knocks<00:04:42.650> back<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.340> sheen<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.610> little<00:04:44.030> bit

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
it knocks back the sheen a little bit

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.439 
it knocks back the sheen a little bit
and<00:04:44.680> almost<00:04:45.680> has<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:47.000> an<00:04:47.740> encaustic<00:04:48.740> look<00:04:49.449> to

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
and almost has a an encaustic look to

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.230 
and almost has a an encaustic look to
the<00:04:50.600> painting<00:04:51.050> if<00:04:51.229> you<00:04:51.979> know<00:04:52.310> what<00:04:52.490> encaustic

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
is that's actually painting in wax but

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.680

all everything's sitting on the top so

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.020 
all everything's sitting on the top so
after<00:05:45.020> this<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:45.770> still<00:05:46.039> see<00:05:46.190> these<00:05:46.340> bubbles<00:05:46.580> so

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
after this I still see these bubbles so

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.540 
after this I still see these bubbles so
what<00:05:47.180> I've<00:05:47.300> done<00:05:47.510> is<00:05:47.870> I've<00:05:48.050> got<00:05:48.260> some<00:05:49.190> plain

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
what I've done is I've got some plain

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.480 
what I've done is I've got some plain
rubbing<00:05:50.360> alcohol<00:05:50.479> and<00:05:51.139> I<00:05:51.919> keep<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:52.310> in<00:05:52.430> a

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
rubbing alcohol and I keep it in a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.719 
rubbing alcohol and I keep it in a
little<00:05:52.520> spray<00:05:53.000> bottle<00:05:53.500> and<00:05:54.500> what<00:05:55.250> this<00:05:55.430> does

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
little spray bottle and what this does

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.969 
little spray bottle and what this does
is<00:05:56.320> wherever<00:05:57.320> I<00:05:57.500> see<00:05:57.770> these<00:05:57.919> little<00:05:58.099> bubbles<00:05:58.310> I

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
is wherever I see these little bubbles I

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.150 
is wherever I see these little bubbles I
spray<00:06:00.979> this<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.610> I<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.690> um<00:06:03.169> okay<00:06:03.860> so<00:06:03.889> I'm

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
spray this and I and it um okay so I'm

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.710 
spray this and I and it um okay so I'm
not<00:06:04.310> a<00:06:04.340> scientist<00:06:04.849> I'm<00:06:05.180> not<00:06:05.360> sure<00:06:05.479> exactly

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
not a scientist I'm not sure exactly

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.290 
not a scientist I'm not sure exactly
what's<00:06:06.080> happening<00:06:06.500> but<00:06:06.710> it<00:06:06.860> changes<00:06:07.610> the

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
what's happening but it changes the

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.600 
what's happening but it changes the
viscosity<00:06:08.720> and<00:06:10.180> allows<00:06:11.180> the<00:06:12.020> air<00:06:12.320> it<00:06:12.710> thins

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
viscosity and allows the air it thins

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.580 
viscosity and allows the air it thins
the<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:16.520> little<00:06:16.729> skin<00:06:17.450> over<00:06:17.900> the<00:06:17.930> bubble<00:06:18.349> it

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
the the little skin over the bubble it

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.930 
the the little skin over the bubble it
thins<00:06:18.889> it<00:06:19.160> till<00:06:19.400> it<00:06:19.520> pops

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
thins it till it pops

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.580 
thins it till it pops
so<00:06:20.720> now<00:06:20.930> there's<00:06:21.830> one<00:06:22.010> last<00:06:22.220> one<00:06:22.580> and<00:06:23.590> it

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
so now there's one last one and it

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.960 
so now there's one last one and it
doesn't<00:06:24.889> seem<00:06:25.010> to<00:06:25.160> have<00:06:25.370> any<00:06:26.650> negative<00:06:27.650> effect

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
doesn't seem to have any negative effect

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.629 
doesn't seem to have any negative effect
on<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.389> rest<00:06:29.570> of<00:06:29.690> this<00:06:29.810> now<00:06:30.650> if<00:06:31.010> my<00:06:31.310> golden

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
on the rest of this now if my golden

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.000 
on the rest of this now if my golden
retriever<00:06:31.729> comes<00:06:32.270> in<00:06:32.479> here<00:06:32.810> I'm<00:06:33.289> in<00:06:33.349> trouble

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
retriever comes in here I'm in trouble

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.310 
retriever comes in here I'm in trouble

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320
