00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 throughout america cougars blue cross 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.270
 we hear the words of the forward 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.270
 star of the america cup 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.929
 what I did during my entire career in 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.810
 Mexican football I believe that it supports 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.900
 I mean, I think it's a particular way 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.669
 but obviously I like it but I say 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.580
 the mere fact of having called me 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.980
 to be important I always say what I say 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.619
 being a player maybe not born in 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.349
 mexico in a country of so much inhabitant 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.269
 for me it was a 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.710
 a dream come true play this be 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.280
 the truth I could connect 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.589
 pressure before coming we had had 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.420
 a talk with Miguel in the party of 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.190
 santi and I told him to be in the place 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.680
 it would try to bring what 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.360
 could he touched me and the truth was I was lucky 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.060
 me but 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.710
 but maybe now there's a lot of talk about me 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.530
 but also the classmates that I had 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.000
 back the other day the truth was 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.100
 were 10 beasts that killed themselves all 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.020
 party and the truth that that also 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.490
 It makes me very happy makes me the truth 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.850
 I did not come to cover his mouth and I 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.770
 I came to 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.530
 to play an america cup to do what 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.100
 better and to try to make the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.810
 people from mexico and especially my 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.190
 children and my family who are the ones 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.799
 They are always in the bad times 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.600
 they did nothing to me but I repeat, it's not a 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.790
 issue that has to talk now bone 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.200
 I did not talk anything I say my 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.780
 representative also knows that I'm 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.340
 got into this then I'm not at 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.950
 so much for nothing the wta 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.630
 could be revalued vicente matÃ­as 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.250
 vuoso for some team in the league mx 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.630
 I say atlas it has already been very clear that 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.429
 you do not need it you do not want it 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.710
 Jaguars would not seem to do either 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.920
 valid an option to stay at nothing 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.420
 now they cited adalberto palm now as 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.579
 directive of this team and says that 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.920
 same and if it is because the volpe does not 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.329
 dislike him for being a guy all that goes 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.459
 versus doing the features that 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.679
 has to not tell you that equals returns 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:03.739
 also take the campus that has 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:06.349
 Minimum league player such as 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:08.599
 goals that still suddenly with the press 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.369
 Chilean already puts it in colo colo 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.690
 South America surely some team 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.180
 it's also clear usually we 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.220
 We know from other countries the day to day 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.280
 of what has happened today bozo has 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.049
 the opportunity itself to revalue what 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.599
 she her future can finish it 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.790
 worthy way to how it was intended 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.519
 a year ago to go down the street from the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.410
 bitterness today there is that halo of light that 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.299
 end ends up finding like 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.440
 professional football and what it is 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.350
 That it is 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.640
 many foreign players mostly 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.480
 South Americans go to the Copa Libertadores 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.670
 they go to these cups america and they play like 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.520
 if now they bring bellows and vitamins 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.350
 extras or not and here they dragged 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.990
 patitas but it turns out an america cup and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.390
 the two and launched the latter that was not 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.090
 so good for jaguars for you or if 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.340
 that's why he's a guy who does work 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.990
 dirty and that sometimes is not rewarded not 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.450
 miguel herrera been reward taking 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.310
 the america cup and it turns out that it almost 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.530
 is playing the same and it turns out that 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.300
 he scored two goals no and that is the axis of 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.610
 attack on this that understood sticks 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.090
 because it cost him a lot of work in a 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.750
 stage where was a player who did not have 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.150
 for nothing a control out of the field or 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.090
 be with atlas went very wrong and until 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.090
 found now ecuador mexico and chile 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.710
 that stadium I would not go crazy as the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.849
 lieutenant to the superiors no thanks me 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.829
 that new stadium or crazy for nothing 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.010
 to one of the best if not the 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:58.599
 better in chile and of course you're not 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:58.599
 talking economically pacifier 42 35
