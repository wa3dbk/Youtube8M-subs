that we're trying to shoot for is is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:46.750 
that we're trying to shoot for is is

that<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.229> to<00:00:51.440> use<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.220> water<00:00:52.640> meter<00:00:52.940> instead<00:00:53.839> of

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
that is to use a water meter instead of

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.630 
that is to use a water meter instead of
trying<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.199> use<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.379> volumetric<00:00:54.860> measure<00:00:55.280> to

they can get off there that it does

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.229 
they can get off there that it does
happen<00:02:07.319> over<00:02:07.679> time<00:02:07.709> so<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.640> always<00:02:08.789> worth<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
happen over time so it's always worth to

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
happen over time so it's always worth to
recalibrate<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.810> recheck<00:02:10.229> these<00:02:10.410> scales<00:02:10.679> in

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
recalibrate and recheck these scales in

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:19.640 
recalibrate and recheck these scales in

essentially<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.239> an<00:02:21.360> example<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
essentially this this is an example of a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.350 
essentially this this is an example of a
scale<00:02:22.140> we've<00:02:22.379> used<00:02:22.739> away<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.129> powder<00:02:23.370> here's

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
scale we've used away the powder here's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.759 
scale we've used away the powder here's
the<00:02:24.510> bucket<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.019> can<00:02:25.080> see<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.440> scale<00:02:25.650> is

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
the bucket you can see the scale is

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:26.990 
the bucket you can see the scale is
actually<00:02:25.890> preset<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> weight<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
actually preset for the weight of the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.339 
actually preset for the weight of the
bucket<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.510> when<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.840> set<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.080> bucket

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
bucket so that when you set the bucket

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.530 
bucket so that when you set the bucket
on<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.470> scale<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:29.190> zeroes<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.120> then

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
on the scale it zeroes it up and then

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.089 
on the scale it zeroes it up and then
you<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.319> would<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.590> add<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.890> powder

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
you just you would just add the powder

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.520 
you just you would just add the powder
to<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.459> bucket<00:02:32.760> weight<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:34.019> way<00:02:34.319> each

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
to the bucket weight and and way each

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.229 
to the bucket weight and and way each
bucket<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.250> make<00:02:35.370> sure<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.730> had<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:35.909> precise

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
bucket to make sure you had the precise

amount of powder obviously this would be

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.680

to the camp challenge with buckets is

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.140 
to the camp challenge with buckets is
they<00:04:29.110> tend<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.710> be<00:04:29.800> wasteful<00:04:30.220> calves<00:04:30.880> can

they tend to be wasteful calves can

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.730 
they tend to be wasteful calves can

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
another advantage to the bottle is it

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.340 
another advantage to the bottle is it
some<00:04:42.820> more<00:04:42.970> natural<00:04:43.390> feeding<00:04:43.630> mechanisms<00:04:44.290> you

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
some more natural feeding mechanisms you

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.320 
some more natural feeding mechanisms you
don't<00:04:44.530> have<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.740> train<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.220> camp<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:45.970> bottle

don't have to train the camp to a bottle

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.910 
don't have to train the camp to a bottle
typically<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.870> have<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.140> work<00:04:47.320> hard<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.680> train

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
typically you have to work hard to train
