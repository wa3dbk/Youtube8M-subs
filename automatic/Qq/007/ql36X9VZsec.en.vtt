millions<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.849> millions<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.449> girls<00:03:13.689> around

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
millions and millions of girls around

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.289 
millions and millions of girls around
the<00:03:14.769> country<00:03:15.159> started<00:03:15.669> at<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.849> same<00:03:16.060> time

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
the country started at the same time

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.020 
the country started at the same time
with<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.569> same<00:03:16.599> goal<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:18.730> think<00:03:18.969> that

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
with the same goal and to think that

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.580 
with the same goal and to think that
only<00:03:19.389> six<00:03:19.629> of<00:03:19.750> us<00:03:19.900> made<00:03:20.169> it<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.439> we<00:03:20.500> were<00:03:20.560> able
