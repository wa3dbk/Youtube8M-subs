mw3<00:03:07.069> but<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.430> rest<00:03:08.639> is<00:03:08.909> that<00:03:09.510> looks<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.109> this

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
mw3 but the rest is that looks like this

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.860 
mw3 but the rest is that looks like this
no<00:03:10.560> chem<00:03:10.829> camo<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.440> yeah<00:03:14.480> we'll<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.840> the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
no chem camo and so yeah we'll be on the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.759 
no chem camo and so yeah we'll be on the
goldstone<00:03:16.590> which<00:03:16.829> is<00:03:16.980> default<00:03:17.400> slow<00:03:18.389> send<00:03:18.780> any

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
goldstone which is default slow send any

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.869 
goldstone which is default slow send any
sand<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.340> i'm<00:03:20.930> not<00:03:21.930> sure<00:03:23.989> netherrack<00:03:25.879> that

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
sand so i'm not sure netherrack that

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.479 
sand so i'm not sure netherrack that
looks<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.299> one<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.019> camels<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.190> all

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
looks like one of the camels and all

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.159 
looks like one of the camels and all
beauty<00:03:30.349> obsidian<00:03:31.349> I<00:03:31.590> think<00:03:32.489> they<00:03:32.579> changed

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
beauty obsidian I think they changed

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:40.819 
beauty obsidian I think they changed
stone<00:03:34.169> brick<00:03:35.090> slab<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.980> brakes<00:03:38.370> lab<00:03:39.829> cobble

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
stone brick slab the brakes lab cobble

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.089 
stone brick slab the brakes lab cobble
stone<00:03:41.040> slab<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:42.540> then<00:03:42.720> there's<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.230> woods<00:03:43.440> I

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
stone slab and then there's the woods I

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.550 
stone slab and then there's the woods I
think<00:03:44.519> they're<00:03:45.150> they<00:03:45.540> look<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.139> default

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
think they're they look like the default

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.069 
think they're they look like the default
pretty<00:03:46.769> much<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:48.120> think<00:03:48.780> they<00:03:48.900> might<00:03:49.049> have

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
pretty much I think they might have

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.860 
pretty much I think they might have
changed<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:51.150> sand<00:03:51.480> stone<00:03:51.840> slab<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:54.569> stone

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
changed the sand stone slab the stone

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.569 
changed the sand stone slab the stone
slab<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:56.549> mossy<00:03:57.120> stone<00:03:57.620> which<00:03:58.620> yeah<00:03:59.250> looks

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
slab the mossy stone which yeah looks

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.930 
slab the mossy stone which yeah looks
different<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.959> break<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.919> looks<00:04:02.159> different

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.550 

lap<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.680> lazuli<00:04:08.599> it<00:04:09.599> looks<00:04:09.780> different<00:04:09.989> you

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
lap so lazuli it looks different you

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.710 
lap so lazuli it looks different you
know<00:04:10.650> they<00:04:10.799> changed<00:04:11.159> it<00:04:11.190> up<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:12.060> looks<00:04:12.629> like

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
know they changed it up this looks like

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.719 
know they changed it up this looks like
one<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.139> camos<00:04:13.560> from<00:04:13.889> probably<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
one of the camos from probably the

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.469 
one of the camos from probably the
bedrock<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:16.590> i<00:04:16.829> unblock<00:04:17.459> this<00:04:17.940> looks<00:04:18.299> nothing

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
bedrock so i unblock this looks nothing

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.740 
bedrock so i unblock this looks nothing
like<00:04:18.720> iron<00:04:19.049> i'm<00:04:19.349> not<00:04:19.680> sure<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.549> gold<00:04:21.269> block<00:04:21.570> I

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
like iron i'm not sure the gold block I

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.779 
like iron i'm not sure the gold block I
think<00:04:21.989> that's<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.380> default<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.219> can<00:04:23.400> see

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
think that's the default but you can see

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.870 
think that's the default but you can see
a<00:04:23.820> little<00:04:24.090> bit<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.360> pattern<00:04:24.780> up<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.110> there<00:04:25.880> your

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
a little bit of pattern up in there your

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.440 
a little bit of pattern up in there your
character

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
character

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.260 
character
a<00:04:27.860> tree<00:04:28.860> looks<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.160> same<00:04:29.340> if<00:04:29.790> you<00:04:29.970> don't<00:04:30.150> have

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
a tree looks the same if you don't have

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.810 
a tree looks the same if you don't have
any<00:04:30.450> skin<00:04:31.190> diamond<00:04:32.190> block<00:04:32.670> default<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.570> clay

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
any skin diamond block default the clay

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.660 
any skin diamond block default the clay
think<00:04:35.820> they<00:04:35.940> changed<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:38.690> stone<00:04:39.690> brick<00:04:40.670> stone

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
think they changed it stone brick stone

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.890 
think they changed it stone brick stone
break<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.330> stone<00:04:42.840> brick<00:04:43.080> one<00:04:43.410> stone<00:04:43.890> brick

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
break to stone brick one stone brick

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.050 
break to stone brick one stone brick
they<00:04:45.900> did<00:04:46.230> changed<00:04:46.890> up<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.960> red<00:04:48.960> stone<00:04:49.320> or<00:04:50.060> you

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
they did changed up the red stone or you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.320 
they did changed up the red stone or you
can<00:04:51.210> see<00:04:51.450> that<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:54.360> looks<00:04:54.420> different<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:57.150> lab

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330
