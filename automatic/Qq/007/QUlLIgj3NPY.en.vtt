00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
that you can do none of it really

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.190 
that you can do none of it really
matters<00:02:09.619> it's<00:02:10.459> all<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.910> same<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.780> swing<00:02:12.050> your

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
matters it's all the same you swing your

matters it's all the same you swing your

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
sword and then you kill some enemies

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.390 
sword and then you kill some enemies
have<00:02:14.480> smaller<00:02:14.840> hit<00:02:15.110> boxes<00:02:15.530> or<00:02:15.709> move<00:02:15.860> faster

have smaller hit boxes or move faster

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.339 
have smaller hit boxes or move faster
but<00:02:16.580> that's<00:02:16.760> about<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.050> same<00:02:18.319> thing

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
but that's about it it's the same thing

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.160 
but that's about it it's the same thing
over<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.129> over<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.239> can't<00:02:20.510> picture<00:02:20.720> anyone

willingly playing this game for longer

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.530 
willingly playing this game for longer
than

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
than

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.410 
than
our<00:02:24.040> about<00:02:25.040> 30<00:02:25.370> minutes<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.909> you<00:02:26.060> get<00:02:26.239> your

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
our about 30 minutes in you get your

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.050 
our about 30 minutes in you get your
ball<00:02:26.629> this<00:02:27.260> axe<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.799> like<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> glimmer<00:02:28.489> hope<00:02:28.879> of

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
ball this axe is like a glimmer hope of

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.910 
ball this axe is like a glimmer hope of
breaking<00:02:29.269> up<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.810> monotony<00:02:29.930> you've<00:02:30.530> endured

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
breaking up the monotony you've endured

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.170 
breaking up the monotony you've endured
so<00:02:31.280> far<00:02:31.549> yeah<00:02:32.269> that<00:02:32.930> didn't<00:02:33.319> really<00:02:33.530> work<00:02:33.680> out

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
so far yeah that didn't really work out

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.729 
so far yeah that didn't really work out
shooting<00:02:35.180> enemies<00:02:35.329> with<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:35.959> weak-ass<00:02:36.379> bold

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
shooting enemies with that weak-ass bold

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.170 
shooting enemies with that weak-ass bold
felt<00:02:37.069> almost<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.579> swinging<00:02:37.969> your<00:02:38.120> sword

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
felt almost like swinging your sword

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.630 
felt almost like swinging your sword
except<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.930> range<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.379> slightly<00:02:39.709> longer<00:02:40.159> it

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
except the range is slightly longer it

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.470 
except the range is slightly longer it
changes<00:02:41.299> absolutely<00:02:42.230> nothing<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:44.299> game's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
changes absolutely nothing the game's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.240 
changes absolutely nothing the game's
control<00:02:45.049> is<00:02:45.230> some<00:02:45.500> power<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.040> graphics

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
control is some power and the graphics

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.770 
control is some power and the graphics
are<00:02:46.609> nothing<00:02:46.939> to<00:02:46.970> write<00:02:47.060> home<00:02:47.209> about<00:02:47.450> either

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
are nothing to write home about either

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.050 
are nothing to write home about either
I've<00:02:48.650> gotten<00:02:49.069> used<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.370> having<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.639> look<00:02:49.819> at<00:02:49.939> the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
I've gotten used to having a look at the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.879 
I've gotten used to having a look at the
wii's<00:02:50.239> graphics<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.109> different<00:02:51.470> light<00:02:51.620> but

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
wii's graphics in a different light but

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.309 
wii's graphics in a different light but
still<00:02:52.189> it's<00:02:52.760> pretty<00:02:53.000> bad<00:02:53.359> character

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
still it's pretty bad character

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.890 
still it's pretty bad character
animations<00:02:54.950> are<00:02:55.099> pretty<00:02:55.400> ugly<00:02:55.609> as<00:02:55.970> well

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.360 

that's<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.139> what<00:03:00.260> this<00:03:00.470> game<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.769> ugly

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
that's just what this game is ugly

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.729 
that's just what this game is ugly
killing<00:03:02.239> many<00:03:02.450> enemies<00:03:02.870> all<00:03:03.139> at<00:03:03.260> once<00:03:03.470> has<00:03:03.709> a

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
killing many enemies all at once has a

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.710 
killing many enemies all at once has a
small<00:03:04.129> appeal<00:03:04.430> but<00:03:04.579> that's<00:03:04.760> not<00:03:04.939> even<00:03:05.239> nearly

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
small appeal but that's not even nearly

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.390 
small appeal but that's not even nearly
enough<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.079> ever<00:03:06.200> motivated<00:03:06.470> towards<00:03:07.129> playing

enough to ever motivated towards playing

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.670 
enough to ever motivated towards playing
this<00:03:07.519> game<00:03:07.760> again<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.419> suppose<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:09.230> game<00:03:09.409> does

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
this game again I suppose this game does

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.039 
this game again I suppose this game does
have<00:03:09.919> its<00:03:10.129> historical<00:03:10.879> Hill<00:03:11.209> but<00:03:11.659> honestly

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
have its historical Hill but honestly

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.379 
have its historical Hill but honestly
