and<00:00:27.120> a<00:00:28.120> C<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:31.060> for<00:00:31.330> an<00:00:31.480> F<00:00:31.690> you<00:00:32.110> start<00:00:32.410> off<00:00:32.560> with

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
and a C I so for an F you start off with

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.190 
and a C I so for an F you start off with
the<00:00:33.100> second<00:00:33.700> string<00:00:34.150> on<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.510> first<00:00:34.720> fret<00:00:34.870> and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200

the second string on the first fret and
the<00:00:35.410> top<00:00:35.650> string<00:00:35.980> or<00:00:36.220> the<00:00:36.400> fourth<00:00:36.610> string<00:00:36.970> on

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
the top string or the fourth string on

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.070 
the top string or the fourth string on
the<00:00:37.420> second<00:00:37.720> fret<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.489> that's<00:00:42.850> an<00:00:42.970> F<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:43.809> the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
the second fret so that's an F and the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.440 
the second fret so that's an F and the
next<00:00:44.379> one<00:00:44.590> is<00:00:44.770> an<00:00:44.890> E<00:00:45.070> minor<00:00:45.280> which<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.940> you<00:00:46.270> just

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
next one is an E minor which is you just

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.140 
next one is an E minor which is you just
take<00:00:46.809> this<00:00:47.500> finger<00:00:47.890> off<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.280> so<00:00:48.820> you're<00:00:48.970> left

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
take this finger off and so you're left

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.520 
take this finger off and so you're left
with<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.480> top<00:00:49.690> string<00:00:49.960> on<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.320> second<00:00:50.770> fret

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.100 

that's<00:00:56.530> an<00:00:56.710> E<00:00:56.890> minor<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:58.150> next<00:00:58.480> one<00:00:58.630> is<00:00:58.870> a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
that's an E minor and the next one is a

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.940 
that's an E minor and the next one is a
b-flat<00:01:00.300> I'm<00:01:01.300> not<00:01:01.510> too<00:01:01.660> sure<00:01:01.840> about<00:01:01.900> this<00:01:02.200> chord

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
b-flat I'm not too sure about this chord

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.580 
b-flat I'm not too sure about this chord
though<00:01:03.130> so<00:01:03.700> it's<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.300> bottom<00:01:04.930> two<00:01:05.170> strings

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
though so it's the bottom two strings

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.690 
though so it's the bottom two strings
and<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.890> first<00:01:06.130> fret<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:07.420> it's<00:01:07.660> these<00:01:07.960> two<00:01:08.290> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and the first fret so it's these two and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.609 
and the first fret so it's these two and
the<00:01:09.700> third<00:01:10.210> string<00:01:10.630> on<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.899> second<00:01:11.200> fret<00:01:11.259> and

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
the third string on the second fret and

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:19.170 
the third string on the second fret and
the<00:01:11.860> top<00:01:12.130> string<00:01:12.399> on<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.910> third<00:01:13.420> fret<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
the top string on the third fret so

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.260 
the top string on the third fret so
that's<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.960> B<00:01:20.380> flat<00:01:20.440> chord<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.700> last<00:01:21.970> one

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
that's the B flat chord and the last one

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.080 
that's the B flat chord and the last one
is<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.479> C<00:01:22.899> which<00:01:23.320> is<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.619> easiest<00:01:23.920> one<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.430> it's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
is a C which is the easiest one and it's

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.740 
is a C which is the easiest one and it's
the<00:01:25.330> bottom<00:01:25.750> string<00:01:26.110> on<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.380> third<00:01:26.560> fret<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:30.750> so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
the bottom string on the third fret I so

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.289 
the bottom string on the third fret I so
for<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.049> strumming<00:01:32.380> pattern<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:33.010> sort<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.030> just

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
for the strumming pattern I sort of just

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.180 
for the strumming pattern I sort of just
do

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.660 

down<00:01:38.090> up<00:01:38.450> up<00:01:38.810> down<00:01:38.870> up<00:01:39.590> up<00:01:39.710> down

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
down up up down up up down

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.060 
down up up down up up down
oops<00:01:41.300> yeah<00:01:42.170> down<00:01:42.800> up<00:01:43.280> down<00:01:43.880> up<00:01:44.570> down<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.920> then

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
oops yeah down up down up down and then

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.070 
oops yeah down up down up down and then
you<00:01:46.220> move<00:01:46.370> on<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.700> next<00:01:46.880> board<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.750> then

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
you move on to the next board and then

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.440 
you move on to the next board and then
sometimes<00:01:51.710> it's<00:01:52.100> kind<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.760> longer<00:01:53.060> than<00:01:53.090> usual

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
sometimes it's kind of longer than usual

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.200 
sometimes it's kind of longer than usual
cause<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.260> think<00:01:54.860> it's<00:01:55.190> four<00:01:55.460> counts<00:01:55.940> but

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
cause it's I think it's four counts but

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.270 
cause it's I think it's four counts but
sometimes<00:01:56.690> it's<00:01:56.930> longer<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.650> just<00:01:58.070> have

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
sometimes it's longer so you just have

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.060 
sometimes it's longer so you just have
to<00:01:58.310> sustain<00:01:58.640> these<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.360> code<00:01:59.690> for<00:02:00.080> just<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.890> few

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
to sustain these in code for just a few

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.180 
to sustain these in code for just a few
seconds<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.840> will<00:02:02.960> play<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:04.160> song

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
seconds and I will play you the song

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
seconds and I will play you the song
slowly<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:05.750> start<00:02:06.050> off<00:02:06.110> with<00:02:06.170> an<00:02:06.470> F<00:02:11.560> a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
slowly so you start off with an F a

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:30.340 
slowly so you start off with an F a
minor<00:02:16.780> move<00:02:17.780> on<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> B<00:02:18.920> flat<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.840> do<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
minor move on to the B flat just do that

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.410 
minor move on to the B flat just do that
for<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> entire<00:02:30.830> song<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.670> slowly<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.150> would

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
for the entire song so slowly I would

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.440 
for the entire song so slowly I would
play<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.750> twice<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:34.280> start<00:02:34.640> with<00:02:34.760> an<00:02:34.880> F<00:02:35.120> it

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
play it twice and start with an F it

00:02:35.450 --> 00:03:02.990 
play it twice and start with an F it
goes<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:39.230> minor

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.820
