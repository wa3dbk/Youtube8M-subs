 Hello, you are watching the origami channel 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:11.340
 what we will do with you today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.799
 wonderful fighter plane rollers 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.310
 unusual design excellent 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.910
 balanced and flies great and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.390
 give you much pleasure let's 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.930
 make such a plane take a sheet 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.080
 a4 paper and and fold in half 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.590
 it is valuable to demand from the party on 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.590
 hand structure 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.880
 role we are building 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.570
 opening except stockings warehouses 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.829
 center line lower these halves 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.829
 and the center does not eat, and on the one hand 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.440
 days you it is neat to them from the second 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.440
 parties 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.180
 then 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.020
 turn over our blank but 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.680
 world side and turn down appreciated 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.450
 only the tip of this line is at a distance of 2 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:34.860
 centimeter away from the edge here we have to 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 to be a centimeter promatch 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.480
 then antiba im our block here for this 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.480
 the lines 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.610
 turn over our billet and now 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.090
 attention is very difficult for us this moment 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.740
 the side 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.740
 with him here, this line 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.939
 Sydney 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.000
 here it is leveled off with us how important this 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:22.500
 Only half of the country we see 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.490
 matched off the line and in the aisle 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.990
 and keeps this side straighten our 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:35.910
 quotes aligned closer not 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.010
 continue to bend here from the little corner and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.270
 further to our leaf straightened 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.040
 but pay attention to this line 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.040
 don't match this one 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.810
 that's what this part is about and the end of 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.060
 not smoothed and now he love this 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.500
 corner 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.500
 here on this line in the middle 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.300
 what we have 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.810
 sex parties do the same going on 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:17.790
 shelves and so line sydney more precisely 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.780
 I'll run this part here not then 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.760
 then straighten it there. 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.130
 so that if we had all exactly 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.980
 and again this 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.980
 this side does not coincide with this country 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.200
 chickens postponed 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.500
 and beat that side of the middle line 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.440
 here 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.140
 now each of these corners is average in 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.470
 center line from the third party and 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.470
 center line 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.159
 literally kurakina 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.510
 with the tip really help anyone here 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:19.540
 it turns out 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.540
 neatly continued the other side 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.520
 tip feeds not 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.850
 that's what happened now 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.850
 I fold the workpiece in half 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.190
 and put on our wings you're not this one 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.190
 side and here's this line 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.820
 we go on the one hand 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.940
 turn over and not symmetrical on any 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.940
 the other side 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.910
 here 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.550
 that's what we did 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.580
 now this ponytail and big court is 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.660
 Ukraine somewhere a centimeter from the fire he 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.660
 leave a bite 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:39.000
 and so we straightened 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.000
 reveal and die inside with halk 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.429
 So 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:48.919
 we will have a tail and there either him 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:51.139
 little wings on one side 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.539
 symmetrically 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:58.319
 compress the other side 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.319
 straighten our billet 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:09.960
 such a wonderful fighter with a sharp 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:12.320
 a nose that flies beautifully 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.470
 will give you pleasure 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.230
