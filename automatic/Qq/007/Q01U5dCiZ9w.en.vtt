00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.820
 hello dear friends ask me 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.730
 question what kinds are i and about 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.090
 a procedure for close prices is the most 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.390
 housing 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.110
 well, in principle, the difference of some 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.420
 global 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.160
 on the types and types of housing that are on 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:34.239
 the territory of the former USSR probably a little 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.030
 there is also the possibility to rent a room 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.699
 along with someone there 1 big apartment 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.250
 Kompashka shoots yes and everyone lives his 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.739
 the room is paid its share of the total 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.340
 apartment cost is the easiest 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:55.610
 option student option second 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:59.200
 option option renting an apartment again 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.200
 price varies by room size 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.670
 studio apartment here is called 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 bachelor 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.250
 she usually does not have separate 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.490
 separate isolated rooms 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.510
 small partition between 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.980
 living space and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.940
 her own heart on a separate 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.220
 a bathroom 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.050
 and the cost of bachelor and varies by 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.240
 differently depending on the province of 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.480
 city ​​size but you can start 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.420
 it's about cold there 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.979
 350 dollars and accordingly where is here 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.979
 780 if we are talking about 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.990
 big cities like approach because 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.610
 Toronto 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.610
 the next level is 2 3 4 5 and so 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.290
 further from the room but it is clear again that 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.350
 the price then will vary important 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.140
 the moment we talk about renting a room 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.360
 apartments in the houses is that before the ointment 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.789
 divided into 2 categories and this also affects 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.360
 for the final price 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.390
 houses that are made of concrete 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.180
 concrete houses have good sound insulation 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.150
 they tend to hurt me new and at home 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.040
 which is made of wood and wood 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.150
 overlapping with drywall there and so 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.010
 further options are cheaper there 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.260
 accordingly if you take an apartment 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.540
 it was houses hardwood floors 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.480
 made of plasterboard by your walls so on 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.129
 you have to be very careful in order 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.230
 not to fall 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.120
 bad situation with your neighbors 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.340
 because you will suffer their neighbors 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.689
 get noisy or big 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.840
 the number of children who behave 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.970
 noisy 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.900
 again this is a common point 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.230
 choose neighbors in terms of their 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.090
 time of his emotional brin sign this 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.329
 not in terms of racism from some yes 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.609
 because each and every carcass 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.720
 cultures have each time with their aspects 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:14.389
 his moments of behavior in particular are very 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.449
 do not like to settle near the Indians 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.389
 because hindu or cook for 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.490
 European nose smells that 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.440
 emit narrowly she 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.090
 crying gagging 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.300
 and vice versa, if you choose 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.700
 neighbors all seats chinese auto 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.310
 as a rule it is calm and quiet people 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.940
 who in no way annoyed 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.319
 you 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.909
 miserable 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.980
 and gives you no trouble 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.280
 no discomfort 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.870
 on the contrary are beautiful types 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.989
 neighbors who will always help you 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.659
 if necessary, and will always 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.030
 thinking about doesn't interfere for nickel and so 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.370
 Further 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.980
 and actually the last type of housing 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.130
 which is just different from what 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.110
 have in 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.870
