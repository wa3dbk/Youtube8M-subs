00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 i 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.969
 the passing of the patterns 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.640

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.840

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.320
 the first to leave 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.980
 Of course there is the technique that 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.950
 technically it was valued again always 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.900
 putting putting you in the finals there 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.300

 someone we had to laugh thanks 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.540
 for participating so close and so far away 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.850
 I'm very close and I ended up submerging it 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.350
 the truth that if one of the most fenced 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.440
 friend of this was the murcia and challenge to the 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.160
 week was great and hope that the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.160
 punishment now 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.550
 how about friends how are they how they got 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.350
 account lost the challenge I came to 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.150
 fulfill my word to wash the 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.050
 frets but not that they finish 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.050
 breakfast the testers 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.290
 you stay 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.360

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.030
 to give the same that I want to tell the 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.030
 pitcher before you wash the phrases 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:41.390
 but there could be 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.880
 the latter earned him this pressure 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.390
 it may seem that you have to lose them, you have to 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.390
 have them 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.520
 among the guests the food
