00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.780
 we are condemned facts that warn of 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.549
 that something anomalous happens with the earth 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.529
 news and news from the world 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.590
 devastating earthquake in nepal that has 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:19.180
 claimed the lives of thousands of people 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.040
 mysterious natural phenomena alarm 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.320
 to scientists and the needles of 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.510
 called clock of the end of the world are 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.390
 advanced to three minutes before 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.730
 midnight we invite you to review the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.619
 recent events that demonstrate 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.719
 that humanity is walking on the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.690
 knife edge devastating 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.539
 earthquake of magnitude 7 9 shook the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.460
 last Saturday nepal leaving more than 6,000 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.879
 dead and about 8 million affected 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.640
 throughout the country the earthquake caused numerous 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.940
 material damage and severely affected a 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.249
 area between 1,600 and 3,200 kilometers 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.010
 square an area that goes from kathmandu 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.109
 po to face we are not saying that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.269
 be late to act but you have to 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.670
 understand that we have less and less 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.920
 possibilities to take measures in addition 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.049
 the earthquake caused that in few 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.000
 seconds a part of india is 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.409
 will move up to three meters towards the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.140
 n northern below 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.909
 As noted by Coll Stark Professor 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.859
 research associate in the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.579
 observatory of the land lamont-doherty 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:23.920
 from the university of columbia usa el 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.450
 natural disaster triggered alarms throughout 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.909
 the world and numerous experts 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.369
 they recognized that many areas of our 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.770
 potentially vulnerable planet there 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.509
 are prepared to face this 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.030
 type of cataclysms 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.039
 in addition some scientists like the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.560
 professor of geophysics and risks 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.020
 bilinski climbers warned him of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.750
 a series of extreme geological events 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.969
 like earthquakes volcanoes and tsunamis 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.879
 comparable to the devastating earthquake 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.679
 nepal that could be coming together 

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:55.599
 to the disappearance of ice and 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.610
 sea level rise the 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.200
 Floods planned for the 21st century 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.360
 they are inevitable

 acevedo maquila teacher of the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.299
 university college of london quoted by 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.700
 the newsweek magazine climate change 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.829
 can play a fundamental role in 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.870
 the activation of certain faults that 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.730
 could cause the death of a large 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.220
 number of people said 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.560
 meanwhile even before the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.989
 earthquake in nepal researchers 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.510
 British alerted 33 percent 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.209
 of probabilities of a mega eruption 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.220
 volcanic this century that would be equal or 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.260
 even greater than the tragedy of the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.870
 eruption of the Indonesian volcano tambora 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.879
 that left 70 thousand deaths and 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.340
 inspired Mary Shelley to write her 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.920
 famous frankenstein phenomena 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.230
 disturbing other than disasters 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.569
 natural phenomena and cataclysms 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.400
 less noticeable but not less 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.129
 disturbing to the experts of 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.200
 different parts of the world so the 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.359
 American scientists are 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.549
 alarmed by a mysterious mass of 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.379
 hot water detected in the Pacific 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.480
 that could be the cause of 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.510
 anomalous weather conditions 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.209
 registered in the USA in recent years 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.700
 as the serious drought suffered by the state 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.160
 of california and the harsh winters that 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.599
 have affected the northeast of the country of 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.700
 according to the study of the 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.069
 researchers from the University of 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.459
 washington it is a huge mass 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.510
 of water about 90 meters deep 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.090
 baptized as the stain 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.590
 It stretches some 1,600 kilometers 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.530
 along the west coast of the continent 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.170
 American from alaska to mexico 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.689
 For her part, the British researcher 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.090
 reads brian from bat university 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.459
 alerted this month of April calls 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.799
 dead zones that extend through the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.780
 ocean and threaten the marine fauna and 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.060
 may result in a serious problem for 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.640
 humanity to this we must add the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.349
 strange climatic phenomena that each 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.530
 they are more frequent in our 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.379
 planet like heat waves droughts or by 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.030
 the contrary the anomalous rains the 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.760
 guilty humans 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.379
 eric fisher and useless challenge scientists 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.060
 of the Institute of Sciences of the 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.609
 atmosphere and climate in zÃ¼rich 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.889
 consider that human activity is what 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.959
 that causes global warming that 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.700
 in turn influences the frequency each 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.459
 greater weather phenomena 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.039
 anomalous humanity will not survive the 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.130
 next thousand years if you do not leave the 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.590
 earth and escapes the cosmos for example from 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.930
 agreement with the scientists the increase 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.280
 of the average temperature of the planet that 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.520
 it has its origin in the revolution 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.970
 19th century industrial 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.759
 and causes irregular heat in 75% of 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.560
 the registered cases and is responsible 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.830
 of 18 percent rainfall 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.319
 super abundant since the beginning of 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.990
 global warming in the course of 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.060
 30 years of extreme heat have 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.360
 been four times more frequent than 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.849
 previously explained fincher his opinion 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.550
 adds to many other voices that blame 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.680
 to humans from cataclysms 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.139
 environmental according to dominique bobrek 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.300
 expert in climate protection the 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.699
 people when changing the environment 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.620
 changes the life of all humanity in 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.229
 comparison with the start time of 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.389
 the so-called industrial revolution now 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.800
 the carbon dioxide content in the 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:18.900
 atmosphere has increased by 40% like this if 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.659
 we return tens of millions of years 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.400
 back we'll see that during that period there 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.000
 there were changes of much 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.610
 importance as well as from the decade of 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.440
 1830 until today it is clear that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.900
 if for millions of years not 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.190
 there were many changes and suddenly there is a 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.390
 abrupt change 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.220
 that means 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.650
 something is happening on earth 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.930
 colossal affirmed the French expert 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.410
 during a conference last week 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.110
 we are condemned in front of all these 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.830
 threats the most pessimistic scientists 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.480
 or maybe more realistic warn that 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.960
 we have fewer and fewer possibilities 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.940
 to save the planet this week the 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.130
 scientists have moved forward 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.080
 needles of the symbolic clock of the end of 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.540
 world that marks how much time is left 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.030
 until the day of final judgment at three 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.370
 minutes before midnight due to the 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.500
 growing threats of climate change 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.420
 and nuclear proliferation 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.300
 this new overtaking has been the 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.910
 second in the last three years in the 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:26.490
 year 2012 the needles were advanced 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:29.460
 one minute from 23 54 to 23 55 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.680
 also because of climate change not 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.840
 We are saying that it's too late to 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.270
 act but you have to understand that we 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.490
 there are fewer and fewer possibilities for 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.680
 take action commented that in this 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.990
 Benedict one of the representatives of 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.900
 bulletin of the atomic magazine follow 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.850
 and who created the famous watch the highlight 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.430
 British astrophysicist stephen hawking 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.100
 he assured that humanity will not survive 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.980
 the next thousand years if he does not leave 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.390
 the earth and escapes the cosmos 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.150
 we have to continue investigating the 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.130
 space for the future of humanity 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.470
 I do not think we're going to survive other 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.140
 thousand if we do not escape from our fragile 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.570
 planet said the scientist while 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.060
 So many already warn that with 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.370
 your actions humans could be 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.160
 able to destroy not only the earth 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.750
 but the whole solar system today 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.750
