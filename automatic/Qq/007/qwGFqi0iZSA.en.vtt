00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.310
 this is berlin the sgd android it is 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.180
 friday and this is android daily 8 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.010
 and i am army i have now 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.720
 First, welcome to the android 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.460
 Every day we have a lot of topics 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.570
 small info but still for all themselves 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.800
 maybe yesterday we wondered 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.900
 have changed a bit and that is 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.099
 we no longer with the full android 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.240
 daily on facebook but on 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.070
 facebook is only available for the teaser 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 So that your facebook followers is so ok 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.969
 that is there and then that's that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.829
 complete video just on the side too 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.690
 see on giga DE / android or halt 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.950
 on youtube so best page 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.460
 bookmark youtube then subscribe 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.520
 missed 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 in no case what was going on today 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.430
 weekend and even in the heat 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.719
 somehow not so much but one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.050
 then we have some chic themes 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.489
 nevertheless htc had eternal worry child of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.379
 makes us great manufacturer actually 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.079
 good devices even if not the m9 now 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.850
 so the bang was but are in one 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.129
 lasting crisis has been different for years 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 hard to say so for a while 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.100
 you said they have such a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.180
 fanned model politics that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.260
 everything does not work because in the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.640
 middle class of the beginner class 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.619
 not selling properly then 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.700
 they themselves realized 2012 was 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.189
 so we have to look at the upper class 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 somehow, they also have a focus 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 so half tried at that time too 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.720
 have degraded and that has somehow 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.520
 all brought not really much 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.049
 Now there is a new message from today 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.880
 there is now a tall doner htc 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.140
 said hey let's get out of the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.580
 crisis to come the product range 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.380
 reduce and dismantle 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.939
 We have a light as in this 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.680
 read this message had the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.810
 Colleague can do it in a thick 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.299
 message summarized so if you 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.430
 Tonight also a rip in the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.540
 want to experience magix read the articles on 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.820
 k / /roid would crack a magix 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.990
 also a rumored samsung tablet 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.759
 cause that in an Indian 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.090
 surfaced database is to a 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.329
 I have no display size in one 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.399
 journalist school learned huhu that should 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.079
 have a display of 18 4 inches 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.869
 gigantic as that would be bigger than mine 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.390
 as my laptop can stand around 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.710
 Of course, that 's for the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.060
 professional area makes sense 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.530
 So now if somebody knows somehow 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.319
 extensive graphical applications with 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.479
 makes 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.799
 Can you use something like that or 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.629
 also for multitasking one can of course 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.159
 in fact, then very convenient several 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.290
 run apps side by side 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.730
 that is why it is the presumption in the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.189
 space that's just such a samsung galaxy 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.239
 could be tab 18.4 pro and that 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.790
 maybe a bit then 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.439
 positioned against any ipad pro 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.969
 that he has been through the months since 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:32.829
 rumored kitchen was butt then what 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.450
 exciting about smartphone cameras 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.950
 So smartphone cameras are now 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.629
 if you are good smartphone 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.310
 david city for example the lg g4 or 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.319
 Also the Samsung Galaxy S 6 are the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 results at or above 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.260
 the level of compact cameras i believe 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.760
 You can say that or so 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.169
 compact camera is needed nowadays 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.790
 not anymore if you have good smartphone 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.629
 what they do not achieve yet is the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.540
 quality of course 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.480
 mirror reflex cameras so the slr like 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.980
 which are also called in technical jargon 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.019
 now working course the smartphone 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.489
 industry anyway because that better 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.989
 make some point the sense that at 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.519
 claas smartphone that is actually 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.019
 totally photography and that was natural 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.959
 great if that just as great pictures 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.939
 and a startup called light that 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.980
 he actually has a smartphone 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.599
 camera develops on several 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.150
 different lenses based and thereby 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.500
 to achieve results such as a dslr 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.939
 we do not have pictures of 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.769
 seen, however, there is a picture 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.239
 how it constructs this 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.709
 looks with these multiple lenses 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.180
 relatively interesting actually as the 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.729
 Half of the back of the smartphone 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.199
 its actually full of lentils and the 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.819
 have an awful lot of investment grade 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.810
 Collected means this prototype 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.519
 which they must have built 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.009
 at least a few people among others 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.840
 even convinced foxconn that 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.220
 the potential has the whole so relative 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.239
 exciting maybe that will be where 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.500
 We will be in the next two years 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.150
 really no digital 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.150
 mirror cameras need more 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.489
 hahaha i was on the 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.579
 journalist school frank was at the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.019
 clownschule so and land stage seems there 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.090
 we will not get around today 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.139
 stage time is so exploit in 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.699
 Android almost all Android devices 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.750
 We have had concerns in the last few days 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.919
 as always reported about that 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.750
 telekom as a provider has the 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.919
 automatic download of mms then 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.509
 first stopped there so nothing 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.910
 happened google had yesterday 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.200
 be announced 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.520
 the nexus devices of course now 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.190
 primarily provide with patches and 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.380
 but also in the future 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.850
 monthly security fix is ​​for 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.600
 Android devices for next devices 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.549
 let out 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.080
 meanwhile samsung and lg 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.489
 We said that we did 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.930
 Now we too will be starting monthly 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.480
 our products with security updates 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.700
 supply as well as htc have at least times 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.520
 said yes we bring patches for stage 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.810
 screams out two things now 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.300
 For one thing , we have articles where we are 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.250
 our overview of the factory image is 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.330
 if necessary updated for nexus devices 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.130
 that is, if you do not wait 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.410
 Wanted to give her this safety 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.640
 patched the firmware automatically 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.990
 your device war you can the underneath 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.570
 load and flash yourself and you're off 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.370
 Immediately almost safe the other is the one 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.540
 not online yet until you see it 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.300
 is he secretly online then i have 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.160
 just a little analytic piece 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.050
 written about why stage seems in 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.760
 that sense was good for the android os 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.930
 because it has led to that 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.100
 now a kind of shoulder 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.320
 between google manufacturers 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.000
 Providers somehow get started where the 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.290
 recognize the update not only shows 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 are cosmetic and somehow new 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.620
 Features that are not important 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.240
 but that is security relevant 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.530
 and that it is accordingly important and 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.360
 meaningful and actually mandatory 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.610
 necessary is that android devices of all 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.170
 couleur of all manufacturers regularly with 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.660
 updates are supplied especially the 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.130
 Android os through its modular through 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.540
 the modular construction of the google in the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.250
 recent years was a lot of the 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.230
 the best prerequisites for that are 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.820
 stop also a htc or even travel in 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.500
 the usa provider just such a 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.030
 safety fix can play without that 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.400
 complete complete complete firnberg 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:40.650
 So having to build again can do that too 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:43.020
 on giga de android that's it 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.340
 already one gets the stage fix the nexus 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.860
 next svf 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.330
 this is our advertising slogan here the 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.350
 we are in the elevator all day long 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.120
 form are nexus 5 i am a owner 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.650
 of the nexus one and I'll tell you afterwards 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.060
 then I'll bottle it, I wish you 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.560
 a fantastic weekend even if 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.750
 it should be brooding hot ride 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.760
 somehow in it's best and there 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.560
 cool it and then I'm glad you 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.150
 Monday at hopefully rain and 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.440
 to see winter temperatures again 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.440
 have you until then
