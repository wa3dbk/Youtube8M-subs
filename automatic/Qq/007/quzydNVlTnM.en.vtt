00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.510 

there's<00:00:18.540> Eddie<00:00:19.349> you're<00:00:20.040> being<00:00:20.279> controlled

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
there's Eddie you're being controlled

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:32.600 
there's Eddie you're being controlled
fight<00:00:21.360> it<00:00:21.540> fight<00:00:30.500> he<00:00:31.500> took<00:00:31.649> off<00:00:31.800> again<00:00:31.829> yeah<00:00:32.489> if

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
fight it fight he took off again yeah if

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.920 
fight it fight he took off again yeah if
only<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> same

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
only you do the same

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.779 
only you do the same
O'Hara<00:00:34.589> if<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.070> don't<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.519> can't

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
O'Hara if you don't get that I can't

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.669 
O'Hara if you don't get that I can't
turn<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.000> back<00:00:36.269> on<00:00:36.329> danger<00:00:36.899> no<00:00:37.199> matter<00:00:37.469> what

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
turn my back on danger no matter what

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:38.240 
turn my back on danger no matter what
the<00:00:37.800> cost

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the cost

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.470 
the cost
then<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> got<00:00:38.730> no<00:00:38.879> business<00:00:39.030> calling

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
then you got no business calling

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
then you got no business calling

guess<00:00:42.089> what<00:00:42.269> else<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.570> am<00:00:42.600> still<00:00:42.989> alive<00:00:43.379> let's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
guess what else I am still alive let's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.380 
guess what else I am still alive let's
hope<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> keep<00:00:44.969> saying<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.359> same

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
hope you get to keep saying the same

we've<00:01:14.510> been<00:01:14.659> a<00:01:14.690> lot<00:01:14.900> of<00:01:15.049> things<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.409> each<00:01:15.440> other

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
we've been a lot of things to each other

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.320 
we've been a lot of things to each other
Eddie<00:01:15.979> but<00:01:16.310> you've<00:01:16.490> never<00:01:16.700> been<00:01:16.970> anyone's

Eddie<00:01:25.490> listen<00:01:25.790> you've<00:01:26.390> got<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> chip<00:01:26.900> inside

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
Eddie listen you've got a chip inside

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.580 
Eddie listen you've got a chip inside
you<00:01:27.470> that's<00:01:27.680> making<00:01:27.830> you<00:01:28.100> do<00:01:28.280> this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
you that's making you do this

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:37.749 
you that's making you do this
just<00:01:30.590> making<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.799> longer<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:37.280> things<00:01:37.520> in

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
just making it the longer that things in

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.190 
just making it the longer that things in
you<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.060> more<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:38.390> rewiring<00:01:38.840> you're

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
you the more it's rewiring you're

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:52.500 
you the more it's rewiring you're
thinking<00:01:39.619> no<00:01:40.130> no

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.090 

Barker<00:01:53.510> what<00:01:53.990> are<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.170> doing<00:01:54.500> because<00:01:54.830> it's

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
Barker what are you doing because it's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.160 
Barker what are you doing because it's
causing<00:01:55.460> major<00:01:55.670> problems<00:01:56.300> here<00:01:56.390> I've<00:01:56.810> got<00:01:57.050> to

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
causing major problems here I've got to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.870 
causing major problems here I've got to
get<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.350> atomic<00:01:57.740> energy<00:01:57.890> regulators<00:01:58.580> out<00:01:58.760> of

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
get the atomic energy regulators out of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.750 
get the atomic energy regulators out of
the<00:01:58.970> way<00:01:59.090> so<00:01:59.150> they're<00:01:59.480> not<00:01:59.510> destroyed<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:00.760> I'm

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
the way so they're not destroyed so I'm

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.790 
the way so they're not destroyed so I'm
in<00:02:01.970> danger<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:05.240> explosions<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.320> your<00:02:06.590> head

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
in danger of explosions on your head

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.800 
in danger of explosions on your head
you're<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.490> one<00:02:07.610> who<00:02:07.670> told<00:02:07.850> me<00:02:08.000> about<00:02:08.119> quantum

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
you're the one who told me about quantum

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.530 
you're the one who told me about quantum
causality<00:02:09.470> yeah<00:02:09.920> well<00:02:10.130> now<00:02:10.940> I'm<00:02:11.090> telling<00:02:11.180> you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
causality yeah well now I'm telling you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.600 
causality yeah well now I'm telling you
to<00:02:11.630> fix<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.170> sheesh<00:02:13.070> what<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.370> grouch<00:02:15.580> okay

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
to fix this sheesh what a grouch okay

the<00:02:17.300> first<00:02:17.510> regulators<00:02:18.050> say<00:02:18.430> radiation<00:02:19.430> level

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the first regulators say radiation level

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.760 
the first regulators say radiation level
is<00:02:19.790> dropping<00:02:20.000> with<00:02:20.450> my<00:02:20.840> costumes<00:02:21.290> providing

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
is dropping with my costumes providing

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.740 
is dropping with my costumes providing
me<00:02:21.830> some<00:02:22.040> protection<00:02:22.190> from<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.850> but<00:02:23.000> it's<00:02:23.480> not

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
me some protection from it but it's not

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.990 
me some protection from it but it's not
gonna<00:02:23.930> last<00:02:24.170> forever<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:25.459> give<00:02:25.700> me<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.820> minute

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
gonna last forever just give me a minute

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.960 
gonna last forever just give me a minute
to<00:02:26.270> take<00:02:26.420> care<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.930> other<00:02:27.080> two<00:02:27.350> regulators

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
to take care of the other two regulators

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:51.940 
to take care of the other two regulators
minutes<00:02:28.970> about<00:02:29.150> all<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.510> have

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.560 

I've<00:02:52.950> gotten<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.340> second<00:02:53.670> regulator<00:02:54.030> safety

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
I've gotten the second regulator safety

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.270 
I've gotten the second regulator safety
is<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.990> still<00:02:55.260> affecting<00:02:55.710> things<00:02:55.830> on<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.220> end

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
is it still affecting things on your end

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.270 
is it still affecting things on your end
yeah<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.570> still<00:02:58.290> dropping<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
yeah it's still dropping but the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.370 
yeah it's still dropping but the
cumulative<00:02:59.910> effect<00:03:00.270> if<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:00.900> not<00:03:01.080> stopped

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
cumulative effect if it's not stopped

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.530 
cumulative effect if it's not stopped
entirely<00:03:04.460> still<00:03:07.850> plenty<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.880> make<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.270> go

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
entirely still plenty to make this go

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.940 
entirely still plenty to make this go
away<00:03:09.570> or<00:03:09.990> not<00:03:14.960> you're<00:03:15.960> not<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.110> one<00:03:16.320> end<00:03:16.680> up<00:03:16.830> as

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
away or not you're not the one end up as

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:35.830 
away or not you're not the one end up as
