00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.360
 Hello in this video possible show how to highlight that last 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.919
 installed programs in the Start menu under Windows can switch off briefly 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.720
 I've installed van der Burgh installed on this system and if I have 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.189
 now wait for the start press then this fanfare will be down here 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.810
 highlighted 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.050
 and all programs exactly the same here the corresponding entry 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.780
 if I do not go over it then he will stop 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.060
 highlighted 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.470
 probably so that we can find it much faster if 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 who is looking for the installation 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.710
 There are certainly users for whom this can be useful 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.080
 inexperienced users or older users will appreciate that 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.170
 Of course, after a while, the distance over or loses 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.370
 last installed application this special status again and Event # 11 in 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.110
 this year to the group as well 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.890
 any other countries they have not even mentally noticed or 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.950
 but simply will not use this feature 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.710
 According to the principle of small cattle also makes manure could this function 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.330
 switch off because with this feature, the start-up must have one before viewing 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.520
 after I like Kik on the bath 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.970
 before displaying the menu always first check what entries the now 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.790
 to emphasize 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.730
 less is more or less is faster the profits are natural 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.350
 not really any but they could just turn off cattle to turn it off 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.049
 Just click on our 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.420
 almost go to the free area right mouse button 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.420
 we call the property in the context menu 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.850
 click on the tabs Startmenu tab 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.799
 then we just adapt Wartenberg also put on it come quite 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.520
 clear inferior and have last installed as the penultimate checkbox last 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.710
 Highlight programs 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.780
 just take out the checkbox 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.280
 and that was it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.120
 under Windows XP 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.100
 relatively similar also free area 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.350
 on the taskbar at the right mouse button properties 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.429
 start the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.919
 to adjust 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.919
 expanded 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.769
 and here we have the area 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.719
 start the settings the second checkbox last installed programs 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.449
 highlight 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 also remove the checkbox 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:26.730
 take over 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.619
 okay again 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.249
 and the Wars then under Windows XP
