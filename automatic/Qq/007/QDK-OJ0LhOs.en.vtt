bunch<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.470> stuff<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.069> then<00:02:32.790> what<00:02:33.150> i<00:02:33.180> did<00:02:33.390> was<00:02:33.510> i

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
bunch of stuff and then what i did was i

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.990 
bunch of stuff and then what i did was i
turned<00:02:33.989> around<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.190> could<00:02:35.340> see<00:02:35.400> this

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
point at it you see this switch in here

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.860

there's<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.269> switch<00:02:42.660> right<00:02:43.200> there<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:45.630> kind

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
there's a switch right there it's kind

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.210 
there's a switch right there it's kind
of<00:02:45.930> hard<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.230> see<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:46.620> get<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.829> flashlights

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
of hard to see go get the flashlights

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.759 
of hard to see go get the flashlights
run<00:02:48.079> just<00:02:49.079> give<00:02:49.170> me<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.260> second<00:02:49.560> I'll<00:02:49.620> get<00:02:49.739> a

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
run just give me a second I'll get a

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.089 
run just give me a second I'll get a
flashlight<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:53.329> I'll<00:02:54.329> show<00:02:54.599> you<00:02:54.829> so<00:02:55.829> I<00:02:55.860> I

flashlight and I'll show you so I I

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.280 
flashlight and I'll show you so I I
think<00:02:56.700> what's<00:02:56.849> happening<00:02:57.239> is<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.690> switch

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
think what's happening is that switch

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.759 
think what's happening is that switch
gets<00:02:58.590> worn<00:02:58.920> out<00:02:59.129> and<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.760> stays<00:03:00.090> open<00:03:00.590> when<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
gets worn out and it stays open when the

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.509 
gets worn out and it stays open when the
when<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.370> tray<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.730> closed<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:04.519> states

when the tray is closed I states

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.759 
when the tray is closed I states
actually<00:03:05.819> up<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.510> opposite<00:03:06.900> stays<00:03:07.170> connected

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
actually up the opposite stays connected

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.030 
actually up the opposite stays connected
while<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> tray<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.000> closed<00:03:09.709> kind<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.769> see<00:03:10.950> it

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
there you go so what to do is the front

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.059 
there you go so what to do is the front
piece<00:03:36.389> it's<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.260> switch<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.590> makes<00:03:38.010> a

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
piece it's a switch that makes a

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.129 
piece it's a switch that makes a
connection<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.819> way<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.569> know<00:03:39.720> there's<00:03:39.989> two

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
connection that way you know there's two

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.610 
connection that way you know there's two
pieces<00:03:40.380> kind<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.280> go<00:03:41.430> like<00:03:41.579> that<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:43.019> take<00:03:43.470> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
pieces kind of go like that so take the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.559 
pieces kind of go like that so take the
front<00:03:43.859> one<00:03:44.010> has<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.160> plastic<00:03:44.730> piece<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.389> with

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
front one has a plastic piece on it with

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.089 
front one has a plastic piece on it with
a<00:03:45.599> tiny<00:03:46.049> screwdriver<00:03:46.530> or<00:03:46.650> something<00:03:46.849> just

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
a tiny screwdriver or something just

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.830 
a tiny screwdriver or something just
canada<00:03:50.099> pry<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.700> back<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.690> know<00:03:51.810> very

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
canada pry it back you know very

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.979 
canada pry it back you know very
slightly<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:53.790> will<00:03:53.940> open<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.690> connection

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
slightly that will open the connection

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.770 
slightly that will open the connection
and<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:56.370> doesn't<00:03:56.910> take<00:03:56.940> much<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.269> break<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:57.690> off

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
and it doesn't take much to break it off

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.330 
and it doesn't take much to break it off
so<00:03:57.930> do<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.139> be<00:03:58.260> very<00:03:58.560> careful<00:03:58.950> just<00:03:59.069> pull<00:03:59.250> it

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
so do it be very careful just pull it

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.509 
so do it be very careful just pull it
back<00:03:59.519> just<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.209> little<00:04:00.239> bit<00:04:00.739> okay<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.160> then<00:04:02.340> let

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
back just a little bit okay and then let

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.550 
back just a little bit okay and then let
it<00:04:02.549> go<00:04:02.790> you'll<00:04:03.120> see<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.450> it's<00:04:03.660> not<00:04:04.049> connected

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
it go you'll see that it's not connected

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.990 
it go you'll see that it's not connected
