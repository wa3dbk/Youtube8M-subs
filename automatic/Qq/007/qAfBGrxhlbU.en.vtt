00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.149
 all these letters are spectacular and 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.330
 patricia and the truth is that I do not know how 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.610
 stay because each one surpasses the 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.740
 others we are also very used to 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.570
 see them lately in the coated paper of 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.000
 the magazines because our rich and 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.620
 celebrities marry precisely with this 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.020
 type of sugar fondant cakes 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.360
 what have been the last weddings that he has 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.190
 used these good cakes the 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.680
 hated that we have seen has been the wedding 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.140

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.780
 guy and how was that patricia pie the 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.150
 cake was broken white and also 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.460
 had sugar flowers 5 flower in sugar 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.860
 different that symbolize the flowers of the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.329
 united kingdom at alberto's wedding 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.130
 Monaco we also saw a very 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.110
 similar in the wedding of Alberto de Monaco 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.640
 and there was a fondant cake what happens 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.559
 is that this one was a lot more modern 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.630
 much more contemporary was a cake 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.020
 very large of impressive dimensions 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.850
 and with floating stars they too 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.040
 in sugar real weddings but also 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.449
 weddings in hollywood of actors and actresses 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.449
 super known 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.200
 with Katie Holmes in Rome with a cake 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.960
 white and all covered with white roses 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.150
 has killing magnifying the leather itself 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.790
 It is also very important in terms of 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.170
 the bridal cakes and many times we 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.810
 the question arises which is the best 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.369
 moment to serve it patricia reality 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.040
 of the world with what it dictates is that 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.470
 after building the dance opens and 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.390
 after the first dance, people come back 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.330
 to the piece and there should be served the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.869
 wedding cake that there is of the couple that 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.280
 normally with any one of its 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.770
 well day we live in the pies of 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.869
 fondant and that seems to be no longer us 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.360
 carrying not the truth is a trend 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.610
 that is falling a little in disuse 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.200
 wedding cakes cars currently 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.420
 people are already leaving aside the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.399
 classic figurine of the couple and is not 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.990
 replacing other hand other 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.429
 decorations the trend would be 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.590
 the flowers in this case those are the 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.479
 flowers and the time to cut the cake 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.610
 at night is very important because there 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.679
 than doing it as it plays as the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.270
 tradition in this patriotic sense yes 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.580
 good tradition a little 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.440
 has fallen into disuse to be counted on 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.850
 great tablets and while there are some 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.740
 people who are very classic and continue 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.590
 keeping the tradition normally 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.510
