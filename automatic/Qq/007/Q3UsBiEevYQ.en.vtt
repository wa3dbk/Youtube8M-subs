today<00:00:17.699> we're<00:00:18.240> gonna<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.570> building<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.560> fire

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
today we're gonna be building a fire

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.849 
today we're gonna be building a fire
engine<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.930> have<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> watched<00:00:22.230> my<00:00:22.529> car

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
engine and have you watched my car

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.099 
engine and have you watched my car
tutorial<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.580> told<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.660> was<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
tutorial I told you that I was going to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.400 
tutorial I told you that I was going to
build<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.410> car<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.710> fire<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:27.320> it's<00:00:28.320> not

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
build a car on fire and here is it's not

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.380 
build a car on fire and here is it's not
a<00:00:28.800> lot<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.429> fire<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.269> still<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.660> fire<00:00:30.840> and

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
a lot on fire but it's still on fire and

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
a lot on fire but it's still on fire and
I've<00:00:33.390> built<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.010> fireproof<00:00:35.010> materials

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
I've built out of fireproof materials

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.209 
I've built out of fireproof materials
very<00:00:35.880> much<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:37.140> fire<00:00:37.530> spread<00:00:37.800> off<00:00:37.950> but

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
very much I have fire spread off but

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.740 
very much I have fire spread off but
there's<00:00:38.520> always<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.850> chance<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.270> could<00:00:39.329> set<00:00:39.600> my

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
there's always a chance I could set my

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.630 
there's always a chance I could set my
city<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.079> fire<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.280> happened<00:00:41.309> more

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
city on fire what just happened more

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.400 
city on fire what just happened more
than<00:00:41.700> once<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.840> wasn't<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.260> take<00:00:43.350> any

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
than once so I wasn't going to take any

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.279 
than once so I wasn't going to take any
chances

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
chances

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.540 
chances
so<00:00:46.289> we're<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.469> gonna<00:00:46.649> build<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.160> fire<00:00:47.190> engine

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so we're just gonna build a fire engine

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.619 
so we're just gonna build a fire engine
right<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.149> somewhere<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:50.360> oh<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:51.510> gonna

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
right here somewhere and oh we're gonna

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.650 
right here somewhere and oh we're gonna
need<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:53.930> quartz<00:00:54.930> slab<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:56.300> right<00:00:57.300> rule<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
need is quartz slab and right rule to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.510 
need is quartz slab and right rule to
begin<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.859> similar<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.460> our

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
begin with it's just very similar to our

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.070 
begin with it's just very similar to our
London<00:00:59.910> bus<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.030> you're<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.149> need<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.629> space

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
London bus and you're gonna need a space

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.300 
London bus and you're gonna need a space
that's<00:01:04.350> four<00:01:04.979> wide<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.549> 13<00:01:06.240> long<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> think

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that's four wide and 13 long so I think

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.870 
that's four wide and 13 long so I think
I'll<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.780> build<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> around<00:01:10.580> here<00:01:11.580> put<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
I'll just build it around here put the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.960 
I'll just build it around here put the
front<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.210> there<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> need<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:16.970> place

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
front about there so I need to place

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.440 
front about there so I need to place
down<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.420> slab<00:01:18.780> there<00:01:21.560> okay

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
down one slab there okay

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.900 
down one slab there okay
silicon<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:26.020> it's<00:01:26.140> gonna<00:01:26.230> be<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:28.270> ride<00:01:28.510> and

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
silicon so it's gonna be for ride and

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.740 
silicon so it's gonna be for ride and
thirteen<00:01:30.910> long<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:32.200> one<00:01:32.560> two<00:01:33.040> three<00:01:33.240> four<00:01:34.240> five

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
thirteen long so one two three four five

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.460 
thirteen long so one two three four five
six<00:01:35.230> seven<00:01:35.740> eight<00:01:36.040> nine<00:01:36.430> ten<00:01:37.290> eleven

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
six seven eight nine ten eleven

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.190 
six seven eight nine ten eleven
I<00:01:38.910> think<00:01:39.910> I'll<00:01:40.000> make<00:01:40.120> a<00:01:40.240> bit<00:01:40.450> longer<00:01:40.900> this<00:01:41.050> way

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
I think I'll make a bit longer this way

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.400 
I think I'll make a bit longer this way
twelve<00:01:41.650> thirteen<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.810> 13<00:01:46.810> wide<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.230> you<00:01:47.290> can

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
twelve thirteen so 13 wide and you can

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.570 
twelve thirteen so 13 wide and you can
just<00:01:47.560> fill<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:47.920> in<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.870> then<00:01:53.620> we<00:01:54.010> can<00:01:54.040> place

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
just fill that in and then we can place

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.440 
just fill that in and then we can place
in<00:01:54.820> our<00:01:55.060> wheels<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:57.310> not<00:01:57.430> so<00:01:57.850> gonna<00:01:58.030> take<00:01:58.270> out

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
in our wheels I'm not so gonna take out

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.660 
in our wheels I'm not so gonna take out
a<00:01:58.800> button<00:01:59.800> for<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.720> at<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.260> back<00:02:02.670> it's

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
a button for that so at the back it's

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.270 
a button for that so at the back it's
all<00:02:03.790> this<00:02:03.850> will<00:02:04.000> be<00:02:04.060> back<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.860> 1<00:02:06.040> away<00:02:06.250> from

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
all this will be back just a 1 away from

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.449 
all this will be back just a 1 away from
there<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.679> you're<00:02:08.679> gonna<00:02:08.770> use<00:02:08.920> bedrock<00:02:09.310> with

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
there and you're gonna use bedrock with

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.920 
there and you're gonna use bedrock with
the<00:02:09.520> wheels<00:02:09.720> 1<00:02:10.720> away<00:02:10.869> from<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.200> edge<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:13.810> could

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the wheels 1 away from the edge we could

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.330 
the wheels 1 away from the edge we could
place<00:02:14.140> or<00:02:14.500> wheels<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.040> button<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.310> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
place or wheels in the button in the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.220 
place or wheels in the button in the
middle<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.730> then<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.480> front<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.870> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> be

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
middle and then the front is going to be

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:27.949 
middle and then the front is going to be
3<00:02:17.620> away<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:17.890> 1<00:02:18.400> 2<00:02:18.790> 3<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:24.000> get<00:02:25.000> place<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.540> or<00:02:25.720> bun

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
3 away so 1 2 3 I get place in or bun

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.550 
3 away so 1 2 3 I get place in or bun
let<00:02:28.959> back<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.950> that's<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.280> length<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.640> it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
let back in so that's the length of it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.449 
let back in so that's the length of it
now<00:02:32.560> we're<00:02:32.860> going<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.010> take

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
now we're going to take

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.709 
now we're going to take
the<00:02:35.000> Red<00:02:35.180> Bull<00:02:35.359> and<00:02:35.569> place<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.560> line<00:02:37.540> all<00:02:38.540> the

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
the Red Bull and place a line all the

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:45.210 
the Red Bull and place a line all the
way<00:02:38.810> along<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.049> wall

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.360 

and<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:46.000> at<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.690> front<00:02:47.170> leave<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.070> space<00:02:48.220> of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
and then at the front leave a space of

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.020 
and then at the front leave a space of
two<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:49.150> then<00:02:49.270> go<00:02:49.420> up<00:02:49.600> by<00:02:49.750> one<00:02:50.790> leave<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.820> space

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
two and then go up by one leave a space

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.290 
two and then go up by one leave a space
of<00:02:52.210> one<00:02:52.800> up<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:54.130> wonder<00:02:54.460> and<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.820> could<00:02:55.000> fill<00:02:55.150> in

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
gonna be the same as the other side so

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.320 
gonna be the same as the other side so
we<00:04:26.930> can<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.229> copy

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330
