00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
expiration I can see the reasoning why

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340 
expiration I can see the reasoning why
people<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.570> such<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> big<00:00:36.930> deal<00:00:37.110> but

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
people think this is such a big deal but

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350 
people think this is such a big deal but
I'm<00:00:37.469> also<00:00:37.649> seeing<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.430> lot<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> jumping<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I'm also seeing a lot of jumping to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.030 
I'm also seeing a lot of jumping to
conclusions<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.140> people<00:00:40.559> missing<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> point

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
conclusions and people missing the point

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.299 
conclusions and people missing the point
so<00:00:41.640> here's<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> think<00:00:42.649> first<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.100> gold

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
so here's what I think first it's a gold

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
so here's what I think first it's a gold
think<00:00:44.579> these<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:44.940> good<00:00:45.600> things<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.289> tend<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
think these are good things I tend to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.139 
think these are good things I tend to
find<00:00:46.920> though<00:00:47.160> whenever<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.730> mentioned

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
find though whenever this is mentioned

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.910 
find though whenever this is mentioned
discussion<00:00:48.719> always<00:00:48.840> escalates<00:00:49.260> into<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.590> whole

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
discussion always escalates into a whole

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
say I do think in the end they are an

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.000 
say I do think in the end they are an
important<00:00:57.420> part<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.690> MMOs<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.649> fact<00:00:58.829> this

I'd<00:04:28.139> argue<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.560> mechanics<00:04:29.010> like<00:04:29.130> armor

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
cracked and you fancy trying a new build

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.170 
cracked and you fancy trying a new build
in<00:04:40.410> one<00:04:40.949> scenario<00:04:41.280> what<00:04:41.610> everyone's<00:04:41.880> crying

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
you continue wandering aimlessly around

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.330 
you continue wandering aimlessly around
in<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:46.020> second<00:04:46.410> scenario<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.979> begin<00:04:47.220> to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
in the second scenario you begin to

in the first place there is the

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.279 
in the first place there is the
