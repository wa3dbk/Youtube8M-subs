will do a leaf hop leaf hopper cluster

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.970 
will do a leaf hop leaf hopper cluster
so<00:06:06.010> around<00:06:06.880> that<00:06:07.300> one<00:06:07.540> stitch<00:06:08.169> just<00:06:08.200> before

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
so around that one stitch just before

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.480 
so around that one stitch just before
that<00:06:09.190> we<00:06:09.280> just<00:06:09.310> finished<00:06:09.700> working<00:06:10.240> into<00:06:10.570> the

front<00:06:12.490> post<00:06:14.250> twice<00:06:15.570> so<00:06:16.570> we<00:06:16.600> have<00:06:16.780> five<00:06:17.080> loops

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
front post twice so we have five loops

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.280 
front post twice so we have five loops
and<00:06:17.650> pull<00:06:17.860> through<00:06:18.040> four<00:06:18.990> skip<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.139> next

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
and pull through four skip the next

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.200 
and pull through four skip the next
stitch<00:06:20.590> there<00:06:21.010> and<00:06:21.669> we'll<00:06:21.760> do<00:06:21.850> the<00:06:21.940> same<00:06:21.970> thing

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
stitch there and we'll do the same thing

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:31.840 
stitch there and we'll do the same thing
around<00:06:22.690> this<00:06:22.840> post<00:06:23.200> right<00:06:24.070> here<00:06:27.660> one

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.980 

and<00:06:32.170> to<00:06:33.610> pull<00:06:34.610> it<00:06:34.700> up<00:06:34.820> and<00:06:35.000> draw<00:06:35.270> through<00:06:35.510> for
