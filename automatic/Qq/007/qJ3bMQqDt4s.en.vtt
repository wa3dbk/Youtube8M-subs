00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
speed of the game so we just capitalize

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.480 
speed of the game so we just capitalize
on<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.799> those<00:01:23.009> guys<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.250> keep

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
that uh i think the learning curve was

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.720 
that uh i think the learning curve was
really<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.800> know<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.220> him<00:02:35.370> learning<00:02:35.580> the

really you know and him learning the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.060 
really you know and him learning the
place<00:02:35.940> was<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.300> easy<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:36.959> him<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:38.040> know

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
place was very easy for him you know

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.530 
place was very easy for him you know
