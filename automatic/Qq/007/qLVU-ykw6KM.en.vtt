00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
scanned it so I could try to copy each

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.219 
scanned it so I could try to copy each
letter<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.189> close<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.000> possible<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.689> basically

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
letter as close as possible I basically

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.550 
letter as close as possible I basically
just<00:01:10.369> make<00:01:11.369> these<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.880> nodes<00:01:12.630> whatever

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that I scanned and it helps clean up

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.179 
that I scanned and it helps clean up
some<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.280> choppiness<00:01:24.799> but<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.009> something

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
some of the choppiness but for something

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.219 
some of the choppiness but for something
like<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.700> won't<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.479> be

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.380 

perfect<00:01:31.229> because<00:01:31.700> you've<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.090> kind<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
perfect because you've got to kind of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
perfect because you've got to kind of
keep<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:36.110> essence<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.310> freehand

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
keep the essence of the the freehand

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.830 
keep the essence of the the freehand
that's<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:41.000> like<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> sharp<00:01:42.420> edge<00:01:42.630> at

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that's up here to like the sharp edge at

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.170 
that's up here to like the sharp edge at
the<00:01:42.899> bottom<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.409> V<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.000> keep

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the bottom of this V you got to keep

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.929 
the bottom of this V you got to keep
that<00:01:45.240> because<00:01:45.920> that's<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.220> edge<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> pen

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that because that's the edge of the pen

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.160 
that because that's the edge of the pen
I<00:01:48.329> would<00:01:48.990> leave<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I would leave that and a little bit of

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.490 
I would leave that and a little bit of
the<00:01:52.259> waviness

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.150 

but<00:01:56.130> some<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.930> stuff<00:01:57.930> is<00:02:00.710> from<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> scan

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
but some of the stuff is from the scan

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.130 
but some of the stuff is from the scan
and<00:02:02.340> I'm<00:02:02.460> picking<00:02:02.910> up<00:02:03.000> all<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> ink<00:02:03.540> edge<00:02:03.780> so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and I'm picking up all the ink edge so

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.680 
and I'm picking up all the ink edge so
you<00:02:04.200> got<00:02:04.410> smooth<00:02:04.710> some<00:02:05.010> of<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.150> so

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
you got smooth some of it up and then so

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.890 
you got smooth some of it up and then so
this<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.080> one<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:08.130> traced<00:02:08.550> around<00:02:08.900> and

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
this is the one that traced around and

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.600 
this is the one that traced around and
this<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.350> trace<00:02:10.680> and<00:02:10.710> see<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.280> field<00:02:11.460> it's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
this is the trace and see if field it's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.440 
this is the trace and see if field it's
smoother<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.440> rid<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:15.150> what

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
smoother and we get rid of that and what

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.840 
smoother and we get rid of that and what
I<00:02:15.480> decided<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.050> do<00:02:16.230> was<00:02:16.410> actually<00:02:16.440> make<00:02:17.070> each

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
I decided to do was actually make each

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.100 
I decided to do was actually make each
word<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:21.680> key<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> keyboard<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:24.990> this

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
word a key on the keyboard so in this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.570 
word a key on the keyboard so in this
case<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.230> comma<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.190> when<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> hit<00:02:29.520> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
case this is a comma so when I hit a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.140 
case this is a comma so when I hit a
comma<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.210> heat<00:02:30.660> it'll<00:02:31.020> stay<00:02:31.260> pretty<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.370> I'll

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
comma on heat it'll stay pretty and I'll

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.240 
comma on heat it'll stay pretty and I'll
show<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> few<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.680> idea<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.220> I

did do the M th the P I did Oh an R and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.780 
did do the M th the P I did Oh an R and
a<00:03:14.580> T<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:18.330> then<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.930> slashes<00:03:19.650> or<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
period is little - is Drive they are all

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.350 
period is little - is Drive they are all
different<00:03:26.040> sizes<00:03:26.280> still<00:03:26.760> when<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.940> type<00:03:27.209> them

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
different sizes still when I type them

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.150 
different sizes still when I type them
out<00:03:27.540> they<00:03:27.750> don't<00:03:27.930> match<00:03:28.200> but<00:03:28.739> in<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.920> sign

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
out they don't match but in the sign

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.850 
out they don't match but in the sign
program<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.940> should<00:03:30.060> be<00:03:30.180> pretty<00:03:30.390> easy<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:31.050> make

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
program it should be pretty easy to make

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.540 
program it should be pretty easy to make
it<00:03:32.040> look<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.870> letter<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.470> what<00:03:35.250> I'll<00:03:35.370> do

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
it look like the letter so what I'll do

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.670 
it look like the letter so what I'll do
is<00:03:35.580> I'll<00:03:35.790> save<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.480> font<00:03:39.050> put<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> disk

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
is I'll save this font put it on a disk

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.160 
is I'll save this font put it on a disk
and<00:03:40.920> we'll<00:03:41.220> go<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.550> sign<00:03:41.850> cutter<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.450> see

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
and we'll go to the sign cutter and see

00:03:43.170 --> 00:04:12.620 
and we'll go to the sign cutter and see
if<00:03:43.860> we<00:03:44.010> can<00:03:44.160> make<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.459> look<00:03:44.610> like<00:03:44.820> that

and<00:04:38.380> it's<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:39.390> scratch<00:04:40.390> resistant<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:41.470> a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
and it's a scratch resistant it's a

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.690 
and it's a scratch resistant it's a
sticker<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:44.200> didn't<00:04:44.710> put<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.950> contour<00:04:45.400> cut

terabyte<00:06:28.050> hard<00:06:28.229> drive<00:06:29.419> this<00:06:30.419> the<00:06:30.749> edges<00:06:31.139> are

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
terabyte hard drive this the edges are

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.079 
terabyte hard drive this the edges are
looked<00:06:31.439> better<00:06:31.709> when<00:06:32.009> I<00:06:32.039> do<00:06:32.159> it<00:06:32.429> again<00:06:32.550> because

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.089 
looked better when I do it again because

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:34.790 
looked better when I do it again because
I'll<00:06:33.209> let<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.449> Machine<00:06:33.809> actually<00:06:34.050> cut<00:06:34.499> around

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
I'll let the Machine actually cut around

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.570 
I'll let the Machine actually cut around
the<00:06:34.949> edges<00:06:35.369> make<00:06:36.270> it<00:06:36.419> look<00:06:36.539> really<00:06:36.809> cool<00:06:37.020> but

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580
