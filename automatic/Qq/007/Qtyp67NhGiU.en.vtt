00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.900 

I<00:02:21.069> think<00:02:22.069> people<00:02:22.280> when<00:02:22.459> they<00:02:22.550> put<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.819> video

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
I think people when they put the video

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.190 
I think people when they put the video
again<00:02:23.150> where<00:02:23.300> they're<00:02:23.390> gonna<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.720> about<00:02:23.989> it
