00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.840 

well<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:01.199> cytochrome<00:00:01.680> oxidase<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.520> actually

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
well the cytochrome oxidase is actually

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.990 
well the cytochrome oxidase is actually
gonna<00:00:03.030> wait<00:00:03.300> till<00:00:03.570> it<00:00:03.659> has<00:00:03.810> four<00:00:04.440> electrons<00:00:05.430> so

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
gonna wait till it has four electrons so

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.990 
gonna wait till it has four electrons so
right<00:00:06.180> now<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.899> has<00:00:07.080> four<00:00:07.410> electrons<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> after

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
right now it has four electrons so after

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.299 
right now it has four electrons so after
that<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.420> gonna<00:00:09.570> combine<00:00:09.900> with<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.559> o2

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
that it's gonna combine with the o2

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.209 
that it's gonna combine with the o2
molecule<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.440> it's<00:00:13.440> gonna<00:00:13.559> go<00:00:13.740> ahead<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
molecule and it's gonna go ahead and

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.400 
molecule and it's gonna go ahead and
it's<00:00:14.580> gonna<00:00:14.730> grab<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> Oh<00:00:15.210> two<00:00:15.269> molecule<00:00:15.929> from

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
it's gonna grab a Oh two molecule from

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.930 
it's gonna grab a Oh two molecule from
the<00:00:16.500> matrix<00:00:16.710> right<00:00:17.100> here<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.730> these<00:00:17.880> o

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the matrix right here so one of these o

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.240 
the matrix right here so one of these o
twos<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.539> gonna<00:00:19.050> go<00:00:19.230> right<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:19.740> there

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
twos is gonna go right up there

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.920 
twos is gonna go right up there
I<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.699> don't<00:00:20.820> log<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.449> ahead<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.689> keep<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
I just don't log go ahead and keep the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.560 
I just don't log go ahead and keep the
arrow<00:00:22.109> there<00:00:22.380> whatever<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:24.000> also<00:00:24.240> going

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
arrow there whatever and it's also going

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
arrow there whatever and it's also going
to<00:00:24.630> combine<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.019> eight<00:00:25.670> hydrogen<00:00:26.670> ions<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to combine with eight hydrogen ions so

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.540 
to combine with eight hydrogen ions so
eight<00:00:30.050> eight<00:00:31.700> hydrogen<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.600> write<00:00:33.780> h+<00:00:34.710> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
eight eight hydrogen I just write h+ so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.510 
eight eight hydrogen I just write h+ so
basically<00:00:35.940> why<00:00:36.570> does<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> want<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> combine

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
basically why does it want to combine

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.569 
basically why does it want to combine
four<00:00:38.520> electrons<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:40.110> oxygen<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.890> hate<00:00:41.309> eight

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
four electrons with oxygen in hate eight

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.540 
four electrons with oxygen in hate eight
hydrogen<00:00:42.510> ions<00:00:42.809> well<00:00:43.290> basically<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.250> four

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
hydrogen ions well basically the four

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
hydrogen ions well basically the four
electrons<00:00:45.120> four<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.379> these<00:00:46.739> hydrogen<00:00:47.039> ions

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
electrons four of these hydrogen ions

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.139 
electrons four of these hydrogen ions
and<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:48.600> o2<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> form<00:00:50.039> two<00:00:50.250> h2<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and your o2 is going to form two h2 you

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.040 
and your o2 is going to form two h2 you
let<00:00:51.840> me<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.050> try<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.730> h2o<00:00:53.730> molecules<00:00:54.390> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
let me just try to h2o molecules so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.299 
let me just try to h2o molecules so
let's<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.350> ahead<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.739> keep<00:00:55.920> track<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.219> what

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
let's go ahead and keep track of what

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.660 
let's go ahead and keep track of what
happened<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:58.260> o2<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.859> since

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
happened here this is your o2 and since

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.279 
happened here this is your o2 and since
you<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.940> two<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> balances<00:01:01.109> out

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you have two of them that balances out

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
you have two of them that balances out
since<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.800> each<00:01:02.309> h2o<00:01:02.820> there's<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.420> oxygen<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
since in each h2o there's one oxygen and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.130 
since in each h2o there's one oxygen and
OH<00:01:04.589> -<00:01:04.650> which<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.670> molecular<00:01:05.939> oxygen<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:06.960> two

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
OH - which is molecular oxygen has two

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.580 
OH - which is molecular oxygen has two
of<00:01:07.290> them

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
of them

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
of them
so<00:01:07.799> you're<00:01:07.920> gonna<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.220> two<00:01:08.430> h2o<00:01:08.850> molecules

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
so you're gonna have two h2o molecules

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.929 
so you're gonna have two h2o molecules
eight<00:01:10.080> hydrogen<00:01:10.799> ions<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.549> look<00:01:11.760> at

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
eight hydrogen ions but if we look at

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.260 
eight hydrogen ions but if we look at
two<00:01:12.210> molecules<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.750> h2o<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.650> only<00:01:13.740> four

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
two molecules of h2o there are only four

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.999 
two molecules of h2o there are only four
hydrogen<00:01:15.270> atoms<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.409> happens<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
hydrogen atoms so what happens is you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.480 
hydrogen atoms so what happens is you
have<00:01:17.040> four<00:01:17.520> hydrogen<00:01:18.330> ions<00:01:19.110> left<00:01:19.500> over<00:01:19.860> so

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
have four hydrogen ions left over so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.310 
have four hydrogen ions left over so
those<00:01:20.700> four<00:01:20.939> hydrogen<00:01:21.479> ions<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:22.020> actually

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
those four hydrogen ions are actually

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.240 
those four hydrogen ions are actually
going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.530> shuttled<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.460> other<00:01:23.610> side

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
going to be shuttled to the other side

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
going to be shuttled to the other side
so<00:01:26.250> basically<00:01:26.430> once<00:01:27.060> everything<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.810> combined

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
so basically once everything is combined

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
so basically once everything is combined
in<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.240> different<00:01:30.540> molecules

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
in here all of your different molecules

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.230 
in here all of your different molecules
it's<00:01:31.710> gonna<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> chemical

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it's gonna you know have a chemical

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.109 
it's gonna you know have a chemical
reaction<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.020> you're<00:01:34.790> basically<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.000> have

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
reaction and you're basically you have

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.850 
reaction and you're basically you have
three<00:01:36.150> ingredients<00:01:36.840> electrons<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> oxygen

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
three ingredients electrons and oxygen

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.760 
three ingredients electrons and oxygen
and<00:01:38.430> hydrogen<00:01:38.790> ions<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:40.020> gonna<00:01:40.140> make<00:01:40.439> two

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and hydrogen ions you're gonna make two

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.730 
and hydrogen ions you're gonna make two
waters<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.689> left<00:01:42.689> over<00:01:43.079> you're<00:01:43.350> gonna<00:01:43.439> have

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
waters and left over you're gonna have

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
waters and left over you're gonna have
four<00:01:44.100> hydrogen<00:01:45.030> ions<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:45.869> hydrogen

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
four hydrogen ions and your hydrogen

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.080 
four hydrogen ions and your hydrogen
ions<00:01:46.590> your<00:01:46.950> leftovers<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
ions your leftovers are just going to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.060 
ions your leftovers are just going to
get<00:01:48.180> shuttled<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.560> pumped<00:01:50.009> out

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
get shuttled out right here pumped out

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.020 
get shuttled out right here pumped out
to<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> other<00:01:50.520> side

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to the other side

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.060 
to the other side
so<00:01:51.420> again<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.350> we're<00:01:52.560> producing

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
so again as you can see we're producing

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.730 
so again as you can see we're producing
a<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.939> hydrogen<00:01:54.360> ions<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.259> side<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
a lot of hydrogen ions on this side and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.249 
a lot of hydrogen ions on this side and
not<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> lot<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.240> side<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.810> few

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
not a lot on this side there are a few

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.620 
not a lot on this side there are a few
you<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.399> side<00:01:59.460> but<00:02:00.119> not<00:02:00.360> as

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you know over on this side but not as

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.840 
you know over on this side but not as
much<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.490> said<00:02:02.729> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
much as the other side and I said that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.020 
much as the other side and I said that
because<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.560> pumping<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.189> hydrogen<00:02:05.670> ions

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
because the pumping of hydrogen ions

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
because the pumping of hydrogen ions
from<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.509> side<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.320> another<00:02:07.590> side<00:02:08.009> basically

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
from one side to another side basically

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.420 
from one side to another side basically
from<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.330> side<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.690> matrix<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.190> space

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
from this side the matrix to the space

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.820 
from this side the matrix to the space
between<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.970> inner<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.360> outer<00:02:12.510> membrane

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
between the inner and outer membrane

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.710 
between the inner and outer membrane
it's<00:02:14.130> pretty<00:02:14.460> much<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.820> create<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.270> gradient

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
it's pretty much gonna create a gradient

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.900 
it's pretty much gonna create a gradient
integrating<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.770> know<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.160> when<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.700> have

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
integrating as you know is when you have

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.090 
integrating as you know is when you have
a<00:02:18.120> lot<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.690> something<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.320> side<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.770> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
a lot of something on one side and a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.400 
a lot of something on one side and a
little<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.520> something<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.390> other<00:02:21.570> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
little of something on the other so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.590 
little of something on the other so
right<00:02:22.710> now<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> gradient<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.150> lot<00:02:24.420> of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
right now we have a gradient a lot of

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.220 
right now we have a gradient a lot of
ions<00:02:24.990> on<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.710> side<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.870> not<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> lot<00:02:28.200> of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
ions on this side and not a lot of

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.710 
ions on this side and not a lot of
hydrogen<00:02:28.830> ions<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.460> other<00:02:29.610> side<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.180> when

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
hydrogen ions on the other side and when

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
hydrogen ions on the other side and when
we<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> gradient<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.590> biology<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.730> has<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
we have a gradient in biology this has a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.750 
we have a gradient in biology this has a
lot<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.360> potential<00:02:34.200> energy<00:02:34.670> now<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
lot of potential energy now the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.820 
lot of potential energy now the
potential<00:02:36.270> energy<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.200> gradient<00:02:37.500> is

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
potential energy of this gradient is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.310 
potential energy of this gradient is
going<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.310> used<00:02:38.580> by<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:39.000> last<00:02:39.450> molecule

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
going to be used by this last molecule

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.760 
going to be used by this last molecule
this<00:02:40.740> last<00:02:41.100> molecule<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.760> called<00:02:41.970> ATP

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
this last molecule is called ATP

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.380 
this last molecule is called ATP
synthase<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.070> let<00:02:44.580> me<00:02:44.640> go<00:02:44.760> ahead<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:44.970> draw<00:02:45.240> it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
synthase and let me go ahead and draw it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.100 
synthase and let me go ahead and draw it
so<00:02:46.080> ATP<00:02:46.560> synthase<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.550> pretty<00:02:48.420> much<00:02:48.690> gonna

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
so ATP synthase is pretty much gonna

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.660 
so ATP synthase is pretty much gonna
look<00:02:49.410> something<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:52.800> has<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
look something like this and it has a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.540 
look something like this and it has a
little<00:02:54.120> part<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:55.140> yellow<00:02:55.680> again<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:56.460> you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
little part that is yellow again if you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.070 
little part that is yellow again if you
looked<00:02:56.820> at<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.210> your<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.720> know<00:02:57.840> under<00:02:58.050> a

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
looked at it in your you know under a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080 
looked at it in your you know under a
microscope<00:02:58.370> probably<00:02:59.370> wouldn't<00:02:59.640> be<00:02:59.730> yellow

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
microscope probably wouldn't be yellow

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.200 
microscope probably wouldn't be yellow
but<00:03:00.860> let<00:03:01.860> me<00:03:01.920> draw<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.130> blue<00:03:02.490> part<00:03:04.910> mmm<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.030> kind

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
but let me draw a blue part mmm it kind

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.030 
but let me draw a blue part mmm it kind
of<00:03:06.270> looks<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.620> weird-looking<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.710> robot

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
of looks like a weird-looking a robot

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.890 
of looks like a weird-looking a robot
jellyfish<00:03:08.610> but<00:03:09.300> anyways<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:10.050> is<00:03:10.260> called<00:03:10.530> ATP

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
jellyfish but anyways this is called ATP

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.229 
jellyfish but anyways this is called ATP
synthase<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.290> here<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.370> use<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:14.670> color<00:03:14.910> yet

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.010 

this<00:03:18.239> last<00:03:18.630> one<00:03:19.520> ATP

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.570 

synthase<00:03:25.020> now<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.190> actually<00:03:26.370> the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
synthase now this is actually the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.800 
synthase now this is actually the
molecule<00:03:27.210> that<00:03:27.420> makes<00:03:27.960> ATP's<00:03:29.480> alright<00:03:30.480> so

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
molecule that makes ATP's alright so

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.630 
molecule that makes ATP's alright so
let's<00:03:31.050> go<00:03:31.230> ahead<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:32.040> know<00:03:32.130> take<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> step

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
let's go ahead and you know take a step

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.100 
let's go ahead and you know take a step
back<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.210> what<00:03:33.240> we<00:03:33.510> have<00:03:33.540> going<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.050> here

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
back and see what we have going on here

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.700 
back and see what we have going on here
we<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.360> okay<00:03:36.360> we<00:03:36.540> don't<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.720> any<00:03:36.930> electrons

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
we have okay we don't have any electrons

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.710 
we have okay we don't have any electrons
to<00:03:37.860> work<00:03:38.010> with<00:03:38.160> anymore<00:03:38.400> because<00:03:38.700> those<00:03:39.480> were

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
to work with anymore because those were

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.390 
to work with anymore because those were
used<00:03:39.960> whenever<00:03:40.200> we<00:03:40.470> created<00:03:40.860> water<00:03:41.130> right

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
used whenever we created water right

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.430 
used whenever we created water right
here<00:03:41.730> all<00:03:42.000> we<00:03:42.330> have<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:42.960> thing<00:03:43.230> called

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
here all we have is this thing called

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.920 
here all we have is this thing called
ATP<00:03:44.160> synthase<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.210> bunch<00:03:45.390> of<00:03:45.540> hydrogen

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
ATP synthase and a bunch of hydrogen

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.770 
ATP synthase and a bunch of hydrogen
ions<00:03:46.470> pretty<00:03:47.160> much<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> hydrogen<00:03:47.940> ion<00:03:48.060> gradient

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
ions pretty much a hydrogen ion gradient

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.410 
ions pretty much a hydrogen ion gradient
on<00:03:48.900> one<00:03:49.410> side<00:03:49.620> or<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:49.920> other<00:03:50.120> well<00:03:51.120> what's

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
on one side or the other well what's

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.930 
on one side or the other well what's
gonna<00:03:51.570> happen<00:03:51.990> is<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.650> ATP<00:03:53.130> synthase<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
gonna happen is this ATP synthase is

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.280 
gonna happen is this ATP synthase is
going<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> use<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.480> energy<00:03:54.630> from<00:03:55.170> this

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
going to use the energy from this

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.490 
going to use the energy from this
gradient<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:56.190> create<00:03:56.520> ATP<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.540> let<00:03:58.320> me<00:03:58.380> go

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
gradient to create ATP and let me go

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.960 
gradient to create ATP and let me go
ahead<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.740> explain<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.100> guys<00:03:59.130> exactly<00:03:59.610> how

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
ahead and explain you guys exactly how

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.449 
ahead and explain you guys exactly how
that's<00:04:00.150> going<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.420> happen<00:04:00.980> so<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.160> top<00:04:02.430> of

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
that's going to happen so the top of

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.940 
that's going to happen so the top of
your<00:04:02.850> ATP<00:04:03.360> synthase<00:04:03.990> is<00:04:04.260> pretty<00:04:04.650> much<00:04:04.800> gonna

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
your ATP synthase is pretty much gonna

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.980 
your ATP synthase is pretty much gonna
have<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.520> think<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.820> like<00:04:05.880> two<00:04:06.240> tubes<00:04:06.630> it

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
have just think of it like two tubes it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.350 
have just think of it like two tubes it
has<00:04:07.410> one<00:04:07.709> tube<00:04:07.980> where<00:04:08.370> things<00:04:08.640> can<00:04:08.850> go<00:04:09.000> into<00:04:09.180> it

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
has one tube where things can go into it

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.410 
has one tube where things can go into it
and<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.990> has<00:04:10.140> another<00:04:10.530> tube<00:04:10.920> where<00:04:11.580> things<00:04:11.970> can

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
and it has another tube where things can

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.750 
and it has another tube where things can
go<00:04:12.630> out<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.200> now<00:04:13.920> what's<00:04:14.130> gonna<00:04:14.190> happen<00:04:14.310> is

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
go out of it now what's gonna happen is

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.759 
go out of it now what's gonna happen is
these<00:04:15.090> hydrogen<00:04:15.660> ions<00:04:15.810> from<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.380> side<00:04:16.560> right

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
these hydrogen ions from this side right

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.860 
these hydrogen ions from this side right
here<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.160> they're<00:04:17.850> gonna<00:04:18.060> enter<00:04:18.419> at<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.660> top

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
here is they're gonna enter at the top

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.130 
here is they're gonna enter at the top
of<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.109> 8t<00:04:19.560> synthase<00:04:20.070> one<00:04:20.760> at<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.090> time<00:04:21.480> so

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
of the 8t synthase one at a time so

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.230 
of the 8t synthase one at a time so
one's<00:04:22.410> gonna<00:04:22.620> come<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.220> it's<00:04:23.970> gonna<00:04:24.060> be

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
one's gonna come in and it's gonna be

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.760 
one's gonna come in and it's gonna be
stuck<00:04:24.480> on<00:04:24.630> here<00:04:24.900> they're<00:04:25.200> actually<00:04:25.320> gonna<00:04:25.590> be

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
stuck on here they're actually gonna be

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.830 
stuck on here they're actually gonna be
a<00:04:25.800> few<00:04:25.980> stuck<00:04:26.220> on<00:04:26.340> here<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.760> whenever<00:04:27.510> one

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
a few stuck on here and whenever one

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.250 
a few stuck on here and whenever one
comes<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.260> another<00:04:28.740> one<00:04:29.070> goes<00:04:29.550> out<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:31.080> one

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
comes in another one goes out so one

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.830 
comes in another one goes out so one
goes<00:04:31.440> into<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.919> ATP<00:04:32.400> synthase<00:04:32.820> another<00:04:33.600> one

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
goes into the ATP synthase another one

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.530 
goes into the ATP synthase another one
goes<00:04:34.140> out<00:04:34.350> now<00:04:35.130> this<00:04:35.370> entering<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.270> exiting

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
goes out now this entering and exiting

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.340 
goes out now this entering and exiting
of<00:04:37.130> H+<00:04:38.130> ions<00:04:38.550> or<00:04:38.790> hydrogen<00:04:39.300> ions<00:04:39.690> is<00:04:39.900> going<00:04:40.290> to

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
of H+ ions or hydrogen ions is going to

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.800 
of H+ ions or hydrogen ions is going to
create<00:04:40.620> it's<00:04:41.370> pretty<00:04:41.640> much<00:04:41.790> gonna<00:04:42.000> make<00:04:42.570> the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
create it's pretty much gonna make the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.920 
create it's pretty much gonna make the
top<00:04:43.290> part<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.800> ATP<00:04:44.400> synthase<00:04:44.910> spin<00:04:45.720> or

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
top part of the ATP synthase spin or

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.400 
top part of the ATP synthase spin or
rotate<00:04:46.710> now<00:04:47.550> whenever<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.570> top<00:04:48.780> part<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.200> this

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
rotate now whenever the top part of this

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.430 
rotate now whenever the top part of this
rotates<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.520> creates<00:04:51.180> energy<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:52.020> think<00:04:52.229> of<00:04:52.290> it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
rotates it creates energy so think of it

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.920 
rotates it creates energy so think of it
like<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:53.250> know<00:04:53.669> it's<00:04:53.820> kind<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.090> like<00:04:54.240> a<00:04:54.419> turbine

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
like I know it's kind of like a turbine

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.440 
like I know it's kind of like a turbine
this<00:04:55.620> spins<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.370> creates<00:04:56.640> energy<00:04:57.030> but

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
this spins and it creates energy but

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.030 
this spins and it creates energy but
instead<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:58.020> know<00:04:58.050> like<00:04:58.169> water<00:04:58.680> or

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
instead of you know like water or

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.969 
instead of you know like water or
something<00:04:59.520> or<00:04:59.700> wind<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.540> uses<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.229> gradient<00:05:01.650> of

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
something or wind it uses a gradient of

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.750 
something or wind it uses a gradient of
ions<00:05:02.640> instead<00:05:03.390> so<00:05:04.380> what<00:05:05.100> this<00:05:05.220> does<00:05:05.430> is<00:05:05.490> it

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
ions instead so what this does is it

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.850 
ions instead so what this does is it
creates<00:05:05.910> energy<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.870> bottom<00:05:07.350> part<00:05:07.680> can

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
creates energy that the bottom part can

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.990 
creates energy that the bottom part can
use<00:05:08.100> and<00:05:08.400> actually<00:05:09.120> once<00:05:09.660> you<00:05:09.840> get<00:05:10.050> three<00:05:10.680> I

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
use and actually once you get three I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.370 
use and actually once you get three I
can<00:05:12.000> draw<00:05:12.150> my<00:05:12.330> 3<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.570> little<00:05:12.720> better<00:05:12.960> come<00:05:13.229> on

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
can draw my 3 a little better come on

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.430 
can draw my 3 a little better come on
Bucky<00:05:13.650> step<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.250> up<00:05:14.340> once<00:05:15.060> you<00:05:15.210> get<00:05:15.419> three<00:05:16.200> of

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
Bucky step it up once you get three of

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.980 
Bucky step it up once you get three of
these<00:05:16.770> hydrogen<00:05:17.220> ions<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:18.000> enter<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.510> it<00:05:18.780> can

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
these hydrogen ions to enter it it can

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.409 
these hydrogen ions to enter it it can
create<00:05:19.290> enough<00:05:19.770> energy<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.729> make<00:05:21.150> something

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
create enough energy to make something

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.770 
create enough energy to make something
amazing<00:05:21.690> happen<00:05:22.680> well<00:05:23.250> what<00:05:23.850> amazing<00:05:24.600> thing

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
amazing happen well what amazing thing

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.750 
amazing happen well what amazing thing
is<00:05:24.900> going<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.080> happen<00:05:25.470> well<00:05:26.070> it's<00:05:26.310> gonna<00:05:26.490> take

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
is going to happen well it's gonna take

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.120 
is going to happen well it's gonna take
an<00:05:26.910> ATP

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
an ATP

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.580 
an ATP
which<00:05:30.130> I<00:05:30.310> guess<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.640> drew<00:05:30.880> like<00:05:31.060> that<00:05:31.420> and<00:05:31.870> a

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
which I guess I drew like that and a

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.110 
which I guess I drew like that and a
phosphate<00:05:32.920> what<00:05:33.700> you<00:05:33.940> evidently<00:05:34.690> is<00:05:34.990> pink<00:05:35.320> in

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
phosphate what you evidently is pink in

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.240 
phosphate what you evidently is pink in
this<00:05:37.120> bottom<00:05:37.540> part<00:05:37.750> right<00:05:37.780> here<00:05:38.230> once<00:05:38.950> it<00:05:39.130> has

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
this bottom part right here once it has

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.890 
this bottom part right here once it has
enough<00:05:39.550> energy<00:05:39.700> it<00:05:40.090> can<00:05:40.180> take<00:05:40.420> these<00:05:40.600> two

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
enough energy it can take these two

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.770 
enough energy it can take these two
molecules<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.620> smash<00:05:42.370> them<00:05:42.640> together<00:05:42.820> and<00:05:43.300> of

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
molecules and smash them together and of

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.620 
molecules and smash them together and of
course<00:05:44.020> whenever<00:05:44.530> you<00:05:44.710> combined<00:05:45.130> ADP<00:05:46.120> with

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
course whenever you combined ADP with

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.250 
course whenever you combined ADP with
another<00:05:47.110> P<00:05:47.410> it<00:05:47.650> forms<00:05:48.100> a<00:05:48.250> teepee<00:05:49.240> which<00:05:50.050> is

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
another P it forms a teepee which is

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.310 
another P it forms a teepee which is
energy<00:05:51.090> so<00:05:52.090> that's<00:05:52.540> pretty<00:05:52.750> much<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:52.990> that's

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
energy so that's pretty much it that's

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.190 
energy so that's pretty much it that's
how<00:05:53.790> ATP<00:05:54.790> synthase<00:05:55.390> which<00:05:55.450> is<00:05:55.810> this<00:05:55.990> molecule

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
how ATP synthase which is this molecule

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.830 
how ATP synthase which is this molecule
right<00:05:56.440> here<00:05:56.820> uses<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:58.150> energy<00:05:58.300> from<00:05:58.720> the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
right here uses the energy from the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.180 
right here uses the energy from the
gradient<00:05:59.260> to<00:05:59.410> make<00:05:59.440> a<00:06:00.180> teepee
