00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:02.840 
okay this part should be pretty simple

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.199 
okay this part should be pretty simple
I've<00:00:03.530> got<00:00:03.770> it<00:00:03.860> sitting<00:00:04.160> where<00:00:04.729> it's<00:00:04.879> propped

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:05.209 
I've got it sitting where it's propped

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.230 
I've got it sitting where it's propped
up<00:00:05.450> on<00:00:05.600> the<00:00:05.749> GPS<00:00:06.169> GPS<00:00:07.069> won't<00:00:07.579> lock<00:00:07.759> up<00:00:08.059> in<00:00:08.210> the

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
up on the GPS GPS won't lock up in the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.589 
up on the GPS GPS won't lock up in the
basement<00:00:08.509> especially<00:00:09.320> oriented<00:00:09.860> like<00:00:10.009> it<00:00:10.190> is

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:10.599 
basement especially oriented like it is

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.320 
basement especially oriented like it is
but<00:00:11.599> basically<00:00:12.429> that's<00:00:13.429> all<00:00:13.610> I'm<00:00:13.759> doing<00:00:14.179> is

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
but basically that's all I'm doing is

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.700 
but basically that's all I'm doing is
plugging<00:00:14.839> in<00:00:15.169> the<00:00:16.090> USB<00:00:17.090> port<00:00:17.570> I<00:00:17.960> just<00:00:18.470> took<00:00:18.620> it

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
plugging in the USB port I just took it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.410 
plugging in the USB port I just took it
outside<00:00:18.890> and<00:00:19.340> played<00:00:19.520> with<00:00:19.730> it<00:00:19.850> on<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.000> Auto

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
outside and played with it on a Auto

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.320 
outside and played with it on a Auto
mission

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
mission

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.499 
mission
