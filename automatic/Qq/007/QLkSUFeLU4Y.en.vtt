00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
um I guess the thing that I noticed the

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.710 
um I guess the thing that I noticed the
most<00:00:47.680> is<00:00:47.980> just<00:00:48.550> how<00:00:48.879> much<00:00:49.030> thicker<00:00:49.330> and<00:00:49.570> longer

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
most is just how much thicker and longer

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.140 
most is just how much thicker and longer
they<00:00:50.110> are<00:00:50.260> when<00:00:50.710> what<00:00:51.370> do<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:51.549> do<00:00:51.699> use<00:00:51.909> them

they are when what do you do use them

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.680 
they are when what do you do use them
okay<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:53.290> we<00:00:53.710> might<00:00:53.920> as<00:00:53.949> well<00:00:54.330> you<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:55.449> primer

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.649 
okay so we might as well you the primer
on<00:00:55.869> heron<00:00:56.400> okay<00:00:57.400> you<00:00:58.089> know<00:00:58.210> it's<00:00:58.420> great<00:00:58.570> for

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
on heron okay you know it's great for

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.649 
on heron okay you know it's great for
both<00:00:58.989> I<00:00:59.409> think<00:01:00.250> I<00:01:00.400> find<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:02.170> you<00:01:02.769> want<00:01:03.129> to

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
both I think I find that if you want to

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.330 
both I think I find that if you want to
curl<00:01:04.659> your<00:01:04.750> lashes<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.619> really<00:01:05.890> hold<00:01:06.159> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
curl your lashes and really hold the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.010 
curl your lashes and really hold the
curl<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:06.640> think<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.270> works<00:01:07.450> better<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.600> not<00:01:10.780> put

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
curl I think it works better to not put

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.420 
curl I think it works better to not put
it<00:01:11.110> on<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.380> top<00:01:11.670> okay<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.860> put<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.250> on

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
it on the top okay so you put this on

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.120 
it on the top okay so you put this on
before<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:15.939> a<00:01:16.420> curl<00:01:17.250> um<00:01:18.250> yes<00:01:18.850> well<00:01:19.830> no<00:01:20.830> you

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
before you a curl um yes well no you

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.160 
before you a curl um yes well no you
don't<00:01:21.280> have<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.700> could<00:01:21.820> do<00:01:21.969> either<00:01:22.119> way<00:01:25.170> so

end of the lashes so that way it'll curl
fluidly<00:02:04.940> rather<00:02:05.479> than<00:02:06.250> straight<00:02:07.250> up<00:02:07.460> okay

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240

the markup sometimes if you've got this

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.090 
the markup sometimes if you've got this
really<00:03:09.630> difficult<00:03:10.170> curling<00:03:11.130> lashes<00:03:13.100> about

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
really difficult curling lashes about

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.320 
really difficult curling lashes about
what<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.790> little<00:03:15.540> bit<00:03:16.130> um<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:18.150> might

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
what I have a little bit um you might

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.390 
what I have a little bit um you might
want<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.630> put<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> coat<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.290> mascara<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:20.010> first

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
want to put a coat of mascara on first

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.010 
want to put a coat of mascara on first
and<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:22.170> find<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.650> using<00:03:23.430> there's<00:03:24.240> um<00:03:24.450> curling

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
and I find that using there's um curling

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.690 
and I find that using there's um curling
masters<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:25.830> think<00:03:26.070> it<00:03:26.220> there's<00:03:26.460> also

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
masters that you think it there's also

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.630 
masters that you think it there's also
um<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.900> think<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> waterproof<00:03:28.950> mascaras

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
um I think the waterproof mascaras

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.140 
um I think the waterproof mascaras
really<00:03:30.060> work<00:03:30.210> best<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.230> hold<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.650> curl

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
really work best to really hold the curl

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.980 
really work best to really hold the curl
so<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:34.110> would<00:03:34.260> suggest<00:03:34.470> water<00:03:34.920> phase<00:03:35.220> over

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
so you would suggest water phase over

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.710 
so you would suggest water phase over
yes<00:03:36.990> my<00:03:37.260> true<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.340> mean<00:03:38.910> what's<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.300> difference

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
yes my true I mean what's the difference

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
like if it's not waterproof how can it

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.820
