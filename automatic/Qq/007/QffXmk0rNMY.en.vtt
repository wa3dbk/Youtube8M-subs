00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello welcome to disabled 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.470
 barrier-free de are in the mobile center 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.380
 sawatzki and today we test in 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.420
 the most practical is your system 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.330
 We recently reported on the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.240
 The fair was seen as a demonstration 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.359
 one or the other wall but today would like 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.869
 I really drive without legs and 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.400
 without touching the steering wheel and that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.320
 Show and test was 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.960
 you really have to say that I am 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.149
 never drove with fucking the system 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.559
 and therefore very exciting for me 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.430
 I'm a little bit excited, but then 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 I always come with olli and willi willi 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.899
 of course with willi's willi has to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.039
 Filming is of course a huge thing 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.510
 challenge willi is filming and i'm driving 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.629
 as the first time really the hammer 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.940
 I you you get here a system 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.329
 bit left and right and how out 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.219
 long time, of course, the canon 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.980
 was I here about the vip switch 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.140
 what you have already shown gas 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.840
 and slow down that really means mine 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.330
 feet i know this is hard because of 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.000
 Will sits behind and really films like that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.710
 My feet touching not the gas pedal 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.290
 I 'm really doing everything now 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.360
 this lever and we test it now 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.610
 really times with me and very nice 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.590
 Driving instructor can take part 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.299
 also just before stones good day my name 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 is bernd schultz from mobile sender 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.799
 zawadzki ok and thank God we have 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.350
 interpol I really was the one now 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.299
 first seconds here with the system 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.990
 I never made them believe that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.119
 I can get it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.530
 I sure think so like me 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.840
 You may have met them 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.320
 We try now times as willi going 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.210
 okay 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.400
 I'm really curious about that 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.940
 first meter god be in here 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.350
 industrial area not so much traffic 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.030
 but are really my first meters 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.729
 I want to say excited 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.740
 I give you now I can not or I 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.940
 it does not intervene into the steering wheel could 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.880
 I now also in the steering wheel 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.009
 intervene additionally no the force 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.780
 they would not overcome this 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.580
 put motors but you see here 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.649
 a red button that is for driving instructors 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.320
 meant that means when I realize that 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.060
 you get a fit now or 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.530
 Then I could pass out immediately 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.720
 can beat on it then if you can 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.600
 Use the steering wheel again as normal 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.459
 Ok, so let's say that 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.060
 road already tight but I already have a 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.010
 I can feel very good and blink 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.880
 now too 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.290
 now we have already gave the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.970
 voice control which one could do now 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.860
 but also integrate with it 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.500
 probably you who spoke steering 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.780
 would be activated by the button on the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.430
 joystick and they just talk 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.260
 the command and then that would 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.230
 vehicle doing what you want 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.870
 for the secondary functions so klinger 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.590
 lichthupe and so on I really was 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.930
 Now a few seconds and does that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.690
 sure and feel really already 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.670
 very very sure what i say so 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.230
 unbelievable so i really would have 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.180
 So now really a threshold 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.130
 hurry to give it a try because 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.890
 he thought he definitely needed 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.989
 some time to get used to something like that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.230
 I'm just totally surprised that now 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.650
 I drive the vehicle all with one hand 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.650
 control 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.220
 you also drive a curve 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.370
 yes that is a prerequisite for good 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.370
 year 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.690
 How many hours do you need it? 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.020
 I have the three years now 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.700
 if someone says the driving school now 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.590
 I visited and now completely new 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.080
 you have to learn how many 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 the people about need hours to hours 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.500
 they get along with it 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.470
 that is very different i would 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.930
 claim between 20 and 120 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.880
 driving hours 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.770
 that depends a lot on the disability and 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.930
 which must be that in the case 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.000
 with the learner in the past 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.920
 So it has already excited them now 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.320
 for example, they make that out of the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.360
 web ripe okay but conditions to 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.990
 for the people already a driving test 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.490
 Shake it down correctly and play it 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.470
 a role if anyone ever 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.480
 has driven and people are easier 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.220
 was already a driver or have 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.410
 to make the sneijder driver's license 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.440
 can you say it out well that would 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.150
 me between the older and the younger 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.250
 and somebody else makes a difference 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.950
 has already had a driving license and 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.290
 a pattern as a classic pattern 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.300
 it has to be in itself 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.220
 habituation while a young one still 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.440
 had no license can be 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.840
 Just then adjust accordingly 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.699
 he has that a little easier 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.479
 also the dosage of brakes and 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.050
 really great gas that makes me 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.330
 courage 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.539
 that is also important that it makes me 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.080
 courage I have ms and progress 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.660
 is allowed to test something and may drive 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.120
 It's not that I'm not scared 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.940
 got to 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.699
 For the future I will continue to be mobile 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.000
 stay and that really does me too 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.440
 courage I have to say I know now here 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.180
 probably even a few 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.090
 problems that does not 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.510
 I am satisfied I am accident free 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.330
 drove and have the car like that 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.850
 safely brought back by sawatzki as 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.300
 he really people I have to say comes 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.440
 over here in the mobile center zawadzki 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.630
 test the system 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.210
 you will be really surprised how 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:32.610
 easily six drivers leaves you soon 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.610
 olli and willi and then schultz
