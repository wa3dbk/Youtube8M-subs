the bottom right they actually indicate

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.740 
the bottom right they actually indicate
that<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.340> you're<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.790> area<00:00:36.149> or<00:00:36.510> when

you take hold of the province you can

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.160 
you take hold of the province you can
recruit<00:00:39.809> those<00:00:40.309> units<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.579> mercenaries<00:00:42.270> and

recruit those units as mercenaries and
this<00:00:43.320> will<00:00:43.469> change<00:00:43.710> depending<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.340> what

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this will change depending on what

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
this will change depending on what
region<00:00:44.789> you're<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.210> also<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> distance

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
region you're in also in the distance

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
region you're in also in the distance
you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:47.010> these<00:00:47.399> very<00:00:47.670> small<00:00:47.850> ships<00:00:49.610> sort

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
you can see these very small ships sort

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.319 
you can see these very small ships sort
of<00:00:50.750> docking<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:52.020> Alexandria<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.940> these<00:00:54.120> will

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
of docking at Alexandria and these will

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.119 
of docking at Alexandria and these will
actually<00:00:54.360> move<00:00:54.840> along<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> trade<00:00:55.680> routes<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
actually move along the trade routes I

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
actually move along the trade routes I
presume<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:56.789> trade<00:00:57.090> ships<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> can't<00:00:57.899> think

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
presume there trade ships I can't think

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.569 
presume there trade ships I can't think
what<00:00:58.410> else<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
what else they would be because the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.220 
what else they would be because the
normal<00:00:59.910> sort<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.180> warships<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.140> in

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
normal sort of warships you can see in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.930 
normal sort of warships you can see in
the<00:01:01.320> foreground<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:02.070> pretty<00:01:02.340> pretty<00:01:02.730> damn

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the foreground are pretty pretty damn

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
the foreground are pretty pretty damn
big<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.449> quite<00:01:03.750> obvious<00:01:04.170> same<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.739> normal

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
big and quite obvious same as the normal

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
big and quite obvious same as the normal
avatar<00:01:05.729> size<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> yeah<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.590> these<00:01:07.680> small

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
avatar size so yeah you get these small

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.920 
avatar size so yeah you get these small
sort<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> trade<00:01:08.430> ships<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.659> move

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
sort of trade ships that actually move

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.109 
sort of trade ships that actually move
along<00:01:10.229> routes<00:01:10.590> you'll<00:01:11.280> also<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.760> able<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.000> see

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
along routes you'll also be able to see

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.880 
along routes you'll also be able to see
occasionally<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:13.020> wonders<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
occasionally these wonders of the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
occasionally these wonders of the
ancient<00:01:13.920> world<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.060> example<00:01:15.119> you've<00:01:15.600> got

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
ancient world so for example you've got

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
ancient world so for example you've got
the<00:01:15.990> Great<00:01:16.320> Pyramids<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> Giza<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.119> in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the Great Pyramids of Giza there and in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.370 
the Great Pyramids of Giza there and in
the<00:01:18.390> distance<00:01:18.479> you've<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> Lighthouse

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the distance you've got the Lighthouse

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.130 
the distance you've got the Lighthouse
of<00:01:19.560> Alexandria<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.689> give<00:01:21.960> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
of Alexandria and they will give you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.109 
of Alexandria and they will give you
benefits<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.630> region<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.409> province<00:01:26.119> so

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
benefits to your region or province so

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.090 
benefits to your region or province so
for<00:01:27.360> they<00:01:27.570> gave<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.080> example<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
for they gave the example of the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
for they gave the example of the
pyramids<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:29.850> say<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> pyramids<00:01:30.450> will

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
pyramids they say the pyramids will

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.539 
pyramids they say the pyramids will
actually<00:01:31.140> generate<00:01:31.170> increased<00:01:31.979> income

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
actually generate increased income

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.530 
actually generate increased income
because<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.960> would<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.470> wealthy<00:01:34.920> Roman

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
because you would get to wealthy Roman

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.260 
because you would get to wealthy Roman
citizens<00:01:36.890> being<00:01:37.890> tourists<00:01:38.579> basically<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
citizens being tourists basically and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390 
citizens being tourists basically and
going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> visit<00:01:39.810> these<00:01:40.079> pyramids<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.250> they

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
going to visit these pyramids so they

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
going to visit these pyramids so they
would<00:01:41.579> actually<00:01:41.939> generate<00:01:42.270> their<00:01:42.420> own<00:01:42.450> income

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
would actually generate their own income

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.469 
would actually generate their own income

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
of shanty towns and the whole settlement

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
of shanty towns and the whole settlement
will<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.380> change<00:01:55.680> depending<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.369> how

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
will actually change depending on how

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.300 
will actually change depending on how
big<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.450> city<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.200> how<00:01:58.710> many<00:01:58.770> construction

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
big the city is how many construction

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.109 
big the city is how many construction
sites<00:01:59.549> you've<00:02:00.090> got<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.320> add<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:02.119> new

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
sites you've got so you can add a new

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.060 
sites you've got so you can add a new
construction<00:02:03.780> site<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.829> will<00:02:04.920> actually

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
construction site and it will actually

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.789 
construction site and it will actually
expand<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.270> city<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> city<00:02:07.560> will

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
expand the city so the city will

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.279 
expand the city so the city will
visually<00:02:08.250> appear<00:02:08.729> bigger<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.869> this

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
visually appear bigger and this

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.380 
visually appear bigger and this
screenshot<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.190> pretty<00:02:11.730> good<00:02:11.910> because<00:02:12.060> you've

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
screenshot is pretty good because you've

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.309 
screenshot is pretty good because you've
got<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> left<00:02:13.020> hand

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
got on the left hand

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.470 
got on the left hand
so<00:02:13.439> this<00:02:13.709> settlement<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.370> fairly<00:02:14.730> small<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
so this settlement is fairly small and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.629 
so this settlement is fairly small and
on<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> right<00:02:16.140> hand<00:02:16.379> side<00:02:16.530> there's<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.069> very

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639 
on the right hand side there's a very

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.479 
on the right hand side there's a very
sort<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> sprawling<00:02:18.540> large<00:02:18.959> settlement<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
sort of sprawling large settlement and

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.709 
sort of sprawling large settlement and
they<00:02:20.700> actually<00:02:20.999> said<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.629> know

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
they actually said that you know

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.239 
they actually said that you know
something<00:02:22.049> like<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.349> small<00:02:22.650> settlement<00:02:23.129> you

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:23.249 
something like that small settlement you

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:24.949 
something like that small settlement you
can<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.489> in<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.670> middle<00:02:23.939> can<00:02:24.359> be<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.599> three

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
can see in the middle can be up to three

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.780 
can see in the middle can be up to three
or<00:02:25.109> four<00:02:25.319> times<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:25.799> big<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.340> could<00:02:26.579> if<00:02:26.730> you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
or four times as big so you could if you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.330 
or four times as big so you could if you
want<00:02:27.329> invest<00:02:27.870> your<00:02:28.019> money<00:02:28.079> in<00:02:28.469> something<00:02:28.950> like

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that small settlement and make it you

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.420 
that small settlement and make it you
know<00:02:31.079> really<00:02:31.319> big<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.159> you<00:02:32.250> see<00:02:32.400> on

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
know really big like the one you see on

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.910 
know really big like the one you see on
the<00:02:32.549> right<00:02:33.530> something<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.680> thought<00:02:34.859> was

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the right something that I thought was

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.069 
the right something that I thought was
pretty<00:02:35.280> cool<00:02:35.430> was<00:02:35.909> that<00:02:35.939> this<00:02:36.510> sort<00:02:36.689> of<00:02:36.719> feel

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
pretty cool was that this sort of feel

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.140 
pretty cool was that this sort of feel
of<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.739> map<00:02:38.040> will<00:02:38.370> change<00:02:38.730> depending<00:02:38.939> on

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
of the map will change depending on

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.729 
of the map will change depending on
where<00:02:39.419> you<00:02:39.569> are<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:40.079> for<00:02:40.260> example<00:02:40.319> is

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
where you are this for example is

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.360 
where you are this for example is
overlooking<00:02:41.730> turkey<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:43.230> pontus<00:02:43.859> i<00:02:44.069> believe

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
overlooking turkey and pontus i believe

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.869 
overlooking turkey and pontus i believe
but<00:02:45.090> they<00:02:45.900> mentioned<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.639> north

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
but they mentioned that in the north

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.220 
but they mentioned that in the north
you're<00:02:48.239> going<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.419> have<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.599> lot<00:02:48.780> more<00:02:48.900> dense

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
you're going to have a lot more dense

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.839 
you're going to have a lot more dense
woodland<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.189> actually<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.489> this

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
woodland and you can actually see this

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.179 
woodland and you can actually see this
on<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> gameplay<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.799> can<00:02:52.919> hear<00:02:53.099> the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.780 
winds howling and these different sound
effects<00:02:55.590> will<00:02:55.829> give<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> really<00:02:56.430> real

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
was just a quick overview really of some

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.199 
was just a quick overview really of some
of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.409> visual<00:03:14.069> elements<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.549> could<00:03:14.699> see<00:03:14.879> in

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
of the visual elements you could see in

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.879 
of the visual elements you could see in
the<00:03:15.299> gameplay<00:03:15.689> and<00:03:15.989> some<00:03:16.199> of<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.379> screenshots

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
the gameplay and some of the screenshots

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.259 
the gameplay and some of the screenshots
that<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.159> been<00:03:17.280> released<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:18.060> probably

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
that have been released you probably

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.759 
that have been released you probably
could<00:03:18.509> have<00:03:18.540> worked<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.870> lot<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.079> this<00:03:19.199> info<00:03:19.560> out

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
could have worked a lot of this info out

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.199 
could have worked a lot of this info out
but<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.519> thought<00:03:20.609> I'd<00:03:20.759> cover<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.150> for

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
but I just thought I'd cover this for

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.899 
but I just thought I'd cover this for
completion<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.769> just<00:03:23.159> to<00:03:23.220> add<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.549> few<00:03:23.729> bits

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
completion and just to add in a few bits

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.089 
completion and just to add in a few bits
