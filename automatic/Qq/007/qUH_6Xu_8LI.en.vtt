00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 ARE THE BEST CIA AGENCIES 

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.400
 TREATED FOR ANY SITUATION 

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:20.900
 You're my best friend. I trust you. 

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.200
 I know you put a neck on me. And I'm back for you. 

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:27.000
 ON ONE 

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:28.400
 What is it on your computer? 

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.800
 Oh, I'm looking at my girl's photo. 

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.400
 I'm doing the same thing! Do you want to see her? 

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:35.000
 - Three. - One two Three 

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.300
 - That's ... - Lauren Scott? 

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.500
 I feel weird about dating two men at once. 

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.300
 Do you think Gloria Steinem was imprisoned just to be a whore? 

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:45.800
 I think I'll go to hell. 

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.000
 Get into it, you have to be flexible. 

00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:48.500
 You know what? Go with her. 

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.500
 It wouldn't be fair of me if we didn't see the picture. 

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.200
 Sorry, what's that supposed to mean? 

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.000
 I think we should clarify the rules. 

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:54.500
 I think yes. 

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.400
 We shouldn't tell her we know each other. 

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:57.500
 We will all go our way. 

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.400
 Let her scramble. 

00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:00.900
 Let the best win. 

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.500
 This is an operation to catch and hold. 

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.500
 Watch Agent Henson. 

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:12.500
 Don't disappoint your country, boys. 

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.400
 SECRET AGENT 

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.500
 This is a perfect evening. 

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.000
 Make them rain. 

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.000
 AGAINST THE SECRET AGENT 

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:24.500
 I'm right back. 

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:38.500
 Seriously? 

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:41.400
 REESE WITHERsPOON 

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.200
 Have you killed someone with your bare hands? 

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:45.400
 Not like that. 

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:46.500
 CHRIS PINE 

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:49.900
 TOM HARDY 

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.500
 Tuck, this is my friend. 

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:55.700
 Ok. You can do this. Maybe they just shake hands. 

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:57.900
 I will probably pass out. 

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:05.500
 I offer to sleep with both of them and find out who's worth it. 

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.000
 - Why is he listening to the old man? - I have no idea. 

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.500
 THIS IS WAR 

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.000
 I think I got stuck somehow. Oh my god! ------------------------------ 1f7bed81706b--
