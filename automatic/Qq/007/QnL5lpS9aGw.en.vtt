00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
like 28 minutes or so so I'm going to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.880 
like 28 minutes or so so I'm going to
put<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.040> see<00:03:08.040> how<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.280> turns<00:03:08.489> out<00:03:09.769> all<00:03:10.769> right

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
put it in see how it turns out all right

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.729 
put it in see how it turns out all right
so<00:03:10.950> here's<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:12.470> cake<00:03:13.470> pops<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.130> see<00:03:14.280> they

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
so here's the cake pops you can see they

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.890 
so here's the cake pops you can see they
came<00:03:16.739> out<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.130> top<00:03:17.160> quite<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> bit<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.480> I

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
came out the top quite a bit and I

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.420 
came out the top quite a bit and I
actually<00:03:19.019> only<00:03:19.320> put<00:03:19.560> them<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.830> for<00:03:19.950> 20<00:03:20.190> minutes

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
actually only put them in for 20 minutes

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.199 
actually only put them in for 20 minutes
but<00:03:20.840> they<00:03:21.840> come<00:03:22.080> right<00:03:22.260> off<00:03:22.910> kind<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.000> funny

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
but they come right off kind of funny

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.600 
but they come right off kind of funny
looking<00:03:24.650> like<00:03:25.650> little<00:03:25.950> mushrooms<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:29.550> can

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
looking like little mushrooms you can

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
looking like little mushrooms you can
see<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.180> they<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:32.190> come<00:03:32.459> right<00:03:32.489> off<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
see that they just come right off and it

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.880 
see that they just come right off and it
did<00:03:33.810> help<00:03:34.760> spring<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.970> top<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.570> pan

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.959 

so<00:03:41.890> I'm<00:03:42.189> going<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.370> go<00:03:42.459> ahead<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.670> take<00:03:42.819> the

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
directions I took off the lids after

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.420 
directions I took off the lids after
letting<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.140> pans<00:03:50.500> cool<00:03:50.859> for<00:03:51.099> about<00:03:51.159> five

minutes in the refrigerator here's what

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:06.289 
minutes in the refrigerator here's what
they<00:03:55.060> look<00:03:55.299> like<00:03:56.670> kind<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:57.819> delicate

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.619 

interesting

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
interesting

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.229 
interesting
see<00:04:09.260> how<00:04:09.409> they<00:04:09.590> hold<00:04:09.769> up<00:04:10.010> dipping<00:04:10.909> them<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.150> the

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
see how they hold up dipping them in the

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.530 
see how they hold up dipping them in the
candy<00:04:11.629> coating<00:04:12.340> believe<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.519> directions<00:04:14.209> say

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
candy coating believe the directions say

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.590 
candy coating believe the directions say
to<00:04:15.370> put<00:04:16.370> them<00:04:16.519> in<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.729> freezer<00:04:16.970> for<00:04:17.180> 10

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
to put them in the freezer for 10

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.740 
to put them in the freezer for 10
minutes<00:04:17.959> after<00:04:18.289> you<00:04:18.380> put<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.739> sticks<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:22.750> dip

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
minutes after you put the sticks in dip

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.379 
minutes after you put the sticks in dip
the<00:04:23.900> end<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.199> baked<00:04:24.380> pop<00:04:24.650> stick<00:04:25.009> into<00:04:25.880> the

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
the end of the baked pop stick into the

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.040 
the end of the baked pop stick into the
coating<00:04:26.870> then<00:04:27.110> insert<00:04:27.500> into<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.889> cake<00:04:28.099> ball

place into the freezer for 10 minutes

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.980 
place into the freezer for 10 minutes
until<00:04:31.699> coating<00:04:32.389> is<00:04:32.660> hard<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:35.240> I'll<00:04:35.660> try<00:04:35.930> that

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
until coating is hard so I'll try that

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.200 
until coating is hard so I'll try that
now<00:04:40.780> here's<00:04:41.780> some<00:04:42.020> of<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.199> cake<00:04:42.410> balls<00:04:43.180> when<00:04:44.180> I

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
now here's some of the cake balls when I

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.990 
now here's some of the cake balls when I
took<00:04:44.330> them<00:04:44.660> out<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.259> the<00:04:45.500> pan<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:46.639> was<00:04:46.759> like<00:04:46.970> a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
took them out of the pan that was like a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.120 
took them out of the pan that was like a
lip<00:04:47.330> on<00:04:47.599> them<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.289> I<00:04:48.320> ended<00:04:48.590> up<00:04:48.680> having<00:04:48.889> to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
lip on them and so I ended up having to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.680 
lip on them and so I ended up having to
I<00:04:49.870> tried<00:04:50.870> using<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.289> knife<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:52.000> shave<00:04:53.000> off<00:04:53.419> that

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
I tried using a knife to shave off that

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.600 
I tried using a knife to shave off that
lip<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.199> that<00:04:54.320> didn't<00:04:54.710> work<00:04:54.860> so<00:04:54.889> well<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.580> I

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
lip and that didn't work so well so I

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.749 
lip and that didn't work so well so I
just<00:04:55.699> ended<00:04:56.150> up<00:04:56.300> using<00:04:56.620> like<00:04:57.759> kitchen

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
just ended up using like kitchen

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.330 
just ended up using like kitchen
scissors<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.840> trimming<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.830> and<00:05:01.009> it<00:05:01.130> didn't

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
scissors and trimming it and it didn't

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.810 
scissors and trimming it and it didn't
turn<00:05:01.520> out<00:05:01.669> too<00:05:01.910> bad<00:05:01.940> I<00:05:03.310> didn't<00:05:04.310> use<00:05:04.490> the

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
turn out too bad I didn't use the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.960 
turn out too bad I didn't use the
plastic<00:05:05.060> reusable<00:05:06.020> sticks<00:05:06.289> I<00:05:06.530> bought<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.070> the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
plastic reusable sticks I bought the the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.710 
plastic reusable sticks I bought the the
Wilton<00:05:08.419> I<00:05:09.099> think<00:05:10.099> it<00:05:10.190> was<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.789> 4<00:05:11.479> inch

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
Wilton I think it was the the 4 inch

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.960 
Wilton I think it was the the 4 inch
sticks<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:13.280> these<00:05:13.430> are<00:05:13.580> almost<00:05:13.820> too<00:05:14.630> soft<00:05:15.080> I

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
sticks and these are almost too soft I

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.040 
sticks and these are almost too soft I
probably<00:05:16.970> should<00:05:17.210> have<00:05:17.240> left<00:05:17.509> them<00:05:17.750> in<00:05:17.930> the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
probably should have left them in the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.529 
probably should have left them in the
oven<00:05:18.320> a<00:05:18.440> little<00:05:18.620> longer<00:05:19.159> they<00:05:20.150> were<00:05:20.270> only<00:05:20.419> in

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
oven a little longer they were only in

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.219 
oven a little longer they were only in
there<00:05:20.630> for<00:05:20.690> 20<00:05:21.110> minutes<00:05:21.139> maybe<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.979> full<00:05:22.190> 25

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
there for 20 minutes maybe the full 25

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.899 
there for 20 minutes maybe the full 25
but<00:05:24.229> they<00:05:24.770> didn't<00:05:24.979> come<00:05:25.070> out<00:05:25.190> too<00:05:25.370> bad<00:05:25.550> you<00:05:25.729> can

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
but they didn't come out too bad you can

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.990 
but they didn't come out too bad you can
see<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.710> then<00:05:27.710> dealing<00:05:28.340> with<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.580> candy

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
see and then dealing with the candy

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.360 
see and then dealing with the candy
coating<00:05:29.389> is<00:05:29.509> just<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:29.930> nightmare<00:05:30.139> I<00:05:30.650> think<00:05:31.070> I

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
coating is just a nightmare I think I

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.620 
coating is just a nightmare I think I
warm<00:05:32.330> it<00:05:32.479> up<00:05:32.599> and<00:05:32.840> then<00:05:33.639> swirl<00:05:34.639> it<00:05:34.970> around<00:05:35.060> and

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
warm it up and then swirl it around and

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.499 
warm it up and then swirl it around and
there<00:05:35.810> and<00:05:36.139> it's<00:05:36.289> just<00:05:36.759> they<00:05:37.759> suggested<00:05:38.360> maybe

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
there and it's just they suggested maybe

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.240 
there and it's just they suggested maybe
