that<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:01.110> all<00:00:01.469> about<00:00:02.040> numbers<00:00:02.550> everything

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
that is all about numbers everything

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.630 
that is all about numbers everything
that<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.810> learn<00:00:04.020> in<00:00:04.200> mathematics<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:05.040> nothing

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
that you learn in mathematics is nothing

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.309 
that you learn in mathematics is nothing
but<00:00:05.819> different<00:00:05.970> forms<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.569> number<00:00:06.930> patterns

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
but different forms of number patterns

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.280 
but different forms of number patterns
actually<00:00:07.890> not<00:00:08.429> just<00:00:08.730> math<00:00:09.030> but<00:00:09.450> all<00:00:09.660> physical

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
actually not just math but all physical

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.190 
actually not just math but all physical
phenomena<00:00:10.860> natural<00:00:11.610> phenomena<00:00:12.200> everything

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
phenomena natural phenomena everything

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.079 
phenomena natural phenomena everything
can<00:00:13.410> really<00:00:13.769> be<00:00:13.920> explained<00:00:14.460> using<00:00:14.639> number

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
can really be explained using number

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.880 
can really be explained using number
patterns<00:00:15.480> right<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:15.839> these<00:00:16.049> number<00:00:16.470> patterns

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
patterns right so these number patterns

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.510 
patterns right so these number patterns
are<00:00:17.039> at<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> very<00:00:17.789> core<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.750> all<00:00:19.199> math<00:00:19.980> or<00:00:20.220> all

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
are at a very core of all math or all

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.359 
are at a very core of all math or all
nature<00:00:21.029> right<00:00:21.270> let's<00:00:22.199> look<00:00:22.439> at<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.740> very<00:00:23.039> simple

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
nature right let's look at a very simple

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.290 
nature right let's look at a very simple
number<00:00:24.330> pattern<00:00:24.689> right<00:00:24.900> let's<00:00:25.140> say<00:00:25.320> 1<00:00:25.650> 3<00:00:26.130> 5<00:00:26.609> 7

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
number pattern right let's say 1 3 5 7

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.480 
number pattern right let's say 1 3 5 7
what<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.109> these<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> look<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:28.980> them<00:00:29.189> what

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
what are these if you look at them what

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.429 
what are these if you look at them what
are<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:30.539> are<00:00:30.750> nothing<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.109> odd

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
are they these are nothing but odd

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.170 
are they these are nothing but odd
numbers<00:00:31.890> these<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.430> nothing<00:00:32.700> but<00:00:32.850> odd

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
numbers these are nothing but odd

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880 
numbers these are nothing but odd
numbers<00:00:33.630> right<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.350> could<00:00:34.620> visualize

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
numbers right now you could visualize

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.030 
numbers right now you could visualize
them<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.820> trying<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.989> triangle<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
them as trying this one triangle this is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.330 
them as trying this one triangle this is
three<00:00:38.430> triangles<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.690> divide<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.340> further

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
three triangles if I divide it further

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.760 
three triangles if I divide it further
this<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.270> five<00:00:42.570> triangles<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.290> seven

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
this will be five triangles here seven

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
this will be five triangles here seven
triangles<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.450> want<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> divide<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
triangles right so if I want to divide a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.470 
triangles right so if I want to divide a
triangle<00:00:46.800> into<00:00:47.100> each<00:00:47.340> part<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.030> two<00:00:48.329> equal

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
triangle into each part in two equal

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.380 
triangle into each part in two equal
areas<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:50.100> number<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> triangles<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.149> will<00:00:51.239> get

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
areas the number of triangles I will get

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
areas the number of triangles I will get
in<00:00:51.600> each<00:00:51.809> row<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.649> an<00:00:52.770> odd<00:00:52.949> right

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
in each row is going to be an odd right

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
in each row is going to be an odd right
this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> visualize<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.350> now

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this is one way to visualize it now

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.020 
this is one way to visualize it now
let's<00:00:56.190> add<00:00:56.370> them<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.120> 1<00:00:58.219> 1<00:00:59.219> &amp;<00:00:59.520> 3<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.000> add

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
let's add them and see 1 1 &amp; 3 you add

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.349 
let's add them and see 1 1 &amp; 3 you add
you'll<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.719> 4<00:01:01.079> 1<00:01:01.710> plus<00:01:02.010> 3<00:01:02.280> plus<00:01:02.430> 5<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.270> will

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
you'll get 4 1 plus 3 plus 5 you will

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.560 
you'll get 4 1 plus 3 plus 5 you will
get<00:01:03.539> 9<00:01:03.780> 1<00:01:04.500> plus<00:01:04.769> 3<00:01:05.010> plus<00:01:05.159> 5<00:01:05.460> plus<00:01:05.820> 7<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.450> will

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
get 9 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 you will

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.710 
get 9 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 you will
get<00:01:06.720> 16<00:01:07.140> right<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.540> nothing<00:01:09.540> but

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
get 16 right what are these nothing but

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.109 
get 16 right what are these nothing but
square<00:01:10.049> numbers<00:01:10.530> right<00:01:11.070> why<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.970> get

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
square numbers right why do you get

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
square numbers right why do you get
square<00:01:12.390> numbers<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.380> adding<00:01:13.830> triangles

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
square numbers because adding triangles

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
square numbers because adding triangles
gives<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.670> squares<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:15.630> two<00:01:15.990> triangles

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
gives you squares right two triangles

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.950 
gives you squares right two triangles
make<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.830> square<00:01:17.070> which<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.850> why<00:01:18.180> adding

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
make up a square which is why adding

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.780 
make up a square which is why adding
these<00:01:19.080> numbers<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.710> represented<00:01:20.340> triangles

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
these numbers that represented triangles

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.969 
these numbers that represented triangles
gave<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> square<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.770> way

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
gave you a square so it's just one way

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.800 
gave you a square so it's just one way
to<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.909> there's<00:01:24.270> another<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.780> we

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to see it right there's another way we

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.350 
to see it right there's another way we
can<00:01:25.110> visualize<00:01:25.530> triangles<00:01:26.100> let's<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:27.060> one

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
can visualize triangles let's take one

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:35.080 
can visualize triangles let's take one
then<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.710> 1<00:01:29.009> &amp;<00:01:29.310> 2<00:01:30.299> 1<00:01:31.200> 2<00:01:31.770> &amp;<00:01:32.040> 3<00:01:32.390> 1<00:01:33.390> 2<00:01:33.930> 3<00:01:34.409> &amp;<00:01:34.770> 4

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
then I have 1 &amp; 2 1 2 &amp; 3 1 2 3 &amp; 4

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.870 
then I have 1 &amp; 2 1 2 &amp; 3 1 2 3 &amp; 4
these<00:01:36.090> are<00:01:36.150> all<00:01:36.840> triangles<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.610> first

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
these are all triangles right the first

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.300 
these are all triangles right the first
one<00:01:39.030> has<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.960> point<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.799> second<00:01:41.189> one

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
one has just one point the second one

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.969 
one has just one point the second one
has<00:01:41.520> three<00:01:41.970> points<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.960> third<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.439> has<00:01:43.649> six

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
has three points the third one has six

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.539 
has three points the third one has six
points

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
points

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.780 
points
the<00:01:44.700> fourth<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.180> has<00:01:45.390> n<00:01:45.630> points<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.640> we

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the fourth one has n points right so we

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.539 
the fourth one has n points right so we
call<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.130> triangular<00:01:50.130> numbers

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
call all of these as triangular numbers

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.700 
call all of these as triangular numbers
right<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:51.119> call<00:01:51.390> them<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.720> triangular<00:01:52.320> numbers

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
right we call them as triangular numbers

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.399 
right we call them as triangular numbers
because<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.659> form<00:01:54.930> triangles

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
because as you see they form triangles

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.069 
because as you see they form triangles
right<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.790> again<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.390> said<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.780> add<00:01:58.049> up

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
right now again we said if you add up

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.530 
right now again we said if you add up
triangles<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.100> squares<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.119> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> add

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
triangles you get squares so if you add

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.819 
triangles you get squares so if you add
these<00:02:00.810> triangles<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.439> should<00:02:01.590> again<00:02:01.799> be

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
these triangles you should again be

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.190 
these triangles you should again be
getting<00:02:02.310> squares<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.969> let's<00:02:03.630> scribe<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
getting squares right let's scribe you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.340 
getting squares right let's scribe you
have<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:04.829> first<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.850> three<00:02:06.090> gives<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.079> 4

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
have one first one and three gives you 4

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.520 
have one first one and three gives you 4
3<00:02:07.920> &amp;<00:02:08.129> 6<00:02:08.369> gives<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.270> 9<00:02:09.539> square<00:02:10.170> again

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
3 &amp; 6 gives you 9 square again

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.040 
3 &amp; 6 gives you 9 square again
six<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.740> ten<00:02:13.010> gives<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.850> 16<00:02:14.060> square<00:02:14.720> again

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
six and ten gives you 16 square again

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.110 
six and ten gives you 16 square again
right<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.920> get<00:02:16.130> these<00:02:16.310> square<00:02:16.670> numbers

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
right so you get these square numbers

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.760 
right so you get these square numbers
these<00:02:17.510> are<00:02:17.630> nothing<00:02:17.750> but<00:02:17.900> square<00:02:18.290> numbers

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
these are nothing but square numbers

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.580 
these are nothing but square numbers
right<00:02:19.010> one<00:02:19.340> four<00:02:19.730> nine<00:02:19.760> sixteen<00:02:20.330> are<00:02:20.750> nothing

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
right one four nine sixteen are nothing

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.770 
right one four nine sixteen are nothing
but<00:02:21.800> square<00:02:22.160> numbers<00:02:22.580> right<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.570> see

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
but square numbers right you can see

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.900 
but square numbers right you can see
that<00:02:23.960> in<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.170> figure<00:02:24.410> also<00:02:24.980> what<00:02:25.460> we<00:02:25.610> did<00:02:25.640> you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
that in the figure also what we did you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.500 
that in the figure also what we did you
had<00:02:26.030> one<00:02:26.240> plus<00:02:26.540> three<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.230> one<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.770> three<00:02:28.510> give

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
had one plus three so one and three give

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.180 
had one plus three so one and three give
you<00:02:29.660> four<00:02:29.930> right<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.170> am<00:02:30.350> just<00:02:30.380> rotating<00:02:31.100> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
you four right I am just rotating the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.980 
you four right I am just rotating the
triangle<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.640> putting<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.060> top<00:02:32.180> three<00:02:32.780> and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
triangle and putting it on top three and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.910 
triangle and putting it on top three and
six<00:02:33.730> gives<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.940> nine<00:02:35.180> right<00:02:35.780> six<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.650> then

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
six gives you nine right six and then

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
six gives you nine right six and then
gives<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.790> 16<00:02:38.030> right<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.560> multiple<00:02:40.430> ways<00:02:40.700> in

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
gives you 16 right so multiple ways in

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.120 
gives you 16 right so multiple ways in
which<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.270> can<00:02:41.450> visualize<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:42.080> simple<00:02:42.680> concept

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
which you can visualize a simple concept

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.610 
which you can visualize a simple concept
of<00:02:43.310> triangles<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.390> squares<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:45.050> actually

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
of triangles and squares right actually

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.880 
of triangles and squares right actually
links<00:02:46.310> numbers<00:02:46.850> geometry<00:02:47.600> algebra

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
links numbers geometry algebra

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.320 
links numbers geometry algebra
everything<00:02:48.890> right<00:02:49.220> which<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.820> why<00:02:50.060> number

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
everything right which is why number

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.570 
everything right which is why number
patterns<00:02:50.870> are<00:02:51.050> so<00:02:51.320> fascinating<00:02:52.070> right<00:02:52.190> when

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
patterns are so fascinating right when

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.310 
patterns are so fascinating right when
you<00:02:52.700> start<00:02:52.940> visualizing<00:02:53.450> number<00:02:53.930> patterns

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
you start visualizing number patterns

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.010 
you start visualizing number patterns
they<00:02:55.160> become<00:02:55.460> extremely<00:02:56.030> fascinating<00:02:56.780> and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
they become extremely fascinating and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.930 
they become extremely fascinating and
this<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.860> nothing<00:02:58.190> new<00:02:58.400> for<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.730> you've

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
this is nothing new for you you've

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.850 
this is nothing new for you you've
already<00:02:59.270> been<00:02:59.750> learning<00:03:00.230> number<00:03:00.500> patterns

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
already been learning number patterns

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.220 
already been learning number patterns
for<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> very<00:03:01.370> long<00:03:01.700> time<00:03:01.970> now<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.360> fact<00:03:02.870> what<00:03:03.110> is

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
for a very long time now in fact what is

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.080 
for a very long time now in fact what is
the<00:03:03.350> very<00:03:03.710> first<00:03:04.100> thing<00:03:04.460> that<00:03:04.490> you<00:03:04.760> learn<00:03:04.790> in

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
the very first thing that you learn in

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.210 
the very first thing that you learn in
math<00:03:05.240> it's<00:03:05.540> nothing<00:03:05.840> but<00:03:05.960> a<00:03:06.020> number<00:03:06.200> part<00:03:06.560> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
math it's nothing but a number part the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.070 
math it's nothing but a number part the
first<00:03:07.520> thing<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.150> learn<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.540> math<00:03:08.720> is

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
first thing that you learn in math is

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.290 
first thing that you learn in math is
nothing<00:03:09.440> but<00:03:09.560> counting<00:03:10.100> right<00:03:10.460> one<00:03:11.030> two<00:03:11.270> three

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
nothing but counting right one two three

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.780 
nothing but counting right one two three
four<00:03:11.780> five<00:03:12.050> six<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:12.710> on<00:03:12.740> that<00:03:13.490> is<00:03:13.640> nothing

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
four five six and so on that is nothing

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.490 
four five six and so on that is nothing
but<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.120> number<00:03:14.420> pattern<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:14.960> we<00:03:15.080> also<00:03:15.230> have<00:03:15.470> a

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
but a number pattern and we also have a

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.260 
but a number pattern and we also have a
name<00:03:15.740> for<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:16.040> that's<00:03:16.280> natural<00:03:16.760> numbers<00:03:17.120> and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
name for it that's natural numbers and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.710 
name for it that's natural numbers and
we<00:03:17.720> represent<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.410> with<00:03:18.560> n<00:03:19.209> right<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.630> there

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
we represent it with n right so there

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.000 
we represent it with n right so there
are<00:03:20.840> some<00:03:20.990> number<00:03:21.350> patterns<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:21.920> you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
are some number patterns that you

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.220 
are some number patterns that you
already<00:03:22.280> know<00:03:22.730> right<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.390> very<00:03:23.600> basic<00:03:24.050> one

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
already know right the very basic one

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.990 
already know right the very basic one
the<00:03:24.410> first<00:03:24.770> thing<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.430> learn<00:03:25.459> in<00:03:25.820> math

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
the first thing that you learn in math

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.080 
the first thing that you learn in math
what<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.690> counting<00:03:27.440> one<00:03:28.250> two<00:03:28.430> three<00:03:28.820> four

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
what is it counting one two three four

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.390 
what is it counting one two three four
five<00:03:29.390> six<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.140> on<00:03:30.260> right<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:31.160> is

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
five six and so on right this is

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.370 
five six and so on right this is
actually<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.820> number<00:03:32.180> pattern<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.780> also<00:03:32.990> has<00:03:33.350> a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
actually a number pattern it also has a

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.250 
actually a number pattern it also has a
name<00:03:33.680> called<00:03:34.220> natural<00:03:34.820> numbers<00:03:35.240> B<00:03:35.780> normally

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
name called natural numbers B normally

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.120 
name called natural numbers B normally
represented<00:03:36.950> by<00:03:37.190> n<00:03:37.630> right<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.410> line<00:03:39.800> one

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
represented by n right so on a line one

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.800 
represented by n right so on a line one
two<00:03:40.400> three<00:03:40.700> four<00:03:40.910> five<00:03:41.180> these<00:03:41.450> are<00:03:41.630> nothing

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
two three four five these are nothing

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.500 
two three four five these are nothing
but<00:03:41.990> natural<00:03:42.320> we<00:03:43.280> can<00:03:43.430> now<00:03:43.580> count<00:03:43.850> everything

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
but natural we can now count everything

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.960 
but natural we can now count everything
let<00:03:44.930> me<00:03:45.080> take<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.260> basket<00:03:45.500> there's<00:03:46.220> one<00:03:46.520> apple

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
let me take a basket there's one apple

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.280 
let me take a basket there's one apple
here<00:03:47.240> three<00:03:47.810> oranges<00:03:49.360> four<00:03:50.360> fruits<00:03:50.630> in<00:03:50.870> total

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
here three oranges four fruits in total

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.040 
here three oranges four fruits in total
right<00:03:51.830> now<00:03:52.400> what<00:03:52.760> if<00:03:52.970> we<00:03:53.120> want<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.390> represent

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
right now what if we want to represent

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.020 
right now what if we want to represent
what<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.530> left<00:03:54.770> in<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.130> basket<00:03:55.280> right<00:03:55.880> we

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
what is left in the basket right we

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.610 
what is left in the basket right we
could<00:03:56.150> represent<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.690> fruits<00:03:56.930> using<00:03:57.260> natural

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
could represent the fruits using natural

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.070 
could represent the fruits using natural
numbers<00:03:57.980> how<00:03:58.459> do<00:03:58.520> we<00:03:58.760> represent<00:03:59.300> what<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.720> left

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
numbers how do we represent what is left

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.940 
numbers how do we represent what is left
in<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.410> basket

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
in the basket

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.130 
in the basket
there<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.340> nothing<00:04:01.580> right<00:04:02.390> there<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:02.780> nothing

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
there is nothing right there is nothing

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.810 
there is nothing right there is nothing
how<00:04:03.470> do<00:04:03.530> we<00:04:03.709> show<00:04:03.920> nothing<00:04:04.130> with<00:04:04.430> natural

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
how do we show nothing with natural

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.030 
how do we show nothing with natural
numbers<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.480> can't<00:04:05.780> right<00:04:06.080> which<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.680> why<00:04:06.860> we

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
numbers you can't right which is why we

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.880 
numbers you can't right which is why we
now<00:04:07.190> bring<00:04:07.400> in<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.760> zero<00:04:08.120> right<00:04:08.720> if<00:04:08.989> we<00:04:09.410> include

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
now bring in a zero right if we include

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.340 
now bring in a zero right if we include
zero<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:10.970> set<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.360> natural<00:04:11.570> numbers<00:04:12.140> that

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
zero to the set of natural numbers that

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.220 
zero to the set of natural numbers that
we<00:04:12.500> already<00:04:12.709> had<00:04:13.250> we<00:04:13.820> now<00:04:14.060> get<00:04:14.360> whole<00:04:14.750> numbers

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
we already had we now get whole numbers

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.760 
we already had we now get whole numbers
these<00:04:15.739> 0<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:17.080> infinity<00:04:18.080> are<00:04:18.230> nothing<00:04:18.650> but

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
these 0 to infinity are nothing but

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.789 
these 0 to infinity are nothing but
whole<00:04:19.070> numbers<00:04:19.489> represented<00:04:20.419> by<00:04:20.600> W<00:04:21.200> right

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
whole numbers represented by W right

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.650 
whole numbers represented by W right
again<00:04:22.490> there<00:04:22.700> are<00:04:22.820> infinite<00:04:23.570> such<00:04:23.840> numbers

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
again there are infinite such numbers

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.380 
again there are infinite such numbers
let's<00:04:25.140> now<00:04:25.380> see<00:04:25.710> what<00:04:26.190> numbers<00:04:26.640> we<00:04:26.820> get<00:04:27.030> by

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
let's now see what numbers we get by

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.870 
let's now see what numbers we get by
adding<00:04:27.960> two<00:04:28.230> whole<00:04:28.440> numbers<00:04:28.890> right<00:04:29.100> see<00:04:29.730> we

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
adding two whole numbers right see we

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.540 
adding two whole numbers right see we
add<00:04:30.060> two<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.570> five<00:04:30.870> we<00:04:31.380> get<00:04:31.500> seven<00:04:31.950> which<00:04:32.400> is

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
add two and five we get seven which is

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.940 
add two and five we get seven which is
also<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.940> whole<00:04:33.240> number

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
also a whole number

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.190 
also a whole number
try<00:04:34.950> three<00:04:35.220> plus<00:04:35.460> eight<00:04:35.670> that<00:04:36.480> gives<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:36.930> 11

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
try three plus eight that gives you 11

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.040 
try three plus eight that gives you 11
which<00:04:37.950> is<00:04:38.100> again<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.490> whole<00:04:38.760> number<00:04:39.120> right<00:04:39.660> so

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
which is again a whole number right so

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.930 
which is again a whole number right so
adding<00:04:40.530> whole<00:04:40.680> numbers<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:41.280> still<00:04:41.520> giving<00:04:41.820> up

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
adding whole numbers is still giving up

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.760 
adding whole numbers is still giving up
giving<00:04:42.510> us<00:04:42.690> whole<00:04:42.900> numbers<00:04:43.230> right<00:04:43.410> so<00:04:43.560> we<00:04:43.650> can

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
giving us whole numbers right so we can

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.400 
giving us whole numbers right so we can
still<00:04:44.010> work<00:04:44.190> with<00:04:44.400> now<00:04:45.300> what<00:04:45.720> happens<00:04:46.140> if<00:04:46.380> we

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
still work with now what happens if we

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.980 
still work with now what happens if we
subtract<00:04:47.220> these<00:04:47.460> two<00:04:47.700> numbers<00:04:48.060> instead<00:04:48.360> right

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
subtract these two numbers instead right

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.260 
subtract these two numbers instead right
we<00:04:49.320> do<00:04:49.470> three<00:04:49.800> minus<00:04:50.370> eight<00:04:50.520> what<00:04:51.030> does<00:04:51.240> that

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
we do three minus eight what does that

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.590 
we do three minus eight what does that
give<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.840> minus<00:04:52.680> five<00:04:52.980> now<00:04:53.580> minus<00:04:54.060> five<00:04:54.360> is

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
give you minus five now minus five is

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600 
give you minus five now minus five is
not<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.050> part<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.710> our<00:04:55.920> set<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.400> whole<00:04:56.580> numbers

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
not a part of our set of whole numbers

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.690 
not a part of our set of whole numbers
right<00:04:57.480> is<00:04:57.720> not<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.140> part<00:04:58.440> of<00:04:58.560> our<00:04:58.710> set<00:04:58.980> so<00:04:59.460> what

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
right is not a part of our set so what

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.970 
right is not a part of our set so what
do<00:04:59.850> we<00:04:59.910> do<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.600> be<00:05:00.750> able<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:01.020> represent<00:05:01.320> minus

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
do we do to be able to represent minus

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.390 
do we do to be able to represent minus
five

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
five

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.610 
five
we<00:05:02.640> add<00:05:02.850> another<00:05:03.180> set<00:05:03.810> of<00:05:03.960> numbers<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.590> the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
we add another set of numbers to the

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.940 
we add another set of numbers to the
left<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:05.550> zero<00:05:05.880> these<00:05:06.570> are<00:05:06.840> nothing<00:05:07.770> but

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
left of zero these are nothing but

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.130 
left of zero these are nothing but
negatives<00:05:08.640> of<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.090> natural<00:05:09.510> numbers<00:05:09.900> right

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
negatives of the natural numbers right

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.990 
negatives of the natural numbers right
so<00:05:10.560> we<00:05:10.680> add<00:05:10.860> negatives<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.670> natural

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
so we add negatives of the natural

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.970 
so we add negatives of the natural
numbers<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.540> other<00:05:12.690> side<00:05:12.990> this<00:05:13.710> entire

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
numbers to the other side this entire

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.550 
numbers to the other side this entire
set<00:05:14.670> of<00:05:14.700> numbers<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.390> we<00:05:15.450> now<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:16.080> is

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
set of numbers that we now have is

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.610 
set of numbers that we now have is
called<00:05:16.920> as<00:05:17.130> in<00:05:18.090> teachers<00:05:18.630> right<00:05:18.900> represented

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
called as in teachers right represented

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.050 
called as in teachers right represented
by<00:05:19.770> I<00:05:19.950> again<00:05:20.850> an<00:05:21.030> infinite<00:05:21.900> set<00:05:22.140> right<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.370> okay

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
by I again an infinite set right so okay

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.600 
by I again an infinite set right so okay
we<00:05:24.750> now<00:05:25.080> have<00:05:25.410> all<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.830> numbers<00:05:25.950> possible

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
we now have all the numbers possible

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.730 
we now have all the numbers possible
seems<00:05:26.910> like<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.150> lot<00:05:27.450> right<00:05:27.630> but<00:05:28.290> not<00:05:28.440> really

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
seems like a lot right but not really

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.310 
seems like a lot right but not really
let's<00:05:29.580> zoom<00:05:29.940> in<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.300> section<00:05:30.810> of<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.050> number

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
let's zoom in to a section of the number

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.620 
let's zoom in to a section of the number
line<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.530> see<00:05:31.800> let's<00:05:32.100> say<00:05:32.250> we<00:05:32.370> zoom<00:05:32.580> in<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.910> zero

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
line to see let's say we zoom in to zero

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.080 
line to see let's say we zoom in to zero
to<00:05:33.720> one<00:05:34.020> can<00:05:34.800> we<00:05:34.950> have<00:05:35.190> more<00:05:35.430> numbers<00:05:35.850> here

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
to one can we have more numbers here

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.130 
to one can we have more numbers here
this<00:05:36.780> is<00:05:36.990> one<00:05:37.230> unit<00:05:37.500> right<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:38.040> is<00:05:38.190> one<00:05:38.400> unit

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
this is one unit right this is one unit

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.960 
this is one unit right this is one unit
can<00:05:40.140> we<00:05:40.290> divide<00:05:40.650> it<00:05:40.830> into<00:05:41.010> smaller<00:05:41.400> units<00:05:41.850> as

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
can we divide it into smaller units as

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.640 
can we divide it into smaller units as
the<00:05:42.060> question<00:05:42.420> if<00:05:42.600> we<00:05:42.840> can<00:05:43.110> then<00:05:43.380> we<00:05:43.500> would

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
the question if we can then we would

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.220 
the question if we can then we would
have<00:05:43.830> numbers<00:05:44.250> in<00:05:44.430> between<00:05:44.670> right<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:45.930> instead

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
have numbers in between right so instead

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.200 
have numbers in between right so instead
of<00:05:46.470> a<00:05:46.590> section<00:05:46.950> let's<00:05:47.280> imagine<00:05:47.670> it<00:05:47.970> to<00:05:48.120> be

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
of a section let's imagine it to be

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.150 
of a section let's imagine it to be
something<00:05:48.570> like<00:05:48.660> a<00:05:48.720> pizza<00:05:49.170> right<00:05:49.710> let's

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
something like a pizza right let's

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.070 
something like a pizza right let's
imagine<00:05:50.520> this<00:05:50.880> to<00:05:51.090> be<00:05:51.120> a<00:05:51.240> pizza<00:05:51.690> let's<00:05:51.930> move

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
imagine this to be a pizza let's move

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.110 
imagine this to be a pizza let's move
the<00:05:52.260> line<00:05:52.410> down<00:05:52.620> let's<00:05:52.830> have<00:05:53.010> a<00:05:53.040> pizza<00:05:53.310> instead

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
the line down let's have a pizza instead

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.140 
the line down let's have a pizza instead
of<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.900> number<00:05:55.230> right<00:05:55.410> now<00:05:55.920> can<00:05:56.640> we<00:05:56.790> divide

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
of the number right now can we divide

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.820 
of the number right now can we divide
this<00:05:57.420> essentially<00:05:57.870> we<00:05:58.080> want<00:05:58.200> to<00:05:58.380> divide<00:05:58.650> this

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
this essentially we want to divide this

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.500 
this essentially we want to divide this
unit<00:05:59.130> right<00:05:59.250> this<00:05:59.430> is<00:05:59.520> one<00:05:59.730> unit<00:05:59.940> we<00:06:00.390> can

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
unit right this is one unit we can

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.720 
unit right this is one unit we can
divide<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:00.960> into<00:06:01.170> two<00:06:01.440> halves<00:06:01.680> like<00:06:01.830> this<00:06:02.130> so

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
divide it into two halves like this so

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.760 
divide it into two halves like this so
between<00:06:03.120> 0<00:06:03.480> and<00:06:03.630> 1<00:06:03.810> there<00:06:03.990> is<00:06:04.110> one<00:06:04.320> point<00:06:04.530> which

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
between 0 and 1 there is one point which

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.580 
between 0 and 1 there is one point which
is<00:06:04.920> the<00:06:05.040> heart<00:06:05.250> correct<00:06:06.030> now<00:06:06.690> if<00:06:06.960> we<00:06:07.140> take<00:06:07.320> this

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
is the heart correct now if we take this

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.310 
is the heart correct now if we take this
half<00:06:07.890> you<00:06:08.520> can<00:06:08.700> further<00:06:09.030> divide<00:06:09.600> it<00:06:09.810> into<00:06:10.020> two

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
half you can further divide it into two

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.350 
half you can further divide it into two
quarters<00:06:10.800> you<00:06:11.280> can<00:06:11.310> further<00:06:11.640> divide<00:06:12.030> it<00:06:12.210> into

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
quarters you can further divide it into

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.150 
quarters you can further divide it into
two<00:06:12.630> quarters<00:06:13.020> what<00:06:13.410> does<00:06:13.590> that<00:06:13.620> tell<00:06:14.010> you

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
two quarters what does that tell you

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.820 
two quarters what does that tell you
between<00:06:15.060> this<00:06:15.390> half<00:06:15.660> there<00:06:16.140> is<00:06:16.260> a<00:06:16.290> point<00:06:16.620> which

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
between this half there is a point which

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.090 
between this half there is a point which
is<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.070> quarter<00:06:17.490> right<00:06:18.470> similarly<00:06:19.470> this

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
is the quarter right similarly this

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.010 
is the quarter right similarly this
quarter<00:06:20.610> you<00:06:20.760> can<00:06:20.790> further<00:06:21.120> have<00:06:21.420> a<00:06:21.450> point<00:06:21.750> one

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
quarter you can further have a point one

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.860 
quarter you can further have a point one
eight<00:06:22.050> this<00:06:22.740> 1/8<00:06:23.250> you<00:06:23.400> can<00:06:23.550> have<00:06:23.730> a<00:06:23.760> point<00:06:24.090> 1/16

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
eight this 1/8 you can have a point 1/16

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.500 
eight this 1/8 you can have a point 1/16
and<00:06:25.050> so<00:06:25.380> on<00:06:25.530> right<00:06:25.740> we<00:06:26.190> can<00:06:26.340> keep<00:06:26.610> going<00:06:26.670> we<00:06:27.360> can

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
and so on right we can keep going we can

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.180 
and so on right we can keep going we can
keep<00:06:27.780> slicing<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:28.380> into<00:06:28.590> smaller<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.100> smaller

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
keep slicing it into smaller and smaller

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.760 
keep slicing it into smaller and smaller
pieces<00:06:29.520> and<00:06:30.030> we<00:06:30.600> can<00:06:30.750> keep<00:06:31.050> dividing<00:06:31.440> our

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
pieces and we can keep dividing our

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.219 
pieces and we can keep dividing our
number<00:06:32.100> line<00:06:32.310> right<00:06:32.490> so<00:06:33.210> what<00:06:33.510> does<00:06:33.690> that<00:06:33.720> tell

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
number line right so what does that tell

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.430 
number line right so what does that tell
us<00:06:34.440> that<00:06:34.729> integers<00:06:35.729> are<00:06:35.940> not<00:06:36.419> enough<00:06:36.870> to

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
us that integers are not enough to

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.570 
us that integers are not enough to
represent<00:06:37.650> all

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
represent all

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.119 
represent all
simple<00:06:38.759> numbers<00:06:39.120> there<00:06:39.360> are<00:06:39.509> in<00:06:39.960> fact<00:06:40.409> between

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
simple numbers there are in fact between

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.879 
simple numbers there are in fact between
every<00:06:41.849> two<00:06:42.060> integers<00:06:42.720> there<00:06:43.229> are<00:06:43.349> another

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
every two integers there are another

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.980 
every two integers there are another
infinite<00:06:44.520> set<00:06:44.729> of<00:06:44.759> numbers<00:06:44.909> right<00:06:45.449> we<00:06:45.629> were

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
infinite set of numbers right we were

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.629 
infinite set of numbers right we were
able<00:06:46.169> to<00:06:46.319> divide<00:06:46.650> it<00:06:46.830> infinitely<00:06:47.250> right<00:06:47.490> we

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
able to divide it infinitely right we

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.640 
able to divide it infinitely right we
can<00:06:47.759> keep<00:06:47.939> going<00:06:48.270> on<00:06:48.419> and<00:06:48.629> on<00:06:48.719> right<00:06:48.960> so

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
can keep going on and on right so

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.850 
can keep going on and on right so
between<00:06:49.889> any<00:06:50.189> two<00:06:50.699> integers<00:06:51.360> there<00:06:52.319> are<00:06:52.469> again

the<00:07:00.150> definition<00:07:00.810> for<00:07:00.990> this<00:07:01.139> is<00:07:01.409> nothing<00:07:02.069> but

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099 
the definition for this is nothing but

the definition for this is nothing but

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
by Q right P by Q where P and Q are

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.749 
by Q right P by Q where P and Q are
integers<00:07:09.020> Q<00:07:10.020> is<00:07:10.169> not<00:07:10.379> one<00:07:10.710> and<00:07:10.919> P<00:07:11.190> and<00:07:11.310> Q<00:07:11.520> don't

integers Q is not one and P and Q don't

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.360 
integers Q is not one and P and Q don't
have<00:07:11.909> any<00:07:12.060> common<00:07:12.659> patterns<00:07:13.110> right<00:07:13.319> so<00:07:13.949> that

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
have any common patterns right so that

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.909 
have any common patterns right so that
is<00:07:14.669> essentially<00:07:15.330> what<00:07:15.509> a<00:07:15.930> rational<00:07:16.469> number<00:07:16.500> is

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
is essentially what a rational number is

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.820 
is essentially what a rational number is
and<00:07:17.129> actually<00:07:17.669> even<00:07:18.599> all<00:07:18.840> the<00:07:18.990> integers<00:07:19.620> are

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
and actually even all the integers are

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.969 
and actually even all the integers are
rational<00:07:20.190> numbers<00:07:20.250> why<00:07:21.229> because<00:07:22.229> Q<00:07:22.440> can<00:07:22.620> be<00:07:22.650> 1

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
rational numbers why because Q can be 1

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.730 
rational numbers why because Q can be 1
right<00:07:23.250> if<00:07:23.460> you<00:07:23.969> put<00:07:24.240> Q<00:07:24.509> equal<00:07:24.840> to<00:07:24.870> 1<00:07:25.020> they<00:07:25.590> all

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
right if you put Q equal to 1 they all

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.339 
right if you put Q equal to 1 they all
become<00:07:26.039> integers<00:07:26.610> so<00:07:26.789> integers<00:07:27.389> are<00:07:27.629> rational

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:28.349 
become integers so integers are rational

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:30.650 
become integers so integers are rational
number
