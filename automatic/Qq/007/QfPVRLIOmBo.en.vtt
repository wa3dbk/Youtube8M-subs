would<00:02:53.520> be<00:02:53.550> chain<00:02:53.850> link<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.840> then<00:02:55.500> coil<00:02:56.220> ah

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
would be chain link one and then coil ah

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.810 
would be chain link one and then coil ah
so<00:02:56.790> will<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.209> chanock<00:02:58.080> too<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.400> yeah<00:02:59.580> that's<00:02:59.700> a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
so will be chanock too so yeah that's a

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.729 
so will be chanock too so yeah that's a
good<00:02:59.970> thing<00:03:00.150> because<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.720> at<00:03:01.290> your<00:03:01.440> opponent
