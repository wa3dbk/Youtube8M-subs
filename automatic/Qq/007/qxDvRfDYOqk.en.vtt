00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.639 
so hyped for that but I'm kind of

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
relieved that gray isn't just another

character<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> went<00:01:46.020> evil<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.560> have

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
character that went evil and they have

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
character that went evil and they have
to<00:01:46.829> fight<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.280> some<00:01:47.520> point<00:01:47.759> down<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> line

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
to fight at some point down the line
although<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.960> still<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.500> they<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:49.799> because

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
although I still think they will because

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.160 
although I still think they will because
of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.610> whole<00:01:50.759> end<00:01:51.119> thing<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.630> don't<00:01:51.840> think

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
of the whole end thing I don't think

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.170 
of the whole end thing I don't think
that<00:01:52.740> gray<00:01:53.130> saying<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.759> he<00:01:53.909> wants<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that gray saying that he wants to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
that gray saying that he wants to
destroy<00:01:54.570> end<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:55.229> an<00:01:55.350> act<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.860> mean<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> was

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
destroy end was an act I mean it was

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 
destroy end was an act I mean it was
obvious<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.759> everything<00:01:57.270> else<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.750> ACTU

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
obvious that everything else was ACTU

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.319 
obvious that everything else was ACTU
but<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.549> believe<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.820> he<00:02:00.030> wants<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
but I really do believe that he wants to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.940 
but I really do believe that he wants to
destroy<00:02:00.750> him<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.290> he<00:02:01.469> said<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.920> before

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
destroy him because he said that before

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.679 
destroy him because he said that before
the<00:02:02.310> time<00:02:02.520> skip<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.210> promise<00:02:03.570> he<00:02:03.659> made

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the time skip and that promise he made

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.420 
the time skip and that promise he made
to<00:02:03.840> his<00:02:04.020> father<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.439> whatnot<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.189> I'm<00:02:05.280> pretty

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to his father and whatnot so I'm pretty

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.819 
to his father and whatnot so I'm pretty
sure<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.320> vs.<00:02:07.619> grey

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
sure we will get a not to vs. grey

she is but knowing this manga we'll just

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.880 
she is but knowing this manga we'll just

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
see not to do like a humongous flame

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.830 
see not to do like a humongous flame
breath<00:03:28.190> then<00:03:28.489> that'll<00:03:28.790> be<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.630> mean

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
breath then that'll be it but I mean

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.930 
breath then that'll be it but I mean
they're<00:03:30.109> up<00:03:30.260> against<00:03:30.650> some<00:03:30.890> powerful<00:03:31.220> avatars

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
they're up against some powerful avatars

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.270 
they're up against some powerful avatars
or<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.630> seems<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.590> power<00:03:33.859> level<00:03:34.220> of

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
or so it seems the the power level of

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.699 
or so it seems the the power level of
the<00:03:34.370> avatars<00:03:34.819> really<00:03:35.239> ever<00:03:35.359> been<00:03:35.660> hasn't<00:03:36.560> been

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
the avatars really ever been hasn't been

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.110 
the avatars really ever been hasn't been
shown<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:37.489> we<00:03:37.579> don't<00:03:37.790> know<00:03:37.880> if<00:03:37.970> they're

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.370 
to take him down so I guess now that
he's<00:04:51.740> revealed<00:04:52.130> that<00:04:52.460> he's<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.419> good<00:04:53.750> guy<00:04:53.990> still

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
he's revealed that he's a good guy still

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.990 
he's revealed that he's a good guy still
and<00:04:54.650> then<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:54.980> will<00:04:55.100> intensify<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.700> drama

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
and then that will intensify the drama

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.280 
and then that will intensify the drama
because<00:04:56.210> good<00:04:56.540> Jill<00:04:56.720> will<00:04:56.840> be<00:04:56.930> like<00:04:57.110> I'm

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
because good Jill will be like I'm

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.409 
because good Jill will be like I'm
taking<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:57.740> in<00:04:57.919> grey<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.430> then<00:04:58.700> Lucy<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.330> I

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
taking you in grey and then Lucy and I

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:00.850 
taking you in grey and then Lucy and I
should<00:04:59.630> be<00:04:59.720> like<00:04:59.840> no<00:05:00.020> he's<00:05:00.200> on<00:05:00.229> our<00:05:00.410> side<00:05:00.650> i

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
should be like no he's on our side i

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.230 
should be like no he's on our side i
thinka<00:05:01.160> Jill<00:05:01.400> could<00:05:01.580> say<00:05:01.729> I<00:05:01.760> don't<00:05:02.090> give<00:05:02.210> a

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
thinka Jill could say I don't give a

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.659 
thinka Jill could say I don't give a
damn<00:05:02.510> but<00:05:02.750> then<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.470> could<00:05:03.650> spark<00:05:04.010> like<00:05:04.400> you

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
damn but then that could spark like you

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.730 
damn but then that could spark like you
