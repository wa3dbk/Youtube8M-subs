00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.500

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.039
 will be easy to roll and climb 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.729

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.829
 seconds really 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.860
 most models of Polish wheelchairs 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.410
 have new convenient features and also have 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.520
 ability to change take off 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.760
 different parts of the stroller 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.170
 young mothers need not only 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.260
 functionality but also the convenience of the stroller 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.110
 therefore, in this model there is 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.270
 Easy to remove from the box with one button 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.550
 despite the clever functionality itself 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.710
 yourself a stroller silent nothing anywhere 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.230
 knocks and does not rattle so baby can 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.090
 sleep well while mom leads him

 By the way, you can swing in different directions 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.890
 only strollers with suspension on belts 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.440
 the rest of the strollers are only longitudinal 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.540
 swing lateral swing on such 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.260
 prohibited it may break 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.540
 frames 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.920
 it is generally worth noting that the Poles are paying 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.080
 great attention to various 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.090
 modernized technology this 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.790
 significantly reduces the possibility of marriage 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.560
 and the product turns out really 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.750
 quality such a stroller is quite 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.690

 and she's really easy to manage 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.780
 I read that when creating data 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.760
 models first 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.280
 ability to manage it was taken into account 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.130
 with one hand if the whole 2 is occupied 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.590
 trick here in swivel wheels they're like 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.090
 times and provide maneuverability 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.190
 the most popular are kits 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.590

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.050
 for a newborn baby and also three in 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.540
 one set with car seat each 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.100
