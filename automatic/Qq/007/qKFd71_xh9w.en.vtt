music<00:01:14.090> which<00:01:14.390> sounds<00:01:14.780> very<00:01:14.840> similar<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.649> very

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
music which sounds very similar and very

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:22.470 
music which sounds very similar and very
much<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.460> same

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.450 

so<00:01:23.480> I<00:01:23.570> like<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:24.020> always<00:01:24.410> tried<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.890> do<00:01:25.220> is<00:01:25.280> to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
so I like I always tried to do is to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.570 
so I like I always tried to do is to
find<00:01:25.730> a<00:01:25.880> way<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.090> create<00:01:26.840> new<00:01:27.200> sound<00:01:27.560> which<00:01:28.550> is

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
find a way to create new sound which is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.790

both<00:01:29.480> fresh<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:31.150> organic<00:01:32.350> has<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.380> certain

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
both fresh and organic has a certain

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.400 
both fresh and organic has a certain
emotional<00:01:34.760> content<00:01:35.270> not<00:01:35.660> just<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:36.110> shape

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
emotional content not just a shape

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.620 
emotional content not just a shape
because<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.340> lot<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.550> people<00:01:37.640> doing<00:01:38.120> out<00:01:38.270> what
