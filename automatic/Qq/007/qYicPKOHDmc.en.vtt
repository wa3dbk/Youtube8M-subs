00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.629
 the repetition 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:15.530
 disappeared but it was my favorite ball 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:18.740
 go today not I get myself comfortable 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.890
 I'm sorry, we were just trying to recover 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.860
 our special items to the best 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:31.009
 we should open them and maybe in 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:33.050
 there is some more note then if 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.450
 we discover to whom the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.500
 feathers we will discover who has taken 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.500
 our things 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.079
 it's me who sounds like it sounds like 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.079
 my alarm clock 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.489
 I'm better now 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.760
 I'll see and I found it lost in the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760
 path 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.900
 my ball 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.180
 because you've taken all those things 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.860
 that were not yours 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.440
 with your special things 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.440
 I also wanted to have something special 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.540
 I experienced a change but you can not do that 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.540
 without permission of no 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 yes 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.270
 I have put 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.280
 min 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 we all miss our objects 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 special 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.899
 that's why they are special but I can 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.750
 enjoy hand tokio the keys and I 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.700
 I can lend you my alarm clock and what 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.580
 better my ball but next time 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.580
 ask me what is it worth 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 do not 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 two 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.660
 of prepared rocket boosters 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.370
 Y 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.310
 and the result will be quite close 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.310
 but the herd now 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.650
 and thanks for the race to wii it has been 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.820
 the best and in a long time nothing but 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.820

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.220
