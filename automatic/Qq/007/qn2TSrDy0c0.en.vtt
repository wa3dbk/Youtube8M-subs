tips for animation and today we're

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.460 
tips for animation and today we're
talking<00:00:17.850> about<00:00:18.119> my<00:00:18.390> favorite<00:00:18.840> part<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.290> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
talking about my favorite part of the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.170 
talking about my favorite part of the
pre-production<00:00:19.890> process<00:00:20.369> which<00:00:20.939> is

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
pre-production process which is

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.550 
pre-production process which is
storyboarding

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.440 

the<00:00:27.010> storyboard<00:00:27.580> is<00:00:27.670> like<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:27.940> miniature

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
the storyboard is like a miniature

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.750 
the storyboard is like a miniature
version<00:00:28.600> of<00:00:29.080> your<00:00:29.290> film<00:00:29.800> it's<00:00:30.010> use<00:00:30.610> the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
version of your film it's use the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.700 
version of your film it's use the
sequential<00:00:31.210> images<00:00:31.540> similar<00:00:32.110> to<00:00:32.349> that<00:00:32.470> of<00:00:32.529> a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
sequential images similar to that of a

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.280 
sequential images similar to that of a
comic<00:00:33.040> book<00:00:33.070> so<00:00:33.640> in<00:00:34.420> your<00:00:34.600> storyboard<00:00:34.930> you'll

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
comic book so in your storyboard you'll

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.000 
comic book so in your storyboard you'll
be<00:00:35.440> working<00:00:35.830> out<00:00:36.010> your<00:00:36.250> staging<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:38.010> settings

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
be working out your staging the settings

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.160 
be working out your staging the settings
your<00:00:39.160> characters<00:00:39.640> are<00:00:39.670> in<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.540> actions<00:00:41.080> or

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
your characters are in the actions or

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.460 
your characters are in the actions or
characters<00:00:41.620> we'll<00:00:41.770> be<00:00:41.890> doing<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:43.660> lot<00:00:44.440> of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
characters we'll be doing and a lot of

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.530 
characters we'll be doing and a lot of
your<00:00:44.710> directing<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:45.640> editing<00:00:45.760> will<00:00:46.270> be<00:00:46.360> done

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
your directing and editing will be done

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.760 
your directing and editing will be done
at<00:00:46.690> this<00:00:46.809> stage<00:00:46.870> of<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.320> process

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.890 

it's<00:00:51.070> best<00:00:51.310> to<00:00:51.400> draw<00:00:51.670> your<00:00:51.880> storyboards<00:00:52.720> on

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
it's best to draw your storyboards on

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.800 
it's best to draw your storyboards on
separate<00:00:53.530> panels<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.490> can<00:00:54.760> pin<00:00:55.660> them

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
separate panels so that you can pin them

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.200 
separate panels so that you can pin them
up<00:00:55.930> on<00:00:56.080> a<00:00:56.110> board<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.680> move<00:00:57.490> them<00:00:57.670> around<00:00:57.820> as

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
up on a board and move them around as

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.330 
up on a board and move them around as
you<00:00:58.330> wish<00:00:58.540> as<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:59.500> story<00:00:59.770> evolves<00:01:00.040> and

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
you wish as the story evolves and

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.450 
you wish as the story evolves and
changes<00:01:00.690> also<00:01:01.690> it's<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.230> good<00:01:02.350> idea<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:03.040> draw

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
changes also it's a good idea to draw

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.330 
changes also it's a good idea to draw
your<00:01:04.440> individual<00:01:05.940> panels<00:01:06.940> on<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.830> aspect

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
your individual panels on the aspect

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.680 
your individual panels on the aspect
ratio<00:01:09.430> size<00:01:09.970> you'll<00:01:10.240> be<00:01:10.390> using<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:10.840> your<00:01:10.870> film

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
ratio size you'll be using in your film

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.460 
ratio size you'll be using in your film
here<00:01:13.690> we<00:01:13.810> can<00:01:13.990> see<00:01:14.170> both<00:01:14.380> aspect<00:01:14.950> ratios

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.900 

underneath<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.740> panels<00:01:19.130> we<00:01:19.460> place<00:01:19.700> our

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
underneath the panels we place our

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.300 
underneath the panels we place our
dialogue<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:21.260> can<00:01:21.290> also<00:01:21.590> include<00:01:21.950> sound

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
dialogue you can also include sound

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.370 
dialogue you can also include sound
effects<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.910> sometimes<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.930> may<00:01:24.080> want<00:01:24.320> to

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
effects and sometimes you may want to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.740 
effects and sometimes you may want to
put<00:01:24.650> in<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:25.040> description<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:26.270> action<00:01:26.630> in

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
put in a description of the action in

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.350 
put in a description of the action in
the<00:01:26.840> shot

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.310 

when<00:01:33.360> you're<00:01:33.510> working<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.080> team<00:01:34.290> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
when you're working with the team of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140 
when you're working with the team of
animators<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.190> important<00:01:35.730> that<00:01:35.910> your

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
animators it's important that your

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.000 
animators it's important that your
storyboards<00:01:36.840> are<00:01:36.990> clear<00:01:37.260> and<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.800> draw

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
storyboards are clear and that they draw

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.520 
storyboards are clear and that they draw
well<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.970> everyone<00:01:39.510> can<00:01:39.750> clearly<00:01:40.080> define<00:01:40.320> what

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
well so everyone can clearly define what

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.730 
well so everyone can clearly define what
the<00:01:40.800> shots<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.250> about<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.930> thing<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.350> good

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the shots are about the thing is good

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
the shots are about the thing is good
rendering<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.520> take<00:01:44.760> time<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.330> for<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> lone

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
rendering can take time and for a lone

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.710 
rendering can take time and for a lone
animator<00:01:46.680> or<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.980> very<00:01:47.370> small<00:01:47.670> team<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.690> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
animator or a very small team it is a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.180 
animator or a very small team it is a
better<00:01:48.960> idea<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.830> keep<00:01:50.040> your

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
better idea that you keep your

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.100 
better idea that you keep your
storyboards<00:01:50.790> rough<00:01:51.000> quickening<00:01:51.990> your

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
storyboards rough quickening your

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.430 
storyboards rough quickening your
production<00:01:52.590> flow

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
production flow

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.830 
production flow
here<00:01:55.370> is<00:01:55.520> another<00:01:55.760> one<00:01:55.940> of<00:01:56.000> my<00:01:56.180> storyboards

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
here is another one of my storyboards

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.560 
here is another one of my storyboards
but<00:01:57.170> as<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.500> can<00:01:57.680> see<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.310> very<00:01:58.370> rough<00:01:58.790> the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
but as you can see it is very rough the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.630 
but as you can see it is very rough the
important<00:02:00.110> thing<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:00.620> that<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.160> story<00:02:01.430> is

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
important thing is that the story is

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
important thing is that the story is
coming<00:02:01.880> across<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:03.110> staging<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.650> correct

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.259 

cutting<00:02:14.950> from<00:02:15.129> one<00:02:15.340> shot<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.640> another<00:02:15.790> can

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
cutting from one shot to another can

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.930 
cutting from one shot to another can
save<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.629> a<00:02:16.660> lot<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.959> time<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.349> animation<00:02:17.940> in

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
save you a lot of time in animation in

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.540 
save you a lot of time in animation in
this<00:02:19.239> scene<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:20.110> camera<00:02:20.530> cuts<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.040> shot<00:02:21.370> of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
this scene the camera cuts to a shot of

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.150 
this scene the camera cuts to a shot of
the<00:02:22.060> Master's<00:02:22.510> dog<00:02:22.810> while<00:02:23.319> he<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.620> talking

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
the Master's dog while he is talking

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.680 
the Master's dog while he is talking
this<00:02:24.970> saves<00:02:25.300> time<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.629> lip-syncing<00:02:27.690> another

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
this saves time on lip-syncing another

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.330 
this saves time on lip-syncing another
thing<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.260> do<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.590> save<00:02:29.799> time<00:02:30.129> while

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
thing you can do to save time while
