00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.590
 and rocked like l2 which is typical for 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.830
 such movement for increased volume 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.720
 and fast progress up professional 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.800
 if he is really interested in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.470
 purchases he will buy from the market all 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.980
 it means that in this phase yes 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.980
 take recall phase iii sos called 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.480
 sync of strange that is a sign of strength and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.930
 for now this is a sign of strength 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.809
 emphasizes but only a sign of strength 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.700
 here the most important thing is fast-growing 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.649
 price is big progress on the bars up and 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.660
 increasing volume 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:01.039
 let's paint in more detail 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 How does this Soss look like already in bars? 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.920
 signal sos looks like a movement from 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 level to level very often this sausage 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 happens in a ranger already formed that is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.200
 we will have some visual boundaries 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.000
 both top and bottom and the price will rise with 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.659
 big progress up is usually 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.439
 the letter r here if you look at the daytime 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 timeframe 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.119
 then the best such indicator is the bottom 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 cool 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.750
 SOS is one bar movement inside 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.900
 ranger if we notice you will pass it 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.670
 the fewer the bars the better that is the bar 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.490
 there should be this for daytime 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.759
 graphics naturally inside the day he 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.590
 decomposed into several 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:55.619
 progressive fast jerks up 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.320
 let's say that daytime 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.469
 there will be 3 bars and four and so on that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.270
 we need to see in this we need to see 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.979
 firstly increasing volume of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.009
 compared with at least two previous 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.129
 bars like this for example 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.459
 or see a ladder 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:18.970
 from rising bar anyway volume 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.340
 on the upward movement should be increased 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.780
 above average and 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.000
 this this sign is based on the fact that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.010
 professional when making their purchases 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.069
 he pours the volume of the market and the price here 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.590
 naturally read to rise and how would 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.470
 he did not sell he will be able to devour these 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.450
 selling everything on the market he takes 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.190
 redeem a very important point here is very 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.909
 hard for traders who have 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.829
 studies and weights and likes and not immediately 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.340
 head arise 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.829
 hang such a thing but how am I not 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.379
 guessed did not find out why I'm right here 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.659
 did not buy 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.170
 why wasn't my purchase here like me 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.810
 I did not think about it or something else 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.349
 Immediately I will say drive away such thoughts we 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.220
 we trade after a professional first he 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:21.069
 then we have this fact that the current movement 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.379
 up is a strong area is 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.019
 shopping 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.440
 nothing promises us what the reaction will be 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.040
 normal or vice versa the price will drop 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.260
 in that how we are washed up we already know 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.349
 a professional if the situation is him 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.840
 whether it is also convenient for them 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.590
 easy to sell on growing traffic 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.989
 the stronger the impulse the lighter it is 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.340
 sell understand therefore concern to 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.540
 this movement 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.669
 Well, I would say it is more prosaic if 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.849
 by some indirect signs not 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:05.819
 managed to take this zero point 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.819
 support it and do not worry
