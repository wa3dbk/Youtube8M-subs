this<00:01:29.360> game<00:01:29.450> as<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.840> say<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.710> there's<00:01:31.070> a

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
this game as I say is that there's a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.320 
this game as I say is that there's a
whole<00:01:31.369> bunch<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:31.640> different<00:01:31.760> kinds<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.180> levels

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
whole bunch of different kinds of levels

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.670 
whole bunch of different kinds of levels
this<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:32.600> one<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.930> larger<00:01:33.200> levels<00:01:33.560> which

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
this is one of the larger levels which

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.800 
this is one of the larger levels which
is<00:01:33.830> pretty<00:01:34.340> heavily<00:01:34.670> based<00:01:34.970> on<00:01:35.180> platforming

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
is pretty heavily based on platforming

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.450 
is pretty heavily based on platforming
it's<00:01:36.229> actually<00:01:36.500> more<00:01:36.619> fun<00:01:36.680> when<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.160> play<00:01:37.280> as

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
it's actually more fun when you play as

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.370 
it's actually more fun when you play as
co-op<00:01:37.729> but<00:01:38.060> every<00:01:38.330> level<00:01:38.509> is<00:01:38.660> also<00:01:39.080> playable

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
co-op but every level is also playable

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.540 
co-op but every level is also playable
single-player<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.070> that's<00:01:40.340> very

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
single-player and that's very

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.580

importantly you can play this on your

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.930 
importantly you can play this on your
own<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.070> play<00:01:43.220> with<00:01:43.340> friends<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:43.820> the

and<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.729> next<00:01:46.970> section<00:01:47.300> is<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.450> first

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
and this next section is the first

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.660 
and this next section is the first
introduction<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.380> danger<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:48.920> see<00:01:49.640> that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
introduction of danger so see that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.210 
introduction of danger so see that
little<00:01:50.000> smoking<00:01:50.390> thing<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.500> don't<00:01:51.770> touch<00:01:52.009> it

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
little smoking thing you don't touch it

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.760 
little smoking thing you don't touch it
and<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:53.210> really<00:01:53.660> adds<00:01:53.840> an<00:01:54.259> extra<00:01:54.560> dimension

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
and that really adds an extra dimension

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.920 
and that really adds an extra dimension
to<00:01:55.130> gameplay<00:01:55.520> also<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.450> see<00:01:56.630> these<00:01:56.750> little

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
to gameplay also you see these little

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.600 
to gameplay also you see these little
kind<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.200> microchips<00:01:57.890> which<00:01:58.100> are<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.460> wall

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
kind of microchips which are on the wall

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.090 
kind of microchips which are on the wall
that's<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.570> way<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.869> you<00:01:59.960> can<00:02:00.110> add<00:02:00.350> logic<00:02:00.710> into

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
that's a way that you can add logic into

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.190 
that's a way that you can add logic into
your<00:02:01.340> level<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.300> guy<00:02:02.660> who<00:02:02.720> built<00:02:03.080> this

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
your level so the guy who built this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.880 
your level so the guy who built this
level<00:02:03.560> has<00:02:04.100> wired<00:02:04.729> up<00:02:04.910> these<00:02:05.060> levers<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.619> by

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
level has wired up these levers and by

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.740 
level has wired up these levers and by
grabbing<00:02:07.490> them<00:02:07.759> he<00:02:08.179> can<00:02:08.330> build<00:02:08.420> whole

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
grabbing them he can build whole

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.969 
grabbing them he can build whole
machines<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.470> can<00:02:09.590> actually<00:02:09.709> build

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
machines and you can actually build

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.550 
machines and you can actually build
incredibly<00:02:10.640> intricate<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:11.630> complicated

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
incredibly intricate like complicated

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.880 
incredibly intricate like complicated
mechanisms<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:14.209> allow<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.690> build<00:02:15.019> new

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
mechanisms that allow you to build new

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.110 
mechanisms that allow you to build new
kinds<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.190> gameplay<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.640> doesn't<00:02:16.850> just<00:02:17.000> have

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
kinds of gameplay it doesn't just have

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.539 
kinds of gameplay it doesn't just have
to<00:02:17.239> be<00:02:17.330> what<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.810> thought<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.370> can<00:02:19.459> get

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
to be what we thought of but you can get

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.020 
to be what we thought of but you can get
squashed

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.190 

okay<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.090> again<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.690> bit<00:02:24.900> would<00:02:24.960> have<00:02:25.080> been

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
okay so again this bit would have been

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.740 
okay so again this bit would have been
way<00:02:25.410> quicker<00:02:25.740> co-op<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:27.180> sure<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.660> play

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
way quicker co-op so sure you can play

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.540 
way quicker co-op so sure you can play
this<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:27.990> your<00:02:28.080> own<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:29.250> you'd<00:02:29.400> had<00:02:29.520> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
this on your own but if you'd had a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.980 
this on your own but if you'd had a
friend<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.970> help<00:02:30.180> work<00:02:30.330> with<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.750> could

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
friend to help work with that you could

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.200 
friend to help work with that you could
have<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.230> plowed<00:02:31.650> through<00:02:31.890> every<00:02:32.790> level<00:02:32.940> has

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
one of my favorite bits in this level is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.310 
one of my favorite bits in this level is
the<00:02:44.060> elephant<00:02:44.510> which<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.900> next<00:02:45.170> section

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
the elephant which is this next section

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.090 
the elephant which is this next section
so<00:02:46.780> as<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.960> say<00:02:48.140> we<00:02:48.320> provide<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:48.740> with<00:02:49.010> the

so as I say we provide you with the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.160 
so as I say we provide you with the
inspiration<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:49.880> your<00:02:49.940> own<00:02:50.090> levels<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.690> one

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
inspiration for your own levels and one

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
inspiration for your own levels and one
of<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.350> things<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.710> get<00:02:51.920> for

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
of the things that you get for

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.090 
of the things that you get for
completing<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.700> level<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.750> if<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:54.650> the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
completing the level is if you like the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.280 
completing the level is if you like the
elements<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:55.670> made<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.060> level<00:02:56.360> up<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.050> in

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
elements that made that level up so in

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.350 
elements that made that level up so in
this<00:02:57.470> case<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:57.890> elephant<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.090> kind<00:02:59.300> of

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
this case this elephant is this kind of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.110 
this case this elephant is this kind of
like<00:02:59.480> moving<00:02:59.780> creature<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:01.400> he<00:03:01.670> manages<00:03:02.030> to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
like moving creature if he manages to

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.910 
like moving creature if he manages to
complete<00:03:02.300> this<00:03:02.570> in<00:03:02.720> time<00:03:02.959> he<00:03:03.380> will<00:03:03.500> then<00:03:03.650> win

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
complete this in time he will then win

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.800 
complete this in time he will then win
the<00:03:04.400> right<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.610> use<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.240> his<00:03:05.360> own<00:03:05.450> levels

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
the right to use that in his own levels

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.690 
the right to use that in his own levels
and<00:03:06.080> that's<00:03:06.230> kind<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.590> cycle<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.520> call

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
and that's kind of a cycle that we call

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.520 
and that's kind of a cycle that we call
play<00:03:07.910> create<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.420> share<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:08.900> it's<00:03:09.020> like<00:03:09.140> you

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
play create and share so it's like you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.600 
play create and share so it's like you
play<00:03:09.709> through<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> level<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.280> have<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> good

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
play through the level you have a good

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.910 
play through the level you have a good
time<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.120> as<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:11.870> like<00:03:12.110> almost<00:03:12.350> as<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.620> side

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
time and as it's like almost as a side

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.430 
time and as it's like almost as a side
effect<00:03:12.950> we<00:03:13.790> kind<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.120> feed<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.540> it's<00:03:15.230> like

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
effect we kind of feed you it's like

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.840 
effect we kind of feed you it's like
cool<00:03:15.739> stuff<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.280> then<00:03:16.400> you're<00:03:16.489> just<00:03:16.580> kind<00:03:16.700> of

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
cool stuff and then you're just kind of
