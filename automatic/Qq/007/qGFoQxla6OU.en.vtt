to<00:01:47.009> choose<00:01:47.399> where<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.729> needs<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.960> let's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
to choose where it needs to be so let's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.139 
to choose where it needs to be so let's
check<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:49.950> does<00:01:50.250> ok<00:01:51.090> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
check out what it actually does ok so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
check out what it actually does ok so
let's<00:01:51.360> take<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.600> closer<00:01:51.840> look<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> dials<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
let's take a closer look at the dials of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.980 
let's take a closer look at the dials of
the<00:01:52.790> cs3<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.210> left<00:01:54.420> hand<00:01:54.600> side<00:01:54.810> we've<00:01:54.960> got

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the cs3 on the left hand side we've got

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
the cs3 on the left hand side we've got
level<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:55.740> basically<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.280> volume<00:01:56.700> control

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
level that's basically a volume control

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
level that's basically a volume control
I<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:57.450> give<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> demo<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.229> it's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
I will give you a demo of that it's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.190 
I will give you a demo of that it's
fairly<00:01:58.890> obvious<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.850> tonal<00:02:00.299> control<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> next

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
fairly obvious the tonal control is next

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.520 
fairly obvious the tonal control is next
that<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.649> darken<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> sound<00:02:02.520> from

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
that can darken the sound from

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.600 
that can darken the sound from
anti-clockwise<00:02:04.530> right<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.159> way<00:02:05.280> through<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
anti-clockwise right the way through to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.120 
anti-clockwise right the way through to
quite<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> bright<00:02:06.750> sound<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.950> say

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
quite a bright sound but have to say

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.770 
quite a bright sound but have to say
it's<00:02:08.280> quite<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.520> subtle<00:02:08.910> tone<00:02:09.420> you're<00:02:09.690> not

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it's quite a subtle tone you're not

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.990 
it's quite a subtle tone you're not
going<00:02:09.930> to<00:02:09.990> get<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> massive<00:02:10.500> tone<00:02:11.250> or<00:02:11.430> sweep<00:02:11.670> let

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
going to get a massive tone or sweep let

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.150 
going to get a massive tone or sweep let
me<00:02:12.090> give<00:02:12.210> you<00:02:12.270> an<00:02:12.360> example<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.160> here's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
me give you an example of that here's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.190 
me give you an example of that here's
the<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.670> darkest<00:02:15.180> tone<00:02:15.420> you'll<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:15.840> out<00:02:16.020> of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
the the darkest tone you'll get out of

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:33.880 
the the darkest tone you'll get out of
it<00:02:16.350> use<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> clean<00:02:17.130> sound<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.550> them

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.110 

so<00:02:34.890> we're<00:02:35.010> not<00:02:35.070> talking<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.490> huge<00:02:35.760> amount<00:02:36.030> of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
so we're not talking a huge amount of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.400 
so we're not talking a huge amount of
tonal<00:02:36.450> sweet<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:36.930> certainly<00:02:37.170> enough

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
tonal sweet but it's certainly enough

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.950 
tonal sweet but it's certainly enough
there<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.650> adjust<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.190> tone<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.820> any<00:02:39.240> input

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
there to adjust a tone of any input

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.250 
there to adjust a tone of any input
that's<00:02:40.080> going<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.770> sort<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.100> way<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
that's going in a sort of way so the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.440 
that's going in a sort of way so the
next<00:02:43.440> one<00:02:43.560> along<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> attack<00:02:44.250> knob<00:02:44.490> that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
next one along is the attack knob that

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.660 
next one along is the attack knob that
basically<00:02:45.930> increases<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.830> intensity<00:02:47.460> of<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
basically increases the intensity of the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.900 
basically increases the intensity of the
attack<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.270> you're<00:02:48.840> picking<00:02:49.260> dynamics<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
attack in you're picking dynamics so the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.900 
attack in you're picking dynamics so the
further<00:02:51.090> clockwise<00:02:51.660> you've<00:02:51.930> got<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.440> more

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
further clockwise you've got the more

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.750 
further clockwise you've got the more
intense<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.510> basically

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
intense that is and it basically

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.610 
intense that is and it basically
articulates<00:02:56.760> every<00:02:57.420> single<00:02:57.840> note<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.500> you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
articulates every single note that you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.710 
articulates every single note that you
pick<00:02:58.890> let<00:02:59.670> me<00:02:59.760> give<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.000> an<00:03:00.090> example<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.600> that

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
pick let me give you an example of that

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.840 
pick let me give you an example of that
I'll<00:03:00.870> bring<00:03:01.020> in<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.380> little<00:03:01.860> bit<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.100> Drive<00:03:02.670> on

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
I'll bring in a little bit of Drive on

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.030 
I'll bring in a little bit of Drive on
the<00:03:02.970> amp<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:03.810> we'll<00:03:04.050> play<00:03:04.260> I'll<00:03:04.560> play<00:03:04.740> a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the amp and then we'll play I'll play a

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.280 
the amp and then we'll play I'll play a
passage<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:05.940> amp<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.540> amp<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.050> then

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
passage with the amp just amp and then

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.100 
passage with the amp just amp and then
we'll<00:03:07.470> put<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.450> cs3<00:03:09.450> on<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.750> see<00:03:09.870> what<00:03:09.990> it

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
we'll put the cs3 on and see what it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.610 
we'll put the cs3 on and see what it
sounds<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.380> together<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:13.170> here's<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.440> tone

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
sounds like together so here's the tone

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.660 
sounds like together so here's the tone
from<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.920> amp<00:03:14.010> now<00:03:17.960> let's<00:03:18.960> hit<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.670> cs3

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
from the amp now let's hit with the cs3

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:29.860 
from the amp now let's hit with the cs3
on<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.080> attack<00:03:22.770> all<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.100> way<00:03:23.220> up<00:03:23.340> so

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.270 

you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.050> hear<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.440> oh<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:32.100> definitely

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
you can hear that it oh it's definitely

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.670 
you can hear that it oh it's definitely
articulating<00:03:33.210> every<00:03:33.450> note<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.630> if<00:03:34.500> you

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
articulating every note and if you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.930 
articulating every note and if you
certainly<00:03:35.070> play<00:03:35.280> across<00:03:35.550> strings<00:03:40.640> okay<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.910> a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
certainly play across strings okay and a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.190 
certainly play across strings okay and a
final<00:03:42.270> number<00:03:42.360> were<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.660> look<00:03:42.780> at<00:03:42.959> is

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
final number were going to look at is

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.370 
final number were going to look at is
the<00:03:43.620> sustain<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.520> that's<00:03:45.420> fairly<00:03:45.690> obvious<00:03:45.780> -

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
the sustain and that's fairly obvious -

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.110 
the sustain and that's fairly obvious -
so<00:03:46.860> basically<00:03:47.100> what<00:03:47.550> it's<00:03:47.670> doing<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:48.030> going

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
so basically what it's doing it's going

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.460 
so basically what it's doing it's going
to<00:03:48.209> grab<00:03:48.450> hold<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.959> notes<00:03:49.140> as<00:03:49.320> it's

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
to grab hold of the notes as it's

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.920 
to grab hold of the notes as it's
decaying<00:03:49.830> naturally<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.610> then<00:03:51.150> try<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.510> keep

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
decaying naturally and then try to keep

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.270 
decaying naturally and then try to keep
that<00:03:52.140> going<00:03:52.380> for<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:52.890> you're<00:03:53.190> getting

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
that going for you so you're getting

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.070 
that going for you so you're getting
sustain<00:03:53.970> basically<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.600> let<00:03:54.720> me<00:03:54.810> give<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.020> a

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
sustain basically so let me give you a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.550 
sustain basically so let me give you a
note<00:03:55.320> without<00:03:55.950> cs3<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.900> just<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.350> amp

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
note without cs3 just the just the amp

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.860 
note without cs3 just the just the amp
and<00:03:59.250> then<00:03:59.340> we'll<00:03:59.520> try<00:03:59.730> and<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.030> bring<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.420> cs3

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
and then we'll try and you bring the cs3

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.810 
and then we'll try and you bring the cs3
and<00:04:00.900> I'll<00:04:01.110> get<00:04:01.260> afterwards<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.920> show<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
and I'll get afterwards and show you the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.430 
and I'll get afterwards and show you the
difference<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.510> here's<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.810> sustained<00:04:04.410> note

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
difference so here's a sustained note

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.100 
difference so here's a sustained note
with<00:04:04.980> just<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.340> M

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.140 

and<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.890> can<00:04:14.040> hear<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.280> naturally<00:04:14.820> decaying

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
and you can hear it naturally decaying

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.490 
and you can hear it naturally decaying
that<00:04:15.390> even<00:04:15.690> though<00:04:15.780> I'm<00:04:15.930> giving<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.320> some

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
that even though I'm giving it some

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.410 
that even though I'm giving it some
vibrato<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:17.250> could<00:04:17.579> have<00:04:17.670> really<00:04:17.910> fought<00:04:18.180> it

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
vibrato I could have really fought it

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.210 
vibrato I could have really fought it
and<00:04:18.570> tried<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.810> bring<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.170> back<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.440> life<00:04:19.590> but

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
and tried to bring it back to life but

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:28.530 
and tried to bring it back to life but
check<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.820> out<00:04:20.940> now<00:04:21.150> with<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.420> cs3<00:04:22.049> engaged

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.510 

so<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.350> can<00:04:29.500> see<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.800> it's<00:04:29.950> grabbing<00:04:30.280> hold

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
so you can see that it's grabbing hold

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.450 
so you can see that it's grabbing hold
of<00:04:30.670> that<00:04:30.790> note<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.540> elongating<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.620> and

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
of that note and elongating it and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.360 
of that note and elongating it and
keeping<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:34.000> alive<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.930> like<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.170> say<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.470> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
keeping it alive and like I say the the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.570 
keeping it alive and like I say the the
cs3<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.270> compressors<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:37.930> general<00:04:38.230> a<00:04:38.580> subtle

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
cs3 and compressors in general a subtle

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.920 
cs3 and compressors in general a subtle
effects<00:04:39.910> but<00:04:40.120> they<00:04:40.180> can<00:04:40.330> make<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.540> huge

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
effects but they can make a huge

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.180 
effects but they can make a huge
difference<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.590> turn<00:04:41.770> them<00:04:41.890> what<00:04:42.040> they're

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
difference to you turn them what they're

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.550 
difference to you turn them what they're
actually<00:04:42.340> doing<00:04:42.850> really<00:04:43.090> is<00:04:43.420> evening<00:04:44.350> an<00:04:44.440> hour

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
actually doing really is evening an hour

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.410 
actually doing really is evening an hour
