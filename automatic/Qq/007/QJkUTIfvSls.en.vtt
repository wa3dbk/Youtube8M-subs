00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:53.449
 footprint 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.449

 We see people 200 meters more 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:24.370
 down does not come out a small pirarara 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:28.240

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.500

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:45.580

 here is much rumor but very good 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:33.090
 It's time that there's no way you're just 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:36.039
 bastard that he is caught 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:42.400
 while he does not take the hook he does not 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:44.199
 We are already out of stock and now 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.320
 Good. We're going to have to take the boat. 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:48.340
