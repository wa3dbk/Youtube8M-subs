00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.590
 hello girls i hope you 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.640
 okay today I am very 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.470
 happy to meet you for a 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.640
 new tutorial nail art cute or 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.870
 for the one he would have recognized 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.220
 to draw small rice heads 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.240
 Lacombe stays a day without me adore 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.830
 since I am very small 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.890
 you will see that it is very easy to 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.890
 achieve 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.730
 so for this alert and I used 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.189
 an internal Cottin Verdian base or the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.869
 chocolate a beige nail polish from the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.199
 white and black acrylic paint 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.609
 a fine brush and a kingston like 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.079
 always i'm going to start senales art 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.820
 by applying a basecoat to 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.180
 protect my angle from the nail polish 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.500
 and allow a better grip 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.000
 I will then apply my nail polish to 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.199
 nails so I applied the beige on 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.199
 my two to mÃ¼ller have two layers 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.440
 I then apply one goes better to 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.360
 chocolate nails on everything but will be done 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.650
 in two layers and the greenhouse packaging 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.290
 and handed just adorable 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.059
 these are glazes ice cream cone 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.540
 in house studies and unfortunately they 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.540
 are no longer edited 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 and 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.030
 we now go to deco so I 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.800
 will take my paint tube 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.660
 white and black acrylic and I'm going 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.650
 have two drops of each paint 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.420
 on a pallet 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.680
 then with the help of a fine brush I 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.680
 take white acrylic paint 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.960
 to do the dyeing of a fight I 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.000
 begins by making the outline of a 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.090
 oval lying on the base of my fingernail 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.980
 that I will fill in blank one time 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.540
 that my plot and dry I will spend a 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.890
 second red that we could even spent 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.240
 a third layer if ever this is 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.470
 still not running it really depends 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.970
 paint marks quickly created 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.230
 and if he did not have any painting 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.580
 you can over old white varnish 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.390
 it works very well and you only have to 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.390
 apply this layer 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.010
 I then do a second round that I 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.480
 go dipped in acrylic paint 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.310
 black or sold come to see me if you 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.750
 do not have one and I'm going to make two 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.370
 weight to make rice eyes the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.170
 croma and I'm going to achieve a third 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.850
 times to make the muzzle I'm going 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.170
 then take a fine brush and I 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.360
 let's do two lines apart and 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.360
 other weight to make the cars 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.720
 that's all I have to do is apply 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.370
 a layer of top coat so I re in 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.480
 also add on the slice of my 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.920
 nail to prevent water from 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.800
 seeps in and to keep my manicure 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.480
