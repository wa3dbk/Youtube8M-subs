00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.759
 hello guys welcome back to games 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.469
 collection tv i am your de said 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.389
 Today I give you a box of india 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 review of such jaguars 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.420
 the very first 64-bit console released 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 in america in 1993 is a year later in 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.699
 Japan and Europe 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.650
 it was a big failure because being 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.289
 the first 64-bit console 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.480
 it was very difficult to program and not 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.370
 great support comes from third parties 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.430
 therefore large parts of companies 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.960
 videogames and worse still the tari 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.070
 same not release of the very great ones 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.750
 memorable titles for this console 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.969
 the result was that atari was withdrawn 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.940
 from the console market 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.719
 precisely following this failure 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.289
 with the tari janua a sin but it goes well 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.320
 this is the external box shows the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.420
 jaguar logo because the equal after links 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.030
 initio started calling the consoles with 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.570
 names of animals precisely jaguar la 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.820
 lynx etc. etc. with the eyes on 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 cyber morse game that was included in 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 all the shorts in the packaging of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.150
 that jaguar and what game brings the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.330
 written 64 bit a bit on all sides 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.490
 just to show off proudly 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.280
 these 64 bits that were not 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.250
 practically never exploited 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.180
 we see its interior this pressure 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.060
 which I put almost new so I saw 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 a new console their conditions 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.649
 inside we have the meat box 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.210
 eggs 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.290
 only the ones lacking a scudetto of 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.509
 thank you for purchasing the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.270
 console thanks to you business you have 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.060
 made his failure booklet of the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.310
 instructions with various institutions 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.259
 inside that is how to connect the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.490
 consul 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.920
 the instruction of the game instructions 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.220
 cyber morse which was really bad 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.110
 this postcard to sign up for 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.360
 information on the tariff etc. 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.110
 etc. to the empire there is the cable of 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.450
 supply 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.880
 this is the American model indeed it is the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.730
 english model english model 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.569
 American therefore only works at 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 110 volt cyber morph cartridge uses 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.250
 in all packages 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.650
 unfortunately for those who bought them with the times 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.030
 to this very strange format behind the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.319
 logo atari this grip to remove the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.650
 cartridges with strength and that's it 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.049
 the controller that controls a lot 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.310
 particular 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.390
 this controller has practically a 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.140
 design all its own to a very cruise 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.290
 low 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.200
 it is not shaped so invitation slips 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.319
 practically suffered three many keys 2 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.120
 so that the key pauses the option key 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.890
 or the numeric keypad that was already 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.069
 was included in previous models of 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.160
 age and as 7800 and then the models of 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.310
 this film is removed is 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.030
 practically comes out the keyboard for 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.130
 call your friends at home which is a 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.150
 which among other things not many games 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.859
 even the TV had a cable for the interior 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.900
 av 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:35.859
 sorry the rf cable for the antenna and that's it 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.570
 the console that I believe has a 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.670
 good design and all in all as you see 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.060
 it's not so bad 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.950
 lacks the door of the dust that 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.410
 for example, models such as 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.170
 super nintendo megadrive had them here 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.069
 no logo has already been inserted 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.739
 64-bit interactive multimedia system the 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.709
 power button 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.910
 behind it is the attack for the power supply 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.130
 this door that actually looks like 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.069
 an expansion port but it is actually 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.889
 the cable that the connection for the cable that 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.380
 it was used to have the video 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:17.160
 composite pd yellow red and white e 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.020
 and the classic RF cable connection 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.330
 in front there are two doors that the 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.230
 controllers that are very similar to 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.590
 those of the mega drive 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.840
 indeed I believe they are compatible and not 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.200
 there is nothing else behind the serial 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.960
 numerical various information to the good 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.720
 a great pity for this big design 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.400
 failure of the tari that surely was 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.380
 a big blow to their company 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.340
 having said this guys I greet you and there 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.340
 let 's see the next life hello
