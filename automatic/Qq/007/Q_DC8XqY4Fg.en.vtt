00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this short in two distinct ways as just

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.390 
this short in two distinct ways as just
a<00:01:18.750> standard<00:01:19.200> short<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> propaganda

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
a standard short and as a propaganda

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
a standard short and as a propaganda
short<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> standard<00:01:22.020> short<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.439> it's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
short as a standard short I think it's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
short as a standard short I think it's
fine<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.610> much<00:01:23.729> goofiness<00:01:24.299> or

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
fine there's not as much goofiness or

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
fine there's not as much goofiness or
even<00:01:24.810> outright<00:01:24.930> anger<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.530> were<00:01:25.680> used<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> from

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
even outright anger as were used to from

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
even outright anger as were used to from
Donald's<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> physical<00:01:27.330> humor<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.720> still

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Donald's but the physical humor is still

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
Donald's but the physical humor is still
there<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.590> can't<00:01:28.799> complain<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
there so I really can't complain the
