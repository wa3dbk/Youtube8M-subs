00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.480
 this beautiful island deal 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.549
 We'll talk in two weeks. We'll talk. 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.880
 step of the week I put enough 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.880
 private from here in orlando 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.610
 had most of the parks 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.200
 best pictures here 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.380
 again nice and 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.810
 I'll try to show it to you now it 's 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.360
 one point for me was one of the points 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.280
 What was this house that we 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.480
 You are now entering the market question 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.920
 stayed during this time 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.050
 completely different from a hotel of a 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.840
 hostel or something 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.489
 we had a house very similar 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.570
 how can we have in terms of 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.809
 comfort 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.050
 then Brazil ends up replacing the super 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.410
 well- equipped supernova a neighborhood 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.070
 Quite quiet our good people here 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:12.440
 We're going in and a gun is a room. 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:15.340
 coupled dinner thing 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.340
 equipped 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.900
 ita new micro waves 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.030
 the double dishwasher refrigerator 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 the space for dissent and right here 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.690
 Our left together and China 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.570
 the heated pool 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.360
 everything is in order because the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.340
 equipment are really new male 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.730
 different from the one we are 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.860
 accustomed in brazil 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.240
 but martin with the electric and 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.640
 is also worn works quite well 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.520
 heated people used a little less nearly 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.290
 did not actually use this space here 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.780
 because it removes the other managers 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.780
 for the purchase of parts except 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.270
 but here we can see the part 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.680
 interior of the house that is extremely 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.600
 pretty comfortable and functional enough 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.370
 run a can a garage in the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.640
 they put it as the hall of 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.010
 This part is multi-purpose eggs where 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.500
 had a lot of fun 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.370
 children here we stay 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.370
 4 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.290
 three other children four years and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.290
 They were accommodated and it was a delight their 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.379
 people have above all this dormitory 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.840
 down here also quite well 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.769
 equipped super comfortable two beds 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.500
 not married 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.900
 the house has four suites in fact 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.739
 this is the first time 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.739
 on the bottom 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.580
 We're going to 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.580
 first floor on the top floor of the house 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.430
 on the top of the house all in one 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.170
 carpet or central air conditioning 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.540
 works great 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.490
 the two-story house not a child 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.470
 higher 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.120
 I do not believe we have the first 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.340
 suite the other two single beds 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.510
 We have not really prepared anything 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.709
 she's still well spoken messy house 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.900
 Because god 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.790
 The couple stayed with us tomorrow though. 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.090
 in the morning we did not pack 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.970
 to do it insisted but here we are the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.640
 second suite 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.830
 two beds the largest 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.330
 which are 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.300
 really well equipped and 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.220
 all of them with her by Ana 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.830
 I find no fault anything that 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.470
 people could criticize and see that 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.860
 really this did not work and did not 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.890
 worth in 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.830
 pepper forró compare it with the hotel here 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.609
 the main agent park is in the suite 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.969
 main one queen size bed 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.569
 well with suite also with cable tv and 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.569
 flat screen 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.479
 Actually, we have an air 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.479
 conditioning for example sent 70 ° 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.479
 lightning 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.440
 really everything in the house running a lot 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.950
 good 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.730
 and we made a comparison with the 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.730
 prices in reality for us the price 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.740
 perhaps it was more of something than the 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.060
 people could not compare with others 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.060
 for 10 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.070
 to compare the suspicious packages that 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.210
 we have is that the price of your looks 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.680
 what a joke but it really was not 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.570
 super reliable supermoon super delicious 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.440
 And this house is really for us to leave. 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.440
 missing 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.460
 so that's it I hope they also have 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.980
 I wish I could spend something 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.870
 really at home time 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:33.180
 the idea was this I hope that when you 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.070
 have proved and have opted for such 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.890
 place like this a house like it is 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.750
 You can have fun had a while. 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.730
 happy moments just like us 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:47.690
 had in the last ten days 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.690
 A hug until Tchan made everyone
