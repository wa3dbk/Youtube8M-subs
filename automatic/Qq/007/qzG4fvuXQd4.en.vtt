00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.400
 to achieve special effects in the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.799
 choreography the group carioca lumini 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.710
 dance company with knowledge 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.980
 of various areas beyond physical dance 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.400
 chemistry and biology make up the show 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 matter that premieres today in Brasilia 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.330
 dancers wearing special costumes 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.330
 made with paint against beautiful 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.800
 lights 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.530
 Colors 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.530
 the smoke 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.649
 matter the show is a dream on the scene 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.829
 the dancers create playful images 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.289
 between pirouettes jumps and contortionists 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.140
 in the dark a challenge for those who are 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.239
 accustomed to working with lots of light 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.739
 some choreographies we really do 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.199
 have to communicate on the scene with the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.579
 colleague because we do not then see the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.649
 people make it up we create codes 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.570
 We're communicating and knowing. 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.640
 Where we put the people we did not hit were 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.920
 five years of research and testing to 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.409
 unite science art 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.330
 the idea was this physicist and dancer who 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.119
 so does not show matter 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.729
 obviously produce many images but I 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.179
 did not know that these images were 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.240
 important 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.270
 only in dance was to understand that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.600
 It's what I thought was important. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.549
 however to do this is to put 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.319
 practice these thoughts is necessary 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.960
 knowledge and the technique of other 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.340
 people come to the material 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.100
 to respond in the way that people 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.840
 wanted to understand how gases 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.280
 they work how we can 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.000
 make the best use of 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.460
 This was just an attempt to respond. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.079
 for the dancers to be on stage is a 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.750
 opportunity to make the public 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.649
 do not lose the ability to create and 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.390
 to dream 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.070
 people feel a little feeling a 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.659
 few of us mostly do not have 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.049
 face here so they can really 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.220
 To imagine that it is not very tasty is a 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:07.940
 very tasty belief this exchange 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.940
 the perfect
