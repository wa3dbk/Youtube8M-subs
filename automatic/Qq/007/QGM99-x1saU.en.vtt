eating sugar with a spoon right but did
you<00:00:13.769> know<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.009> sugar<00:00:14.549> wasn't<00:00:14.820> things<00:00:15.120> like

bread and pasta did you know that
there's<00:00:19.680> actually<00:00:20.279> sugar<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:21.150> beer<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.920> not

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
there's actually sugar in beer it is not

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.300 
there's actually sugar in beer it is not
even<00:00:23.369> sweet<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.420> why<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.019> why<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.800> your

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
even sweet so why is that why is your

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370 
even sweet so why is that why is your
sugar<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.820> food<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.539> aren't<00:00:27.840> even<00:00:27.900> sweet

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
sugar and food that aren't even sweet

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.890 
sugar and food that aren't even sweet
both<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.730> simple<00:00:30.179> actually

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
both is really simple actually

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.709 
both is really simple actually
the<00:00:31.080> way<00:00:31.230> sugar<00:00:31.710> works<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.399> sugar<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.510> also

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the way sugar works this sugar is also

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.470 
the way sugar works this sugar is also
called<00:00:34.140> glucose<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.309> there's<00:00:35.700> glucose<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
called glucose and there's glucose and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.850 
called glucose and there's glucose and
all<00:00:36.600> kinds<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.170> things<00:00:37.230> are<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.710> eat

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
all kinds of things are with eat

including sweets including carbohydrates
and<00:00:41.219> also<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.969> our<00:00:42.030> vegetables<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.870> our<00:00:43.200> ribs

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and also in our vegetables and our ribs

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
and also in our vegetables and our ribs
as<00:00:43.739> well<00:00:43.950> how<00:00:44.460> does<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:44.940> work<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.539> does

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
as well how does it really work how does

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.560 
as well how does it really work how does
it<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.260> beer<00:00:46.680> become<00:00:47.550> sugar<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.270> our<00:00:48.390> body

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it be like beer become sugar in our body

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.600 
it be like beer become sugar in our body
it's<00:00:48.989> actually<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.739> simple<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it's actually really simple the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
it's actually really simple the
scientific<00:00:51.390> name<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.780> sugar<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.530> actually

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
scientific name for sugar is actually

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.700 
scientific name for sugar is actually
glucose<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.180> glucose<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.870> found<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.469> all

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
glucose and glucose is found with all

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.170 
glucose and glucose is found with all
kinds<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.160> foods<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.699> eat<00:00:56.730> including

sweets carbohydrates fruits and
vegetables<00:01:00.480> -<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.960> know<00:01:01.590> vegetables<00:01:02.309> even

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
vegetables - I know vegetables even

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.579 
vegetables - I know vegetables even
though<00:01:02.850> they're<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.149> sweet<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.870> turns<00:01:04.320> into

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
though they're not sweet it turns into

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.340 
though they're not sweet it turns into
glucose<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.700> body<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.689> happens<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
glucose in your body and what happens is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
glucose in your body and what happens is
your<00:01:07.650> body<00:01:07.890> produces<00:01:08.250> large<00:01:08.850> amounts<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
your body produces large amounts of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.410 
your body produces large amounts of
insulin<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.200> capture<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> glucose<00:01:11.610> once<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
insulin to capture the glucose once the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.969 
insulin to capture the glucose once the
glucose<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.200> collected<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
glucose is all collected in the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
glucose is all collected in the
bloodstream<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.060> body<00:01:15.270> does<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> sing

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
bloodstream and your body does it sing

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.260 
bloodstream and your body does it sing
the<00:01:16.590> anthem<00:01:16.740> level<00:01:17.280> goes<00:01:17.520> away<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.090> almost

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the anthem level goes away and almost

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.880 
the anthem level goes away and almost
now<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.680> want<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.369> sugar<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.439> what<00:01:22.439> happens

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
now you want more sugar so what happens

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.219 
now you want more sugar so what happens
is<00:01:23.100> when<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> eat<00:01:23.850> sugar<00:01:23.880> you're<00:01:24.750> creating

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
is when you eat sugar you're creating

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.740 
is when you eat sugar you're creating
this<00:01:25.350> dangerous<00:01:26.040> cycle<00:01:26.369> copy<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.360> body<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
this dangerous cycle copy your body to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.219 
this dangerous cycle copy your body to
want<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.880> sugar<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.479> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
want more and more and more sugar and so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.230 
want more and more and more sugar and so
that<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.340> makes<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:33.119> difficult

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
that actually makes it really difficult

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.010 
that actually makes it really difficult
or<00:01:34.810> be<00:01:35.049> healthy<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.130> what<00:01:36.700> do<00:01:36.820> you<00:01:36.909> do<00:01:37.119> having<00:01:37.930> a

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
or be healthy so what do you do having a

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.800 
or be healthy so what do you do having a
boy<00:01:38.200> sugar<00:01:38.710> or<00:01:38.979> glucose<00:01:39.549> if<00:01:39.820> isn't<00:01:40.180> everything

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
boy sugar or glucose if isn't everything

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.020 
boy sugar or glucose if isn't everything
you<00:01:41.170> learn<00:01:41.409> what<00:01:41.710> types<00:01:42.010> of<00:01:42.220> sugar<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.729> good

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
you learn what types of sugar is good

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.480 
you learn what types of sugar is good
and<00:01:43.300> what<00:01:43.540> is<00:01:43.630> bad<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:44.470> best<00:01:44.770> types<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.220> sugar

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and what is bad the best types of sugar

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.969 
and what is bad the best types of sugar
comes<00:01:45.850> from<00:01:46.180> fresh<00:01:46.479> fruits<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.140> low<00:01:47.619> starch
