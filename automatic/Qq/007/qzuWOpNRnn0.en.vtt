00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the solid shown is formed by 16 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.319
 cubes after painting all the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.000
 surface of the solid has shown the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.570
 number of cubes that have only two 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.570
 painted faces 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.930
 the problem tells us that the solid that 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.029
 shows us is formed by 16 cubes 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.110
 they also tell us that they are going to paint 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.250
 the entire surface 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.210
 and they ask us to find the number of 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.030
 cubes that have only two faces 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.399
 painted 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.180
 after painting all this solid that 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.430
 show us here we must determine 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.000
 how many cubes are going to be left with only 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.510
 two faces painted to see let's start 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.019
 looking at the corners for example 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 in this corner the juice would have three 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.500
 painted faces 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.700
 and the same will happen for the others 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.970
 cubes that are also in the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.970
 corners 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.560
 for example these from here to the bottom 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.100
 would have the upper part painted the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.770
 left side part and part of the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.330
 background would also not be painted 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.480
 then they would also have three faces 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.480
 painted 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.240
 and the same thing is going to happen with the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.240
 cubes that were on the bottom 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.530
 then the cubes that would have only 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.280
 two painted faces would be the ones left 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.319
 for example this one here only has the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.110
 clear top and side face 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.460
 painted left 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.000
 the same with this cube has only two 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.000
 painted faces 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.800
 and similarly the other cubes 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.800
 they only have two faces painted 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.160
 so he 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:48.280
 the number of cubes with two sides 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.820
 painted would be equal to 8 if there are 4 in the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.820
 upper part 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.630
 2 3 and 4 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.090
 and also 4 on the bottom in 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.630
 total 8 the answer is found in the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.630
 alternative
