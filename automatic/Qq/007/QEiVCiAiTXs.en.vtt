now<00:00:03.870> once<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.200> solder<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.710> applied<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.549> both

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
now once the solder is applied to both

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.839 
now once the solder is applied to both
pieces<00:00:06.740> both<00:00:07.740> sides<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.280> clean<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> holes

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
pieces both sides you clean the holes

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.860 
pieces both sides you clean the holes
out<00:00:11.750> keep<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.900> mind<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.450> bolsters<00:00:15.450> are

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
out keep in mind this the bolsters are

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.189 
out keep in mind this the bolsters are
pre<00:00:16.410> fitted<00:00:17.150> before<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.480> Rick<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:19.020> all

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
pre fitted before you get Rick do all

the<00:00:19.320> soldering<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.949> makes<00:00:20.160> sense<00:00:21.470> but<00:00:22.470> just

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the soldering that makes sense but just

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:44.150 
the soldering that makes sense but just
thought<00:00:22.949> I'd<00:00:23.130> mention<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.119> case

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660 

reason<00:00:45.160> we<00:00:45.510> read<00:00:46.510> drilled<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.050> holes<00:00:47.290> in<00:00:47.670> both

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
reason we read drilled the holes in both

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.360 
reason we read drilled the holes in both
the<00:00:49.000> liner<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:52.050> bolster<00:00:53.050> piece<00:00:53.350> is<00:00:54.100> so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
the liner and the bolster piece is so

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:10.070 
the liner and the bolster piece is so
you<00:00:54.550> can<00:00:54.730> use<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.260> pinhole<00:00:56.260> for<00:00:56.649> alignment

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080

Amanda

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.830 

just<00:01:18.299> barely<00:01:18.689> touch<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.079> I<00:01:19.380> take<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:20.509> run<00:01:21.509> slow

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
just barely touch it I take it run slow

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:44.719 
just barely touch it I take it run slow
pencil<00:01:22.469> blocking<00:01:33.020> assignment<00:01:34.020> wart<00:01:43.579> clean<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
pencil blocking assignment wart clean it

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.870 
pencil blocking assignment wart clean it
up<00:01:44.880> again<00:01:45.209> with<00:01:45.869> acetone

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.609 

yeah<00:01:50.880> that's<00:01:51.209> to<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:52.340> any<00:01:53.340> burn<00:01:53.729> flux

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
yeah that's to get the any burn flux

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:13.240 
yeah that's to get the any burn flux
excess<00:01:55.619> flux<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.130> might<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.429> on<00:01:56.579> it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.890 

apply<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.430> little<00:02:14.640> bit<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:14.910> oil<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.629> pin

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
apply it a little bit of oil to the pin

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:29.780 
apply it a little bit of oil to the pin
so<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.260> doesn't<00:02:16.560> stick<00:02:16.769> inside<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.340> hole

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.520 

there's<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.980> breach<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.220> patterns<00:02:32.670> that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
there's a breach of the patterns that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.649 
there's a breach of the patterns that
Tony<00:02:34.530> makes<00:02:34.890> there's<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.730> little<00:02:36.209> plate<00:02:36.420> that

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
Tony makes there's a little plate that

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.580 
Tony makes there's a little plate that
he<00:02:36.780> uses<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.409> help<00:02:38.099> align<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.730> bolster<00:02:39.590> during

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
he uses to help align the bolster during

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.729 
he uses to help align the bolster during
soldering<00:02:41.569> also<00:02:42.569> works<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:43.019> aligning<00:02:43.319> caps

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
soldering also works for aligning caps

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.979 
soldering also works for aligning caps
and<00:02:44.610> for<00:02:45.540> cutting<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.890> handle<00:02:47.459> material<00:02:47.989> if

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
and for cutting the handle material if

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.009 
and for cutting the handle material if
they're<00:02:49.610> names<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:51.000> need<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.299> be<00:02:51.450> matched<00:02:51.690> on

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
they're names that need to be matched on

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.150 
they're names that need to be matched on
on<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> inside<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.220> bolsters<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.760> caps
