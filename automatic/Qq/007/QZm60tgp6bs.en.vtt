called it Luke Rockhold a sensational
matchup<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.079> think<00:03:46.109> Michael<00:03:46.560> Bisping<00:03:46.709> yes<00:03:47.430> he

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
matchup I think Michael Bisping yes he

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.580 
matchup I think Michael Bisping yes he
should<00:03:47.730> get<00:03:47.970> his<00:03:48.030> crack<00:03:48.359> at<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.690> title<00:03:48.720> if<00:03:49.230> he

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
should get his crack at the title if he

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.559 
should get his crack at the title if he
beats<00:03:49.829> Luke<00:03:50.130> Rockhold<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.910> course<00:03:51.150> he<00:03:51.299> makes<00:03:51.480> a

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
beats Luke Rockhold of course he makes a

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.240 
beats Luke Rockhold of course he makes a
case<00:03:51.750> for<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.109> but<00:03:52.349> I<00:03:52.500> think<00:03:52.620> Michael<00:03:53.130> Bisping

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
case for it but I think Michael Bisping

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.430 
case for it but I think Michael Bisping
is<00:03:53.519> out<00:03:53.669> of<00:03:53.700> stage<00:03:54.030> right<00:03:54.269> now<00:03:54.329> just<00:03:55.139> have<00:03:55.349> him

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
is out of stage right now just have him

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.440 
is out of stage right now just have him
in<00:03:55.620> big<00:03:55.829> fights<00:03:56.190> let<00:03:56.790> him<00:03:56.910> earn<00:03:57.000> as<00:03:57.180> much<00:03:57.389> money

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
in big fights let him earn as much money

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.120 
in big fights let him earn as much money
as<00:03:57.780> humanly<00:03:58.260> possible<00:03:58.319> because<00:03:58.980> he's

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
as humanly possible because he's

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.009 
as humanly possible because he's
entertaining<00:03:59.609> and<00:03:59.940> ease<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.450> rock<00:04:00.630> holds<00:04:00.840> a

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
entertaining and ease and rock holds a

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.870 
entertaining and ease and rock holds a
smart<00:04:01.440> choice<00:04:01.709> because<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.160> would<00:04:02.489> say<00:04:02.669> he's

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
smart choice because I would say he's

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.629 
smart choice because I would say he's
right<00:04:03.150> he's<00:04:03.599> not<00:04:03.630> in<00:04:04.139> that<00:04:04.319> top<00:04:04.680> mix<00:04:05.069> of<00:04:05.280> 180

right he's not in that top mix of 180
fibers<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.359> if<00:04:06.720> he<00:04:06.959> gets<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.380> fight<00:04:07.620> with

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
fibers but if he gets that fight with

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.530 
fibers but if he gets that fight with
Luke<00:04:08.010> Rockhold<00:04:08.280> he's<00:04:08.760> putting<00:04:09.060> himself<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.480> a

to<00:05:37.050> remember<00:05:37.379> that<00:05:37.500> fight<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.370> for<00:05:38.639> you<00:05:38.969> know

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
to remember that fight so for you know

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.820 
to remember that fight so for you know
you<00:05:39.569> look<00:05:39.690> at<00:05:39.839> Kim<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.259> he<00:05:40.319> did<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.620> things

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
you look at Kim and he did the things

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.499 
you look at Kim and he did the things
that<00:05:40.979> he<00:05:41.069> did<00:05:41.219> would<00:05:41.729> they<00:05:41.759> was<00:05:42.000> able<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.330> take

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
that he did would they was able to take

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.999 
that he did would they was able to take
advantage<00:05:42.539> of<00:05:43.169> it<00:05:43.289> and<00:05:43.349> finish<00:05:43.710> him<00:05:43.740> in<00:05:43.919> the

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
advantage of it and finish him in the

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.279 
advantage of it and finish him in the
first<00:05:44.129> round<00:05:44.339> and<00:05:44.849> I<00:05:45.180> think<00:05:45.419> it's<00:05:45.629> you<00:05:46.050> have<00:05:46.259> to

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
first round and I think it's you have to

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.980 
first round and I think it's you have to
blame<00:05:46.740> Kim<00:05:47.250> for<00:05:47.580> because<00:05:47.849> if<00:05:48.060> he<00:05:48.270> just<00:05:48.479> was

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
blame Kim for because if he just was

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.990 
blame Kim for because if he just was
patient<00:05:49.469> wasn't<00:05:49.770> over<00:05:50.219> aggressive<00:05:50.520> like<00:05:50.879> he

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
patient wasn't over aggressive like he

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.640 
patient wasn't over aggressive like he
was<00:05:51.210> I<00:05:51.419> think<00:05:51.839> this<00:05:51.960> fight<00:05:52.199> could<00:05:52.409> have<00:05:52.529> been

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
was I think this fight could have been

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.350 
was I think this fight could have been
different<00:05:52.800> I<00:05:53.159> think<00:05:53.610> if<00:05:53.729> these<00:05:53.879> guys<00:05:54.000> fight

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
different I think if these guys fight

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.850 
different I think if these guys fight
ten<00:05:54.629> times<00:05:54.659> it<00:05:55.289> wouldn't<00:05:55.680> be<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:55.830> same

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
ten times it wouldn't be the same

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.379 
ten times it wouldn't be the same
element<00:05:56.310> yeah<00:05:56.550> I<00:05:56.580> think<00:05:57.089> you're<00:05:57.330> right

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
element yeah I think you're right

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.390 
element yeah I think you're right
because<00:05:58.169> Kim<00:05:58.379> is<00:05:58.409> a<00:05:58.560> better<00:05:58.830> fighter<00:05:59.099> than<00:05:59.219> he

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
because Kim is a better fighter than he

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.709 
because Kim is a better fighter than he
showed<00:05:59.639> but<00:05:59.789> that<00:05:59.909> in<00:06:00.029> no<00:06:00.089> way<00:06:00.180> it<00:06:00.360> takes<00:06:00.569> away

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
showed but that in no way it takes away

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.059 
showed but that in no way it takes away
from<00:06:00.779> no<00:06:00.990> I've<00:06:01.110> heard<00:06:01.349> all<00:06:01.529> who<00:06:01.650> went<00:06:01.949> out
