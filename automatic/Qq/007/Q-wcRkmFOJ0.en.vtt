00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and you'll have to struggle with a bit

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.410 
and you'll have to struggle with a bit
of<00:02:08.069> plastic<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.759> gets<00:02:09.239> stuck<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
of plastic that gets stuck in the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.290 
of plastic that gets stuck in the
clip-on<00:02:12.320> mount<00:02:12.590> which<00:02:12.920> really<00:02:13.850> isn't<00:02:14.000> worth

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
clip-on mount which really isn't worth

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.650 
clip-on mount which really isn't worth
it

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.090 
it
so<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> would<00:02:15.140> recommend<00:02:15.560> starting<00:02:15.590> off<00:02:15.980> with

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
so I would recommend starting off with

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.880 
so I would recommend starting off with
pliers<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.820> then<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.900> can<00:02:18.050> just<00:02:18.200> easily<00:02:18.440> snap

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
pliers and then you can just easily snap

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.190 
pliers and then you can just easily snap
them<00:02:19.070> out<00:02:19.220> once<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.240> weaken<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.720> plastic

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
them out once you weaken the plastic

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.680 
them out once you weaken the plastic
which<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.920> nice<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:23.000> want<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.240> push<00:02:23.450> them

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
which is nice you want to push them

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.630 
which is nice you want to push them
after<00:02:24.590> you've<00:02:24.770> taken<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.130> drivers<00:02:25.490> off

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
after you've taken the drivers off

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.550 
after you've taken the drivers off
inward<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.780> there's<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.230> little<00:02:27.410> bit<00:02:27.530> more

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
inward so that there's a little bit more

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.790 
inward so that there's a little bit more
torque<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:29.330> once<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.600> get<00:02:29.720> these<00:02:29.930> terrible

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
torque so once you get these terrible

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.680 
torque so once you get these terrible
drivers<00:02:31.400> out<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.790> way<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:31.970> never<00:02:32.390> see

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
drivers out of the way you never see

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.390 
drivers out of the way you never see
them<00:02:32.810> ever<00:02:32.990> again<00:02:33.320> I'm<00:02:33.830> probably<00:02:34.100> going<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
them ever again I'm probably going to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.100 
them ever again I'm probably going to
throw<00:02:34.550> them<00:02:34.640> away<00:02:34.760> because<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.510> really<00:02:35.960> do

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
throw them away because I really do

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.520 
throw them away because I really do
despise<00:02:36.440> them<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:38.209> get<00:02:38.420> your<00:02:38.720> favorite

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
despise them you get your favorite

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.120 
despise them you get your favorite

nice resounding snap which is pretty

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.840 
nice resounding snap which is pretty

satisfying then you do that with your
left<00:03:26.120> side<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:27.640> then<00:03:28.640> that's<00:03:28.820> it

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
left side and then that's it

silver<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.080> mean<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.620> looks<00:03:48.769> like<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.010> was

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
silver so I mean it looks like it was

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.949 
silver so I mean it looks like it was
pretty<00:03:49.310> much<00:03:49.459> meant<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.850> be<00:03:49.970> like<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.360> you

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
pretty much meant to be like this you

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.080 
pretty much meant to be like this you
can<00:03:51.080> hang<00:03:51.260> them<00:03:51.380> wherever<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.709> want<00:03:52.010> use<00:03:52.910> them

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
can hang them wherever you want use them

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.520 
can hang them wherever you want use them
at<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.239> gym<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:53.660> put<00:03:53.810> them<00:03:53.930> around<00:03:54.019> your<00:03:54.260> neck

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
at the gym and put them around your neck

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.530 
at the gym and put them around your neck
and<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:55.220> find<00:03:55.549> that<00:03:55.670> they<00:03:55.880> are<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.030> lot<00:03:56.330> more

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
and I find that they are a lot more

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.539 
and I find that they are a lot more
comfortable<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.260> they<00:03:57.769> actually<00:03:58.010> sound<00:03:58.459> a

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
comfortable and they actually sound a

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.340 
comfortable and they actually sound a
lot<00:03:58.640> better<00:03:58.700> so<00:03:59.209> for<00:03:59.360> about<00:03:59.540> two<00:03:59.720> bucks<00:03:59.750> again

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
lot better so for about two bucks again

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.680 
lot better so for about two bucks again
if<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.680> can<00:04:00.920> include<00:04:01.820> these<00:04:01.970> in<00:04:02.030> order<00:04:02.480> with

no-brainer and I can't recommend enough
of<00:04:09.410> doing<00:04:09.500> this<00:04:09.680> modification<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:10.940> have

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
of doing this modification you have

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.509 
of doing this modification you have
plenty<00:04:11.360> adjustment<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.260> mean<00:04:13.160> you<00:04:13.250> can<00:04:13.400> even

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
plenty adjustment I mean you can even

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.880 
plenty adjustment I mean you can even
there's<00:04:13.910> no<00:04:14.090> clicking<00:04:14.720> for<00:04:15.170> locking<00:04:15.440> anything

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
there's no clicking for locking anything

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.289 
there's no clicking for locking anything
in<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.250> can<00:04:16.340> have<00:04:16.459> one<00:04:16.640> side<00:04:16.880> much<00:04:17.120> higher

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
in so you can have one side much higher

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.039 
in so you can have one side much higher
than<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.630> other<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.109> fine<00:04:19.030> but<00:04:20.049> that's

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
than the other and it's fine but that's

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.560 
than the other and it's fine but that's
about<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.320> if<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:22.400> have<00:04:22.520> any<00:04:22.640> questions<00:04:23.270> about
