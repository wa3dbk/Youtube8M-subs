 very good everyone here we are in a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.690
 new episode of tekken revolution in 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.940
 this episode number 3 already good I have 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.560
 enough news to tell you about the 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.390
 The first ones, as you can see, are going to be the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.180
 cut items are worth I 'm going to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.250
 comment above I think it's better 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 to tell you all the ribs 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.210
 fighting and others and thus pass 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.880
 then why play more quietly 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.790
 apart and then already here to make a 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.650
 little bit more professional, so to speak 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.620
 Well I try and always bring 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.990
 five games as always the five 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.670
 coins that they give us for free and see how 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.470
 are the fighting and well then 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.260
 while you watch this first game 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.000
 against him and lÃ­ber comment two little things 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.430
 game novelties that have started 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.229
 this week and well it is that they have already 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.470
 surpassed the million downloads already 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.920
 let revolution and good then please the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.149
 producer of the game that are under the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.119
 I bet a new event of these that we 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.000
 they leave every week that will be available 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.190
 from the 2nd to the 8th of July and we 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.679
 They give a million money every time 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.110
 well every time not the first time we 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.240
 we made session in the game 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.800
 apart from this good, they will give us 5 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.310
 times 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.780
 gift points things 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.600
 every time we went when they were five 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.720
 times more than normal and then the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.090
 experience will multiply by 15 here 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.470
 As you can see, it 's pretty easy, let's go 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.710
 next what was a pin if I did not 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.299
 mistaken 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.740
 and good apart from this I was 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.540
 commenting have said that soon 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.280
 there will be a bigger update 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.840
 important they also said for those who 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.750
 do not know, they are going to put a new 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.050
 free training so when 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.000
 put it then I will take advantage to make a 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.000
 episode explaining things a little bit 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.250
 what do you have and so on 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.350
 and what more things have been put as two 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.570
 people who have been to jim and asia 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.220
 today we can unlock them as 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.580
 those who are now with building 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.140
 gift points what they have not said is 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.010
 How many points do we need for each one? 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.600
 then also say nothing more 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.550
 I suppose there will be quite a few points 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.590
 true because I have now bryant I think 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.320
 which is last I got was 30,000 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.000
 gift points if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.130
 I suppose that neither xiaoyu then maybe to 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.180
 the 50,000 that the 100,000 do not know not 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.799
 I have no idea the truth 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.590
 and nothing else is already the news that 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.290
 we have this week in mind 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.060
 evolution so for the moment because it's 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.069
 pretty good the thing with people is 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.160
 is cheering to play it 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.060
 also comment 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.800
 it was said that by twitter if it were yes 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.990
 had a good reception this game was 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.290
 they would think to take it out for ps vita with 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.570
 which at the moment the thing is going quite well 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.010
 what yes user of ps vita then the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.790
 truth is that it is a game that would come 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.560
 pretty good for the laptop 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.049
 and nothing more guys let's go 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.299
 directly to comment them the commas 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.250
 let's stay here with us through this 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.130
 which by the way is the same as before 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.530
 it's like it starts with the attack that you see 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.390
 in it alone 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.750
 there's my fault for not for the waitress and 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.750
 above 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.970
 this guy the people when they villar the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.010
 first time they usually win always 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.770
 the attack goes down under this Paul like 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.600
 I always sell you a lot but I 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.270
 I think especially online in this 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.190
 game is good to always prove against 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.260
 people because it's a good way to 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.440
 know if they know the game you give it away 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.360
 and if you see that they miss it or that is 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.660
 they eat it normally it's usually people with 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.870
 with little level we go here already with this 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.450
 third round today continues to start with the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.700
 anger so inventive in faith that it has 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.010
 invincibility with which nothing is sold 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.340
 more to start the fight I always say 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.489
 that you have to do it or be 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.020
 you can not do with that because 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.090
 usually 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.269
 is going to start defending 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.870
 throwing some loose punch as you can 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.220
 be a left punch a right that 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.350
 they started it from the small or 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.790
 simply defending everything 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.260
 you can do and more in this other in 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.389
 revolutions of pieces is to start with the 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.800
 attack this invincibility because you 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.900
 would come from the beginning and all to 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.050
 take the entire combo to anything that is 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.139
 someone who has a little bit of level 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.400
 and as you see, two persecuted 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.289
 has been selling constantly 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.069
 pulling on him always followed the videos 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.069
 previous and other 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.110
 and here we are against this step 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.910
 I am the red so that I go so that 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.860
 have doubts 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.800
 first, as you can see, I'm quite stopped 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.070
 the exciting walk that makes me like 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.070
 game 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.090
 basically that then there he took advantage 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.520
 an egg that you have the day here more 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.590
 claw as you see but you will see how the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.699
 next I 'm going to stop them the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.999
 mostly because it 's one thing that has and 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.819
 that have double has to have 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.889
 Many people are usually always 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.000
 same type of grip, that is if a 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.020
 person uses 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.280
 the 13th as you can see as what 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.530
 usually you will use always 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.870
 grip almost always stop it already 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.920
 many times and arica bones another thing 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.110
 I better have to change it but 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.570
 generally goes way as you see here to 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.560
 use simple to grip and here is a 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.110
 time and then I will do it again 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.300
 again again then then until 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.890
 that does not grip we stopped it simply 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.160
 with 1 or with the square as 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.830
 you want to call you already know how I 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.440
 he eats it stopped it several times 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.910
 so then here we have one time 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.260
 again here again three times the 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.480
 if not super combined in what I 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.310
 comment of the people has a tendency to 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.360
 Always make the same type of grip 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.610
 cge 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.069
 so a tip that I 'm going to tell you 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.469
 varying wineries then first the one 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:21.080
 start with square x triangles 52 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.370
 then the boasts of two hands that 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.080
 They are usually with a square and triangle 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.990
 Some 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.849
 or with X circles and well we are already 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.810
 here in this last fight of this 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.860
 episode with chasuble precisely the 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.870
 baddest player that I play with 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.250
 this occasion is the broken channel how 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.520
 you are going to see below and in the way 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.379
 more foolish this has to be said that it 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.930
 defends more difficult than in others this 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.669
 that is not you can laugh of myth what 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.949
 you want but in tekken tag tournament os 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.319
 the rolls stop a lot easier 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.669
 in the side passes especially and 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.889
 separate that they have the movements of 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.930
 invincibility because you have to 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:59.780
 make them interesting as you can see 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.270
 that you come running or whatever 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.460
 zeal aunt and well they take advantage in 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.659
 people who take advantage of that very much 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.300
 in the online 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:11.789
 it is easy to find people with 400 500 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.759
 victories and that practically only makes 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:16.680
 that and you win but good too 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:18.650
 my fault it is clear that he does not know 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.690
 counter it is like this 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.360
 that's one thing that I always 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.000
 I say when when they have like that 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.650
 Nordic that the other is a crush yet 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.020
 I do not know that guilt studies because I do not know 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.060
 defend but simply because it 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.560
 can defend voucher guys have already 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.210
 come messages from people that if I do not 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.520
 annoys many rays because if they bother me 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.490
 obviously but it is a thing that can be 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.889
 defend what is not usually 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.720
 used and good because that's what happens 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:48.039
 but it can be defended and easily worth 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.000
 so nothing guys to ghana and this turkey 

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:51.590
 I hope you think you liked the 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.419
 video that has helped you enough 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.840
 your comments and your little balls 

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:59.470
 and see you at the next show 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.470
 do not
