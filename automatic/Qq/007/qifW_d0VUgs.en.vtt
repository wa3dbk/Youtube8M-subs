00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
hacking can might as well commit suicide

hacking can might as well commit suicide
I<00:00:35.070> know<00:00:35.340> I've<00:00:35.520> been<00:00:35.610> using<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.210> dead<00:00:36.390> horse

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
I know I've been using the dead horse

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.930 
I know I've been using the dead horse
analogy<00:00:37.200> quite<00:00:37.469> often<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.730> not

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
analogy quite often but how can you not

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
analogy quite often but how can you not
well<00:00:39.480> how<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.200> let's<00:00:40.410> use<00:00:40.530> rotting

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
well how about this let's use rotting

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
well how about this let's use rotting
roadkill<00:00:41.460> racoon<00:00:41.850> instead<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.600> time<00:00:42.660> it's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
roadkill racoon instead this time it's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.590 
roadkill racoon instead this time it's
name<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.649> EMP<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.579> specifically<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.390> fact

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
name is EMP more specifically the fact

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.750 
name is EMP more specifically the fact
that<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> EMP<00:00:45.989> does<00:00:46.410> disable<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.280> shields

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that the EMP does disable all shields

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.910 
that the EMP does disable all shields
for<00:00:47.910> infantry<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.570> destroys<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:49.140> explosives

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
for infantry and destroys all explosives

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.979 
for infantry and destroys all explosives
as<00:00:50.100> well<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.430> deployable<00:00:50.760> beacon<00:00:51.360> finkies<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
as well as deployable beacon finkies and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.500 
as well as deployable beacon finkies and
most<00:00:52.320> importantly<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.129> drains<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.789> abilities

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
most importantly it drains all abilities

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.080 
most importantly it drains all abilities
energies<00:00:55.050> except<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.800> heavy<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.219> soft<00:00:56.640> time

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
energies except for heavy a soft time

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.549 
energies except for heavy a soft time
and<00:00:57.329> time<00:00:57.480> again<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:58.140> asked<00:00:58.289> developers

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and time again I have asked developers

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
and time again I have asked developers
to<00:00:59.039> explain<00:00:59.340> me<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> simple<00:01:00.090> thing<00:01:00.390> why

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
to explain me the simple thing why

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.869 
to explain me the simple thing why
hasn't<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.260> been<00:01:01.320> fixed<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.280> bug<00:01:02.550> or

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
hasn't it been fixed if it's a bug or

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.060 
hasn't it been fixed if it's a bug or
why<00:01:03.449> did<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.750> felt<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.229> heavy<00:01:04.439> needed<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
why did they felt that heavy needed that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.010 
why did they felt that heavy needed that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
in any of the patches so I still

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.280 
in any of the patches so I still

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
consider it to be a bug so devs

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.910 
consider it to be a bug so devs
why<00:01:16.560> why<00:01:17.250> why<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.600> still<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> game<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
why why why is it still in the game I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
why why why is it still in the game I
used<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> rely<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.880> EMP<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> help<00:01:21.630> me<00:01:21.780> deal

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
that anything that moves must be shot I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.520 
that anything that moves must be shot I
guess<00:03:24.030> that's<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.480> murican<00:03:24.900> way<00:03:25.230> nonetheless

this<00:03:25.920> bug<00:03:26.070> has<00:03:26.280> gotten<00:03:26.549> me<00:03:26.640> killed<00:03:26.880> too<00:03:27.090> many

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
this bug has gotten me killed too many

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.860 
this bug has gotten me killed too many
times

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
times

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.270 
times
oddly<00:03:28.140> enough<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:28.860> not<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.130> only

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
oddly enough this is not the only

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.069 
oddly enough this is not the only
problem<00:03:29.610> with<00:03:29.880> cloaking<00:03:30.329> see<00:03:30.510> sometimes<00:03:30.959> you

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
problem with cloaking see sometimes you

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.840 
problem with cloaking see sometimes you
uncloak<00:03:31.500> shoot<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.070> then<00:03:32.220> at<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.640> same<00:03:32.790> time

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
uncloak shoot and then at the same time

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.699 
uncloak shoot and then at the same time
you're<00:03:33.239> reloading<00:03:33.480> cloak<00:03:33.989> for<00:03:34.260> some<00:03:34.410> reason

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
you're reloading cloak for some reason

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.050 
you're reloading cloak for some reason
at<00:03:34.829> this<00:03:34.950> point<00:03:35.040> game<00:03:35.370> decides<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:35.940> are

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
at this point game decides that you are

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.819 
at this point game decides that you are
doing<00:03:36.299> too<00:03:36.450> many<00:03:36.660> open<00:03:36.810> fiends<00:03:37.170> at<00:03:37.350> once<00:03:37.560> and

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
doing too many open fiends at once and

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.470 
doing too many open fiends at once and
so<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.370> cloaks<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.820> while<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.329> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
so it on cloaks you while you are in the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.210 
so it on cloaks you while you are in the
middle<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.810> huge<00:03:40.140> crowd<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.590> enemies<00:03:40.709> who<00:03:41.190> are

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
middle of huge crowd of enemies who are

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.890 
middle of huge crowd of enemies who are
glad<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.760> make<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.940> barbecue<00:03:42.450> out<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.780> your

another<00:03:43.680> problem<00:03:43.980> with<00:03:44.220> cloaking<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.700> that

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
another problem with cloaking is that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.610 
another problem with cloaking is that
did<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.150> general<00:03:45.540> it's<00:03:45.690> very<00:03:45.870> slow<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.410> laggy

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
did in general it's very slow and laggy

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.530 
did in general it's very slow and laggy
to<00:03:47.010> say<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.340> least<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:47.970> know<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.360> all

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
to say the least and you know that all

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.210 
to say the least and you know that all
of<00:03:48.570> these<00:03:48.780> problems<00:03:49.049> were<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.769> game<00:03:49.920> since

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
of these problems were in the game since

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.920 
of these problems were in the game since
launch<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:50.820> all<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.000> can<00:03:51.299> say<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.900> has

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
launch so all I can say is that it has

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.350 
launch so all I can say is that it has
gotten<00:03:52.410> worse<00:03:52.769> finally<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.700> just<00:03:53.790> want<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.209> say

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
gotten worse finally I just want to say

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.150 
gotten worse finally I just want to say
that<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.690> not<00:03:54.870> fair<00:03:55.110> nor<00:03:55.350> balance<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
that it's not fair nor balance that the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.979 
that it's not fair nor balance that the
infiltrator<00:03:56.549> cannot<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.180> anything<00:03:57.480> against

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
infiltrator cannot do anything against

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.140 
infiltrator cannot do anything against

have explosive weapons or tools that
deal<00:04:02.220> enough<00:04:02.549> damage<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:03.000> be<00:04:03.239> effective<00:04:03.750> at

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
deal enough damage to be effective at

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.330 
deal enough damage to be effective at
this<00:04:04.019> point<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.320> have<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.530> mention<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:04.920> using

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
this point I have to mention that using

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.430 
this point I have to mention that using
explosive<00:04:05.910> darts<00:04:06.299> against<00:04:06.660> MBT<00:04:07.079> is<00:04:07.230> like

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
explosive darts against MBT is like

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.110 
explosive darts against MBT is like
throwing<00:04:07.680> shit<00:04:07.980> at<00:04:08.040> your<00:04:08.280> enemy<00:04:08.730> all<00:04:08.910> it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
throwing shit at your enemy all it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.400 
throwing shit at your enemy all it
doesn't<00:04:09.299> make<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.630> look<00:04:09.660> like<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.989> chimp<00:04:10.290> with

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
doesn't make you look like a chimp with

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.440 
doesn't make you look like a chimp with
few<00:04:10.680> chromosomes<00:04:11.220> missing<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:11.880> solution<00:04:12.180> is

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
few chromosomes missing so solution is

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.360 
few chromosomes missing so solution is
quite<00:04:12.630> obvious<00:04:13.079> give<00:04:13.320> hacking<00:04:13.739> some<00:04:13.950> real<00:04:14.130> use

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
quite obvious give hacking some real use

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.110 
quite obvious give hacking some real use
on<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.730> field

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
on the field

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.759 
on the field
why<00:04:15.269> not<00:04:15.510> vehicle<00:04:15.930> hacking<00:04:16.320> just<00:04:16.620> like

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
why not vehicle hacking just like

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.560 
why not vehicle hacking just like
implant<00:04:17.160> side<00:04:17.370> one<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:17.910> those<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.359> who

skull<00:04:20.789> you<00:04:21.060> can<00:04:21.269> sit<00:04:21.479> down<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.690> stop

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
skull you can sit down and stop

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.779 
skull you can sit down and stop
protesting<00:04:22.229> because<00:04:22.979> if<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.220> look<00:04:23.400> at<00:04:23.550> first

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
protesting because if you look at first

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.580 
protesting because if you look at first
incarnation<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.539> disability<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.200> can<00:04:25.440> see

incarnation of disability you can see

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.650 
incarnation of disability you can see
that<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.890> took<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.220> lot<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.520> time<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:27.060> skill<00:04:27.419> to

alarm would go off and you would

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.010

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
sight one you could still hack if you

sight one you could still hack if you
were<00:04:35.820> cloaked<00:04:36.240> but<00:04:36.600> in<00:04:36.720> plan<00:04:36.900> situ<00:04:37.140> let's<00:04:37.500> just

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
were cloaked but in plan situ let's just

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.590 
were cloaked but in plan situ let's just
have<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.890> decent<00:04:38.310> timer<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.790> hack<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.030> vehicle

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
have a decent timer to hack a vehicle

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.510 
have a decent timer to hack a vehicle
unless<00:04:39.780> it's<00:04:40.140> a<00:04:40.230> deployed<00:04:40.650> Sunday<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.400> you

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
unless it's a deployed Sunday and you

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.350 
unless it's a deployed Sunday and you
are<00:04:41.670> uncloaked

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
are uncloaked

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.970 
are uncloaked
and<00:04:42.480> that's<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.170> mean<00:04:43.380> come<00:04:43.590> on<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.830> will

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
and that's it I mean come on it will

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.530 
and that's it I mean come on it will
make<00:04:44.010> infiltrator<00:04:44.760> much<00:04:44.970> more<00:04:45.180> fun<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.510> play

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
make infiltrator much more fun to play

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.210 
make infiltrator much more fun to play
and<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> would<00:04:46.200> actually<00:04:46.620> do<00:04:46.800> some<00:04:47.040> real<00:04:47.190> good

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
and it would actually do some real good

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.600 
and it would actually do some real good
for<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.790> people<00:04:47.910> around<00:04:48.300> him
