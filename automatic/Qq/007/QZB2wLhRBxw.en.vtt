00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 okay let me give you a few examples 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.899
 for a fight 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.899
 how to make something concrete so 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.699
 SCO Angers first 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.289
 to draw green-white 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.240
 To pull Laura 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.239
 horror crash 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.239
 and red-white push 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.300
 so 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.300
 I want the green first 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.640
 say 'life possible 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.300
 both under drugs 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.560
 the conflict has come 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.560
 and it's bringing people to bad now 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.990
 Sermons oranges here and there 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.990
 in the blue over 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.390
 Premium will be for once 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.380
 high and meets there come under pressure 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.840
 And that's good 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930
 per child 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.710
 must be my first player 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.960
 who here 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 and the one behind here is already solved 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.230
 It was true that everyone was here 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.230
 Bremen and empty 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.380
 who here? 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.030
 I would need it now 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 the left the turn 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.170
 we did not have it twice 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.530
 I can go here in March 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 on the left those children hurry right born 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.980
 Cologne could but 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.210
 I can just turn my back too 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.130
 Jungwirth to be expected 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 and Alba too young 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580
 this view was to look for 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.870
 Put Jaap Timmer 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.870
 could on the left percentage points 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 I knew them here and explain them 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 Zellmann Access Care 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.599
 feels like this again in the middle of the left side 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.400
 here lives the hit 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 it is he caption 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.439
 and incendiary devices 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.659
 Quiet 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:16.819
 that's true 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.539
 we had this combination 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.549
 with Laura Schwensen 17 70 sticks and tricks 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.509
 and at some point he has 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:32.649
 and that is an early one reaching a green fastest Pierre 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.109
 priced 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.109
 easily in under ten seconds 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.519
 Philip Hook slips off 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.019
 where children are 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.179
 the cut off small block 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.179
 the request of course the well-known of the 1 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.439
 it was like that 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.399
 with no precious can 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.359
 here is this could 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.649
 the Greens will also be solved at the same time 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.189
 So their values ​​probably with 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.179
 says ünal 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:07.479
 Reduce 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.729
 by Brigitte Klante 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.079
 there lived 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.779

 Wengen OpenTV hands over Greens 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.769
 and 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.669
 OK 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.449
 this explanation was valid 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.789
 How to use the hammer blow Pozzo talented said 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:39.199
 per child 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.829
 this is the way forward 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.589
 to remove the day of the network 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.679
 what some feel good 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.589
 Do not drink like that or something special 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:51.339
 Frankfurt so separate 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.679
 Santa's sacrifice 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.259
 these second guitarists 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.259
 eight instead 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.569
 some came 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.629
 I have specified that 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.629
 how protects 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.009
 and really solved 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.259
 Peters highest goals put position 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.740
 nobody could be solved already 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.740
 are interesting here in a heap 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.449
 Fürth Frankfurt 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.199
 Minute as well 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.309

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:41.830
 already standard 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.279
 was born 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:45.159
 so unclear 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.249
 Tomczyk and Timo Kuhlmann 1 4 under Tel 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.249
 take a slide and tape 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.909
 and and Eurosport 2 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.300
 it does exist here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.080
 this brings 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.729
 you look at the cube that against me, although dominated as my first 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.979
 SOK as though notice it 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.979
 there take care of 0 8 percent 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.779
 around 100 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.300
 who lives here he here 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.409
 then they could bring 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.180
 and at the same time rose 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.990
 minute 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.009
 put together and 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.009
 put in the last two Grands Prix 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.069
 Gilboa does not believe Larry 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.889

 Criminal Court it terribly embarrassing 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.059
 I still do not have a really good attack 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.979
 second chalked unhappy 1 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.869
 That's it 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:07.629
 Violence belongs 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.619
 especially important 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.800
 Wanted morale and mood 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.749
 you do not need it 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.550
 and if you ever saw Beijing after the run the left side can 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 leaving the cross on the left side of Dell 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.289
