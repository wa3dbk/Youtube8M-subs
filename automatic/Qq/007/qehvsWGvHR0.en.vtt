00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.690
 we are here at the stand of welotec 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.320
 Oliver Wennmacher is here and will be with us 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:35.590
 tell something about the new cellars 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.960
 There was already the 90s of the 69 mm 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.680
 Keller has recently been introduced 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.900
 been 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.489
 but in the whole series of new more 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.980
 leaf springs there is also a whole 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.420
 a series of innovations that you can find here on the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.820
 jack bauer would like to introduce 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.730
 yes that's right we will the media 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 evo presented a good two months ago 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.680
 two weeks then the mini van evo being 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.660
 it was with mini fan evo so that the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.840
 previously available on the market motors 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.449
 straight designed by head consistently 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.400
 were on the old mini fan pro us 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.890
 Develop at the moment with the company has 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 Together new engines are optimized 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.600
 for the new mini fan evo and it 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.380
 there are now first prototypes one 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.060
 I also have here for example 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.740
 this is now a head 1 b 45 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.420
 specially made for the new mini wo 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.640
 there are even shorter now 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.110
 345 designs that are now in 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.789
 end stage that we measure the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.240
 partly the engines are still 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.280
 fine-tuned and then about from last 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.670
 september first active week available 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.619
 his 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.509
 we made such leaves 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.009
 which we partly already in ac 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.750
 network have shown times 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.490
 they are now being supplemented daily 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.250
 and then also shown on the homepage 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.130
 so that you already know what 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 there comes 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.640
 the range is relatively large 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.560
 also on motors mini fan has so synonymous 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.329
 a very wide range of uses we 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.369
 Today, many have asked me what 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.530
 himself wounded after three it was driven 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.200
 then, of course, today is europe four 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.030
 up to six it drives and quite intensifies 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.979
 We have noticed that for about two years 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.890
 the Hochwald area eight and ten 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.900
 cells are also interesting on the mini fans 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.180
 very good the services that is then 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.190
 of course, just like you 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.959
 never really hoped for it before 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.150
 it has been desired then it is already 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.489
 Huge thing besides a small cellar 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.620
 to get out there is so 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.780
 today beyond 2 kw and also the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.140
 shudder was 30 minutes earlier 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.500
 magic border jump in between 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.240
 yes, but over the engines there are 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.040
 yes, a whole bunch of others 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.180
 News on different sizes 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.250
 maybe you can add something to that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.600
 So yes say the mini fan there was yes 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.430
 always a smaller version 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.830
 with 66 mm 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.570
 the classic exchange in the cellar was 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.900
 also for foam waffle with 64 he im 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.200
 basement, cellar 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.850
 formerly called the hw 505 we have ours 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.030
 nomenclature yes changed a bit 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.010
 his name is now mini fan 66 I have 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.380
 now one in the hand is also 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.850
 available now so we deliver the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.230
 with all engines we also in the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.180
 classic mini fan deliver 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.459
 As a rule , takes about twelve percent 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.340
 less power on yes and a whole 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.780
 Let's take a look at models 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.820
 that are in the market can be equipped with it 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.800
 while smaller models has in the yes 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.050
 contrary to the mini fan a gfk coat 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.180
 and this gfk coat is essential 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.489
 thinner so it's basically 1 1 replacement 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.989
 But also with other engines has 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.660
 you have something else to report to us 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.000
 larger engines yes that concerns in the 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.500
 media 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.330
 we had that shortly in the times 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.730
 introductory video described that 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.140
 a timely 80 millimeter version of the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.100
 mini fans should come that is meanwhile 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.290
 available 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.290
 this in the cellar is so typical 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.780
 built in the abo 32 we deliver 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.269
 now in a 6s and 8s version 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.780
 Then it was like that after the show 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.660
 of the new media we are very strengthened 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.760
 customers got the 700 requests 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.180
 Engines in use therefore have motors 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.440
 with 39 mm diameter 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.180
 they fit plastically into ours 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.290
 existing housing not pure we have 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.450
 found a solution 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.720
 We now have a housing that 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.549
 also takes 39 millimeters of motors 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.390
 Do not have it in our shop yet 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.640
 is available 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.370
 So you can on request the media evo 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.350
 in the classic 89 variant as well 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.030
 with a housing get per 700 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.039
 motors can be installed 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.610
 We also offer this as a service 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.060
 on 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.710
 great then I thank you first for 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.410
 the information is always possible 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.840
 keep getting new extensions and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.070
 modifications to the motors are allowed 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.510
 be curious there will certainly 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.550
 the spectrum yes, as well as already 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.720
 mentioned in the future still to be extended 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.720
 Thank you! See you soon
