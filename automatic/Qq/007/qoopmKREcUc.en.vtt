00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
just by bumping into it so we've got

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.910 
just by bumping into it so we've got
some<00:00:39.510> lights<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:40.170> around<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.590> bottom<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
some lights going around the bottom of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.529 
some lights going around the bottom of
this<00:00:40.980> popcorn<00:00:41.489> popper<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:43.250> hop<00:00:44.250> burn<00:00:44.579> starts

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this popcorn popper and hop burn starts

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.779 
this popcorn popper and hop burn starts
popping<00:00:45.809> I'm<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.890> really<00:00:47.039> gonna<00:00:47.219> try<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> win

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
popping I'm not really gonna try to win

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.549 
popping I'm not really gonna try to win
but<00:00:48.710> just<00:00:49.710> show<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.750> how<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.930> works<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.469> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
but just show you how this works if you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.340 
but just show you how this works if you
go<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.949> red<00:00:53.250> ring<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> top<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
go on this red ring at the top and you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.549 
go on this red ring at the top and you
touch<00:00:55.590> pop<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.489> popcorn<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.840> will<00:00:58.050> kick<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
touch pop the popcorn they will kick you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.970 
touch pop the popcorn they will kick you
I<00:00:58.879> did<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.899> lot<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> popcorn

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
I did that because a lot of the popcorn

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
I did that because a lot of the popcorn
was<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.489> getting<00:01:02.789> stuck<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.539> top<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
was just getting stuck on this top of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.770 
was just getting stuck on this top of
red<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.640> sitting<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.720> I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
red and it was just sitting there so I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.039 
red and it was just sitting there so I
modified<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.220> would<00:01:08.900> kick<00:01:09.900> each

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
modified it so that they would kick each

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.240 
modified it so that they would kick each
other<00:01:10.229> around<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.770> game<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.070> little

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
other around so this game is a little

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.499 
other around so this game is a little
buggy<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.850> sometimes<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:17.299> popcorn<00:01:18.299> can

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
buggy because sometimes the popcorn can

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.719 
buggy because sometimes the popcorn can
fall<00:01:18.780> through<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.320> bowl<00:01:19.530> even<00:01:20.400> though<00:01:20.490> glass

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
fall through the bowl even though glass

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
fall through the bowl even though glass
walls<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.390> meaning<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.680> can't<00:01:22.890> actually

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
walls are on meaning you can't actually

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.149 
walls are on meaning you can't actually
go<00:01:23.580> outside<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.150> level<00:01:24.619> sometimes<00:01:25.619> stuff

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
go outside the level sometimes stuff

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.580 
go outside the level sometimes stuff
still<00:01:26.490> slips<00:01:26.790> through<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.200> sometimes

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
still slips through and so sometimes

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
still slips through and so sometimes
even<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> burnt<00:01:29.250> popcorn<00:01:29.460> falls<00:01:29.909> down<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
even the burnt popcorn falls down and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.649 
even the burnt popcorn falls down and
then<00:01:31.159> it's<00:01:32.159> impossible<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:35.540> I'll<00:01:36.540> show

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
then it's impossible to get so I'll show

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
then it's impossible to get so I'll show
you<00:01:36.689> how<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> programming<00:01:37.409> works<00:01:37.790> right

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you how the programming works right

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.450 
you how the programming works right
after<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.420> okay

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
after this okay

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.600 
after this okay
so<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.850> edit<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.070> this

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so if we go to edit you can see this

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.800 
so if we go to edit you can see this
black<00:01:44.939> path<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> top<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.340> where<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.810> light

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
black path at the top is where a light

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.179 
black path at the top is where a light
goes<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.290> them<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.560> drops<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> burnt

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
goes around them that drops the burnt

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.990 
goes around them that drops the burnt
popcorn<00:01:50.399> here's<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.119> burnt<00:01:51.329> popcorn<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.930> here

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
popcorn here's the burnt popcorn up here

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.840 
popcorn here's the burnt popcorn up here
I<00:01:54.000> use<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> light<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:56.430> this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
I use a light that was just because this

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
I use a light that was just because this
was<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> first<00:01:57.149> game<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.659> made<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.229> wouldn't<00:01:58.530> use

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
was the first game I made I wouldn't use

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.469 
was the first game I made I wouldn't use
the<00:01:58.770> light<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.159> cuz<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.939> only<00:02:00.090> use<00:02:00.270> eight

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the light now cuz you can only use eight

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.780 
the light now cuz you can only use eight
lights<00:02:00.719> per<00:02:01.140> level<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.670> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
lights per level so you really have to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.810 
lights per level so you really have to
save<00:02:02.969> those<00:02:04.250> there<00:02:05.250> are<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> bunch<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.610> lights

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
save those there are a bunch of lights

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.880 
save those there are a bunch of lights
down<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.780> are<00:02:06.840> create<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> bowl<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
down here that are create a bowl and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.339 
down here that are create a bowl and
these<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.819> follow<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.450> green<00:02:09.720> path<00:02:09.959> just

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
these just follow this green path just

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.410 
these just follow this green path just
to<00:02:10.530> give<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
to give it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.760 
to give it
a<00:02:11.770> hot<00:02:12.770> look<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.430> guess<00:02:14.590> here<00:02:15.590> are<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
a hot look I guess here are the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.290 
a hot look I guess here are the
creatable<00:02:16.190> popcorn<00:02:17.200> soccer<00:02:18.200> balls<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:20.150> can

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
creatable popcorn soccer balls you can

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.240 
creatable popcorn soccer balls you can
look<00:02:20.480> at<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.630> programming<00:02:21.440> here<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:21.950> these

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
look at the programming here so these

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.660 
look at the programming here so these
are<00:02:22.430> creative<00:02:22.790> all<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.680> every<00:02:24.680> five<00:02:25.250> seconds

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
are creative all and every five seconds

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.600 
are creative all and every five seconds
randomly<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.959> sometimes<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.830> shorter<00:02:28.459> than

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
randomly so sometimes it's shorter than

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.820 
randomly so sometimes it's shorter than
that<00:02:28.760> it'll<00:02:29.300> create<00:02:29.690> another<00:02:30.080> one<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.500> itself

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
that it'll create another one of itself

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.309 
that it'll create another one of itself
which<00:02:31.340> then<00:02:31.610> will<00:02:31.850> create<00:02:31.970> more<00:02:32.270> so<00:02:32.660> they

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
which then will create more so they

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.380 
which then will create more so they
really<00:02:33.739> do<00:02:33.890> increase<00:02:34.580> exponentially

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
really do increase exponentially

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.050 
really do increase exponentially
of<00:02:35.569> course<00:02:36.380> creatable<00:02:37.160> objects<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.819> can<00:02:37.880> only

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
of course creatable objects you can only

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.900 
of course creatable objects you can only
have<00:02:38.269> up<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.600> hundred<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.519> go<00:02:40.670> into<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
have up to a hundred if you go into the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.449 
have up to a hundred if you go into the
settings<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:42.019> can<00:02:42.170> see<00:02:42.410> max<00:02:42.830> created<00:02:43.310> as<00:02:43.430> a

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
settings you can see max created as a

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.699 
settings you can see max created as a
hundred<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.480> high<00:02:44.600> as<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.810> can<00:02:44.870> go<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.590> course

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
hundred so high as you can go of course

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.670 
hundred so high as you can go of course
I<00:02:45.890> could<00:02:46.069> add<00:02:46.250> more<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:47.269> make<00:02:47.780> another<00:02:48.080> you

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
I could add more just make another you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.380 
I could add more just make another you
know<00:02:48.769> ball<00:02:49.010> number<00:02:49.310> two<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.910> make<00:02:50.239> that

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
know ball number two and make that

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.170 
know ball number two and make that
creatable<00:02:50.840> but<00:02:51.470> 100<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.549> good<00:02:52.850> enough<00:02:53.120> for

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
creatable but 100 is good enough for

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.640 
creatable but 100 is good enough for
this<00:02:53.480> level<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.080> reason<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.350> started

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
this level so the reason I started

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.009 
this level so the reason I started
making<00:02:57.769> this<00:02:58.100> was<00:02:58.390> just<00:02:59.390> because<00:02:59.600> whenever<00:02:59.810> I

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
making this was just because whenever I

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.680 
making this was just because whenever I
get<00:03:00.170> some<00:03:00.860> level<00:03:01.280> editor<00:03:01.640> I'm<00:03:01.940> sure<00:03:02.540> I'm<00:03:02.660> not

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
get some level editor I'm sure I'm not

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.199 
get some level editor I'm sure I'm not
the<00:03:02.840> only<00:03:03.049> one<00:03:03.230> here<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:04.700> something<00:03:05.060> like

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
the only one here like something like

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.699 
the only one here like something like
Garry's<00:03:05.510> Mod<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.959> first<00:03:06.170> thing<00:03:06.319> I<00:03:06.410> want<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.560> do

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
Garry's Mod the first thing I want to do

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.530 
Garry's Mod the first thing I want to do
is<00:03:06.890> create<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.310> million<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.880> something<00:03:08.299> and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
is create a million of something and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.680 
is create a million of something and
just<00:03:08.780> have<00:03:09.140> them<00:03:09.380> fight<00:03:09.980> or<00:03:10.400> do<00:03:11.120> whatever<00:03:11.330> and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
just have them fight or do whatever and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.130 
just have them fight or do whatever and
so<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.950> created<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.840> would<00:03:14.989> just

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
so I created this so that it would just

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.410 
so I created this so that it would just
keep<00:03:15.470> creating<00:03:15.709> more<00:03:16.100> balls<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:19.390> then<00:03:20.390> I

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
keep creating more balls and then I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.500 
keep creating more balls and then I
decided<00:03:20.900> well<00:03:21.700> why<00:03:22.700> don't<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:23.269> make<00:03:23.450> a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
decided well why don't I just make a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.940 
decided well why don't I just make a
game<00:03:23.780> out<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.109> somehow<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:25.670> for<00:03:25.910> fun<00:03:26.090> and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
game out of it somehow just for fun and

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.050 
game out of it somehow just for fun and
I<00:03:27.950> wasn't<00:03:28.220> actually<00:03:28.489> expecting<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.910> make<00:03:29.000> a

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
I wasn't actually expecting to make a

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.270 
I wasn't actually expecting to make a
good<00:03:29.299> game<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.840> it's<00:03:30.230> not<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:32.320> whatever<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:34.250> I

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
good game and it's not but whatever so I

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.039 
good game and it's not but whatever so I
decided<00:03:34.790> well<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.269> know<00:03:35.390> could<00:03:35.690> make<00:03:35.840> some

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
decided well you know could make some

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.069 
decided well you know could make some
burnt<00:03:36.290> popcorn<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.100> then<00:03:37.220> add<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.510> dumb<00:03:38.780> story

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
burnt popcorn and then add a dumb story

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.530 
burnt popcorn and then add a dumb story
on<00:03:39.350> top<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.250> have<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:40.970> collect<00:03:41.299> the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
on top of it and have you collect the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.460 
on top of it and have you collect the
burnt<00:03:42.079> popcorn<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:44.870> made<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.290> burnt

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
burnt popcorn so I made the burnt

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.099 
burnt popcorn so I made the burnt
popcorn<00:03:45.910> disappear<00:03:46.910> from<00:03:47.269> this<00:03:47.480> light<00:03:47.780> out<00:03:48.019> of

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
popcorn disappear from this light out of

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.610 
popcorn disappear from this light out of
nowhere<00:03:48.829> which<00:03:49.220> doesn't<00:03:49.549> really<00:03:49.640> make<00:03:49.730> sense

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
nowhere which doesn't really make sense

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.199 
nowhere which doesn't really make sense
but<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:52.070> way<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.250> could<00:03:52.519> control<00:03:52.910> how<00:03:53.180> quickly

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
but that way I could control how quickly

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.930 
but that way I could control how quickly
the<00:03:54.049> burnt<00:03:54.230> popcorn<00:03:54.489> gets<00:03:55.489> generated

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
the burnt popcorn gets generated

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.199 
the burnt popcorn gets generated
actually<00:03:56.420> I'll<00:03:56.720> show<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.190> what<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.220> code<00:03:58.670> is

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
actually I'll show you what that code is

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.849 
actually I'll show you what that code is
really<00:03:59.989> simple<00:04:00.470> it's<00:04:01.010> just<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:02.859> changes

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
really simple it's just so this changes

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.460 
really simple it's just so this changes
how<00:04:03.920> quickly<00:04:04.370> it's<00:04:04.670> made<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.329> in<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.900> last<00:04:06.079> 20

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
how quickly it's made so in the last 20

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.410 
how quickly it's made so in the last 20
seconds<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.040> goes<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.459> last<00:04:07.670> page<00:04:07.970> you

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
seconds it goes to the last page you

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.259 
seconds it goes to the last page you
know<00:04:09.230> when<00:04:09.859> there's<00:04:10.010> 40<00:04:10.310> seconds<00:04:10.639> left<00:04:10.670> since

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
know when there's 40 seconds left since

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.220 
know when there's 40 seconds left since
it's<00:04:11.420> only<00:04:11.569> a<00:04:11.660> minute<00:04:11.810> long<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:14.049> this<00:04:15.049> just

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
it's only a minute long so this just

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.240 
it's only a minute long so this just
changes<00:04:15.739> how<00:04:16.609> quickly<00:04:16.930> they're<00:04:17.930> made

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
changes how quickly they're made

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.460 
changes how quickly they're made
and<00:04:20.560> so<00:04:21.560> there<00:04:21.829> it<00:04:21.920> is<00:04:22.070> then<00:04:22.610> goes<00:04:22.790> back<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:27.260> in

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
and so there it is then goes back so in

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.220 
and so there it is then goes back so in
the<00:04:27.500> last<00:04:27.770> 20<00:04:28.580> seconds<00:04:29.000> it's<00:04:29.510> every<00:04:29.990> two

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
the last 20 seconds it's every two

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.310 
the last 20 seconds it's every two
seconds<00:04:30.650> one<00:04:30.950> is<00:04:31.100> made<00:04:31.510> three<00:04:32.510> seconds<00:04:33.110> five

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
seconds one is made three seconds five

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.870 
seconds one is made three seconds five
seconds<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:35.980> was<00:04:36.980> thinking<00:04:37.310> about<00:04:37.400> making<00:04:37.640> it

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
seconds I was thinking about making it

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.400 
seconds I was thinking about making it
so<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.590> if<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.920> popcorn<00:04:40.340> stayed<00:04:40.970> on<00:04:41.540> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
so that if the popcorn stayed on the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.260 
so that if the popcorn stayed on the
heating<00:04:42.950> element<00:04:43.340> or<00:04:43.430> whatever<00:04:43.730> in<00:04:44.060> the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
heating element or whatever in the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.050 
heating element or whatever in the
middle<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.780> this<00:04:44.990> bowl<00:04:45.520> if<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.790> stayed

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
middle of the this bowl if it stayed

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.820 
middle of the this bowl if it stayed
there<00:04:47.240> too<00:04:47.390> long<00:04:47.570> then<00:04:47.930> it<00:04:47.960> would<00:04:48.140> turn<00:04:48.380> into<00:04:48.440> a

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
there too long then it would turn into a

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.700 
there too long then it would turn into a
a<00:04:49.540> burnt<00:04:50.540> popcorn<00:04:50.780> ball<00:04:51.170> which<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.590> could

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
a burnt popcorn ball which you could

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.100 
a burnt popcorn ball which you could
easily<00:04:51.740> do<00:04:52.280> just<00:04:53.060> have<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.390> disappear<00:04:53.600> and

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
easily do just have it disappear and

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.470 
easily do just have it disappear and
then<00:04:54.200> create<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> burnt<00:04:54.980> one<00:04:55.160> but<00:04:55.880> I<00:04:55.910> figured

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
then create a burnt one but I figured

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.060 
then create a burnt one but I figured
that<00:04:56.660> wouldn't<00:04:56.870> really<00:04:57.020> be<00:04:57.350> very<00:04:57.680> much<00:04:57.860> fun

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
that wouldn't really be very much fun

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.710 
that wouldn't really be very much fun
because<00:04:58.430> then<00:04:58.580> you<00:04:58.730> just<00:04:58.970> be<00:04:59.090> sitting<00:04:59.510> here

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
because then you just be sitting here

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.690 
because then you just be sitting here
kicking<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.590> popcorn<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.160> entire<00:05:01.430> time

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
kicking the popcorn the entire time

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.690 
kicking the popcorn the entire time
instead<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.270> actually<00:05:02.870> trying<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.400> go<00:05:04.400> around

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
instead of actually trying to go around

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:12.550 
instead of actually trying to go around
the<00:05:04.790> outside<00:05:07.450> so<00:05:09.340> that<00:05:10.340> is<00:05:10.730> about<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:11.440> if<00:05:12.440> you
