00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.750
 raymond atteveld goes with 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.160
 the system becomes a part of this smoothness 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.459
 and 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:10.269
 I made it up the street 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.310
 2005 had such a top year after the point of view was of course November 12 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.529
 in ahoy rotterdam 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.950
 and we also have the DVD 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.900
 brought out 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.749
 nothing has been done either 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.159
 let me guess program that still 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.489
 and that is now almost twenty countries 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.489
 listen to on fm via satellite and internet 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.970
 so I have not achieved that either 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.970
 and before it is already busy with one 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.150
 the new album from August 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.650
 and also new material a number of patrick helmets is also still of 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.190
 I've done my life 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 he is combined and constantly striving for 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.200
 and a new compilation and five 2006 and you also have when you are not in work 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.200
 they already released you that was 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.030
 waters 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.040
 in addition to how a lock of it so far 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.880
 very good that year the income I find then you know it does but 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.110
 I may even clapped now 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.110
 that I am even nominated for a child of 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.870
 it became a party 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.460
 hook it is really very fresh from it 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.390
 can you tell something about how it always came about and you and the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.170
 development 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.110
 and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.920
 years your personal development of recent times and maybe it will be too 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.110
 the strong for orange on the album 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.220
 and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.860
 well actually i was i started with shippers right after sex but sex is 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.070
 artist album 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.290
 and i also think if you 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.980
 it turns orange that you are increasingly looking for it, but sometimes you also hire who it is 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.270
 make things a lot more difficult, of course I had very easy 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.049
 12 points tracks in sudan the rijswijk 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.399
 to put on the album that all such pieces have been lucrative but 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.100
 just 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.770
 nice same with me can collect but but yes I still want one 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.340
 accept some challenges 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.619
 So basically every track is just a different story 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.499
 So a few times I have proven an intermediate score services them too 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:01.350
 All to do with Nadia Line Hamza Journey from Ajax to New York A Tractor 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.590
 included 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.180
 the new track with furniture in scotland in navigating tracks at home 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.489
 it is a very varied album, people say it said to my early years 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.179
 for the illegal hijacking of burton one 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.449
 really a pure tres album expected 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.330
 and 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.010
 but now i'm still running six months later it's not funny that seit 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.719
 biggest compliment you can get 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.569
 I have taken a lot of risk by bringing out the reverb 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.569
 but I am very satisfied with it myself, it is the most important thing 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.099
 the goal is, for example, if you yourself are not too high up on someone with the 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.500
 tapuit on the counter with the total specialty 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.080
 How can you also exchange a good keeper the Twente man 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.629
 in the church hall it was someone who he really translated calling how is that yes that is 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.979
 very difficult but who did not welcome each other crazy enough because it 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:51.409
 so something different for those people they often cis through it will 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.519
 I think it's good or bad but I think it's going to say something 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.870
 Went away from a year later in the evening so you must go through that you are crazy 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.249
 jan beens think that chrome me another project at home this often lescott 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:03.519
 fans can read the roaring costs 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.869
 and 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:09.029
 he had an idea in one place of the theme as far as he plays in 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.229
 Serbia too crazy 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.229
 own theme that is now almost two years ago 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.249
 Immediately it was actually saved with spouts and sun 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.569
 rainy sunday afternoon literally 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.139
 and i had found a way with him and gave talitha a go 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.829
 matter of being made of ajax 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.519
 nice of the section watching what happens with jan van maasakkers himself not at 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.989
 and then that was just in the week that I booked for his victory where last year 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:34.779
 and then and 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:38.359
 when one of the boring ideas maybe the sixth place is true 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.079
 or they were all who want to make 66 or just the one and the voter 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.439
 to the final battle 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.040
 I tell him that kind of stitches are ready so almelo is important to get one 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.239
 bring new ones 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.219
 all right 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.379
 so I was really literal then 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.180
 then I caught them knowing you and twenty minutes later it got up 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.180
 Haiti headquarters to make the track even inflow 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:58.729
 all right 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.119
 then you know 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.819
 this also written texts 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.909
 I make up for the first time I do not agree with this me 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.339
 I am in tenth place but 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.410
 in particular the man could stand a ban 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.320
 I did not see and hear the cat or dog racks and martin 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.160
 hagens of mayors 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.879
 I am heavily undervalued by the way, a Dutch band 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.539
 di rupo was my home because number is in sight is also crazy 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.339
 3 they go whose is it would get up swaters he was kind of 

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:29.110
 has now succeeded again 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.849
 and i hear there is a meteorite words emerged when i think set 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.889
 so recticel is on the bike that you placed on mission in one go 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.710
 features such as the sing 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.150
 and there the owner of a son made this because and then a chance 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.169
 the premium comes in europe league cup are talking about 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.710
 yes i could miss it abroad so there weren't women there 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.050
 be interested in having your DJ band say goodbye if I go to club 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.039
 do not recognize dancing but what I do not have m 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.189
 and still find them exciting 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.139
 and all about the errors in the context of the context of the second-in-one 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.550
 disks something happens to things 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.729
 that was at the end of the day of each other's chain of mostly fucking hell we 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.060
 have really sunk steps 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.810
 yesterday then it was not at all that we were going to release or but we 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.550
 just wanted 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.789
 And that's not the most important thing I want to say 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.889
 it's just about making music fun 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.639
 I can send those who want to tell them yes the plans this a person with a sisser 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.270
 will eman that is just 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.460
 You just see that you learn from fun that's just and experience with the whole 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.339
 You would simply have to live with people living in a certain neighborhood 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:29.520
 the congolese of eck born out of a fight just have fun 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.449
 are also called 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.969
 yes I know that I hope to rent 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.249
 jfk one 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.349
 what do you think of the statement that twence webshops has a hole in the netherlands 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:40.240
 how 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.240
 I think I have proven otherwise 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.479
 This is definitely not the case 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.639
 she looks 18 all releases worth all of course in the Netherlands too 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.649
 business 2x releases on the holocaust and the poker players first place croo 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.599
 but we actually live on twence and if you were russians, number one was sold 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.389
 already regret this with us 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.119
 nominated as the best consequence for the school leader and she will be 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.239
 camera that program is very good to ride on version I also see the 

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:13.259
 xf and 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.259
 now completely sold out November 12 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.400
 Yes 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.319
 I really don't notice it at all 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.319
 but well maybe that's just doing my vision 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.029
 from my perception is to read the more alive than ever but maybe see 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:30.029
 I'm wrong 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.529
 Jeez train to jump a journey through different music streams like 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:38.309
 I 9 if I Nov. 9 Novum trend that users always mind everyone 

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:39.499
 been 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.559
 that is two seasons it is the collective name for different species 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.860
 music and also that classical one 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.919
 yes for ammunition 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.169
 maybe that would be a bit of the extinction 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:55.319
 I think that disagreement will continue it's just one it's universal 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.919
 music trends it is also proven 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.509
 the 2000 refining was again with a 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:00.990
 England 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.990
 but that will be the extension of arches back to back 

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:08.099
 such an extension of what I intend to do with england klinkenberg 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.660
 ted braking distance with the three podium stood it is already a big mountain this 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.949
 more a man of the way of the buttons 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:21.099
 remy I already knew that she is it decides it's the stage at 8 it's more 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:23.029
 a kind of 

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:26.799
 yes it is again it is very different you know one time most ethical it 

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:31.229
 all from a too big show and a big spectacle and the closing is more 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.919
 laugh at work 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.560
 yes really a bit there quite a guest role to it and other two are not well off 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.719
 to close it is it is something else again something new I know that too 

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:44.760
 can do another three-hour broadcast or put in half-an-hour in ahoy 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.379
 this is something very different from that 

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:49.379
 it just gives a cake and discovered back with remy the crazy thing is that 

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.959
 quite a different one so I am playing in dance music but that is what we want 

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:55.179
 each other can only strengthen dining 

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:58.419
 and i just have wise respect for those guys are poor yes i do for my 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:07:59.330
 favorite product 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.760
 and it is also nicely set 

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.110
 yes it is super 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.610
 always look alone with remy roland he can i also saw good friends 

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.339
 bus 

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:09.449
 shameful with those guys 

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:13.100
 or like he the news though for 20 euros a month
