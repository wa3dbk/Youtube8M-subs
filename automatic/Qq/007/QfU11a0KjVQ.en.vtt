time actually do have my little

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.500 
time actually do have my little
measuring<00:03:12.130> tape<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.730> can<00:03:12.970> tell<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.269> how

measuring tape so I can tell you how

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.660 
measuring tape so I can tell you how
tall<00:03:13.870> he<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.110> but<00:03:14.410> he<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.620> crouching<00:03:15.190> down<00:03:15.220> so

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
tall he is but he is crouching down so

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.890 
tall he is but he is crouching down so
of<00:03:15.790> course<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.239> not<00:03:16.330> gonna<00:03:16.450> be<00:03:16.630> like<00:03:16.750> I'm

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
of course it's not gonna be like I'm

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.660 
of course it's not gonna be like I'm
standing<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:18.480> let's<00:03:19.480> measure<00:03:20.200> him<00:03:20.590> with<00:03:21.519> the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
standing so let's measure him with the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.750 
standing so let's measure him with the
base<00:03:21.910> on<00:03:22.299> he<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.850> little<00:03:24.850> 5<00:03:25.209> inches<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:26.760> then

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
base on he is little 5 inches and then

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.620 
base on he is little 5 inches and then
with<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.780> base<00:03:28.959> off<00:03:29.700> about<00:03:30.700> 5<00:03:30.940> inches<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.450> think

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
with the base off about 5 inches I think

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.699 
with the base off about 5 inches I think
of<00:03:32.019> tiny<00:03:32.380> like<00:03:32.769> right<00:03:33.010> about<00:03:33.220> 5<00:03:33.430> inches<00:03:33.760> so

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
of tiny like right about 5 inches so

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.180 
of tiny like right about 5 inches so
that's<00:03:35.709> how<00:03:35.980> big<00:03:36.220> these<00:03:36.370> figures<00:03:36.730> are<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:38.440> I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
that's how big these figures are and I

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.070 
that's how big these figures are and I
