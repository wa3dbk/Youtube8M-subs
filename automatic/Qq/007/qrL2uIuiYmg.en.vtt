00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
off as a skin personally I don't think

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.330 
off as a skin personally I don't think
so<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.659> mean<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.109> think<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.739> smart<00:02:29.159> move

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
so I mean I think this is a smart move

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.069 
so I mean I think this is a smart move
to<00:02:29.400> include<00:02:29.909> lucena<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.719> game<00:02:30.900> without

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
to include lucena in the game without

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.500 
to include lucena in the game without
her<00:02:31.469> being<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.859> Martha<00:02:32.340> alternate<00:02:32.849> costume<00:02:33.329> I

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
her being a Martha alternate costume I

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.470 
her being a Martha alternate costume I
don't<00:02:34.230> think<00:02:34.319> alternate<00:02:35.010> costumes<00:02:35.519> should<00:02:36.209> be

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
don't think alternate costumes should be

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.720 
don't think alternate costumes should be

doesn't<00:03:39.120> look<00:03:39.359> like<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.870> going<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.049> be<00:03:40.229> as

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729 
doesn't look like it's going to be as

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.270 
doesn't look like it's going to be as

maybe even her idle animation it could

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.360 
maybe even her idle animation it could
