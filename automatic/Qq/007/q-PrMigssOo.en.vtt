00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.560

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.630
 for you manage that the powerful 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.250
 checkout team sunn they from l'orÃ©al 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.780
 I mean I use regularly 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 lightening sprays but this 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.490
 jelly she is divine really we can 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.869
 do the effect you want so a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 effect but at tie and dye 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.830
 clarifications on all 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.000
 hair is like you want more 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.699
 she is really very easy to use 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.769
 what the effect is progressive so you 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.630
 can not miss you good I you 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.309
 lets see the deist my hair before 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.309
 the application of the beautiful lightening 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.460
 the age and the san that applies on the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.170
 dry hair and smile 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.760
 personally I prefer to do it on 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 hair wrung out because in fact the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.820
 formula is so optical so when 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.660
 I'm going to my hair with a dryer 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 hair 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.989
 enlightenment will be more 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.730
 it's gone for the application then 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.840
 personally I want to have an effect 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.820
 bright in my hair 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.770
 so I'm going to apply some fine 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.329
 wick to the root and accent and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.670
 especially down it comes up in 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.949
 a title like that I put a little bit 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.449
 in the hands we can do it 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.020
 also by comb personally I 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.600
 am more textbook and so I come 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.840
 to apply on a few strands rather 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.109
 film from root to slope 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.109
 aouch aouch 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.730
 and here is once everything is spread 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:31.440
 have dry well with the dry to 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:34.610
 temperature a bit high but I 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.610
 want after the first application 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.250
 after the second application 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.800
 my hair after the third 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.800
 application 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.200
 to conclude I can really say that 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.000
 this product that the assistant there is 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.380
 better than I tested after three 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.720
 applications I have the hair they 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.270
 are really where the effect really really 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.700
 progressive so we can not miss 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.380
 more use is super easy so 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.340
 I really recommend it anyway 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.020

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.399
