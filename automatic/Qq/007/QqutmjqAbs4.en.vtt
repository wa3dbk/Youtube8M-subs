this<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.550> we'll<00:00:41.700> attach<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> chains

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this is how we'll attach the chains

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.630 
this is how we'll attach the chains
around<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> tire<00:00:43.040> we<00:00:44.040> also<00:00:44.219> want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> make

around the tire we also want to make

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
around the tire we also want to make
sure<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.030> each<00:00:45.180> cross<00:00:45.510> piece<00:00:45.809> has<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.710> hook

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
sure that each cross piece has the hook

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.400 
sure that each cross piece has the hook
facing<00:00:47.129> away<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.850> tire<00:00:48.260> we'll<00:00:49.260> lay<00:00:49.379> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
recommended that you use these

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.710 
recommended that you use these
tensioners<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> chains<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.299> tensioner

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
tensioners with the chains the tensioner

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.060 
tensioners with the chains the tensioner
will<00:01:33.869> help<00:01:34.020> pull<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> chain<00:01:34.530> tight<00:01:34.770> around

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
will help pull the chain tight around

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950 
will help pull the chain tight around
the<00:01:35.159> tire<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:36.119> make<00:01:36.270> sure<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> there's<00:01:36.810> no

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the tire to make sure that there's no

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.679 
the tire to make sure that there's no
slipping<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.680> movement<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> chain<00:01:38.939> it
