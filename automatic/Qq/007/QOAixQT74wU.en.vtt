 in the open ocean 11 kilometers from 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.230
 coast of Honolulu underwater photographer 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.510
 yo apple shot his girlfriend lizu 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.849
 castello experienced divers entered into 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.300
 contact with a small flock of ordinary 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.219
 green 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.750
 we only used respiratory 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.300
 handset because when you use 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.609
 scuba frighten air bubbles from him 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.769
 whales and dolphins 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 when they themselves swum up to me with being very 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.060
 close i stopped at that moment i 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.070
 understood that they are not afraid of us did not come to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 the fact that I began to iron and is there a camera 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.910
 caught an incredible moment when life 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.910
 liza was suddenly at risk 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.690
 which she caressed her grabbed 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.420
 leg and spun 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.540
 ki immediately let her go but all the horror 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.170
 just started he turned grabbed 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.120
 me by the ankle and began to dive and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.059
 then I understood so I can not breathe 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.890
 whether trying desperately to catch her in 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.309
 lens and detects and and deep under 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.050
 water too deep 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.940
 it took me a few seconds but 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.880
 then I realized that she was actually 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.340
 in the mouth of the whale I really thought that 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.110
 probably lisa will die 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.740
 ahead when the whale began to climb 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.580
 surface 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.200
 but maybe everything is too late and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.119
 then the next thing I remember was 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.000
 on the surface and just breathed in 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.770
 socium forever air I was alive in 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.350
 as a result she was not very strong 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.320
 stripped leg rest she was whole and 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.259
 unscathed I was afraid to drown it 1 me 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.759
 scared the most 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.520
 why is this external peace giant 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.380
 made an attack in a marine aquarium 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.970
 the world in san diego beat hoffman directs 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.950
 training least two single 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.430
 ordinary performances 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.680
 grint 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.939
 he analyzes video footage carefully 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.780
 looking for warning signals 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.970
 who may have missed lying toko 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.280
 on straddled him as if it were a horse is 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.229
 bad go go animal spank again 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.479
 on the surface of the water she makes it clear that 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.790
 does not want to have more with this case 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.310
 says he tries to communicate asks 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.929
 leave him alone 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.030
 Bill believes that the behavior of China 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.519
 changed when Lisa did not sail away 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.200
 the side 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.030
 In general, there are several reasons why 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.350
 animals reacting in a similar way 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.450
 maybe they felt threatened 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.090
 maybe there were their cubs in the area 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.340
 maybe this is rivalry for the right to 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.019
 territory or something else 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.390
 alarmed or what they didn't want to have 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.340
 case according to bella almost fatal 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.380
 The interaction of the lisa with the whale is undeniable 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.870
 proves why the law on the protection of marine 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.480
 mammals forbids close contact 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.770
 man with these creatures 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.420
 decoding 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.670
 you know she was lucky she stayed alive 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.800
 you could be an animal of this size 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.290
 easy to kill or if you want it 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.720
 animal is an enormous force and it is easy 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.180
 can poison you if you wish and we 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.290
 should respect they need to watch 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.360
 them at a distance 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.100
 someone might try to forget 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.990
 Such underwater tests but Liza decided 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.050
 that this experience must necessarily 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.750
 leave my mark i went and did 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.580
 know the fat on your ankle 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.040
 about this case i really appreciate that 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.550
 spent time with him and want to save 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.550
 these memories
