 once finished what is the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.180
 installation in both law and the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.560
 device will restart we hope that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.270
 reboot to load the rom for 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.170
 first time or it will take as everyone knows 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.170
 5 to 10 minutes 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.890
 has configured installed the broken 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.090
 this way we go where it says 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.250
 applications we go right 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.630
 adjustments and we move where it says 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.070
 towards the device as we can 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.560
 hire we have the android version 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.480
 4.4 point four tracks for the nostre 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.640
 You could say it's a contribution 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.500
 of 14 of the rom for this device 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.570
 the rom works very well does not 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.490
 we found serious errors and so 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.590
 Can be used for daily account 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.900
 with some adjustments or some 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 characteristics of no 4 but the truth 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.680
 in scandalize it will not work anymore 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.720
 that the device does not have that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.340
 characteristic but if we can modify 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.680
 what is the visual style that the 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.450
 14 on this device can be 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.890
 use the rom without any problem for 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.970
 daily use we can add what 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.190
 they are quick adjustments 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.760
 remember that there are only nine and 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.170
 right now we have a 5 if we do not look 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.850
 now what the application canon 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.250
 because the applications that come are the 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.610
 most needed in the included the 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.060
 developer what is the launcher like 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.099
 can observe 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.950
 it works very fluid and what are the 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:15.180
 settings like see here 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.950
 are the wolves the wallpapers of 94 the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.320
 widgets that depend on applications 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.120
 that we have installed and the issues that 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.580
 they have added to the rom we can also 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.850
 modify the start settings on 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.830
 transition effect between windows 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.510
 now I will show you what is the bar 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.580
 been as you can observe the some 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.290
 functions that we have seen in something 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.790
 other rom that we have installed in 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.920
 different devices that are 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.190
 working in this community the section 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.780
 of call as you can see is equal to us 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.790
 we go where the camera 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.980
 the camera works correctly 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.870
 modes that this camera brings in the camera 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.820
 No 3 stock so it's not going to 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.630
 have no problem when it comes to 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.130
 use it 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.290
 now we move to the administrator 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.570
 of tasks as you can observe works 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.940
 correctly a little faster than the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.919
 that the new 4 can not see we have 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.930
 life used only we have 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.580
 finalizing all that liberates us hunger 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.770
 which is the ram memory this device 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.900
 works with this rom very well I 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.100

 comparative in the three not four see if 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.650
