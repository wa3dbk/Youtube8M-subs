00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.570
 My name is Didi Mueller and I live in Oakland, California. 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:14.180
 One of the things that happened when I first came to Berkeley in 1964 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.700
 I just met someone who would be my future husband, and I fell in love with it. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.860
 He came from Europe with a bicycle. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.010
 It was a ten-speed bike, but I could not believe it. 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.690
 I told him. 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.690
 Help him learn to ride a 10-speed bike. 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.940
 Together we started working in Peace Corps from Iran and finished the Corps in Nigeria. 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.570
 The bike was a means of transportation for us. We used bicycles in Nigeria and India. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.980
 Wherever we lived, we took our bikes wherever we went. 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.100
 The nearest town was 11 kilometers away. 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.600
 When I heard about AIDS Ride in California, I felt my affection for the bicycle was burning again. 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.900
 I said this. "This is an amazing and meaningful challenge." 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.040
 I saw my son and said: "My mother will be there." My son said, "I'll be with my mother." 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.660
 This is the beginning of the bike began to fall into motion. 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.500
 We have been cycling for two years from 2000 to 2001. It was a great experience. 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.180
 I participated in Centauri ride (160km) called Primavera last weekend. 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.410
 Some of my friends asked, "Have you been alone?" "Well ... I was with 2,000 people! I did not feel alone." 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.880
 I have met a lot of really nice people. 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.860
 Women's riders who love their health 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.700
 I did not shout, I enjoyed riding. 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.250
 This riding knows what I want to do 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.610
 I made it to push on my body. 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.780
 I like that challenge and want to know the limit that I can make. 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.560
 And at the top of the hill, or finishing the day 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.480
 I am beautiful and proud to be immersed in bicycles and enjoying myself.
