00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.539
 It is said that in the 13th century in the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.939
 today corresponds to the Czech republic 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.369
 the monk was sentenced to death by 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.830
 to commit a serious infringement of the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.170
 rules of the monastery where he lived as 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.230
 punishment the priest would be walled 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.809
 I live in a room to escape the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.629
 conviction a monk decided to make a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.420
 with his superiors, proposing that the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.269
 his crime was forgiven in exchange for 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.300
 he produced a copy of the bible and 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.260
 many other hand-written 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.840
 one night 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.110
 such a feat these days would already be 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.559
 very difficult to achieve this with all 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.060
 available technology so just imagine 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.580
 in the 13th century 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.520
 when everything was done by candlelight and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.130
 with the use of only ink and scrolls 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.190
 the superiors agreed with the proposal 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.649
 of the monk because if he did not 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.850
 I agreed what was obvious he would be 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.250
 sentenced 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.860
 but if the promised material were produced 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.099
 in such a short time it would be a miracle 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.410
 which in turn attracted thousands of 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:34.110
 pilgrims and lots of money for a 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.720
 monastery however a monk logo 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.259
 realized that he could never finish 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.660
 the task at which it was proposed 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.330
 deciding to make the unthinkable a covenant 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.789
 with the devil for his services 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.700
 the devil not only asked the soul of the monk 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.940
 in exchange for the book but also demanded that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.399
 A scary and huge portrait your flight 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.220
 was included in the work the next day 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.069
 As promised the book was ready. 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.860
 the priest was forgiven and the volume 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.500
 was known as 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.410
 Giant Book or Devil's Bible 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.890
 The book is more than 90 centimeters 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.080
 height of more than 50 in width beyond 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.709
 measuring more than 20 centimeters 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.860
 thickness and weigh more than 75 pounds 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.260
 is the largest medieval manuscript of 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.319
 that you have news and your pages are 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.650
 made of calf skin and the donkey 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.319
 bible beyond the famous portrait of the evil one 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.689
 also contains the new and the old testament 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.150
 as well as a calendar medical texts 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.030
 and an old encyclopedia 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.250
 however several pages disappeared 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.010
 some believe that the texts that 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.890
 missing information contained sinister 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.030
 too much to read and so they were 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.980
 removed 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.980
 in addition during their various 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.170
 centuries of existence, the codex you say 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.810
 changed hands several times and even 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.150
 survived with some irreparable damage 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.519
 to the fire which could also 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.849
 explain the disappearance of some of 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.639
 their pages according to experts 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.370
 really seems to have been written 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.680
 by a single person but instead of being 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.230
 produced in just one night the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.019
 skillful writer must have taken more 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.540
 20 years to complete the work 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.530
 in addition a small dedication 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.260
 brothers or sister or the inmate or 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.420
 still sister or in clause side at the end 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.150
 of the manuscript also gives some clues 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.120
 about the alleged conviction of the monk 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.790
 so the more likely it is that the priest 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.400
 has actually been convicted or is 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.620
 sentenced to closure and not be 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.930
 immured for life to 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.069
 dedicate fully to the production of 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.690
 book today the bible of the devil meets 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.510
