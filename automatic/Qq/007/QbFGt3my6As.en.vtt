00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.510
 the arrival of the dea causes that all 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.549
 women make us want to leave 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.590
 shopping and then you go to stores and 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.380
 buy the half pillage and then buy the 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.000
 sweater quoted and the shirt and pants and 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.230
 when you come to see you have a lot of 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.810
 things that then where you put them 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.089
 vielka activities but for that we have 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.160
 this chest of drawers that we are going to transform 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:29.259
 applying a gradient in all 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.029
 jaime drawers in bed to see how pretty 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.340
 the face if I do not doubt it apart is super 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.989
 and super come, go and work them and 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.989
 hands to work that's all 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.650
 make this chest of drawers is very easy and only 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.400
 has three stages first we prepare the 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.920
 color then we disassembled the drawer and we 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.260
 we put to paint now let's do the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.420
 my favorite part is preparing the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.940
 colors and for that I'll explain 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.970
 what is the secret to achieve a good 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.220
 basically degrade what we do is 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.339
 count the number of drawers you have 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.070
 our furniture in this case we have 6 and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.640
 that's why I have here my 6 bowls for 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.450
 prepare the paint so eye the key 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.630
 is in the proportions we are going to put 6 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.110
 tablespoons of paint in each bowl the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.180
 proportions change according to the drawer 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.369
 the painting that we use in this case is 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.440
 Latex or vinyl paint from which 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.320
 I find in any pinturerÃ­a 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.110
 I chose a tone that is very fashionable that 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.600
 it's an aqua blue so now we're going to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.030
 prepare the first color that is the most 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.729
 intense 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.760
 for that with our color we have 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.299
 let's put 6 tablespoons is like a 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.299
 cooking recipe 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.370
 to a 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.080
 two 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 3. 4 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.099
 5 and 6 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.720
 obviously in this case the color is pure 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.930
 because that's what we want is the tone 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.239
 darker now let's go to our second 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.849
 bowl that is going to be a little degraded 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.090
 for that we are going to put 5 tablespoons of 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:28.720
 this color and one of white so 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.720
 we have 1 2 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.000
 and 5 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.430
 and now our sixth spoonful is going to be 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.430
 one of white 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.700
 they are fixed as the color is getting 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.920
 increasingly clear 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.250
 It's a very subtle change but here we have 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.069
 the most intense tone and here one more tone 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.260
 so we're going to be preparing in 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.099
 the other balls always with 6 tablespoons 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.099
 totals 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.659
 and 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.190
 plus 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.470
 ready and we have our grade and 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.210
 as you can see we have a rainbow of 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.030
 Same color that looks very nice 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.540
 now we are going to disassemble the drawers for 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.730
 painting to disarm it is very easy just 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.730
 we have to remove the leaf shooters 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.410
 hillsides in this case the breast is about 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.550
 remove 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:59.050
 the nut and take it out maybe you need 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.420
 some tool but most are 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.510
 very easy, we are going to set it aside because this 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.150
 we want to leave it white so that it remains 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.750
 in contrast to the chest of drawers and now to 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.750
 paint 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:17.680
 for this project we use some brushes 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.109
 which are of will be very smooth so the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.699
 brush is not noticeable and I recommend 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.669
 always when you're working with 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.889
 wood paint in the direction of the grain 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.430
 this way again you do not notice the 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.430
 brush strokes 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.740
 yes 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.330
 and ready 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.070
 we finished our first drawer and 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.820
 Now we do the same with the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.820
 next 5 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.789
 ready we have where to store clothes
