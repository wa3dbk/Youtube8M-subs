00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.029
 Today show how the skin in rosacea 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.439
 is optimally cleaned 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.539
 the right cleansing of the skin 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.430
 rosacea it especially important because 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.020
 sweat mutzel make-up the skin 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.270
 additionally irritate and inflammation 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.340
 besides, it is 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.260
 important to the skin receptive to the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.940
 active ingredients from ointments and creams too 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.930
 make the treatment successful 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.790
 can run 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.100
 In the end, that's easy 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.070
 takes a cleaning gel very important 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.350
 no soap no alcohol very little 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.480
 water dries the skin too much from 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.110
 what you hold in your hands is that 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.850
 rosalia cleaning gel from rosi exactly one 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.360
 take a small amount of the gel on the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.360
 hand and then spread it in the face 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.390
 So massage properly but completely 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.390
 do not rub or squeeze gently 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.640
 so 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.649
 with your moist air you take it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.570
 then again that goes like this 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.369
 put together that no water for 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.420
 Cleaning is needed around the skin 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.420
 not unnecessarily burden 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.579
 so now my face is sour 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.829
 I use in connection to that 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.119
 Thermal water around remnants of the cleaning 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.770
 to lose weight 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.929
 It also feels great on the skin 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.469
 and it also affects skin again 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:47.770

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:50.579
 just to expect that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.579

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.750
