that you can see it better like here I

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.440 
that you can see it better like here I
guess<00:03:23.250> because<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.730> turn<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.060> turn<00:03:24.269> at<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
guess because if you turn the turn at a

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.509 
guess because if you turn the turn at a
certain<00:03:24.720> angle<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> red<00:03:26.780> but<00:03:28.519> really

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519
