00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:31.810

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:35.630
 pc for marc for ps3 and for xbox 360 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.030

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.240
 albiazul 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.730
 are the headphones with the pads 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.040
 pretty big now we'll see it 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.810
 the pretty basic user well we see 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.510
 what are some headphones 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.400
 large with the pads and 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.350
 40 mm large earmuffs 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.530
 what will be totally adapted to our 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530
 ears 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.110
 microphone we can 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.470
 we need and take it out when we have 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.890
 we see that it has a flaming design by 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.890
 the laterals 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.800
 and now we've talked about the diadem 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.680
 which is fabric 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.850
 very comfortable very wide and adapts 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.850
 perfectly to the head 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.920
 now we will talk about the connections that 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.920
 we can meet with 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.620
 red and white usual in these 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.620
 headphones and the usb connection 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.390
 we followed the cable and we found 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.700
 control 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.460
 what can we flip 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.330
 and enable the microphone 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.330
 we see a little wheel 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.530
 on the side with which we can 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.870
 control the volume of it 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.819
 the microphone and on the other side we 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.600
 we found a city ​​wheel with the 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.330
 we bring the general volume of the 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.040
 the headphones we found that 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.040
 have a jack entry here 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.270
 it's just to plug it in here 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.310
 to this adapter 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.959
 of the big yak the tiniest yak that 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.959
 is in command of the xbox 360 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.950
 remember that it is a very big headset 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:38.470
 comfortable that sounds good with some 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.500
 serious enough 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.830
 featured 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.830
 but 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.460
 with anti-noise microphone 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.420
 with noise cancellation 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.270
 when putting us on we will highlight that the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.550
 pads we isolated enough from the noise 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.530
 outside since they are quite large and 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.530
 there is enough surface 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.990
