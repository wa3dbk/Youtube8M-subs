oh<00:00:07.639> that's<00:00:08.959> the<00:00:09.959> main<00:00:10.139> quest<00:00:10.500> completed<00:00:11.480> I'd

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
oh that's the main quest completed I'd

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.230 
oh that's the main quest completed I'd
say<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:13.080> think<00:00:13.289> the<00:00:13.709> most<00:00:14.039> stars<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.850> you<00:00:14.910> can

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
say I think the most stars that you can

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.109 
say I think the most stars that you can
get<00:00:17.240> before<00:00:18.650> or<00:00:19.650> at<00:00:20.039> least<00:00:20.310> by<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.760> time<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
get before or at least by the time the

get before or at least by the time the
credits<00:00:21.599> roll<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> first<00:00:22.050> time<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.470> 105<00:00:23.130> which

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
credits roll the first time is 105 which

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.260 
credits roll the first time is 105 which
ones<00:00:24.210> did<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.450> miss<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.460> didn't<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.449> 1,600

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
ones did I miss I didn't get the 1,600

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.510 
ones did I miss I didn't get the 1,600
hungry<00:00:30.270> lumas<00:00:30.449> star<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.170> didn't<00:00:31.920> get<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.250> bat

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
hungry lumas star I didn't get the bat

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.410 
hungry lumas star I didn't get the bat
Iraq<00:00:32.820> garbage<00:00:33.809> dump<00:00:34.079> star<00:00:34.379> and<00:00:35.059> I<00:00:36.059> didn't<00:00:36.359> get

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
Iraq garbage dump star and I didn't get

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
Iraq garbage dump star and I didn't get
any<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.719> trial<00:00:36.989> galaxies<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.249> there's

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
any of the trial galaxies so there's

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.360 
any of the trial galaxies so there's
still<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.789> to<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:39.530> 20<00:00:40.530> more<00:00:40.739> stars<00:00:41.039> to<00:00:41.249> go

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
still going to be 20 more stars to go

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.459 
still going to be 20 more stars to go
after<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:44.269> yeah<00:00:45.269> I<00:00:46.879> it<00:00:47.879> was<00:00:48.120> good<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.780> mean

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
after this yeah I it was good I mean

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.779 
after this yeah I it was good I mean
normally<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.859> would<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.219> gotten<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.639> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
normally I would have gotten all the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.430 
normally I would have gotten all the
stars<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.329> galaxy<00:00:51.359> before<00:00:52.019> moving<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.409> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
stars in a galaxy before moving on to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.619 
stars in a galaxy before moving on to
the<00:00:52.559> next<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.519> there's<00:00:53.729> actually<00:00:53.940> another

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the next but there's actually another

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.739 
the next but there's actually another
hidden<00:00:54.960> star<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.710> every<00:00:56.639> single<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.359> of<00:00:57.389> the

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
hidden star in every single one of the

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:05.430 
hidden star in every single one of the
15<00:00:58.170> main<00:00:58.440> galaxies

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.570 

and<00:01:06.120> some<00:01:07.120> of<00:01:07.150> these<00:01:07.330> are<00:01:07.840> up<00:01:08.830> there<00:01:09.130> in<00:01:09.430> the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
and some of these are up there in the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.420 
and some of these are up there in the
most<00:01:09.730> frustrating<00:01:09.970> stars<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.900> game

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
most frustrating stars in the game

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.330 
most frustrating stars in the game
they're<00:01:12.430> not<00:01:12.760> as<00:01:12.970> hard<00:01:13.330> as<00:01:14.010> lava<00:01:15.010> spire

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
they're not as hard as lava spire

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.370 
they're not as hard as lava spire
daredevil<00:01:16.030> but<00:01:17.550> they're<00:01:19.110> they're<00:01:20.110> definitely

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
daredevil but they're they're definitely

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.050 
daredevil but they're they're definitely
harder<00:01:20.920> than<00:01:21.070> Boulder<00:01:21.310> guys<00:01:21.490> daredevil

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
harder than Boulder guys daredevil

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.550 
harder than Boulder guys daredevil
they're<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.630> second<00:01:26.020> third<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.350> fourth

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
they're like the second third and fourth

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.830 
they're like the second third and fourth
hardest<00:01:26.980> stars<00:01:27.220> are<00:01:27.550> in<00:01:28.120> once<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.540> haven't

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
hardest stars are in once we haven't

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.720 
hardest stars are in once we haven't
gotten<00:01:28.990> yet<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:30.460> gonna<00:01:30.880> be<00:01:31.560> recording<00:01:32.560> those

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.740 

probably<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:38.140> right<00:01:38.380> after<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:38.890> but<00:01:39.750> it'll

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
probably not right after this but it'll

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.710 
probably not right after this but it'll
be<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:41.410> while<00:01:42.040> they'll<00:01:42.520> still<00:01:42.880> most<00:01:43.180> likely<00:01:43.570> go

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
be a while they'll still most likely go

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.380 
be a while they'll still most likely go
up<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:45.010> next<00:01:45.250> day<00:01:45.370> is<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.120> timer

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
up the next day is it the timer

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.210 
up the next day is it the timer
recording<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.290> like<00:01:47.560> two<00:01:48.010> or<00:01:48.160> three

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
recording this I have like two or three

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.830 
recording this I have like two or three
weeks<00:01:48.460> worth<00:01:48.730> of<00:01:48.850> galaxies<00:01:49.300> videos<00:01:49.600> and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
weeks worth of galaxies videos and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.770 
weeks worth of galaxies videos and
that's<00:01:50.020> counting<00:01:50.410> two<00:01:51.010> stars<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.400> day

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.270 

because<00:01:55.780> with<00:01:56.560> all<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.830> lives<00:01:57.040> i'd

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
because with all the lives i'd

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.000 
because with all the lives i'd
accumulated<00:01:57.490> doing<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.390> fourth<00:01:59.010> observatory

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
accumulated doing the fourth observatory

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.219 
accumulated doing the fourth observatory
i<00:02:00.250> went<00:02:00.909> ahead<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.180> did<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.540> fifth<00:02:01.810> or<00:02:02.200> the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
i went ahead and did the fifth or the

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.749 
i went ahead and did the fifth or the
fifth<00:02:02.590> observatory<00:02:03.130> excuse<00:02:03.340> me<00:02:03.460> i<00:02:03.520> went<00:02:03.700> ahead

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
fifth observatory excuse me i went ahead

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.660 
fifth observatory excuse me i went ahead
and<00:02:03.909> did<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.150> secret<00:02:04.509> one<00:02:04.710> simply<00:02:05.710> because<00:02:05.860> i

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
and did the secret one simply because i

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.279 
and did the secret one simply because i
knew<00:02:07.119> i<00:02:07.150> would<00:02:07.420> need<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.630> whole<00:02:07.810> bunch<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.050> lives

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
knew i would need a whole bunch of lives

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.930 
knew i would need a whole bunch of lives
for

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
for

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.510 
for

la vez fire daredevil and some of the
other<00:02:12.670> really<00:02:13.600> hard<00:02:13.810> stars

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.570 

with<00:02:21.319> all<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.530> lives<00:02:21.800> ahead<00:02:21.980> i<00:02:22.130> was<00:02:22.310> thinking

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
with all the lives ahead i was thinking

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.170 
with all the lives ahead i was thinking
about<00:02:22.670> doing<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.030> trial<00:02:23.330> galaxies<00:02:23.840> too<00:02:24.110> but<00:02:24.530> I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
about doing the trial galaxies too but I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:35.740 
about doing the trial galaxies too but I
didn't<00:02:26.180> really<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:34.120> didn't<00:02:35.120> want<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.510> yet

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
didn't really I just didn't want to yet

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.590 
didn't really I just didn't want to yet
because<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.620> want<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.340> save<00:02:37.610> those<00:02:37.880> for<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.390> day

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
because I want to save those for a day

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.059 
because I want to save those for a day
where<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> know<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.140> have<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.380> ton<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.650> time<00:02:39.890> to

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
where I know I have a ton of time to

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.660 
where I know I have a ton of time to
record<00:02:40.370> since<00:02:41.800> well<00:02:42.800> one<00:02:43.100> is<00:02:43.250> going<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.520> be

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
record since well one is going to be

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.020 
record since well one is going to be
easy<00:02:44.709> that's<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.890> way<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.250> trial<00:02:46.520> galaxies

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
easy that's the way the trial galaxies

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.680
