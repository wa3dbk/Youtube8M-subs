00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.950

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.559
 announce you a great news you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.779
 do this will have and yes it's official the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.260
 zobal is finally level 200 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.510
 unfortunately it's so Roman that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.550
 passed him level 200 he did a 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.199
 ricordate fraps but unfortunately the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.410
 Kurdish rice has completely bugged 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.090
 so suddenly he does not have the video there is 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.000
 only screens that I will put you 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.649
 at the end of the video and I will leave 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.930
 in quotation marks the little honor of the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.620
 go up sense level because here it is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.610
 still rose from 2 to about 30% 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 up to 100% almost alone since 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.660
 I was playing more too much and then yeah there is 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.079
 recently to get me back a little bit on 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.300
 the game thanks to that and so here I am 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 wanted to thank him whose romain 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.979
 for what they know it's jack 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.580
 sparrow in his first name 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.890
 so I must also thank you very much 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.250
 2 to seriously ill who are here 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.810
 so alex case record so a big thank you 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.509
 to you the ex not what helped us 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.720
 enormously to mount the character is 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.670
 whatever happens despite the acts 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 the peel ban is anything but one they do 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 he's always here for us is 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.770
 always there the good mood he did not 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.229
 afraid of lighthouses but for us then is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.820
 a big thank you to roque the one also who has 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.009
 who has really helped us pass 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.799
 quickly in quotation marks level 200 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.049
 it took four months I think pretty much 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.939
 playing quietly in appear 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.829
 like fat patients where we could have 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.899
 to go faster I think but 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.330
 frankly it was still pretty 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:54.820
 fast I find it personally 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:57.370
 so we're finally level 200 so 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.430
 so now this character between 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.400
 low quotes it's over I 'll say 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.290
 a high level of the xp and it's over 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.570
 so what are we going to do now is 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.119
 we will be 90% guild 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.330
 it's not possible I'll go 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.330
 request 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.910
 here we are going to ask girl who we 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.100
 puts motto done because I have you 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.730
 still kept a small honor it's 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.230
 to finally be able to 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.380
 to accept together the ornament of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.820
 level 2 100 so the success but for 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.040
 to do well I would have to be 90 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.610
 % otherwise the expert will leave in the void 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:51.000
 it will be useless because we xp max and 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.590
 it will be a little con I find 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.590
 we are going quietly 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.409
 the abbot chases to change a little what 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.650
 we put a good so we'll go 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:12.200
 accept it together and we'll look at 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.440
 what does the small to open law look like 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.569
 balmont who is level has unfortunately 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.099
 but we will still see what 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:27.590
 looks like what makes it pretty good to see if they 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:33.560
 manage to manage alone so we go 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:37.069
 to do what we say good 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:41.060
 shit let's see what makes that good 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.220
 back pelo ball nor ever had to have 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.659
 that he's going 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.599
 he is the master of small cars 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.609
 a story they do not make you are 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.500
 too fast 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.569
 here is a little chida 517 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.260
 so he was stroking voltages twice 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.260
 they saw dpm okay it's not bad 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.530
 Here we do a number all time 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.829
 of 500 and here we are which levels 1 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.530
 the Dopel so there is no problem 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.840
 with that if I let him tap governing the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.889
 fighting here pretty quietly even 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.590
 time you will tell me by being from 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:18.739
 level 2 meaning it's a little pity good 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.950
 so here I am thinking if I do not have 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.070
 other things to announce to you 6 more 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.940
 a tip from some friends of the guide 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.889
 I was asked if I would ever do it again 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.780
 my rogue try their assets 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.490
 finally not have them whoever was 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.470
 already done but we must go back a I 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.289
 will say maybe not exactly like 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.699
 he was before but why not 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.900
 go up a rogue and try to 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.169
 redo things like I did 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.970
 before with or in any case go up 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.479
 another class I had in mind huh that 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:57.110
 shout that I would fire I think because 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.000
 that it is completely op and or 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.000
 well a cra frankly I hesitate so 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.020
 I wait 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.340
 how to say your advice and your and your 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.810
 comments in any case that you 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.480
 put below the video in any 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.190
 case I hope because I know 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.230
 really not what I can ride like 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.700
 no one else I tried I 've already 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.580
 played pretty much every class to 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.110
 high level is clearly I do not know 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.520
 at all I can do as I 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.130
 what could be interesting 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.540
 I think it would be an accra since 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.600
 plug its crisis and chalk to what I 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.800
 know all the same well enough but it's 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.960
 true that if I make myself a rich bag 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.230
 could limit a little pvp and 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.690
 like I've never really done 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.980
 pvp videos i will tell from 1 pure v1 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.340
 it could be quite a bit of a bag 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.560
 and finally either I'm waiting for your little ones 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.550
 comments below the video and 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.620
 I will make videos on dofus pretty much 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.880
 often in any case what now 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.950
 go there the exams and all that are 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.990
 finished so I can get on 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.480
 completely to the task means to 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.100
 make videos I reinstalled the 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.660
 software I used before so I 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.650
 to make records I'll try 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.950
 to redo a new introduction 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.660
 like washed before and like that ben we go 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.370
 to be able to overcome a little 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.570
 little to smelter must son so here I 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.270
