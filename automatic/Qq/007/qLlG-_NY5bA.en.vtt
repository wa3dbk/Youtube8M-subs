unique<00:01:56.219> building<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:57.030> end<00:01:57.570> up

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
unique building that you have end up

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.569 
unique building that you have end up
getting<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> extra<00:01:58.350> money<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.979> top<00:01:59.310> of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
getting you extra money on top of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.160 
getting you extra money on top of
science<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.149> every<00:02:00.450> city<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.960> have

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
science so every city that you have

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.709 
science so every city that you have
you're<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.799> need<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.130> build<00:02:02.310> debt<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
you're going to need to build debt and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.910 
you're going to need to build debt and
really<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.840> need<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> build<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.439> because<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
really do need to build that because you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.399 
really do need to build that because you
will<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.250> tons<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.090> money<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.600> things<00:02:07.350> that

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
will get tons of money so things that

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.710 
will get tons of money so things that
you<00:02:07.530> conquer<00:02:08.039> you'll<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:08.940> able<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.149> pay<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.599> it

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you conquer you'll be able to pay for it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.560 
you conquer you'll be able to pay for it
with<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> paper<00:02:10.319> maker<00:02:10.619> building

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
with a paper maker building

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.990 
with a paper maker building
also<00:02:13.570> when<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.710> conquer<00:02:15.250> things<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.850> take

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
also when you conquer things and take

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.550 
also when you conquer things and take
over<00:02:16.120> cities<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.690> capitals<00:02:17.140> you'll<00:02:17.320> end<00:02:17.500> up

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
over cities and capitals you'll end up

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.050 
over cities and capitals you'll end up
getting<00:02:17.710> more<00:02:17.950> science<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.520> more<00:02:18.760> people

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
getting more science and more people

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.850 
getting more science and more people
with<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.480> hopefully<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.500> retain<00:02:20.830> your

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
with you and hopefully you retain your

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.390 
with you and hopefully you retain your
happiness<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.520> point<00:02:21.850> which<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:22.870> good<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.220> if

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
happiness to a point which is good so if

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.800 
happiness to a point which is good so if
you<00:02:24.520> have<00:02:24.700> high<00:02:24.880> happiness<00:02:25.360> still<00:02:25.540> you'll

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
you have high happiness still you'll

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.350 
you have high happiness still you'll
still<00:02:26.020> be<00:02:26.310> creating<00:02:27.310> people<00:02:27.490> in<00:02:27.910> your<00:02:28.060> cities

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
still be creating people in your cities

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.210 
still be creating people in your cities
meaning<00:02:29.200> you'll<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.800> able<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.070> more

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
meaning you'll be able to have more

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.070 
meaning you'll be able to have more
science<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.540> would<00:02:31.750> highly<00:02:32.050> recommend

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
science so I would highly recommend

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.530 
science so I would highly recommend
science<00:02:32.860> as<00:02:32.950> well<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.120> third<00:02:34.330> one

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
science as well and then the third one

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.180 
science as well and then the third one
is<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.810> diplomatic<00:02:35.410> victory<00:02:35.650> which<00:02:35.980> isn't

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
is a diplomatic victory which isn't

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.700 
is a diplomatic victory which isn't
exactly<00:02:36.750> when<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.780> go<00:02:38.020> forward<00:02:38.350> somewhat

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
exactly when I go forward somewhat

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.480 
exactly when I go forward somewhat
recommended<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.690> one<00:02:41.410> with<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.770> is<00:02:42.190> more<00:02:42.430> or

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
recommended the one with that is more or

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.700 
recommended the one with that is more or
less<00:02:42.550> being<00:02:43.180> friends<00:02:43.630> with<00:02:43.810> some<00:02:44.110> people<00:02:44.380> and

way so that way you have good relations
with<00:03:03.250> everybody<00:03:03.670> else<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:04.210> really<00:03:04.720> wouldn't

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
with everybody else I really wouldn't

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.570 
with everybody else I really wouldn't
recommend<00:03:04.990> going<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.710> patronage<00:03:06.070> tree<00:03:06.400> but

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
recommend going to a patronage tree but

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.670 
recommend going to a patronage tree but
if<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.150> do<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:08.380> get<00:03:08.530> some

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
if you have to do it to get some

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.330 
if you have to do it to get some
city-states

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
city-states

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.760 
city-states
I<00:03:09.460> really<00:03:10.120> wouldn't<00:03:10.300> recommend<00:03:10.770> diplomatic

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
I really wouldn't recommend diplomatic

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.040 
I really wouldn't recommend diplomatic
but<00:03:12.360> yeah<00:03:13.360> it's<00:03:14.110> definitely<00:03:14.560> possible<00:03:14.850> so

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
but yeah it's definitely possible so

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.220 
but yeah it's definitely possible so
then<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:18.010> least<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.460> them<00:03:18.550> all<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:19.230> apparently

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
then the least of them all is apparently

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.470 
then the least of them all is apparently
who's<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.770> nians<00:03:21.130> said<00:03:21.760> Ian's<00:03:21.970> favorite

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
who's that nians said Ian's favorite

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.410 
who's that nians said Ian's favorite
thing<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.650> stay<00:03:23.860> small<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.520> be<00:03:24.850> cultural

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
thing is to stay small and be cultural

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.090 
thing is to stay small and be cultural
that<00:03:26.020> is<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.320> worst<00:03:26.500> option<00:03:26.710> that<00:03:27.010> you're

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
that is the worst option that you're

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.700 
that is the worst option that you're
going<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.370> want<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:28.090> choose<00:03:28.420> because<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:29.560> have

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
going to want to choose because you have

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.980 
going to want to choose because you have
such<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.100> great<00:03:30.400> ability<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.510> go<00:03:31.660> out<00:03:31.840> and

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
such a great ability to go out and

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.860 
such a great ability to go out and
dominate<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.680> be<00:03:33.190> large<00:03:33.460> and<00:03:33.610> just<00:03:34.420> dominate

and<00:03:35.400> staying<00:03:36.400> small<00:03:36.520> in<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:36.850> very<00:03:37.030> good<00:03:37.120> idea

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
and staying small in a very good idea

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.300 
and staying small in a very good idea
you<00:03:37.870> don't<00:03:38.050> have<00:03:38.260> any<00:03:38.440> personality<00:03:38.830> trade

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310

movement of - you may not mainly attack
that's<00:04:02.290> obviously<00:04:02.740> not<00:04:02.980> gonna<00:04:03.100> smack<00:04:03.520> it<00:04:03.670> with

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
that's obviously not gonna smack it with

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.330 
that's obviously not gonna smack it with
a<00:04:03.790> big<00:04:04.000> old<00:04:04.180> cross<00:04:04.420> bell<00:04:04.720> although<00:04:05.230> he<00:04:05.380> can<00:04:05.650> it

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
a big old cross bell although he can it

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.090 
a big old cross bell although he can it
won't<00:04:06.550> kill<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.820> in<00:04:07.210> this<00:04:07.330> most<00:04:07.810> cases<00:04:08.050> at<00:04:08.260> all

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
won't kill you in this most cases at all

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.890 
won't kill you in this most cases at all
and<00:04:09.520> he<00:04:09.670> may<00:04:09.820> attack<00:04:10.120> twice<00:04:10.300> which<00:04:10.660> is<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
and he may attack twice which is the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.750 
and he may attack twice which is the
biggest<00:04:11.320> bonus<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.400> guy

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
biggest bonus to this guy

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.970 
biggest bonus to this guy
so<00:04:13.600> essentially<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.500> will<00:04:14.560> be<00:04:14.710> able<00:04:14.830> to

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
so essentially you will be able to

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.420 
so essentially you will be able to
attack<00:04:15.280> once<00:04:15.580> hit<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.210> unit<00:04:16.540> him<00:04:17.200> again<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
attack once hit a unit him again and

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.670 
attack once hit a unit him again and
usually<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.000> end<00:04:19.060> up<00:04:19.239> killing<00:04:19.390> them<00:04:19.680> this

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
usually you end up killing them this

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.350 
usually you end up killing them this
that<00:04:21.070> ability<00:04:21.430> is<00:04:21.520> extremely<00:04:21.970> helpful<00:04:22.150> when

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
that ability is extremely helpful when

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.450 
that ability is extremely helpful when
attacking<00:04:22.720> cities<00:04:23.050> he<00:04:23.710> pretty<00:04:23.860> much<00:04:23.950> acts<00:04:24.250> as

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
attacking cities he pretty much acts as

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.430 
attacking cities he pretty much acts as
a<00:04:24.580> catapult

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
a catapult

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.940 
a catapult
the<00:04:25.500> time<00:04:25.710> or<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.550> some<00:04:27.260> extent<00:04:28.380> Trebuchet

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
the time or to some extent Trebuchet

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.640 
the time or to some extent Trebuchet
because<00:04:29.790> they're<00:04:30.030> able<00:04:30.150> in<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.510> twice<00:04:30.870> being

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
because they're able in it twice being

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.350 
because they're able in it twice being
able<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:31.890> hit<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.100> twice<00:04:32.220> means<00:04:32.730> you're<00:04:33.330> just

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
able to hit it twice means you're just

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.950 
able to hit it twice means you're just
potent<00:04:33.960> has<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.820> seed<00:04:35.820> unit<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.540> these<00:04:36.750> guys<00:04:36.900> are

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
potent has a seed unit so these guys are

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.440 
potent has a seed unit so these guys are
extremely<00:04:37.350> beneficial<00:04:38.040> you<00:04:38.970> want<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.240> build<00:04:39.330> a

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
extremely beneficial you want to build a

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.540 
extremely beneficial you want to build a
lot<00:04:39.660> of<00:04:39.780> them<00:04:39.930> but<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.560> great<00:04:40.800> general<00:04:41.190> they

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
lot of them but that great general they

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.810 
lot of them but that great general they
close<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.120> unstoppable<00:04:42.680> so<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.310> unique

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
close to unstoppable so the unique

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.550 
close to unstoppable so the unique
building<00:04:45.300> will<00:04:45.420> be<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.570> paper<00:04:45.960> maker<00:04:46.260> which

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
building will be the paper maker which

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.190 
building will be the paper maker which
means<00:04:46.880> you'll<00:04:47.880> get<00:04:48.000> two<00:04:48.270> gold<00:04:48.480> out<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.930> it

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
means you'll get two gold out of it it

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.590 
means you'll get two gold out of it it
will<00:04:49.290> cost<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.680> 75<00:04:50.130> production<00:04:50.700> and<00:04:50.910> you<00:04:51.330> still

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
will cost of 75 production and you still

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.150 
will cost of 75 production and you still
will<00:04:51.720> get<00:04:51.900> that<00:04:52.020> plus<00:04:52.290> one<00:04:52.470> science<00:04:52.860> for<00:04:52.980> every

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
will get that plus one science for every

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.830 
will get that plus one science for every
two<00:04:53.310> citizens<00:04:53.610> in<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.150> city<00:04:54.360> so<00:04:54.690> it's

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
two citizens in the city so it's

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.050 
two citizens in the city so it's
essentially<00:04:55.140> a<00:04:55.290> library<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:55.980> to<00:04:56.490> smack<00:04:56.880> on

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
essentially a library and to smack on

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.860 
essentially a library and to smack on
plus<00:04:57.420> to<00:04:57.600> gold<00:04:57.870> which<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:58.680> huge<00:04:59.130> because<00:04:59.870> your

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
plus to gold which is huge because your

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.050 
plus to gold which is huge because your
rather<00:05:01.590> than<00:05:01.890> maintaining<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.880> building

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
rather than maintaining the building

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.810 
rather than maintaining the building
getting<00:05:04.020> money<00:05:04.230> back<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:05.310> it's<00:05:05.550> extremely

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
getting money back so it's extremely

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.450 
getting money back so it's extremely
important<00:05:06.390> to<00:05:06.420> have<00:05:06.510> that<00:05:07.100> so<00:05:08.100> now<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.310> you

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
important to have that so now that you
