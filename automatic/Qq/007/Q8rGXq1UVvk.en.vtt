00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.869
 filming the second part of the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.730
 advertising that is read from 2013 that is going 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.879
 be premiering in all theaters of the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.629
 production of about 30 people 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.210
 between actors of tourist producers 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.019
 photographer photographers a little the idea 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.539
 of this commercial is to show what the 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.489
 brand proposition let's say it's not just 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.920
 focus on the products in our 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.890
 motorcycles but in people who like the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.659
 type of users the type of consumption of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.179
 users in a museum consume art 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.130
 in design we go through your usual day 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.130
 let's say all the time 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.770

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.600

 against the clock and taking great care that the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.860
 idea 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.260
 we managed to think like brands the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.760
 we can transmit is basically that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.580
