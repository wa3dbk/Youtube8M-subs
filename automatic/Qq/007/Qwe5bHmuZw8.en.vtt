especially on the NFC but let's just
start<00:00:21.570> off<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.869> cowboys<00:00:22.350> eagles<00:00:22.529> game

get<00:00:23.519> out<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> way<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> as<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:25.230> said<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.590> last

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
get out of the way I as I said my last

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.310 
get out of the way I as I said my last
video<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.970> my<00:00:27.029> last<00:00:27.269> Cowboys<00:00:27.750> video<00:00:28.050> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
video I do in my last Cowboys video I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.050 
video I do in my last Cowboys video I
think<00:00:29.160> there's<00:00:29.340> gonna<00:00:29.429> be<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.609> lot<00:00:29.699> work<00:00:29.880> better

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
think there's gonna be a lot work better

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.659 
think there's gonna be a lot work better
than<00:00:30.210> last<00:00:30.390> week<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.920> don't<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> Eagles

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
than last week I don't think the Eagles

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
than last week I don't think the Eagles
are<00:00:32.850> too<00:00:33.030> good<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> team<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.260> put<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.680> that

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
are too good of a team to put that that

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.450 
are too good of a team to put that that
kind<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.520> effort<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:36.030> two<00:00:36.390> weeks<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> row

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
kind of effort out two weeks in a row

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.860 
kind of effort out two weeks in a row
but<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.850> douse<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.300> good<00:00:39.480> enough<00:00:39.629> team

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
but I think douse is a good enough team

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.569 
but I think douse is a good enough team
to<00:00:40.379> give<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> same<00:00:40.829> effort<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.190> put<00:00:41.219> out

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
to give the same effort they put out

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.220 
to give the same effort they put out
they've<00:00:42.510> been<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.809> three<00:00:42.930> straight

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
they've been there for three straight

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.700 
they've been there for three straight
weeks<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:45.719> reason<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.200> des<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.590> win

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
weeks and the reason I think des can win

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.709 
weeks and the reason I think des can win
this<00:00:46.800> game<00:00:46.980> 1<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.430> defense<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.239> playing<00:00:48.360> some

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
this game 1 the defense is playing some

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.940 
this game 1 the defense is playing some
of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.870> best<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.320> I've<00:00:49.500> seen<00:00:49.710> them<00:00:49.829> play

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
of the best of all I've seen them play

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.080 
of the best of all I've seen them play
in<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.670> long<00:00:50.940> time<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.789> which

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
in a long time and you know to and which

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.639 
in a long time and you know to and which
may<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> main<00:00:54.660> reason<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.230> usually<00:00:55.530> it's

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
may be the main reason and usually it's

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.830 
may be the main reason and usually it's
the<00:00:55.739> desert<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.250> team<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:57.300> Tony<00:00:57.480> Romo

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the desert with this team but Tony Romo

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.750 
the desert with this team but Tony Romo
Tony<00:00:58.379> Romo<00:00:58.770> has<00:00:58.949> been<00:00:59.160> playing<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.699> his

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
Tony Romo has been playing out of his

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
Tony Romo has been playing out of his
mind<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> past<00:01:00.510> month<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
mind this past month and really this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
mind this past month and really this
season<00:01:02.430> he's<00:01:03.149> played<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.539> his<00:01:03.750> best<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
season he's played so his best and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
season he's played so his best and
smartest<00:01:04.350> football<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> others<00:01:05.460> career

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
smartest football of the others career

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
smartest football of the others career
and<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.080> continues<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.680> think

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and I think that continues I think

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
and I think that continues I think
Philly<00:01:08.310> goes<00:01:08.490> down<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> think<00:01:08.939> Dallas<00:01:09.090> moves<00:01:09.420> on

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
Philly goes down I think Dallas moves on

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.560 
Philly goes down I think Dallas moves on
now<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.500> other<00:01:10.680> game<00:01:10.920> NFC<00:01:11.460> cardinals<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
now the other game NFC cardinals and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 
now the other game NFC cardinals and
packers<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> packers<00:01:14.610> killed<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
packers you know the packers killed the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
packers you know the packers killed the
Cardinals<00:01:15.450> last<00:01:15.600> week<00:01:15.900> though<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> Carnales

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
Cardinals last week though the Carnales

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
Cardinals last week though the Carnales
held<00:01:16.920> back<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.909> being<00:01:18.180> said<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
held back that being said I do think the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
held back that being said I do think the
Packers<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> better<00:01:19.770> team<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.159> cards<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
Packers are a better team the cards and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.390 
Packers are a better team the cards and
it<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.060> Arizona<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.780> i<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> packers

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
it is in Arizona but i think the packers

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.800 
it is in Arizona but i think the packers
would<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.670> Aaron<00:01:23.970> Rodgers<00:01:24.390> has<00:01:24.540> really

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
would like Aaron Rodgers has really

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.410 
would like Aaron Rodgers has really
matured<00:01:24.930> over<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.530> past<00:01:25.710> couple<00:01:25.979> years

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
matured over this past couple years

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.730 
matured over this past couple years
really<00:01:27.420> embraced<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.409> taking

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
really embraced that you know taking

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.620 
really embraced that you know taking
over<00:01:29.009> Brett<00:01:29.159> Favre's<00:01:29.430> position<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
over Brett Favre's position and the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.679 
over Brett Favre's position and the
Packard<00:01:31.049> defense<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.700> think<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.210> I

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
Packard defense I really think that I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.260 
Packard defense I really think that I
know<00:01:34.280> it's<00:01:35.280> hard<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.610> make<00:01:35.729> case<00:01:35.909> against

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
know it's hard to make case against

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.840 
know it's hard to make case against
Arizona<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:36.869> Arizona<00:01:37.560> last<00:01:38.130> year<00:01:38.520> was

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
Arizona because Arizona last year was
