pulse wife rooms that are really good at

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429

a<00:00:26.189> fusion<00:00:26.550> rifle<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.180> there's<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.019> couple<00:00:28.380> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
a fusion rifle and there's a couple of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.599 
a fusion rifle and there's a couple of
others<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:28.980> there's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> hand<00:00:29.400> cannon

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609

others I think there's a hand cannon
that's<00:00:29.880> pretty<00:00:30.179> good<00:00:30.359> as<00:00:30.480> well<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:31.289> i<00:00:31.500> thought

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that's pretty good as well but i thought

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.680 
that's pretty good as well but i thought
i'd<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.040> auto<00:00:32.279> rifle<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.059> after<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
i'd do the auto rifle this is after the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.479 
i'd do the auto rifle this is after the
patch<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.469> came<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.890> where<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.160> nerfed

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
patch that came out where they nerfed

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.850 
patch that came out where they nerfed
auto<00:00:35.790> rifle<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.600> was<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.050> little<00:00:37.230> bit<00:00:37.469> tricky

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
auto rifle so it was a little bit tricky

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.799 
auto rifle so it was a little bit tricky
trying<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:38.579> gameplay<00:00:39.239> footage<00:00:39.480> for

you that didn't suck and but loads of
people<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.170> been<00:00:43.230> comparing<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
people have been comparing it with the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790 
people have been comparing it with the
0's<00:00:44.430> regime<00:00:44.879> i<00:00:45.120> personally<00:00:45.809> prefer<00:00:46.110> using<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
0's regime i personally prefer using the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
0's regime i personally prefer using the
sewers<00:00:47.160> rather<00:00:47.550> than<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.940> weapon<00:00:48.450> just

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
sewers rather than this weapon just

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.350 
sewers rather than this weapon just
because<00:00:49.260> I've<00:00:49.440> got<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.950> Zeus<00:00:50.640> regimes<00:00:51.090> one

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
because I've got to Zeus regimes one

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
because I've got to Zeus regimes one
with<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> slow<00:00:52.410> fire<00:00:52.710> rate<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:53.250> without<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
with the slow fire rate one without the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.229 
with the slow fire rate one without the
upgrade<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.320> let's<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:57.000> kit

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
just go over the gun just so you guys

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.450 
just go over the gun just so you guys
can<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.020> looks<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

here as you can see is a blue rare
weapon<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.409> thought<00:01:08.159> I'd<00:01:08.369> never<00:01:08.610> use<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.970> gun

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
weapon and I thought I'd never use a gun

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080 
weapon and I thought I'd never use a gun
like<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.990> crucible<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.979> did<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.729> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
like this in crucible but I did so this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.140 
like this in crucible but I did so this
is<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> setup<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.290> I've<00:01:13.380> got<00:01:13.680> mine<00:01:14.490> has<00:01:14.790> red

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
is the setup that I've got mine has red

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
is the setup that I've got mine has red
dot<00:01:15.450> OAS<00:01:16.170> red<00:01:16.770> door<00:01:17.009> ores<00:01:18.229> focus<00:01:19.229> lens<00:01:19.470> fos<00:01:20.189> to

dot OAS red door ores focus lens fos to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.270 
dot OAS red door ores focus lens fos to
and<00:01:20.990> flinching<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.290> easier<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.830> aim<00:01:23.009> under

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and flinching it's easier to aim under

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980 
and flinching it's easier to aim under
fire<00:01:23.729> using<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.360> weapon<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
fire using this weapon which is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440 
fire using this weapon which is
extremely<00:01:25.560> useful<00:01:26.009> especially<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:27.299> you're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
extremely useful especially when you're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
extremely useful especially when you're
up<00:01:27.540> against<00:01:27.840> better<00:01:28.710> weapons<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.250> pulse

boost<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> fire<00:01:41.100> rate

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
boost but as you can see the fire rate

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
boost but as you can see the fire rate
is<00:01:41.400> pretty<00:01:41.610> good<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> impact<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.930> pretty

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
is pretty good and the impact is pretty

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.800 
is pretty good and the impact is pretty
high<00:01:43.380> range<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.369> quite<00:01:44.670> average<00:01:44.880> stability<00:01:45.750> is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
high range is quite average stability is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.679 
high range is quite average stability is
quite<00:01:46.049> low<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.470> reload<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:48.149> okay<00:01:48.360> but

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
quite low and reload is is okay but

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
quite low and reload is is okay but
could<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.170> better<00:01:49.200> over<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.130> got

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
could be better over there and it's got

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.210 
could be better over there and it's got
30<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> mag<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:51.960> manage<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> kill

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
30 in the mag now I do manage to kill

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.639 
30 in the mag now I do manage to kill
one<00:01:53.549> enemy<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.270> 30<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
one enemy with 30 and then I have to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.490 
one enemy with 30 and then I have to
reload<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.210> regards<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.719> actually<00:01:58.110> using

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
reload so with regards to actually using

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.789 
reload so with regards to actually using
the<00:01:58.530> gun<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.310> crucible<00:01:59.579> I<00:02:00.119> would<00:02:00.509> suggest

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the gun in the crucible I would suggest

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.770 
the gun in the crucible I would suggest
trying<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.219> run<00:02:02.700> around<00:02:02.820> quite<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> lot<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
trying to run around quite a lot and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870 
trying to run around quite a lot and
when<00:02:03.899> you're<00:02:04.049> shooting<00:02:04.530> someone<00:02:05.100> try<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
when you're shooting someone try and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
when you're shooting someone try and
move<00:02:05.969> left<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.840> well<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.590> because

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
move left to right as well just because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.770 
move left to right as well just because
if<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.340> go<00:02:08.489> up<00:02:08.580> again<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.060> gun<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
if you go up again it's a gun like the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.470 
if you go up again it's a gun like the
thorn<00:02:10.080> you're<00:02:11.009> you're<00:02:11.459> bound<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.940> die<00:02:12.180> because

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
thorn you're you're bound to die because

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.230 
thorn you're you're bound to die because
the<00:02:12.780> thorn<00:02:13.020> is

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
the thorn is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.760 
the thorn is
three<00:02:13.510> hit<00:02:13.690> kill<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.260> you'll<00:02:14.590> basically

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
three hit kill and you'll basically

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.950 
three hit kill and you'll basically
having<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.490> empty<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.790> whole<00:02:16.000> mag<00:02:16.240> into<00:02:16.630> some<00:02:16.810> of

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
having to empty a whole mag into some of

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.780 
having to empty a whole mag into some of
the<00:02:17.050> Killam<00:02:17.350> now<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.400> probably<00:02:18.580> just

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the Killam now this is probably just

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.580
