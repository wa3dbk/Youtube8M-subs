tremendous<00:00:28.590> amount<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.130> line<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.970> put<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
tremendous amount of line and put out a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.510 
tremendous amount of line and put out a
just<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.380> sick<00:00:31.650> amount<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.009> drag<00:00:32.189> they're

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
just a sick amount of drag they're

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.139 
just a sick amount of drag they're
really<00:00:32.790> smooth<00:00:33.059> six<00:00:33.750> ball<00:00:33.989> bearings<00:00:35.059> you<00:00:36.059> know

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
really smooth six ball bearings you know

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.370 
really smooth six ball bearings you know
like<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.360> said<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> two<00:00:36.840> speeds<00:00:37.140> when

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
like I said it's a two speeds when

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.420 
like I said it's a two speeds when
you're<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.559> high<00:00:37.710> speed<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.340> right

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you're in high speed which it is right

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.130 
you're in high speed which it is right
now<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> 6<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> 1<00:00:39.300> gear<00:00:39.510> ratio<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
now it's a 6 to 1 gear ratio when you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
now it's a 6 to 1 gear ratio when you
push<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> button<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.770> drop<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:42.149> goes

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
push the button you drop it down it goes

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.979 
push the button you drop it down it goes
down<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.809> 301<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.420> got<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.719> bit<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
down to 301 so it's got a little bit of

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
down to 301 so it's got a little bit of
a<00:00:46.050> higher<00:00:46.260> gear<00:00:46.620> ratio<00:00:46.980> than<00:00:47.730> other

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
a higher gear ratio than other

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
a higher gear ratio than other
comparable<00:00:48.239> reels<00:00:48.660> usually<00:00:48.989> when<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
comparable reels usually when you get to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
comparable reels usually when you get to
the<00:00:49.890> size<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.190> drop<00:00:50.399> down<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.850> five<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the size they drop down to like five to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.180 
the size they drop down to like five to
one<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> two<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.230> one<00:00:52.440> stays<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.890> six

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
one and two to one this one stays at six

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
one and two to one this one stays at six
to<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> three<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.899> you're

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to one and three to one so if you're

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.680 
to one and three to one so if you're
looking<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> little<00:00:56.100> bit<00:00:56.280> more<00:00:56.489> speed<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
looking for a little bit more speed and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.590 
looking for a little bit more speed and
this<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> definitely<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.340> way<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.670> solid

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
this is definitely the way to go solid

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.529 
this is definitely the way to go solid
