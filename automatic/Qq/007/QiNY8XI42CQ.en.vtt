00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
a Z and you just swipe along like this
on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.840> four<00:01:31.560> applications<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
on the four applications that you get to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.569 
on the four applications that you get to
configure<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.780> bottom<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.380> then<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.310> can

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
configure at the bottom and then you can

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
configure at the bottom and then you can
slide<00:01:36.090> into<00:01:36.630> those<00:01:36.840> applications<00:01:37.290> there<00:01:37.650> are

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
slide into those applications there are

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.840 
slide into those applications there are
a<00:01:37.770> few<00:01:37.920> other<00:01:38.070> tweaks<00:01:38.310> which<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
a few other tweaks which do it in

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.420 
a few other tweaks which do it in
similar<00:01:39.180> ways<00:01:39.210> /<00:01:39.630> different<00:01:40.259> ways<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.770> just

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
similar ways / different ways I just

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
similar ways / different ways I just
really<00:01:41.640> am<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> fan<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.140> very

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
really am a fan of this one it's very

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
really am a fan of this one it's very
functional<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.009> design<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.490> amazing<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
functional the design is not amazing I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
functional the design is not amazing I
have<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> say<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.350> you're<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> design<00:01:46.799> head

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
have to say so if you're a design head

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.530 
have to say so if you're a design head
you<00:01:47.460> might<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> steer<00:01:48.000> clear<00:01:48.060> from<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you might want to steer clear from this

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.120 
you might want to steer clear from this
one<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.290> definitely<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.799> functional

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
one but it definitely very functional

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
one but it definitely very functional
tweak<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.939> figure<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> apps<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
tweak you can figure all of the apps to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
tweak you can figure all of the apps to
do<00:01:51.960> individual<00:01:52.619> different<00:01:52.920> things<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.909> it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
do individual different things so it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.160 
do individual different things so it's
very<00:01:54.149> useful<00:01:54.299> i<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.020> one

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
very useful i really like this one

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
very useful i really like this one
finally<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.770> come<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.250> winterboard<00:01:56.610> theme

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.039 
finally we come to the winterboard theme
and<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.420> probably<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.810> you've<00:01:57.930> been

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049

and this is probably what you've been
waiting<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.950> called<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.280> low<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
waiting for this is called up low and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
waiting for this is called up low and
it's<00:02:00.030> by<00:02:00.149> century<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.229> same<00:02:01.469> designer<00:02:01.860> of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it's by century the same designer of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.310 
it's by century the same designer of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
oxide which I'm sure you know about and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.230 
oxide which I'm sure you know about and
it's<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.950> beautiful<00:02:04.979> theme<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.969> don't<00:02:06.149> mean

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it's just a beautiful theme I don't mean

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
there's too much to say about it to be

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
there's too much to say about it to be
perfectly<00:02:08.550> honest<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.170> wouldn't<00:02:10.619> say

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
perfectly honest it's a I wouldn't say

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.830 
perfectly honest it's a I wouldn't say
it's<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> totally<00:02:11.430> flat<00:02:11.760> design<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> would

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it's a totally flat design but I would

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.760 
it's a totally flat design but I would
say<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.290> definitely

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
say that it's definitely

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.310 
say that it's definitely
inspired<00:02:14.190> by<00:02:14.310> flat<00:02:14.730> design<00:02:15.060> I'm<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.990> sure<00:02:16.140> he

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
inspired by flat design I'm not sure he

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.630 
inspired by flat design I'm not sure he
might<00:02:16.470> put<00:02:16.680> me<00:02:16.830> right<00:02:16.860> about<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
might put me right about that in the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.730 
might put me right about that in the
comments<00:02:18.210> but<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.230> really<00:02:19.530> beautiful
