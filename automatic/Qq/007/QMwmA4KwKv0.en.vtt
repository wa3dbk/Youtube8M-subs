00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
possible mistakes but everyone's also

possible mistakes but everyone's also
wondering<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.900> something<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.350> seemed

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.090 
what's happening if this result is true
it<00:01:40.049> would<00:01:40.290> mean<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.680> we'd<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it would mean that we'd have to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
it would mean that we'd have to
fundamentally<00:01:41.909> rethink<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
fundamentally rethink the way that the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.350 
fundamentally rethink the way that the
universe<00:01:43.680> works<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.180> have

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
universe works because if you have

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
universe works because if you have

things that can travel faster than the

things that can travel faster than the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
speed of light it's not just space

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.069 
speed of light it's not just space
that's<00:01:50.880> affected<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.810> that's

that's affected it's time that's
affected<00:01:52.530> too<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.130> things<00:01:53.369> start<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> travel

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
affected too so things start to travel

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.030 
affected too so things start to travel
backwards<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.990> time<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.470> sorts<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> weird
