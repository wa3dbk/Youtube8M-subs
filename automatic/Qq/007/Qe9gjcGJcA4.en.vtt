00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.229
 or what this base silvia on behalf of 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.110
 laugh point control small bible 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:12.440
 demonstrated in what we are going to eat today 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:18.020
 There are 34 maximum 5 minutes of preparation 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.850
 it's an ecological beef stage and it 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.119
 they prepare a salad of three 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.350
 ingredients the cucumber lettuce and a 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.690
 mango and I just put it in pieces 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.239
 large cantv then he put pepper salt 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.500
 a little need a little lemon and 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.989
 until a fast but healthy and rich meal 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.300
 but that does not prove the reverse and see you 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.030
 in a pair of a dotcom league and also 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.130
 I hope you are aware that my 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.870
 electronic book that is called absolute 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.610
 ten minutes that the week will come out 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.610
 that a kiss is coming 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.360
 well that's how it looks when the 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.150
 meat and the delicious salad 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.470
 nothing easier faster and more 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.470
 healthy impossible 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.940
 I came up with another idea to add to this 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.550
 video and it was about leaving the food 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.400
 after eating when it is already 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.280
 satisfied because many people or the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.880
 most people are that it's a thing of 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.010
 the society say you have to finish 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.180
 the plate does not have to leave anything there is no 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.740
 to throw nothing because you have to think 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.740
 look at the food donkey 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.310
 good they teach us that we have to eat everything 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.980
 what is on the plate the parents 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.050
 punish children when they do not finish 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.210
 on a plate they have to be seated 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.390
 they finish and they spend hours 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.150
 at the table or sitting at the table with the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.009
 food and without eating it 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.810
 and it is also a punishment and also 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.840
 punish children with food 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.800
 Sometimes they say if you behave bad but 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.440
 like this dish you do not get the dessert 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.770
 or the sweet or when we behave well 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.620
 they give us an ice cream or a sweet when 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.650
 we hurt ourselves they give us a sweet 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.710
 they tell us automaq and how brave that 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:37.800
 you are and so we learn to relate 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.290
 certain beliefs or certain things with the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.990
 food and that's why many people 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.050
 It costs to leave the food even though it's 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.460
 satisfied has to eat more and more to 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.310
 me for example 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.040
 It always cost me a lot to leave the food 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.900
 and I even eat the remains of my 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.900
 friends to my friends sometimes 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.510
 They called me garbage because I ate 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.730
 what I think was left was eaten with two 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.130
 friends with him had eat teenager and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.910
 the girls left what they wanted 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.130
 eat and I felt mothers you can not 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.410
 leave the food you can not throw away and I 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.569
 I ate everything 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.700
 I was fatter than them 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.879
 good are things that put us in the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.879
 head 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.220
 are things that we have that has in the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.610
 head that you have to finish the plate 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.700
 and good is not good to coordinate 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.830
 dishes and eat half and then throw it 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.740
 everything first what can be done is 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.470
 fill the plate with less food here 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.600
 for example it was a piece of meat and a 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.510
 small salad and enough to 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.490
 fill me some works and then I have a 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.800
 little more hungry I can eat a 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.910
 fruit or yogurt or I do not know if it's left 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.370
 salad eat a little more 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.000
 first I'm on the plate with less 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.770
 food and if you see that you feel that still 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.470
 he's a little hungry as he is a bit 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.790
 more but do not fill the plate so full 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.700
 and then if you're in the house of some 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.910
 friend or friends and invites you to eat and you 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.380
 fill a dish like that and you feel like you can not 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.930
 leave the food because it is bad education 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.560
 good that your health is more important or 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.710
 how you feel and your well-being or how you 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.860
 feel the others I think that if not 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.920
 You can make yourself happy or you 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.820
 It is impossible to make others happy 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.220
 people 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.090
 you have to start changing yourself 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.820
 same 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.800
 It will improve your health and physical state 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.590
 mental to then be able to help the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.010
 the rest 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.280
 you're not hungry because you keep eating 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.610
 be aware that when you no longer have 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.090
 hunger is not necessary 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.280
 eat what's left there are several options or 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.250
 six little you throw it or if you do not put it 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.949
 in a tupper and you put it in the fridge or 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.229
 you take it if you are in your house 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:21.879
 friend or friend and would start it next 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:24.759
 nights but that's the main thing 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.500
 What I wanted to say is that when we are 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.479
 children our parents teach us things 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.259
 that in the future does not serve us much for 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.840
 Be in shape 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.770
 they tell us your plate ends or you 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:43.139
 punish us 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:45.389
 they give us food as a thing after 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.819
 of doing something right then when we 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.740
 we feel bad as adults what we're going 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:52.229
 is to the food because that we have 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.689
 learned that we do not have pain like 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.739
 children 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:59.809
 they give us a sweet we feel we feel 

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:03.789
 sad as adults and we go to the 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:07.249
 refrigerator be aware of this and 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.709
 leave the food of dishes and you no longer have 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:12.909
 Hungry though we see each other in Paris belly 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:12.909
 dotcom chau
