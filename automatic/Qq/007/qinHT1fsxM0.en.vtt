frequently about a DSP traffic one does

frequently about a DSP traffic one does
the<00:00:22.110> traffic<00:00:22.530> have<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:23.010> equipped<00:00:23.250> with<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
DSP for me to see them and the answer is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.200

this is really only limited by how many
traffic<00:01:55.320> targets<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> your<00:01:56.250> display<00:01:56.610> will

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
traffic targets that your display will

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.700 
traffic targets that your display will
handle<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.200> useful<00:01:58.619> in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
handle and this is very useful in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.850 
handle and this is very useful in
congested<00:01:59.250> airspace<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.710> you're

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
congested airspace and if you're

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
congested airspace and if you're
wondering<00:02:02.189> about<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.490> accuracy<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.479> DSP

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
wondering about the accuracy of a DSP

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:14.590 
wondering about the accuracy of a DSP
traffic<00:02:04.439> take<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> look<00:02:05.220> at<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.430> next<00:02:05.700> clip

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:28.690 

you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.920 

so<00:02:29.700> what<00:02:29.850> does<00:02:29.970> all<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.270> mean<00:02:30.420> for<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.690> GA

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so what does all this mean for the GA

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.340 
so what does all this mean for the GA
pilot<00:02:31.440> well<00:02:32.250> first<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.930> gives<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
pilot well first of all it gives you a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.260 
pilot well first of all it gives you a
much<00:02:34.590> better<00:02:34.800> picture<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.520> skies<00:02:35.850> around

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
much better picture of the skies around

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.630 
much better picture of the skies around
you<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.690> with<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> right<00:02:37.440> display<00:02:37.950> allows

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
you and with the right display allows

you and with the right display allows
you<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.940> quickly<00:02:39.180> identify<00:02:39.530> potential

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
you to quickly identify potential

threats before they become an issue the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.290 
threats before they become an issue the
