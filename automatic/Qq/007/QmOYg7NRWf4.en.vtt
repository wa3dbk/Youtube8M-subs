00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.230 
to gain so much weight from the time
that<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> senior<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.580> high<00:00:29.670> school<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that I was a senior in high school to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
that I was a senior in high school to
right<00:00:30.359> now<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.260> these<00:00:31.380> are<00:00:31.560> three<00:00:31.800> outside<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
right now so these are three outside the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.670 
right now so these are three outside the
boxes<00:00:32.669> gained<00:00:33.540> weight<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.140> fast

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
boxes gained weight really fast

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.160 
boxes gained weight really fast
number<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.149> started<00:00:36.570> utilizing<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
number one is I started utilizing the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.910 
number one is I started utilizing the
post-workout<00:00:37.860> insulin<00:00:38.070> spike<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
post-workout insulin spike you want to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
post-workout insulin spike you want to
maximize<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.460> insulin<00:00:41.940> levels<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> gain

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
maximize your insulin levels to gain

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.030 
maximize your insulin levels to gain
weight<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> increase<00:00:43.559> your<00:00:43.590> anabolic

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
weight and increase your anabolic

00:00:44.040 --> 00:01:03.200 
weight and increase your anabolic
hormones<00:01:01.399> powder<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.760> post-workout

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
hormones powder and your post-workout

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200 
hormones powder and your post-workout
shake<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.799> recommend<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> two-to-one

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
shake and I recommend the two-to-one

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
shake and I recommend the two-to-one
ratio<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.110> 30<00:01:07.380> grams<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.799> protein

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
ratio so if you have 30 grams of protein

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:18.050 
ratio so if you have 30 grams of protein
put<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> about<00:01:09.090> 60<00:01:09.510> grams<00:01:16.670> breaking<00:01:17.670> down<00:01:17.850> all

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
put it about 60 grams breaking down all

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.700 
put it about 60 grams breaking down all
of<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.270> muscle<00:01:18.570> glycogen<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
of your muscle glycogen so all this is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:43.550 
of your muscle glycogen so all this is
doing<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.189> its<00:01:20.369> replenishing<00:01:25.490> nutrients<00:01:42.560> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
doing is its replenishing nutrients and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
doing is its replenishing nutrients and
its<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.220> caloric<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.240> high<00:01:45.420> in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
its really caloric but it's high in

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.690 
its really caloric but it's high in
monounsaturated<00:01:46.070> healthy<00:01:47.070> fats<00:01:47.340> which<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
monounsaturated healthy fats which is

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.120 
monounsaturated healthy fats which is
you<00:01:48.119> know<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> vital<00:01:48.920> characteristic<00:01:49.920> for

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you know a vital characteristic for

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.350 
you know a vital characteristic for
gaining<00:01:50.430> weight<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.850> increasing<00:01:51.210> those

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
gaining weight and increasing those

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
gaining weight and increasing those
anabolic<00:01:51.869> hormones<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.439> belly<00:01:52.590> muscles<00:01:52.799> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
anabolic hormones and belly muscles so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550 
anabolic hormones and belly muscles so
to<00:01:53.880> tip<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.630> peanut<00:01:54.990> butter<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.259> almond
