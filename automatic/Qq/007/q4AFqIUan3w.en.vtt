have complete control over as you can
see<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.460> if<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.670> hit<00:01:09.060> play<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.180> see

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
see if I if I just hit play you can see

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.149 
see if I if I just hit play you can see
it's<00:01:14.250> controlling<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.590> control

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it's controlling here you can control

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.580 
it's controlling here you can control
the<00:01:20.310> volume<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:23.580> fingers

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:38.530 

so<00:01:35.470> this<00:01:36.470> does<00:01:36.740> have<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.100> work<00:01:37.280> over<00:01:37.610> Wi-Fi<00:01:37.850> so

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
so this does have to work over Wi-Fi so

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.330 
so this does have to work over Wi-Fi so
as<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:39.170> see<00:01:40.030> my<00:01:41.030> Wi-Fi<00:01:41.510> is<00:01:41.570> on<00:01:41.869> here<00:01:42.350> and

as you can see my Wi-Fi is on here and
my<00:01:44.330> Wi-Fi<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:45.050> here<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.470> has<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.830> be<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.070> the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
my Wi-Fi is on here it has to be on the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.950 
my Wi-Fi is on here it has to be on the
same<00:01:46.369> Wi-Fi<00:01:46.580> network<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.390> order<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:47.810> this<00:01:47.900> to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
same Wi-Fi network in order for this to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.490 
same Wi-Fi network in order for this to
work<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.759> some<00:01:49.759> of<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.940> cool<00:01:50.150> features<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.930> you
