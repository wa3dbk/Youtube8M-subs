00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.640 
want is a breakout exactly
so<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.790> foundation<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.020> an<00:01:40.140> open<00:01:40.290> pot

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
so with foundation if it's an open pot

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
so with foundation if it's an open pot
and<00:01:40.829> you're<00:01:40.920> constantly<00:01:41.579> double<00:01:41.939> dipping<00:01:42.180> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and you're constantly double dipping I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.450 
and you're constantly double dipping I
would<00:01:42.360> say<00:01:42.509> six<00:01:42.899> months<00:01:43.259> six<00:01:43.770> months<00:01:43.890> get<00:01:44.280> rid

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
would say six months six months get rid

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
would say six months six months get rid
of<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.329> pump<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.229> why<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of it if it's a pump and this is why I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.679 
of it if it's a pump and this is why I
like<00:01:46.710> using<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.159> pump<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:48.119> use<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.570> up

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
like using a pump you can use it for up

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.980 
like using a pump you can use it for up
to<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.470> year<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.310> two<00:01:50.579> years<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.720> you're

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to one year to two years because you're

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
to one year to two years because you're
not<00:01:52.110> constantly<00:01:52.500> dipping<00:01:53.040> into<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
not constantly dipping into it now the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
not constantly dipping into it now the
thing<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.450> about<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.840> pump<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.409> when

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
thing I like about the pump is that when

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
thing I like about the pump is that when
you<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:55.920> finished<00:01:56.399> using<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.390> great

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you are finished using it it's a great

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.389 
you are finished using it it's a great
time<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> try<00:01:58.320> something<00:01:58.649> new<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.130> your

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
time to try something new I think your

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.030 
time to try something new I think your
skin<00:01:59.759> gets<00:02:00.000> used<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.810> having<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.409> formula<00:02:01.979> on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
skin gets used to having that formula on

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.499 
skin gets used to having that formula on
it<00:02:02.189> sometimes<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.119> look

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
foundation after the pump is over

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.370

preservatives in them think of them as
food<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.590> would<00:02:47.680> put<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:47.980> your

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
refrigerator if you keep them in your

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.390 
refrigerator if you keep them in your
refrigerator<00:02:50.080> they'll<00:02:50.770> last<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.190> little

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
refrigerator they'll last a little

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.880 
refrigerator they'll last a little
longer<00:02:51.550> but<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.630> natural<00:02:52.900> stuff<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.500> gonna<00:02:53.650> go

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
longer but the natural stuff is gonna go

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.740 
longer but the natural stuff is gonna go
way<00:02:54.190> quicker<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:54.880> we're<00:02:55.030> talking<00:02:55.330> like<00:02:55.480> three

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
way quicker so we're talking like three

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.280 
way quicker so we're talking like three
months<00:02:56.200> six<00:02:56.800> months<00:02:57.150> got<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.600> think<00:02:58.990> it's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
months six months got it I think it's

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.810 
months six months got it I think it's
important<00:02:59.650> because<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.920> don't<00:03:00.040> want<00:03:00.280> bacteria

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820
