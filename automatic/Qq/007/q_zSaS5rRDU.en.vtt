00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.999 
but what's happened over the last few
decades<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.929> a<00:01:45.140> lot<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.619> infrastructure

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
decades is a lot of the infrastructure

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.459 
decades is a lot of the infrastructure
that<00:01:46.189> was<00:01:46.340> built<00:01:46.450> designed<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:47.810> in<00:01:47.929> place<00:01:48.259> to

that was built designed and in place to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.639 
that was built designed and in place to
be<00:01:48.619> used<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.969> paid<00:01:50.600> for<00:01:50.780> by<00:01:50.899> taxpayer<00:01:51.409> money

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.510 
be used and paid for by taxpayer money
is<00:01:51.860> now<00:01:52.899> being<00:01:53.899> used<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.829> divert<00:01:55.189> water<00:01:55.219> away

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
is now being used to divert water away

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.950 
is now being used to divert water away
from<00:01:55.880> us<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.149> it's<00:01:56.299> not<00:01:56.390> being<00:01:56.600> used<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.869> way

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
from us and it's not being used the way

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.510 
from us and it's not being used the way
it's<00:01:57.049> supposed<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.350> be<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.219> what<00:01:58.399> we've

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
it's supposed to be and so what we've

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.249 
it's supposed to be and so what we've
got<00:01:58.700> today<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.000> we've<00:01:59.450> got<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.630> real<00:01:59.899> drought

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
got today is we've got a real drought

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.080 
got today is we've got a real drought
something<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:00.829> we<00:02:00.920> can't<00:02:01.130> control<00:02:01.520> but<00:02:01.729> then

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
something that we can't control but then

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.029 
something that we can't control but then
we've<00:02:02.209> got<00:02:02.390> water<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.840> we've<00:02:02.959> received<00:02:03.469> from

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
we've got water that we've received from

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.559 
we've got water that we've received from
the<00:02:04.459> little<00:02:04.819> bit<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.030> water<00:02:05.149> we've<00:02:05.329> gotten

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
the little bit of water we've gotten

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.359 
the little bit of water we've gotten
from<00:02:05.659> rainfall<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.259> from<00:02:06.380> snowpack<00:02:06.799> that<00:02:07.039> is

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
from rainfall and from snowpack that is

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.029 
from rainfall and from snowpack that is
just<00:02:07.549> being<00:02:07.729> wasted<00:02:08.179> out<00:02:08.269> into<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.539> ocean

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
just being wasted out into the ocean

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.830 
just being wasted out into the ocean
well<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.190> it's<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.580> complex<00:02:11.180> water<00:02:11.390> system

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
well it's it's a complex water system

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.479 
well it's it's a complex water system
probably<00:02:12.049> one<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.620> more<00:02:12.769> complex<00:02:13.220> water

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
probably one of the more complex water

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.410 
probably one of the more complex water
systems<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.209> world<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.920> water<00:02:16.420> supply

what we got wasn't managed very well
so<00:03:35.740> if<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.520> think<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.940> we<00:03:37.150> got<00:03:37.330> a<00:03:37.360> small<00:03:37.750> pie

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
so if you think of it we got a small pie

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.710 
so if you think of it we got a small pie
from<00:03:38.349> Mother<00:03:38.590> Nature<00:03:38.980> but<00:03:39.550> then<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.970> take<00:03:40.209> half

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
from Mother Nature but then to take half

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.800 
from Mother Nature but then to take half
or<00:03:41.080> in<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.590> instance<00:03:41.910> 7/8<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.300> pie<00:03:43.510> and
