the second major flaw with the combat is

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.100 
the second major flaw with the combat is
the<00:04:35.310> AI<00:04:35.430> they<00:04:36.060> just<00:04:36.270> don't<00:04:36.510> seem<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.750> react

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
the AI they just don't seem to react

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.260 
the AI they just don't seem to react
fairly<00:04:37.560> sometimes<00:04:38.430> they<00:04:38.670> don't<00:04:38.820> even<00:04:38.940> move

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
fairly sometimes they don't even move

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.390 
fairly sometimes they don't even move
because<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.780> various<00:04:40.140> bugs<00:04:40.380> whenever<00:04:41.160> you

because the various bugs whenever you

because the various bugs whenever you
grab<00:04:41.760> an<00:04:41.940> enemy<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.450> then<00:04:42.600> slice<00:04:43.350> them<00:04:43.620> you

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
grab an enemy and then slice them you

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.500 
grab an enemy and then slice them you
can<00:04:43.920> repeat<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.370> process<00:04:44.580> without<00:04:45.090> fear<00:04:45.480> of

can repeat the process without fear of

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.270 
can repeat the process without fear of
harm<00:04:45.840> because<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.620> game<00:04:46.770> lets<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.100> perform
