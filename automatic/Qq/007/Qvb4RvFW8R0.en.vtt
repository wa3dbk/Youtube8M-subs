for humans to consume and I know we've

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.469 
for humans to consume and I know we've
consumed<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:41.909> long<00:01:42.150> time<00:01:42.329> but

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
consumed it for a really long time but

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.520

there's a lot of research out there that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
lot of variety of different reasons I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.399 
lot of variety of different reasons I
know<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> fact<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.329> an<00:01:48.509> unnecessary

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
know for a fact that it's an unnecessary

know for a fact that it's an unnecessary
crop<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.220> food<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.899> consume

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
do it and my reasons for doing it are

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
do it and my reasons for doing it are
very<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.399> simple<00:01:56.969> um<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.079> heavily

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the time when we disturbed you it's very

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.020 
the time when we disturbed you it's very
low<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.650> fiber<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.040> very<00:02:14.400> high<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.730> calorie

and it's easy to get the calories and
nutrition<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.880> would<00:02:18.030> get<00:02:18.180> from<00:02:18.450> wheat
