00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.549
 second course video lesson how easy 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.650
 increase the jump and the second block is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.100
 stability we will talk about 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.390
 joint stability especially 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.670
 focus on sustainability 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 hip joints as they are 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.099
 key part which is responsible for 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.810
 lower body block stability 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 important because it increases 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.790
 the effectiveness of our movements and this is in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.520
 turn important because we want 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.940
 use all the power that can 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.170
 create our lossless muscles 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.390
 if we can't max out 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.129
 use our movements then we don't 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.559
 can take advantage of this power 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.280
 correctly in order to perform 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.930
 further exercises from 3 blocks 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.329
 consistency most programs 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.949
 focused on sustainability knee but 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.079
 actually hip affects 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.120
 knee resistance but not only my 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.970
 the press is also a major 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.880
 the main part of our rods and that is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.310
 our foundations are about giving stability to the feet 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.950
 but the shoulders and pectoral muscles are also 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.290
 the basis of our skeleton is precisely why 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.720
 it is important to have these parts and trained 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.220
 when you hear a person say what 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.130
 he has a good technique 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.189
 it means trained the basis then 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.920
 there is a press chest shoulders these particular groups 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.000
 muscles are responsible for the balance jump technique 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.409
 and in particular for the stability of our legs 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.490
 the first exercise of our complex 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.310
 sustainability 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.650
 are circles lying down all that you 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.689
 you need it to lie on the left side 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.210
 record and fix with your left hand 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.430
 head secure on the floor of the thigh then 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.030
 counterclockwise without interruption 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.159
 almost all the exercises of the complex 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.740
 sustainability based on workout 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.719
 gluteus muscles because they are very 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.700
 important for the stability of the hip 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.080
 the second exercise of the complex 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.420
 sustainability is 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.090
 volume trouble all you need to get up 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.950
 supporting foot on the hill and to 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.560
 she was on the surface 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.380
 author and in the air grab his hands 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.380
 train and lift your left foot up a little 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.350
 higher than the right then omit the case 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.900
 exercise for both legs make sure that 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.260
 you feel the muscles of your buttocks 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.000
 shrink and tighten third 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.880
 exercise complex sustainability 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.800
 is squatting on one leg 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.350
 which is airborne while 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.380
 should be at a 90 degree angle 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.380
 put the whole body on the heel of the support leg 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.780
 don't squat too low our task 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.780
 improve the stability of our hips 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.050
 the last exercise of the complex 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.930
 sustainability called bike 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.590
 which perfectly calls our flexors 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.290
 leg muscles and lower abs lie on 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.720
 back on the floor bend legs under 90 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.340
 degrees parallel to the floor and follow 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.280
 movement as if you were pedaling 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.650
 bike why do we do it 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.380
 exercise then because we start 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.860
 compress your muscles creating pressure on your hips 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.080
 and strengthen the abdominal muscles here it is 4 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.940
 basic exercises that you should 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.220
 perform to improve your 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.220
 resilience and increase your jump
