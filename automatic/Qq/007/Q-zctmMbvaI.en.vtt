decades ago however the the question of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.150 
decades ago however the the question of

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
they should have input I think it's a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.870 
they should have input I think it's a
totally<00:02:32.350> legitimate<00:02:32.740> one<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.370> know<00:02:33.460> I<00:02:33.490> think

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
totally legitimate one you know I think

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880 
totally legitimate one you know I think
it's<00:02:34.150> important<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:34.720> organizations<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:35.590> hear

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
it's important for organizations to hear

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.410 
it's important for organizations to hear
from<00:02:36.100> their<00:02:36.310> workers<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.940> they<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.180> regular

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
from their workers and they have regular

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.320 
from their workers and they have regular
systemic<00:02:38.320> input<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.130> makes<00:02:39.310> them<00:02:39.490> better<00:02:39.520> more

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
systemic input it makes them better more

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.870 
systemic input it makes them better more
effective<00:02:40.750> organizations<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:42.400> dilemma<00:02:42.790> that

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
effective organizations the dilemma that

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.030 
effective organizations the dilemma that
we<00:02:43.060> face<00:02:43.390> as<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.660> society<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.860> when

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
we face as a society is that when

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.730 
we face as a society is that when
workers<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.760> schools<00:02:46.540> are<00:02:46.900> organized<00:02:47.440> into

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
workers in schools are organized into

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.730 
workers in schools are organized into
powerful<00:02:48.220> unions<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.690> unions<00:02:50.110> use<00:02:50.470> that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
powerful unions the unions use that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.480 
powerful unions the unions use that
power<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:52.000> protect<00:02:52.300> jobs<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.830> protect<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
power to protect jobs and to protect the

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.860 
power to protect jobs and to protect the
occupational<00:02:55.240> interests<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.690> their<00:02:55.810> members

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
occupational interests of their members

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.410 
occupational interests of their members
and<00:02:56.470> therefore<00:02:57.190> they<00:02:57.610> do<00:02:57.670> things<00:02:58.210> in

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
and therefore they do things in

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.600 
and therefore they do things in
collective<00:02:59.170> bargaining<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.070> politics

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
collective bargaining and in politics

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.330 
collective bargaining and in politics
that<00:03:01.240> turn<00:03:01.540> out<00:03:01.720> not<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.080> be<00:03:02.350> good<00:03:02.590> for

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
that turn out not to be good for

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.400 
that turn out not to be good for
children<00:03:03.730> or<00:03:03.910> for<00:03:03.970> effective<00:03:04.600> education<00:03:05.200> and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
children or for effective education and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.400 
children or for effective education and
this<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.550> dilemma<00:03:06.910> that's<00:03:07.240> very<00:03:07.600> real<00:03:08.050> and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
this is a dilemma that's very real and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.310 
this is a dilemma that's very real and
that<00:03:08.920> we<00:03:09.070> need<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.280> do<00:03:09.490> something<00:03:09.880> about<00:03:10.320> well

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
that we need to do something about well

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.740 
that we need to do something about well
aren't<00:03:12.280> things<00:03:12.460> changing<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.150> mean<00:03:13.360> really

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
aren't things changing I mean really

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.720 
aren't things changing I mean really
when<00:03:14.080> I<00:03:14.110> talk<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.590> people<00:03:14.740> about<00:03:15.010> teachers

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
when I talk to people about teachers

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.390 
when I talk to people about teachers
unions<00:03:16.210> lots<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.380> people<00:03:17.680> suggest<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.190> the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
unions lots of people suggest that the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.870 
unions lots of people suggest that the
real<00:03:18.580> answer<00:03:18.850> is<00:03:19.740> reform<00:03:20.740> union<00:03:21.220> unionism

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
real answer is reform union unionism

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.950 
real answer is reform union unionism
where<00:03:22.770> we<00:03:23.770> just<00:03:24.010> get<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.940> same<00:03:25.150> side<00:03:25.480> the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
where we just get on the same side the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
where we just get on the same side the
unions<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.070> school<00:03:27.370> reformist<00:03:28.150> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
unions in the school reformist and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.320 
unions in the school reformist and
personnel<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.190> schools<00:03:30.460> and<00:03:30.940> do<00:03:31.180> the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
personnel in the schools and do the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.670 
personnel in the schools and do the
right<00:03:31.450> thing<00:03:31.780> don't<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.350> think<00:03:32.440> that's

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
right thing don't you think that's

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.670 
right thing don't you think that's
really<00:03:33.280> going<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.270> change<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.870> story<00:03:35.410> from

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
really going to change the story from

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.830 
really going to change the story from
what<00:03:35.920> you've<00:03:36.100> written<00:03:36.300> no<00:03:39.690> basically<00:03:40.690> it's

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
what you've written no basically it's

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.650 
what you've written no basically it's
just<00:03:41.080> wishful<00:03:41.500> thinking<00:03:41.710> it's<00:03:42.550> a<00:03:42.850> recognition

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
just wishful thinking it's a recognition

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.480 
just wishful thinking it's a recognition
that<00:03:43.990> yeah<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.560> know<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.800> unions<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.310> done

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
that yeah you know the unions have done

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.310 
that yeah you know the unions have done
a<00:03:45.520> lot<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:45.760> things<00:03:46.060> over<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.600> last<00:03:46.630> few

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
a lot of things over the last few

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.370 
a lot of things over the last few
decades<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:48.550> are<00:03:48.670> not<00:03:48.880> good<00:03:49.120> for<00:03:49.150> kids<00:03:49.510> you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
decades that are not good for kids you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.470 
decades that are not good for kids you
know<00:03:50.410> from<00:03:50.830> seniority<00:03:51.550> rules<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:52.090> opposing

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
know from seniority rules to opposing

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.310 
know from seniority rules to opposing
school<00:03:52.960> choice<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.530> opposing<00:03:53.890> accountability

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
school choice to opposing accountability

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.840 
school choice to opposing accountability
and<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.100> question<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.430> have<00:03:57.550> to<00:03:57.640> ask

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
and so the question you have to ask

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.220 
and so the question you have to ask
yourself<00:03:58.210> is<00:03:58.330> why<00:03:58.510> do<00:03:58.570> they<00:03:58.840> do<00:03:58.900> these<00:03:59.170> things

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
yourself is why do they do these things

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.590 
yourself is why do they do these things
you<00:03:59.860> know<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.520> it's<00:04:01.120> not<00:04:01.300> an<00:04:01.450> accident

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
you know and and it's not an accident

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.480 
you know and and it's not an accident
they<00:04:02.050> do<00:04:02.110> these<00:04:02.380> things<00:04:02.440> because<00:04:02.920> it's<00:04:03.340> in

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
they do these things because it's in

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.190 
they do these things because it's in
their<00:04:03.640> interests<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.300> do<00:04:04.750> these<00:04:04.930> things

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
their interests to do these things

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.110
