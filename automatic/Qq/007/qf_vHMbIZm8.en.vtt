00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
kind of revolves around technology not

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.210 
kind of revolves around technology not
necessarily<00:02:15.209> wearables<00:02:15.630> there's<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.739> much

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
necessarily wearables there's so much

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.490 
necessarily wearables there's so much
that<00:02:17.519> goes<00:02:17.579> into<00:02:17.639> this<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.109> beauty<00:02:19.350> tech

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that goes into this so the beauty tech

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080 
that goes into this so the beauty tech
is<00:02:19.620> kind<00:02:19.799> of<00:02:19.859> cool<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:20.220> different<00:02:20.459> ways<00:02:20.819> that

technology but I was still shocked that

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.670 
technology but I was still shocked that
it<00:02:45.420> actually<00:02:45.600> worked<00:02:45.989> recovering<00:02:46.500> something

around town like taking with them and
it's<00:03:45.930> cool<00:03:46.200> because<00:03:46.380> YouTube<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.280> such<00:03:47.610> a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
it's cool because YouTube is such a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.030 
it's cool because YouTube is such a
platform<00:03:48.180> for<00:03:48.570> people<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:49.110> be<00:03:49.260> creative<00:03:49.620> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
platform for people to be creative and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.670 
platform for people to be creative and
to<00:03:50.670> really<00:03:50.940> do<00:03:51.150> whatever<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.840> want<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.230> do<00:03:52.410> I

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
to really do whatever you want to do I

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.530 
to really do whatever you want to do I
mean<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.250> technically<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.210> is<00:03:54.300> called

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
mean that technically it is called

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.330 
mean that technically it is called
YouTube<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.260> about<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.160> think

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
YouTube so it is about you and I think

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.620 
YouTube so it is about you and I think
the<00:03:56.400> ad<00:03:56.520> campaign<00:03:56.880> is<00:03:57.000> awesome<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.480> think

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
the ad campaign is awesome and I think

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.330 
the ad campaign is awesome and I think
it<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:57.870> kind<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.200> gives<00:03:58.350> more<00:03:58.620> visibility<00:03:58.980> to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
it just kind of gives more visibility to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.700 
it just kind of gives more visibility to
YouTube<00:04:00.240> creators<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.080> not<00:04:01.410> just<00:04:01.590> those

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
YouTube creators and not just those

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.410 
YouTube creators and not just those
three<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.400> everyone<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:02.940> bringing<00:04:03.240> more

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
three it to everyone it's bringing more

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.060 
three it to everyone it's bringing more
awareness<00:04:03.720> but<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.470> hard<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.860> have<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
awareness but it is hard you have to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.160 
awareness but it is hard you have to
stay<00:04:05.370> relevant<00:04:05.640> but<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:05.880> think<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.690> thing<00:04:06.930> is

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
stay relevant but I think the thing is

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.960 
stay relevant but I think the thing is
is<00:04:07.410> if<00:04:07.530> you're<00:04:07.800> not<00:04:07.950> enjoying<00:04:08.400> making<00:04:08.850> your

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
is if you're not enjoying making your

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.820 
is if you're not enjoying making your
content<00:04:09.360> nobody<00:04:09.870> else<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.230> going<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.560> enjoy<00:04:10.680> it

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
content nobody else is going to enjoy it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.710 
content nobody else is going to enjoy it
either<00:04:11.010> there's<00:04:11.670> always<00:04:11.850> new<00:04:12.090> audiences<00:04:12.540> out
