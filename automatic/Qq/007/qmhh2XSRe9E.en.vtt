00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
 Hi all 

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.960
 well a few weeks ago I had a breakfast in a restaurant as well as 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.769
 I finished getting ready with plenty of time before I decided to go a bit 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:10.729
 TV 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:15.099
 what was my surprise when I switched to channel 5 I discovered that it was that 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.669
 famous caricature that I wanted when I was little, that is, the Smurfs 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.470
 however on that occasion 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.669
 and the series with totally different eyes 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.319
 but before speaking about them I would like to give you a brief review 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.460
 cultural about this series 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.579
 the creator of the Smurfs was certain information or cid or by the pseudonym 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.410
 from third parties 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.950
 this artist created the Smurfs in 1958 as secondary characters for 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.540
 his comics said before running away but later they got the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.770
 protagonist of a magazine of their own and then managed to get to the screen 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.830
 Girl in the United States with the name of Esports an animated series 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.340
 support barbera 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.420
 Now he had told them that on that day the Smurfs of a 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.269
 total way 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.990
 different people and is that I realized something 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.640
 curious and apparently I'm not the only one who thought something similar 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.830
 what I mean is that the Smurfs are rather a campaign 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.180
 advertising of Marxist doctrine in the years of the famous Cold War 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.640
 to understand this it is necessary to know a little about the doctrine of the famous 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.840
 Karl Marx 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.370
 surely many already have basic notions of this but as never before 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.140
 the judge confused there goes another little cultural review 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.680
 for Marx the history of man in society was nothing other than 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.930
 fundamental relationship that exists between man and nature man 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.880
 in such a way that history is born and develops from the first 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.660
 mediation that relates man to nature and at the same time to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.040
 man with other men is to say work 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.160
 this principle gives a pattern to a concept as famous as marx is to say his idea 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.690
 of historical materialism 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.990
 that tells us that the economic structure is the basis 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.300
 that of society 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.680
 Marquez considered society as a structured whole in which the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.150
 determining factors were the factors and relations of production and 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.950
 the warm class struggle in violent revolution the only means 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.380
 to impose the dictatorship of the proletariat a new order that would 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.380
 of leading to a fair and egalitarian society 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.340
 Marx called his doctrine scientific socialism and considered theft picas las 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:22.549
 previous socialist theories but good as this is not a kind of 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.469
 political history sociology or anything like that 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.709
 I'm bored talking a lot I'll leave the information up here 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.069
 If you want to know more, do not be new witnesses, not yourselves. 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.980
 I put this information because it is what I considered basic to understand which 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.980
 is the damn relationship between the Smurfs and the Marx doctrine 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.739
 first of all the alteto smurf is not more than that a village and not a 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.479
 there is no money or private property 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.979
 to the Smurfs to talk about that these difficult goals cost so many 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:58.029
 titles and money or something similar there all substitute and SMEs specific to 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:02.179
 be anti-criticized by the fecyt and community and nobody pituti bought anything 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:06.229
 on the other hand replacing pendeja pituti community there was no 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.559
 division of social classes 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.240
 it's replacement both lived 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.399
 marked and fuji egalitarianism 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.369
 all kind worked together for the team that has to be common within the 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.039
 infrastructure scope 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:22.259
 and I think that damn caricature already made me pitufita year because I can no longer 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:26.759
 stop talking like a smurf but I'll ignore his evil 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.069
 Pituti influence to speak to them as they should 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.339
 let's keep going 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:35.509
 as I told you all those were the blues work for the welfare of the 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.039
 structure of your village and when one of the Smurfs gets to lose 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.509
 Absolutely all Smurfs are going to search 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:47.079
 this end I understand that they are very united and everything else but what the hell 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.229
 jobs they were doing are going to be done alone or that 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:54.889
 finally it was learned that missing Italian is going to collapse everything but if all the 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.389
 idiots Smurfs are going to look for him without him 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.879
 the fundamental reason for creating so many stupidities the socialist doctrine is 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:02.420
 tell 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.550
 how society works as an integrated whole if any of the gears 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.680
 fails everything collapses in such a way that the assholes of the Smurfs give them 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.050
 like losing one of the members of the community who will lose the 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.479
 complete community 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:20.139
 also in d'altea smurf there is no distinction of races all are 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.909
 exactly the same the only difference is his way of dressing 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.080
 good smurf if it's different but only because it's female xd xd xd 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.740
 at this point 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.440
 just like some friends did, they will surely tell me that it is not 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.539
 Possible that the Smurfs represent socialism because they are blue 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.610
 a red wine before which I would respond the same as I answered 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.610
 they do not find it curious that the leader of the area is saying that the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.590
 Charismatic Papa Smurf sight of red unlike all the others 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:51.809
 Smurfs 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.329
 This is because Papa Smurf comes to directly represent Carlos Marx and 

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:01.169
 if you do not believe me let's see the similarities first of all Smurf dad stands out for 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.389
 his abundant white beard that represents that he is already of advanced age as with 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.249
 marx 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.669
 on the other hand papa smurf is the source of ideological support of the community 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.800
 As was the case with Mark Spitz, what placed him as the father of the 

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:19.439
 communist revolution op pardon I was wrong I meant the revolution 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.979
 enjoy the prosecutor cherish cherubs now well 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.979
 they do not also find it curious that the Smurfs do not have their own name 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.870
 Smurfs are identified only by the work they perform within the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.770
 society 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.880
 they were born for a trade impose doing exactly the same thing do not 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.879
 it seems that a totally socialist position 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.120
 although there are still many more arguments to defend the idea that 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.090
 the smurfs are nothing more than a propaganda of the Marxist ideology I 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.199
 I would like to finish this video with only one more argument ie 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.099
 the character of gargamel 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.669
 it will be a simple coincidence that this character that represents 100% the 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.080
 Greed for money is ridiculed by the Smurfs 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.120
 the answer according to them and others more is that not the relationship between gargamel and 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.360
 the Smurfs is perfectly premeditated as a way of 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.669
 oppose capitalism and socialism in such a way that this 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.490
 second ideology impose its superiority 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.160
 on the other hand when observing the character of gargamel we can notice quickly 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.710
 that this man 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.610
 has to represent a clearly aggressive personality and wild what 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.319
 coincidence 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.740
 between minds is the way in which socialist doctrines observed the 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.469
 capitalist system 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:31.029
 well then 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.619
 After listening to all this you will no longer see the Smurfs 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:38.629
 in the same way and whether it is in fact right or that simply 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.259
 It's not hurting to smoke so much marijuana I think it's a subject 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.339
 interesting to try 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:49.219
 If you liked this video do not hesitate to rate subscribe and especially not 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.259
 hesitate to share it with your friends 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.499
 that's all for this occasion 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:58.169
 making your knowledge that any comment you wish to make me 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.959
 either constructive only to fuck will be well received bids farewell 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:06.110
 you the doctor kafka his cause with a small 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.139
 that he has not let me sleep at all well for a few days 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.750
 it's still illegal to autopsy someone alive 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.919
 I hope not because if I do not have a good time in prison 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:18.719
 until next time
