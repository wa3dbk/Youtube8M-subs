00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
the education solution we are working

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.860 
the education solution we are working
with<00:00:48.200> Intel<00:00:48.950> here<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.700> develop<00:00:50.300> new<00:00:50.780> and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
with Intel here to develop new and

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.110 
with Intel here to develop new and

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
exciting solution to share documents

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.660 
exciting solution to share documents
essentially<00:00:53.660> for<00:00:54.260> students<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:54.980> teachers<00:00:55.430> at

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
essentially for students and teachers at

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.970 
essentially for students and teachers at
the<00:00:55.820> same<00:00:56.030> time<00:00:56.329> on<00:00:56.630> whiteboards<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.410> on

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
the same time on whiteboards and on

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.830 
the same time on whiteboards and on
touch<00:00:58.190> displays<00:00:58.700> which<00:00:59.000> are<00:00:59.239> right<00:00:59.480> in<00:00:59.630> front

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
touch displays which are right in front

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.750 
touch displays which are right in front
of<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.170> students<00:01:00.559> at<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.770> teacher<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.610> they

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
of the students at the teacher and they

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.850 
of the students at the teacher and they
can<00:01:02.030> share<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.420> content<00:01:03.110> in<00:01:03.200> real<00:01:03.350> time<00:01:03.590> the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
can share the content in real time the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.679 
can share the content in real time the
cloud<00:01:04.250> solution<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:04.759> really<00:01:05.000> there<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.329> share

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
cloud solution is really there to share

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.840 
cloud solution is really there to share
documents<00:01:06.380> worldwide<00:01:06.799> in<00:01:07.040> real<00:01:07.219> time<00:01:07.490> so

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
documents worldwide in real time so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.819 
documents worldwide in real time so
sharp<00:01:08.210> is<00:01:08.329> going<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.719> offer<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:09.049> service<00:01:09.380> for

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
sharp is going to offer a service for

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.850 
sharp is going to offer a service for
our<00:01:09.890> customers<00:01:10.330> so<00:01:11.330> they<00:01:11.360> can<00:01:11.840> upload<00:01:12.320> their

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
our customers so they can upload their

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.100 
our customers so they can upload their
documents<00:01:13.549> from<00:01:13.700> printers<00:01:14.270> from<00:01:14.600> copiers

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
documents from printers from copiers

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.289 
documents from printers from copiers
into<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.590> cloud<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.400> share<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.850> at<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.090> same

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
into the cloud and share it at the same

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.450 
into the cloud and share it at the same
time<00:01:17.570> with<00:01:17.840> this<00:01:17.990> place<00:01:18.260> around<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.650> world<00:01:18.920> so

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
time with this place around the world so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.480 
time with this place around the world so
this<00:01:19.760> makes<00:01:19.970> collaboration<00:01:20.590> much<00:01:21.590> easier<00:01:22.040> as

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
this makes collaboration much easier as

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.539 
this makes collaboration much easier as
is<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.960> most<00:01:24.140> important<00:01:24.650> here<00:01:24.830> in<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.220> IT

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
is the most important here in this IT

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.730 
is the most important here in this IT
and<00:01:25.940> AV<00:01:26.299> scenery<00:01:26.750> it's<00:01:27.049> not<00:01:27.229> only<00:01:27.560> 80

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
and AV scenery it's not only 80

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.960 
and AV scenery it's not only 80
meanwhile<00:01:28.490> its<00:01:28.670> IT<00:01:28.880> as<00:01:29.119> well<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:30.250> yeah<00:01:31.250> you

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
meanwhile its IT as well and yeah you

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.240 
meanwhile its IT as well and yeah you
know<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:32.119> we<00:01:32.510> have<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.659> new<00:01:33.320> set<00:01:33.590> up<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.220> we

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
know that we have a new set up so we

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.760 
know that we have a new set up so we
show<00:01:34.820> much<00:01:35.180> more<00:01:35.450> visibility<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.280> mark

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
show much more visibility in the mark

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.130 
show much more visibility in the mark
and<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> why<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.929> want

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and this is why we are here so we want

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800 
and this is why we are here so we want
to<00:01:40.200> share<00:01:40.439> our<00:01:40.500> latest<00:01:41.070> technologies<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.329> it's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to share our latest technologies so it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.349 
to share our latest technologies so it's
quite<00:01:43.109> exciting<00:01:43.500> new<00:01:43.859> technology<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
quite exciting new technology so it

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.620 
quite exciting new technology so it
means<00:01:46.310> normal<00:01:47.310> people<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.729> used<00:01:48.030> let's<00:01:48.509> say

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
means normal people are used let's say

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
means normal people are used let's say
to<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.140> lithium<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.700> there's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> new

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
to the lithium and now there's a new

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.630 
to the lithium and now there's a new
technology<00:01:51.990> called<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.429> means

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
technology called it so that means

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.559 
technology called it so that means
indium<00:01:54.119> gallium<00:01:54.149> zinc<00:01:54.899> oxide<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:57.090> makes

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
indium gallium zinc oxide and it makes

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.959 
indium gallium zinc oxide and it makes
everything<00:01:58.429> easier<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:01.340> energy<00:02:02.340> saving<00:02:02.819> on

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
everything easier is energy saving on

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.740 
everything easier is energy saving on
the<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.240> hand<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:04.289> high<00:02:05.009> resolution<00:02:05.750> this

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the one hand it's high resolution this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
the one hand it's high resolution this
is<00:02:06.869> quite<00:02:07.229> important<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.700> more

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
is quite important and it's more

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.600 
is quite important and it's more
transparent<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.709> will<00:02:10.979> have<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.400> say

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
transparent and this will have to say

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.289 
transparent and this will have to say
innovate<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.920> display<00:02:14.250> technology<00:02:14.849> so<00:02:15.120> this

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
innovate the display technology so this

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.720 
innovate the display technology so this
is<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.450> big<00:02:15.829> technology<00:02:16.829> of<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> future<00:02:17.069> we

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
is a big technology of the future we

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.180 
is a big technology of the future we
