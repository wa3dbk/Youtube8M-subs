a-you know they were slowly like
creeping<00:01:00.310> up<00:01:00.460> on<00:01:00.579> price<00:01:00.910> but<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.930> tech<00:01:02.910> for

creeping up on price but the tech for

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.389 
creeping up on price but the tech for
the<00:01:04.030> shoe<00:01:04.239> wasn't<00:01:04.570> quite<00:01:04.989> like<00:01:05.259> at<00:01:05.799> that<00:01:06.130> level

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
the shoe wasn't quite like at that level

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.480 
the shoe wasn't quite like at that level
yet<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:07.689> my<00:01:07.899> opinion<00:01:08.259> I<00:01:08.560> know<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.249> when<00:01:09.369> they

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
yet in my opinion I know that when they

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.940 
yet in my opinion I know that when they
first<00:01:09.789> released<00:01:10.319> think<00:01:11.319> it<00:01:11.409> was<00:01:11.499> the<00:01:11.619> error<00:01:11.770> in

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
first released think it was the error in

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.459 
first released think it was the error in
2009<00:01:13.859> those<00:01:14.909> those<00:01:15.909> were<00:01:16.090> pretty<00:01:16.469> pretty

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
2009 those those were pretty pretty

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.559 
2009 those those were pretty pretty
expensive<00:01:17.889> retail<00:01:18.340> price<00:01:18.819> they<00:01:19.509> were

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
expensive retail price they were

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.230 
expensive retail price they were
slightly<00:01:20.139> less<00:01:20.409> than<00:01:20.619> like<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:21.219> pair<00:01:21.579> of<00:01:21.609> 17<00:01:22.090> s

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
slightly less than like a pair of 17 s

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.840 
slightly less than like a pair of 17 s
like<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:22.929> comparison<00:01:23.530> but<00:01:24.369> they<00:01:24.520> had<00:01:24.670> like

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
like in comparison but they had like

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.749 
like in comparison but they had like
that<00:01:25.060> propulsion<00:01:25.590> technology<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.920> all<00:01:27.399> that

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
that propulsion technology and all that

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.840 
that propulsion technology and all that
stuff<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.409> 2010s<00:01:30.159> again<00:01:30.399> they<00:01:30.520> didn't<00:01:30.759> really

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
stuff the 2010s again they didn't really

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.349 
stuff the 2010s again they didn't really
have<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:32.619> too<00:01:32.799> much<00:01:32.850> actual<00:01:33.850> tech

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
have really too much actual tech

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.989 
have really too much actual tech
upgrades<00:01:34.990> other<00:01:35.380> than<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:36.579> know<00:01:36.609> they<00:01:36.850> had

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
upgrades other than you know they had

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.550 
upgrades other than you know they had
zoom<00:01:37.209> air<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.659> stuff<00:01:37.899> like<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:38.109> but<00:01:38.319> that's

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
zoom air and stuff like that but that's

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.510 
zoom air and stuff like that but that's
pretty<00:01:38.709> much<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:38.979> a<00:01:40.469> 2011<00:01:41.469> I<00:01:41.649> know<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.369> those

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
pretty much it a 2011 I know that those

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.080 
pretty much it a 2011 I know that those
were<00:01:42.819> detailed<00:01:43.060> pretty<00:01:43.359> high<00:01:44.789> they're<00:01:45.789> all<00:01:45.939> on

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
were detailed pretty high they're all on

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.969 
were detailed pretty high they're all on
clearance<00:01:46.209> now<00:01:46.569> but<00:01:46.869> they<00:01:47.469> retail<00:01:47.770> pretty

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
clearance now but they retail pretty

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.289 
clearance now but they retail pretty
high<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.219> I<00:01:48.310> thought<00:01:48.429> that<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.999> shoe

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
high and I thought that that that shoe

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.870 
high and I thought that that that shoe
at<00:01:49.450> least<00:01:49.689> was<00:01:50.249> kind<00:01:51.249> of<00:01:51.340> worth<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.700> because<00:01:51.789> of

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
at least was kind of worth it because of

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.209 
at least was kind of worth it because of
the<00:01:51.999> leather<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.079> they<00:01:53.229> used<00:01:53.469> on<00:01:53.709> them<00:01:54.009> and

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
the leather that they used on them and

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.279 
the leather that they used on them and
then<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.729> had<00:01:54.880> that<00:01:55.119> whole<00:01:55.329> modular<00:01:55.899> set<00:01:56.170> up

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
then it had that whole modular set up

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.919 
then it had that whole modular set up
where<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.469> can<00:01:56.560> change<00:01:57.509> cushioning<00:01:58.509> systems

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
where you can change cushioning systems

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.709 
where you can change cushioning systems
and<00:01:59.289> all<00:01:59.709> that<00:02:00.159> stuff<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:01.389> wasn't<00:02:01.689> really

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
and all that stuff so it wasn't really

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.839 
and all that stuff so it wasn't really
until<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.170> 2011<00:02:02.920> where<00:02:03.069> I<00:02:03.099> was<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.340> like<00:02:03.549> oh

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
until the 2011 where I was just like oh

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.269 
until the 2011 where I was just like oh
200<00:02:04.389> bucks<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:05.109> know<00:02:05.139> that<00:02:05.499> sounds<00:02:06.159> about

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:06.279 
200 bucks you know that sounds about

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.739 
200 bucks you know that sounds about
right<00:02:06.429> for<00:02:06.729> like<00:02:07.060> what<00:02:07.299> they've<00:02:07.450> actually

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
right for like what they've actually

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.580 
right for like what they've actually
offered<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.679> all<00:02:09.490> together<00:02:10.380> whether<00:02:11.380> or<00:02:11.500> not

offered you all together whether or not
they<00:02:11.740> performed<00:02:12.190> well<00:02:12.400> is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
they performed well is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.399 
they performed well is
insignificant<00:02:13.739> but<00:02:14.549> at<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.930> price<00:02:16.140> level

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
insignificant but at the price level

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.640 
insignificant but at the price level
it's<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.549> more<00:02:17.879> of<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.209> what<00:02:18.930> are<00:02:19.049> you<00:02:19.170> getting

buck are you getting I think that those

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.970 
buck are you getting I think that those
are<00:02:22.650> at<00:02:22.860> least<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.840> know<00:02:24.840> quality<00:02:25.140> wise<00:02:25.590> and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
are at least you know quality wise and

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.170 
are at least you know quality wise and
what<00:02:26.099> they<00:02:26.220> come<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.790> all<00:02:26.849> that<00:02:27.030> stuff

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
what they come with and all that stuff

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.490 
what they come with and all that stuff
even<00:02:27.480> though<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.599> kind<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.870> gimmicky<00:02:28.290> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
even though it's kind of gimmicky that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410 
even though it's kind of gimmicky that
at<00:02:28.709> least<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.370> me<00:02:29.519> translates<00:02:30.180> into<00:02:30.329> more

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
at least for me translates into more

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.089 
at least for me translates into more
bang<00:02:30.750> for<00:02:30.959> your<00:02:31.019> buck<00:02:31.079> versus<00:02:31.680> something<00:02:31.950> like

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
bang for your buck versus something like

this is like a really plain kind of

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.339 
this is like a really plain kind of
design<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:39.000> know<00:02:39.150> they're<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:39.900> they're

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
you know I think that they're they're

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.210 
you know I think that they're they're
nicely<00:03:03.420> constructed<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.530> stuff<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.859> like<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
nicely constructed and stuff I like the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.940 
nicely constructed and stuff I like the
whole<00:03:05.400> like<00:03:05.540> it's<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.720> collar<00:03:07.019> here<00:03:07.440> it's

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
whole like it's like collar here it's

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.500 
whole like it's like collar here it's
like<00:03:08.099> neoprene<00:03:08.579> almost<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.180> kind<00:03:09.359> of<00:03:09.420> like

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
like neoprene almost like kind of like

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.649 
like neoprene almost like kind of like
stretchy<00:03:10.079> lycra<00:03:10.950> or<00:03:11.159> spandex<00:03:11.430> type<00:03:12.150> material

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
stretchy lycra or spandex type material

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.839 
stretchy lycra or spandex type material
but<00:03:13.010> other<00:03:14.010> than<00:03:14.129> that<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.579> thought<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
but other than that I just thought the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.729 
but other than that I just thought the
whole<00:03:14.970> thing<00:03:15.030> for<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.599> initial<00:03:16.200> price<00:03:16.500> was

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
whole thing for the initial price was

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.500 
whole thing for the initial price was
cheap<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:17.129> know<00:03:17.220> using<00:03:17.430> plastic<00:03:18.090> instead<00:03:18.389> of

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
cheap you know using plastic instead of

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.039 
cheap you know using plastic instead of
metal<00:03:18.919> like<00:03:19.919> they<00:03:20.790> had<00:03:20.940> done<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.299> years<00:03:21.690> back

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
metal like they had done like years back

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.020 
metal like they had done like years back
prior<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.560> this<00:03:22.829> with<00:03:23.010> air<00:03:23.129> jordan<00:03:23.430> 12<00:03:23.730> and
