00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
from Assassin's Creed 1 arguably in my

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.499 
from Assassin's Creed 1 arguably in my
opinion<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> best<00:00:13.679> from<00:00:14.610> all<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.030> Assassin's

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
opinion the best from all the Assassin's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.630 
opinion the best from all the Assassin's
Creed<00:00:15.570> games<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.410> think<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.070> looks<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
Creed games I think it looks just the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.529 
Creed games I think it looks just the
best<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:19.050> course<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.430> looks<00:00:20.760> we're<00:00:21.330> too

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
best now of course this looks we're too

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.200 
best now of course this looks we're too
good<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.289> probably<00:00:22.650> thinking<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.550> can't<00:00:23.939> be

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
good you probably thinking this can't be

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
good you probably thinking this can't be
made<00:00:24.359> by<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> mother<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.380> RIT<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.980> not

made by a mother and you RIT is not
being<00:00:26.369> made<00:00:26.550> by<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> mother<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.810> course<00:00:27.840> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
being made by a mother this of course is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.580 
being made by a mother this of course is
a<00:00:28.470> PC<00:00:29.279> rip<00:00:29.849> from<00:00:30.599> Assassin's<00:00:31.019> Creed<00:00:31.230> 1<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.500> the

a PC rip from Assassin's Creed 1 on the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
a PC rip from Assassin's Creed 1 on the
PC<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> assets<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.120> been<00:00:33.210> taken<00:00:33.510> of

PC so the assets have been taken of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.080 
PC so the assets have been taken of
course<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> story<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.880> implanted<00:00:35.880> in

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
course you not a story and implanted in

blow ever implanted yeah in the Skyrim
so<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.969> now<00:00:39.059> use<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> one

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
so we can now use it so it is a one

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.799 
so we can now use it so it is a one
piece<00:00:40.980> item<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.090> now<00:00:42.239> some<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> don't

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
piece item and now some of you don't

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.779 
piece item and now some of you don't
like<00:00:43.020> using<00:00:43.410> asset<00:00:43.860> from<00:00:43.950> different<00:00:44.219> games<00:00:44.399> so

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
like using asset from different games so

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
like using asset from different games so
if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.059> don't<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:45.960> your<00:00:46.170> own

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
if you don't like it that's your own

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840 
if you don't like it that's your own
opinion<00:00:46.770> even<00:00:46.920> though<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.700> all

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
opinion even though if you do all

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.819 
opinion even though if you do all
Assassin's<00:00:48.210> Creed<00:00:48.360> 1<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.750> my<00:00:48.870> opinion<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.649> can

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
Assassin's Creed 1 in my opinion you can

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.029 
Assassin's Creed 1 in my opinion you can
use<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.219> anyway<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.440> detail

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
use it anyway as you can see the detail

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.500 
use it anyway as you can see the detail
on<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.610> absolutely<00:00:54.000> amazing<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
on this is absolutely amazing the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
on this is absolutely amazing the
textures<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.140> great<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.520> assume<00:00:56.879> that's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
textures are great and I assume that's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.389 
textures are great and I assume that's
because<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.600> from<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> PC<00:00:58.079> version<00:00:58.500> which

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
because it's from a PC version which

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.310 
because it's from a PC version which
also<00:00:59.879> has<00:01:00.090> good<00:01:00.239> graphics<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.109> why

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
also has good graphics and that is why

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.160 
also has good graphics and that is why
this<00:01:01.800> looks<00:01:02.039> great<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.690> mean<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.840> think<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
this looks great I mean I think it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.450 
this looks great I mean I think it's
much<00:01:04.320> better<00:01:04.379> than<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.010> other

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
much better than the other

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.649 
much better than the other
Assassin's<00:01:05.880> Creed<00:01:06.030> Amber's<00:01:06.299> I've<00:01:06.420> shown<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Assassin's Creed Amber's I've shown you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
Assassin's Creed Amber's I've shown you
because<00:01:07.049> other<00:01:07.350> sort<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.770> altaïr's<00:01:08.220> armor<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
because other sort of altaïr's armor and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.820 
because other sort of altaïr's armor and
you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.689> actually<00:01:09.810> craft<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.380> under<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can actually craft this under the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.710 
you can actually craft this under the
leather<00:01:11.369> section<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> forge<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> can

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
leather section of the forge and you can

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.330 
leather section of the forge and you can
also<00:01:12.840> temper<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.530> believe<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.130> there

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
also temper it now believe it up there

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.100 
also temper it now believe it up there
it<00:01:14.820> isn't<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> Steam<00:01:15.360> Workshop<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.869> course

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it isn't the Steam Workshop of course

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
it isn't the Steam Workshop of course
and<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:17.040> could<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> problem<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.880> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and that could be a problem because this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.570 
and that could be a problem because this
might<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.659> taken<00:01:18.900> down<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.500> imagine<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> will

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
might get taken down I imagine it will

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
might get taken down I imagine it will
do<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:21.090> being<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.420> rip<00:01:21.570> steam<00:01:22.500> sees<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
do because being a rip steam sees it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
do because being a rip steam sees it
once<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.189> owl<00:01:23.340> sees<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.939> course<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.720> have

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
once of owl sees it of course they have

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.620 
once of owl sees it of course they have
to<00:01:25.080> remove<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.500> otherwise<00:01:25.680> he'll<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.070> sued

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
to remove it otherwise he'll get sued

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.620 
to remove it otherwise he'll get sued
yeah<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.229> Garret<00:01:28.650> while<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.210> keep

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
yeah so Garret while you can I will keep

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.740 
yeah so Garret while you can I will keep
this<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.049> my<00:01:31.200> system<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.450> probably<00:01:33.450> will<00:01:33.689> be

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this on my system so I probably will be

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
this on my system so I probably will be
uploading<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> gets<00:01:34.710> taken<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:35.100> as

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
uploading if it gets taken down as

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.370 
uploading if it gets taken down as
always<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.759> guys<00:01:35.970> yeah<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:37.140> pretty

much it
it<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.670> great<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.180> apparently<00:01:39.840> there<00:01:40.229> may<00:01:40.500> be

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it was great now apparently there may be
