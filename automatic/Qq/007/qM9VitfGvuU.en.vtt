we're going to go through the

working<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.460> know<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.000> receiver

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
working on it I know that the receiver

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.819 
working on it I know that the receiver
right<00:00:55.469> away<00:00:55.829> needs<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.550> cord<00:00:57.920> now<00:00:58.920> the<00:01:00.829> insides

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
right away needs a cord now the insides

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.429 
right away needs a cord now the insides
of<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.340> receiver<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> check

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
of this receiver I'm going to check

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.200 
of this receiver I'm going to check
because<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.949> looks<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.369> they're<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.820> here

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
because it looks like they're in here

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.460 
because it looks like they're in here
but<00:01:06.900> I'm<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> take<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.530> apart<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
but I'm going to take this apart and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.789 
but I'm going to take this apart and
sure<00:01:10.470> enough<00:01:11.840> looks<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.080> everything<00:01:13.650> is

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
sure enough looks like everything is

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.230 
sure enough looks like everything is
here<00:01:14.450> hopefully<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:17.240> original

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
here hopefully we can get this original

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.899 
here hopefully we can get this original
receiver<00:01:18.810> working<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.700> would<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:21.000> very<00:01:21.210> nice

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
receiver working that would be very nice

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
receiver working that would be very nice
it's<00:01:23.909> always<00:01:24.150> nice<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.840> always<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> plus<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's always nice it's always a plus to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
it's always nice it's always a plus to
have<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> original<00:01:26.700> equipment<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
have the original equipment and if it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.380 
have the original equipment and if it
sounds<00:01:28.710> good

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
sounds good

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.140 
sounds good
that's<00:01:30.390> great<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.159> we'll<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.850> through<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that's great so we'll go through that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.109 
that's great so we'll go through that
and<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and see what we can do for it if it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.130 
and see what we can do for it if it
needs<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.960> different<00:01:37.590> receiver<00:01:38.520> capsule<00:01:39.270> then

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
needs a different receiver capsule then

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.910 
needs a different receiver capsule then
what<00:01:40.350> we'll<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.100> put<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:42.689> new<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> but

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
what we'll do is put a new one in it but

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
what we'll do is put a new one in it but
I<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.369> try<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> original<00:01:45.600> parts

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
I like to try to get the original parts

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800 
I like to try to get the original parts
working<00:01:46.259> when<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.280> possible<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
working when when it's possible so

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.920 
working when when it's possible so
that's<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.229> receiver<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.540> now<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> did

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that's the receiver on it now I did

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.050 
that's the receiver on it now I did
notice<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:54.420> transmitter<00:01:55.369> is<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
notice that the transmitter is in the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.950 
notice that the transmitter is in the
telephone<00:01:58.340> but<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.549> been<00:01:59.820> disconnected<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
telephone but it's been disconnected and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.840 
telephone but it's been disconnected and
they've<00:02:01.380> pulled<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> wires<00:02:02.100> down<00:02:02.520> through

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
they've pulled the wires down through

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.380 
they've pulled the wires down through
the<00:02:03.000> neck<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.140> candlestick<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:06.210> is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the neck of the candlestick so this is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.040 
the neck of the candlestick so this is
all<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.960> there<00:02:08.239> but<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> don't<00:02:09.569> know<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
all in there but I don't know if it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.050 
all in there but I don't know if it
works<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.619> if<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> initial

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
works so if this is just the initial

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.550 
works so if this is just the initial
check<00:02:12.540> out<00:02:12.780> we're

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
check out we're

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.050 
check out we're
going<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.920> go<00:02:14.190> through<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.000> see

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
going to have to go through that and see

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.160 
going to have to go through that and see
if<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.980> get<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.400> working<00:02:17.700> it'd<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.959> nice

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
if we can get that working it'd be nice

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.229 
if we can get that working it'd be nice
if<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.470> could<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.690> will<00:02:22.880> replace<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
if we could but we will replace the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.320 
if we could but we will replace the
transmitter<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:26.010> need<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.209> it

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
transmitter if we need to so that it

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.490 
transmitter if we need to so that it
sounds<00:02:27.540> good<00:02:27.989> in<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.680> usable<00:02:29.330> for
