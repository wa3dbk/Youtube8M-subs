00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Welcome to wacker tirol today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.270
 the plug-in mob catcher light light it 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.370
 gives a full version of the islam 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 fee but this he would have 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.550
 also thought comes I'm like this 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.519
 friendly and gives a stripped down 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.170
 version the normal level what does this 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.210
 plugin and on the whole we can 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.920
 with eggs or other projectiles the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.930
 wiener congress we can lie 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.699
 Our monsters catch and see content 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.350
 pack in the box or just somewhere 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.119
 Transporting things differently is natural 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.800
 more pleasant than people or pug down and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.060
 to push the whole time 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.619
 you can do with different things 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.360
 with eggs and whatever else 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.579
 That's why we see config what the whole thing 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.290
 At least the lite version is available 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.059
 down here and what the full version can do 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.250
 is then again as 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.930
 full version so who wants to know why 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.370
 some things can not go that can 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.750
 here again read here is what in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.579
 the raffle is in it and what only one 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.379
 light-version trainers have the plugin 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.120
 i just tested the 183 i think on 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.649
 the 18 also works very well with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 I am not sure if this project will work 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.559
 you like that works 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.570
 Try and comment times 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.859
 writing on the bike works like 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.030
 always get the parquet without video 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.469
 description there simply on the link 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.449
 click lands exactly on this homepage 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.769
 and move up here if you can 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.150
 that made grab the plug-in 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.740
 of course with you in your plugin 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.990
 folder I have made catcher sorry 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.430
 and then each folder is created if 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.560
 her our weimar stops and again 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.119
 starts or a mario performs it 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.799
 is okay if catcher in the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.000
 name config a bit 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.650
 but the most important is more extensive 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.420
 of course I'll show you at the end of the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.799
 videos always if we have nothing now 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.720
 want to continue setting 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.689
 then the whole thing works already 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.920
 we only need eggs and throw 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840
 this then for example on this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
 horse 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.619
 accordingly it will be on and here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.049
 can you then over hofer and see you 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.450
 what you have caught is a horse 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.850
 called horse and 27 years old had one 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.530
 Strength of 0 4 and that motto this 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.540
 know data safe that 's just one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.590
 full version why he does that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.520
 did not care 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.920
 In any case, it could be last 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.439
 generate so you can then your rs 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.390
 go here with rumtragen and if you 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.310
 want that to come out here to there 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.659
 master cup just go back 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.939
 of course I'm in game mode now 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.530
 so it comes out different color 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.850
 usually comes the same 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.870
 go out and not here now 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.510

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.580
 pommes pizza goes how does that look 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.710
 out if someone clears up now 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.450
 We have no rights here 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.430
 understand very well 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.110
 I have an account here 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.380
 is the battery on me I would 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.710
 I've decided to start this now 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.370
 cat you see it all works 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.290

 of course, can hoven over and 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.300
 You see what the cat had what I did 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.830
 can and how it is that the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.360
 then throws the cat comes 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.830
 again so you can also village in 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.550
 everything then possible back and forth 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.040
 transport 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.320
 you can stop that you 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.330
 monster can and has now 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.190
 here are such a funny mutant sow 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
 educated now think like already 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.860
 some of you was there was nevertheless times 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.240
 be that now everyone can can then 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.710
 yes somebody come for a color 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.750
 make empty with all my animals the 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.240
 I have been so beautifully maintained here 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.740
 and have gestrehelt yes that can 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.140
 but we can go against something 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.550
 and that's what shield calls itself 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.680
 Shield in hand take it somewhere 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.700
 best always clap in the middle 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.830
 your farm 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.680
 because of the sign from around 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.930
 always ten blocks of business where the person 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.830
 we can not capture animals 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.540
 It's about how I do it now 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.250
 have done and we write in this 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.709
 Just make this sign into it 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.390
 Roger to the top line easy 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.470
 simple yet enroll and then you can 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.360
 you him the other lines angel 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.060
 write in for example alone 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.550
 drive sadly finished and on the sign 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.400
 is there's the name so grab the 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.200
 Well, all this belongs here now and ten 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.060
 blocks around this description are all 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.560
 my fathers business now if you 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.090
 Goals evil faithfully comes with his evil 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.459
 eggs and now want here my funny 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.140
 steal nothing happens that gets 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.580
 just a bell and runs 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.630
 then off the radios and so on 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.640
 of course, everything else in the conflict 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.360
 adjust and go to the computer 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.680
 Let's go now 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.600
 the kontech you will find with you 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.340
 of course in the plug-in folder and there 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.320
 in the folder watcher here we open the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.690
 conficker psion ml and that looks like that 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.070
 out is of course a lot of stuff here 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.720
 but inside most of it is actually in 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.040
 The full version inside is natural 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.450
 here also with it left in it 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.650
 but you can ignore, I will show you 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.720
 just the most important thing 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.850
 what you have to pay attention to first 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.190
 we stop here all your worlds 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.049
 have already been loaded by motive 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.280
 here you can of course again which 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.310
 make others if you do not 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.989
 you wanted animals in the world 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.880
 you could for example but it could 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.860
 continue here or here in the net 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.810
 just continue and nobody can 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.300
 because animals start with it or 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.310
 we can do something similar under the type 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.960
 determine what we animals with 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.389
 By default are eggs 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.340
 but we can do snowballs or file 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.900
 ender beads use if we then 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.730
 just throw on the animals or on 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.070
 the mobs have set lower then 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.690
 let's catch you with these things now 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.880
 we come to the shield protection here 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.070
 Can the radios cutters moderately 10 and 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.050
 The limit per player is three signs 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.030
 So three colors or three times ten 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.650
 then people can go far blocks 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.389
 then secure things yes 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.860
 accordingly could be able to increase 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.990
 you give the people five more signs 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.130
 and increase the radios to 20 that it 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.710
 let's leave it to you 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.419
 If you have iron golems then you wanted 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.620
 can you here this for your villiger 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.600
 grab and if anyone else 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.790
 and she comes somebody or somebody 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.080
 village on the bell then this is here 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.360
 namely, we invite you to true this 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.280
 village attacks the players 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.020
 make it accordingly or if 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.030
 somebody also comes and tries her 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.740
 will capture jets and theirs 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.200
 have green exist if that is on 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.150
 then golems go directly to the 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.320
 players go and want to kill him 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.190
 could be accordingly then 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.169
 emphasize 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.610
 Here the news can issue 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.430
 and the point message is there simply 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.800
 here yes if it's bond or we do not 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.910
 have promotions or capture enable there 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.220
 can you show everything here then 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.840
 also no message is coming as well 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.700
 we have the simple configuration iv 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.830
 can use and down here we can 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.610
 all mops adjust the stop 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.080
 can be 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.700
 Of course the dragon can not be caught 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.010
 could definitely be turned on 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.200
 funny if anyone around with it as such 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.389
 a thing in the village throws but you see 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.010
 you as the leader of the change if the 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.789
 blazer and the guest so what you can 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.410
 could not catch, of course, 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.180
 set up and here you can again 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.320
 stop everything as you hate 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.940
 make out for example the horses 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.410
 make or or or 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.639
 you can set it exactly like 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.560
 like to have it on your server 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.120
 We also wanted the complex 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.010
 configurations and just make here 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.840
 You can not do more on kuwait 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.950
 is the full version available 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.270
 and here we can all again 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.280
 set monsters that you can catch 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.680
 You can also set a chance 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.240
 that's always in percent so 100% has
