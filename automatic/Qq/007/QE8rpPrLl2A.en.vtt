00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
to swim it's how I swim it a lot of the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.190 
to swim it's how I swim it a lot of the
field<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.520> field<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.000> starting<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> come

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
field the field is just starting to come

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800 
field the field is just starting to come
back<00:01:40.230> so<00:01:40.410> fast<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.160> that<00:01:41.250> second<00:01:41.610> 50<00:01:41.730> so<00:01:42.180> it's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
back so fast in that second 50 so it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660 
back so fast in that second 50 so it's
not<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.050> matter<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.490> fast

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
not a matter of going out really fast

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.610 
not a matter of going out really fast
than<00:01:44.970> hanging<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:45.900> dying<00:01:46.170> these<00:01:46.410> days

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
than hanging out or dying these days

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.380 
than hanging out or dying these days
it's<00:01:46.860> almost<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.730> build<00:01:48.030> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it's almost like you got to build that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.760 
it's almost like you got to build that
entire<00:01:48.720> second<00:01:49.020> 50<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.470> way<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.740> wall

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
entire second 50 all the way to the wall

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
entire second 50 all the way to the wall
so<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:51.120> kind<00:01:51.330> of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.480> the<00:01:52.050> mental

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
so that's kind of the the mental

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.590
