00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.230
 hi everyone I am every lamb and this 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.230
 script game plan 2 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.330
 metal gear solid of sound if there is any 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.630
 game in life that has marked me in 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.090
 some time is metal gear solid ' 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.980
 it takes morea today that I took I would be 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.220
 leaving you would be unlinking some 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 way of konami and that leaves us all 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.460
 the fans of sticking in like ok what's 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.059
 happening here is good is bad I do not know and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.590
 I want the truth that I want me 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.080
 phantom pain is far the best metal 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.129
 solid gear that I played in life I have 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.890
 faith 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.860
 I have faith you have faith 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.840
 I hope yes now more than metal gear 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.210
 solid 'metal gear solid is already saturated 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.339
 I love it but it has been many games 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.740
 I agree with host when it says 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.050
 this is the last let me calm me 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.869
 I'll go if I do not retire ok 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.270
 solid metal gear is also passed to the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.450
 history 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.450
 but I'm worried what would happen to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 dance 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.829
 I'm supposed to read kojima guillermo 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.249
 bull are working on a project 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:31.509
 to return to life silent hill under 

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:31.509
 the name of silent hill 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.000
 and more over has the norman reedus as 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.530
 protagonist 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.009
 or is it better walking dead 'with 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:50.689
 creator of a lot doing the new 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.679
 silent and what he has played so for 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.819
 favor 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.039
 I took more please if you are going to retire 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.810
 something after this project because the 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.959
 high that you already generated in us 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.140
 fans is immense the fear that caused 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:09.280
 Pete is amazing and how I imagine that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.280
 it will be silent souls 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.570
 in synthesis if I took more out of konami 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.180
 at least it's worrying we do not know what 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.370
 it's going to happen with pt until they've already done 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.860
 5 and we're going to have the first of 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.730
 September I'm dying to play what we 're going 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.670
 to compete I do not know 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.010
 now cojímar 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.840
 if there is a fight with konami I am sure 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.360
 which is because you are delaying 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.760
 A lot in taking out the games is very 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.220
 man perfectionist there are games that 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.530
 they take much less time and they are very good 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.920
 you do not need so much time you do not need and 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 from so much to detail 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.450
 that's all you commented on what 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.030
 it seems okay that I caught more go 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.030
 it's wrong they 're on konami 's side 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.470
