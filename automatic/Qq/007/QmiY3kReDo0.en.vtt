it back 15 years ago they didn't expect
the<00:00:18.090> travel<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.779> they<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.050> now<00:00:19.369> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the travel that they have now the

thickness of paving on the road is about

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.460 
thickness of paving on the road is about
10<00:00:24.029> years<00:00:24.180> behind<00:00:24.390> where<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.869> should<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
10 years behind where it should be and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
10 years behind where it should be and
that's<00:00:25.590> why<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:25.920> project<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:26.880> important

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that's why this project was so important

existing on the other five miles is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.730 
existing on the other five miles is
there's<00:01:06.119> two<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> half<00:01:06.659> inches<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.260> binder

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
there's two and a half inches of binder

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.920 
there's two and a half inches of binder
which<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> 3/4<00:01:08.939> inch<00:01:08.970> base<00:01:09.360> which<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.750> going

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
which is a 3/4 inch base which is going

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 
which is a 3/4 inch base which is going
over<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> existing<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.580> an<00:01:11.729> inch<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.030> a

meet the new elevation of the road it's
gonna<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.490> loops<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.210> traffic<00:01:27.630> we'll

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
gonna have some loops for traffic we'll

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.100 
gonna have some loops for traffic we'll
be<00:01:28.590> putting<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.009> some<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> ramps<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
be putting on some of the ramps to

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.030 
be putting on some of the ramps to
facilitate<00:01:31.110> better<00:01:31.259> movement<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> traffic

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.289 
facilitate better movement of traffic
through<00:01:32.159> those<00:01:32.310> ramps<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.850> also<00:01:33.119> some

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
through those ramps and also some

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.450 
through those ramps and also some
high-strength<00:01:33.860> pavement<00:01:34.860> will<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.070> installed

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
high-strength pavement will be installed

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.160 
high-strength pavement will be installed
in<00:01:35.579> those<00:01:35.700> ramps<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.720> structural

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
in those ramps then it's a structural

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.289 
in those ramps then it's a structural
overlay<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.070> without<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.520> even<00:01:38.970> though<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
overlay and without it even though the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
overlay and without it even though the
road<00:01:39.479> looks<00:01:39.689> fine<00:01:39.960> right<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:41.400> would<00:01:41.520> soon

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
road looks fine right now it would soon

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.380 
road looks fine right now it would soon
start<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.570> deteriorating<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.560> coming

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.410 

because<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.110> stimulus<00:01:50.380> money<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:51.100> definitely

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
because the stimulus money is definitely

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.360 
because the stimulus money is definitely
given<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.510> shot<00:01:52.750> in<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:52.960> arm<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.260> do<00:01:53.680> tea<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.250> be

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
given a shot in the arm to do tea to be

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.590 
given a shot in the arm to do tea to be
able<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.700> go<00:01:54.820> out<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.120> do<00:01:55.240> some<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.540> the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
able to go out and do some of the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600 
able to go out and do some of the
projects<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.110> they<00:01:56.290> had<00:01:56.500> just<00:01:57.250> sitting<00:01:57.520> on

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
projects that they had just sitting on

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.040 
projects that they had just sitting on
the<00:01:57.730> shelves<00:01:58.090> basically<00:01:58.510> waiting<00:01:58.870> for

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
the shelves basically waiting for

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.520 
the shelves basically waiting for
funding<00:01:59.470> had<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.010> stimulus<00:02:00.400> not<00:02:00.580> come<00:02:00.760> out<00:02:00.910> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
funding had the stimulus not come out I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.210 
funding had the stimulus not come out I
think<00:02:02.530> things<00:02:02.980> have<00:02:03.070> been<00:02:03.310> pretty<00:02:03.970> bad<00:02:04.180> really

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
think things have been pretty bad really

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.680 
think things have been pretty bad really
we<00:02:06.220> had<00:02:06.340> few<00:02:06.640> things<00:02:06.880> on<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.120> books<00:02:07.300> but

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
we had few things on the books but

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.480 
we had few things on the books but
people<00:02:08.380> were<00:02:08.470> laid<00:02:08.649> off<00:02:08.679> for<00:02:09.009> five<00:02:09.160> or<00:02:09.340> six

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
people were laid off for five or six

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.460 
people were laid off for five or six
months<00:02:09.759> this<00:02:09.850> year<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.690> we've<00:02:10.899> been<00:02:11.170> able<00:02:11.320> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
months this year so we've been able to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.560 
months this year so we've been able to
put<00:02:11.740> some<00:02:11.950> people<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.310> work<00:02:12.490> within<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
put some people to work within the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.320
