years<00:00:36.340> ago<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.670> UVI<00:00:37.590> University<00:00:38.590> of<00:00:38.650> virgin

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949

years ago to UVI University of virgin
islands<00:00:39.570> we'd<00:00:40.570> looked<00:00:40.900> into<00:00:41.320> I'd<00:00:42.250> looked<00:00:42.520> into

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
islands we'd looked into I'd looked into

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.729 
islands we'd looked into I'd looked into
aquaculture<00:00:43.660> before<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.230> decided<00:00:44.620> that

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
aquaculture before and I decided that

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.369 
aquaculture before and I decided that
the<00:00:44.949> numbers<00:00:45.309> were<00:00:45.580> really<00:00:46.449> poor<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:47.020> it<00:00:47.230> was

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
the numbers were really poor and it was

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.470 
the numbers were really poor and it was
too<00:00:47.559> big<00:00:47.590> a<00:00:47.800> business<00:00:48.190> risk<00:00:48.400> to<00:00:48.820> just<00:00:49.090> start<00:00:49.330> an

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
too big a business risk to just start an

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.150 
too big a business risk to just start an
aquaculture<00:00:49.840> business<00:00:50.440> but<00:00:50.620> we<00:00:50.710> really<00:00:51.010> liked

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
aquaculture business but we really liked

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.000 
aquaculture business but we really liked
the<00:00:51.340> idea<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:51.699> raising<00:00:51.910> food<00:00:52.330> and<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.590> idea<00:00:53.949> of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
the idea of raising food and the idea of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.600 
the idea of raising food and the idea of
having<00:00:54.220> aquaculture<00:00:55.030> with<00:00:55.600> vegetables

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
having aquaculture with vegetables

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.979 
having aquaculture with vegetables
sounded<00:00:57.610> like<00:00:57.820> we<00:00:58.120> could<00:00:58.330> make<00:00:58.360> enough<00:00:58.809> income

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
sounded like we could make enough income

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.430 
sounded like we could make enough income
tax<00:00:59.500> gold<00:01:00.220> that's<00:01:00.699> a<00:01:00.820> business<00:01:01.210> okay<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.229> do

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
tax gold that's a business okay and do

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.380 
tax gold that's a business okay and do

looking to simplify and streamline we
still<00:02:10.119> very<00:02:10.390> much<00:02:10.569> have<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> first<00:02:11.140> world

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
still very much have a first world

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.710 
still very much have a first world
system<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:11.980> we're<00:02:12.520> very<00:02:13.090> interested<00:02:13.390> in

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
system and we're very interested in

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.750 
system and we're very interested in
turning<00:02:13.900> turning<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.590> into<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.890> viable<00:02:15.220> third

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
turning turning that into a viable third

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.630 
turning turning that into a viable third
world<00:02:16.740> country<00:02:18.450> especially<00:02:19.450> looking<00:02:19.750> for

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
world country especially looking for

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.940 
world country especially looking for
available<00:02:21.640> material<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.959> people<00:02:23.410> who

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
available material so that people who

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
available material so that people who
are<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.910> Ghana<00:02:25.830> know<00:02:26.830> what's<00:02:27.069> available<00:02:27.220> there

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
are in Ghana know what's available there

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.880 
are in Ghana know what's available there
it<00:02:28.239> feels<00:02:28.629> very<00:02:28.660> differently<00:02:29.260> in<00:02:29.319> Ghana<00:02:29.620> than

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it feels very differently in Ghana than

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.280 
it feels very differently in Ghana than
the<00:02:30.489> United<00:02:30.819> States<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:31.870> we<00:02:32.019> might<00:02:32.230> find

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
the United States so what we might find

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.619 
the United States so what we might find
if<00:02:32.709> we<00:02:32.830> go<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.010> our<00:02:33.069> junkyard<00:02:33.700> wouldn't<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.300> in

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
if we go to our junkyard wouldn't be in

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.660 
if we go to our junkyard wouldn't be in
a<00:02:34.810> junk<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.860> there's<00:02:36.010> really<00:02:36.220> junkyards

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
a junk not that there's really junkyards

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.110 
a junk not that there's really junkyards
in<00:02:36.790> Ghana

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
in Ghana

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.390 
in Ghana
because<00:02:37.330> everything<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.870> used<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.349> reused<00:02:38.530> so

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
because everything is used and reused so

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.100 
because everything is used and reused so
everywhere<00:02:39.910> there's<00:02:40.150> different<00:02:40.569> available

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
everywhere there's different available

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.350 
everywhere there's different available
material<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.220> we're<00:02:42.370> really<00:02:42.610> interested<00:02:43.299> in

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
material so we're really interested in

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.330 
material so we're really interested in
doing<00:02:43.660> is<00:02:43.810> sourcing<00:02:44.440> these<00:02:44.680> materials

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
doing is sourcing these materials

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.479 
doing is sourcing these materials
locally<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:46.390> hopefully<00:02:46.780> locally<00:02:47.349> based<00:02:47.530> in

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
locally so hopefully locally based in

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.240 
locally so hopefully locally based in
locally<00:02:48.940> sourced<00:02:49.239> systems<00:02:49.629> of<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.799> third<00:02:51.040> world

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
locally sourced systems of a third world

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.699 
locally sourced systems of a third world

we've<00:02:58.390> been<00:02:58.690> making<00:02:59.200> our<00:03:00.420> commercial<00:03:01.420> systems

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
we've been making our commercial systems

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.410 
we've been making our commercial systems
more<00:03:02.620> economical<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.340> build<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.790> more

more economical to build and more
economical<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.290> operate<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:06.069> that's<00:03:06.670> all

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
economical to operate and that's all

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.569
