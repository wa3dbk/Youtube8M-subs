in<00:00:21.289> a<00:00:21.800> potential<00:00:22.339> sequel<00:00:22.820> we<00:00:23.150> know<00:00:23.269> it's<00:00:23.419> not

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
in a potential sequel we know it's not

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.179 
in a potential sequel we know it's not
been<00:00:23.689> announced<00:00:23.900> but<00:00:24.289> Rockstar<00:00:24.830> would<00:00:25.070> be

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
been announced but Rockstar would be

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.339 
been announced but Rockstar would be
foolish<00:00:25.519> not<00:00:25.580> to<00:00:25.789> anyway<00:00:26.630> one<00:00:27.019> of<00:00:27.109> my<00:00:27.199> main

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
foolish not to anyway one of my main

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.800 
foolish not to anyway one of my main
ones<00:00:27.619> would<00:00:28.039> be<00:00:28.070> to<00:00:28.699> keep<00:00:28.970> it<00:00:29.150> in<00:00:29.300> high<00:00:29.480> school

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
ones would be to keep it in high school

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.740 
ones would be to keep it in high school
instead<00:00:30.560> of<00:00:30.789> progressing<00:00:31.789> on<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.090> college<00:00:32.300> or

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
instead of progressing on to college or

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.460 
instead of progressing on to college or
university<00:00:33.350> I<00:00:34.040> think<00:00:34.520> that<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.760> high<00:00:34.880> school

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
university I think that the high school

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.470 
university I think that the high school
scenario<00:00:36.470> works<00:00:36.830> too<00:00:37.310> well<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:38.060> give<00:00:38.240> it<00:00:38.360> up

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
scenario works too well to give it up

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.230 
scenario works too well to give it up
now<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:39.070> we<00:00:40.070> only<00:00:40.250> did<00:00:40.460> one<00:00:40.730> year<00:00:40.940> in<00:00:41.150> the

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
now and we only did one year in the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.390 
now and we only did one year in the
first<00:00:41.420> game<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:42.080> think<00:00:42.140> there's<00:00:42.830> a<00:00:42.890> lot<00:00:43.010> more<00:00:43.070> to

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
first game I think there's a lot more to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.600 
first game I think there's a lot more to
be<00:00:43.520> done<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.300> think<00:00:44.540> College<00:00:44.990> opens<00:00:45.920> up<00:00:46.160> too

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
be done and I think College opens up too

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.940 
be done and I think College opens up too
many<00:00:46.760> adult<00:00:47.450> like<00:00:47.750> possible<00:00:48.320> at<00:00:48.470> least<00:00:48.710> and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
many adult like possible at least and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.430 
many adult like possible at least and
then<00:00:49.400> it<00:00:49.550> becomes<00:00:50.000> more<00:00:50.270> of<00:00:50.390> a<00:00:50.480> GTA<00:00:50.870> can<00:00:51.290> of

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
then it becomes more of a GTA can of

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.060 
then it becomes more of a GTA can of
game<00:00:51.620> whereas<00:00:52.550> bully<00:00:52.820> had<00:00:53.510> its<00:00:53.660> own<00:00:53.810> identity

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
game whereas bully had its own identity

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.880 
game whereas bully had its own identity
remaining<00:00:55.070> in<00:00:55.310> high<00:00:55.520> school<00:00:55.880> it<00:00:56.270> kind<00:00:56.630> of

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
remaining in high school it kind of

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.200 
remaining in high school it kind of
distinguished<00:00:57.890> itself<00:00:58.100> from<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.550> pack<00:00:58.760> so

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
distinguished itself from the pack so

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.820 
distinguished itself from the pack so
definitely<00:00:59.600> stay<00:00:59.900> at<00:01:00.110> high<00:01:00.230> school<00:01:00.470> for<00:01:00.710> me

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
definitely stay at high school for me

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.460 
definitely stay at high school for me
and<00:01:01.010> in<00:01:01.640> terms<00:01:01.910> of<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.150> map<00:01:02.360> size<00:01:02.630> I'd<00:01:02.990> say

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
and in terms of the map size I'd say

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.039 
and in terms of the map size I'd say
bully<00:01:04.280> was<00:01:04.519> actually<00:01:04.879> relatively<00:01:05.269> small<00:01:05.750> in

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
bully was actually relatively small in

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.010 
bully was actually relatively small in
terms<00:01:06.650> of<00:01:06.890> geography<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.729> maybe<00:01:08.689> make<00:01:08.990> them

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
terms of geography and maybe make them

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.200 
terms of geography and maybe make them
up<00:01:09.259> two<00:01:09.530> or<00:01:09.649> three<00:01:09.859> times<00:01:10.009> bigger<00:01:10.399> although<00:01:11.179> i

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
up two or three times bigger although i

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.539 
up two or three times bigger although i
will<00:01:11.479> say<00:01:11.509> bully<00:01:12.079> did<00:01:12.320> utilize<00:01:12.829> its<00:01:13.039> map<00:01:13.249> a<00:01:13.280> lot

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
will say bully did utilize its map a lot

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:14.980 
will say bully did utilize its map a lot
better<00:01:13.759> than<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.969> lot<00:01:13.999> of<00:01:14.179> these<00:01:14.420> open<00:01:14.810> world

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
better than a lot of these open world

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.310 
better than a lot of these open world
games<00:01:15.289> so<00:01:15.829> at<00:01:16.280> least<00:01:16.549> try<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:17.359> keep<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.840> lack<00:01:18.289> of

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
games so at least try and keep a lack of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.730 
games so at least try and keep a lack of
open<00:01:19.070> spaces<00:01:19.399> that<00:01:19.729> don't<00:01:19.909> really<00:01:20.060> mean<00:01:20.329> much

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
open spaces that don't really mean much

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.309 
open spaces that don't really mean much
make<00:01:21.740> sure<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.280> worthwhile<00:01:22.819> going<00:01:23.479> into<00:01:23.929> each

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
make sure is worthwhile going into each

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.950 
make sure is worthwhile going into each
area<00:01:24.679> of<00:01:24.859> the<00:01:25.069> map<00:01:25.249> i'm<00:01:25.789> sure<00:01:26.090> they<00:01:26.270> will<00:01:26.420> but

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
area of the map i'm sure they will but

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.660 
area of the map i'm sure they will but
if<00:01:27.319> they<00:01:27.499> can<00:01:27.649> increase<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:27.950> map<00:01:28.219> size<00:01:28.460> and

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
if they can increase the map size and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.149 
if they can increase the map size and
still<00:01:28.819> keep<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.210> all<00:01:29.299> relevant<00:01:29.689> than<00:01:30.049> power<00:01:30.710> to

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
still keep it all relevant than power to

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.099 
still keep it all relevant than power to
rock<00:01:31.369> star<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:31.909> think<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.450> rival<00:01:32.810> schools

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
rock star I think the rival schools

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.690 
rock star I think the rival schools
would<00:01:33.229> be<00:01:33.289> a<00:01:33.409> good<00:01:33.590> addition<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.609> main

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
would be a good addition to the main

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.270 
would be a good addition to the main
storyline<00:01:35.359> we<00:01:35.990> saw<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.319> the<00:01:36.350> first<00:01:36.619> one<00:01:36.889> where

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
storyline we saw in the first one where

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.609 
storyline we saw in the first one where
Jimmy<00:01:37.579> was<00:01:37.789> fighting<00:01:38.389> the<00:01:38.420> cliques<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:39.109> think

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
Jimmy was fighting the cliques I think

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.080 
Jimmy was fighting the cliques I think
that<00:01:39.829> they<00:01:40.069> should<00:01:40.100> progress<00:01:40.460> that<00:01:40.819> further

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
that they should progress that further

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.080 
that they should progress that further
and<00:01:41.420> maybe<00:01:41.689> have<00:01:41.840> like<00:01:42.020> extra<00:01:42.679> school<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.670> go

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
and maybe have like extra school to go

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.649 
and maybe have like extra school to go
to<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.389> put<00:01:45.259> play<00:01:45.560> pranks<00:01:45.859> on<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.509> compete<00:01:47.509> in

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
to and put play pranks on and compete in

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.870 
to and put play pranks on and compete in
sports<00:01:47.869> competitions<00:01:48.679> maybe<00:01:49.039> which<00:01:49.729> is

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
sports competitions maybe which is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.120 
sports competitions maybe which is
another<00:01:50.060> thing<00:01:50.270> let<00:01:50.840> us<00:01:50.959> join<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:51.499> sports

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
another thing let us join like sports

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.489 
another thing let us join like sports
teams<00:01:52.459> and<00:01:52.759> chess<00:01:53.719> teams<00:01:53.959> and<00:01:54.200> weird<00:01:54.380> stuff

like<00:01:54.709> that<00:01:54.829> but<00:01:55.369> stuff<00:01:55.639> that's<00:01:55.880> mundane<00:01:56.630> in

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
like that but stuff that's mundane in

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.330 
like that but stuff that's mundane in
real<00:01:56.929> life<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:57.200> cool<00:01:57.649> when<00:01:57.889> you're<00:01:58.009> in<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.159> game

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
real life but cool when you're in a game

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.849 
real life but cool when you're in a game
I'd<00:01:58.939> say<00:01:59.179> give<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.479> an<00:01:59.810> increased<00:02:00.409> sense<00:02:00.679> of

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
I'd say give it an increased sense of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.279 
I'd say give it an increased sense of
discovery<00:02:01.310> as<00:02:01.639> well<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.749> original<00:02:03.139> one

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
discovery as well so the original one

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.779 
discovery as well so the original one
did<00:02:03.469> this<00:02:03.560> quite<00:02:03.829> well<00:02:04.039> where<00:02:04.459> you<00:02:04.579> feel<00:02:04.759> like

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
did this quite well where you feel like

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.459 
did this quite well where you feel like
you're<00:02:05.149> always<00:02:05.179> finding<00:02:05.630> new<00:02:05.779> stuff<00:02:05.959> i'll

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
you're always finding new stuff i'll

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:07.989 
you're always finding new stuff i'll
just<00:02:06.799> say<00:02:06.950> build<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.429> that<00:02:07.459> a<00:02:07.579> bit<00:02:07.639> further

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
just say build on that a bit further

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.779 
just say build on that a bit further
maybe<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.840> hidden<00:02:09.350> click<00:02:09.619> hideouts<00:02:10.130> so

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
maybe have like hidden click hideouts so

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.449 
maybe have like hidden click hideouts so
like<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> nerds<00:02:11.390> base<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.260> hidden<00:02:12.799> away<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.220> to

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
like a nerds base is hidden away in to

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.090 
like a nerds base is hidden away in to
school<00:02:13.700> some

Aaron<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.460> have<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.700> find<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.510> get

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
Aaron you have to find it and you get

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.080 
Aaron you have to find it and you get
like<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.500> become<00:02:16.650> part<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.490> their<00:02:17.670> crew<00:02:17.940> or

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
like to become part of their crew or

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.090 
like to become part of their crew or
something<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.690> don't<00:02:18.930> know<00:02:19.140> i<00:02:19.410> don't<00:02:19.560> know<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
something I don't know i don't know the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.830 
something I don't know i don't know the
ins<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.370> outs<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:20.850> i<00:02:21.060> reckon<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:21.600> could<00:02:21.750> do

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
ins and outs but i reckon they could do

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.870 
ins and outs but i reckon they could do
some<00:02:21.990> really<00:02:22.170> cool<00:02:22.350> stuff<00:02:22.410> with<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:23.010> more

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
some really cool stuff with that more

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.630 
some really cool stuff with that more
enterable<00:02:24.360> buildings<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.530> another<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.220> which

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
enterable buildings is another one which

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.090 
enterable buildings is another one which
kind<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.880> ties<00:02:27.090> into<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.660> but<00:02:28.020> for<00:02:28.410> me<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
kind of ties into that but for me the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.610 
kind of ties into that but for me the
city<00:02:29.640> felt<00:02:29.940> too<00:02:30.180> detached<00:02:30.600> from<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> main

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
city felt too detached from the main

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.730 
city felt too detached from the main
game<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.220> think<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:33.000> an<00:02:33.300> RPG<00:02:34.050> type<00:02:34.260> leveling

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
game I think that an RPG type leveling

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.800 
game I think that an RPG type leveling
structure<00:02:35.220> would<00:02:35.670> work<00:02:35.880> quite<00:02:36.210> well<00:02:36.240> for

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
structure would work quite well for

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.470 
structure would work quite well for
certain<00:02:37.110> skills<00:02:37.380> at<00:02:37.650> least<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:38.970> speed

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
certain skills at least to like speed

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.440 
certain skills at least to like speed
and<00:02:39.510> jump<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.400> cycling<00:02:41.400> something<00:02:42.210> like<00:02:42.330> we

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and jump and cycling something like we

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.600 
and jump and cycling something like we
saw<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.630> san<00:02:42.960> andreas<00:02:43.110> where<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.100> keep<00:02:44.340> doing

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
saw in san andreas where you keep doing

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.190 
saw in san andreas where you keep doing
a<00:02:44.700> certain<00:02:44.880> skill<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.540> will<00:02:45.690> progress

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
a certain skill and it will progress

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.830 
a certain skill and it will progress
actually<00:02:47.130> do<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.670> think<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.390> work<00:02:48.600> well

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
actually do it I think that work well

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840 
actually do it I think that work well
with<00:02:49.080> bully<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.190> way<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.670> game

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
with bully and the way that the game

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.060 
with bully and the way that the game
plays<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:52.020> course<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.410> doesn't<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.830> be<00:02:52.860> in

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
plays of course it doesn't have to be in

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.790 
plays of course it doesn't have to be in
in<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.790> leveling<00:02:54.450> system<00:02:54.930> but<00:02:55.140> something

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
in that leveling system but something

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.470 
in that leveling system but something
like<00:02:55.830> san<00:02:56.220> andreas<00:02:56.730> where<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.240> unlock

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
like san andreas where we can unlock

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.510 
like san andreas where we can unlock
more<00:02:57.750> stuff<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:58.290> go<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.740> think<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.250> would

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
more stuff as we go I think that would

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.690 
more stuff as we go I think that would
add<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.820> lot<00:03:00.210> of<00:03:00.360> depth<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.530> game<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:02.490> goes

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
add a lot of depth to the game this goes

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700 
add a lot of depth to the game this goes
without<00:03:02.880> saying<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:04.230> obviously<00:03:04.350> want

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
without saying but we obviously want

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.160 
without saying but we obviously want
more<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.490> same<00:03:05.670> stuff<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.300> more<00:03:06.720> lessons

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
more of the same stuff so more lessons

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.430 
more of the same stuff so more lessons
like<00:03:07.530> football<00:03:08.490> or<00:03:08.730> soccer<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.930> Americans

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
like football or soccer is you Americans

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.060 
like football or soccer is you Americans
know<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.030> swimming<00:03:12.290> more<00:03:13.290> mini<00:03:13.500> games<00:03:13.770> so

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
know it and swimming more mini games so

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.850 
know it and swimming more mini games so
like<00:03:14.250> golf<00:03:14.640> darts<00:03:15.360> stuff<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.140> more

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
like golf darts stuff like that more

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.610 
like golf darts stuff like that more
weapons<00:03:17.340> obviously<00:03:18.150> I've<00:03:18.390> seen<00:03:19.110> people<00:03:19.290> or

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
weapons obviously I've seen people or

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.680 
weapons obviously I've seen people or
asking<00:03:19.950> for<00:03:20.010> guns<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:21.060> that's<00:03:21.300> just<00:03:21.420> stupid

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
asking for guns but that's just stupid

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.510 
asking for guns but that's just stupid
it'll<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.590> become<00:03:22.710> another<00:03:23.040> Grand<00:03:23.370> Theft

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
it'll just become another Grand Theft

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.790 
it'll just become another Grand Theft
Auto<00:03:23.730> clone<00:03:24.240> if<00:03:24.540> they<00:03:24.720> do<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:25.140> keep<00:03:25.620> it

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
Auto clone if they do that keep it

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.250 
Auto clone if they do that keep it
limited<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.520> say<00:03:27.150> pea<00:03:27.420> shooters<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.020> water

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
limited to say pea shooters and water

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.010 
limited to say pea shooters and water
guns<00:03:28.590> but<00:03:29.280> real<00:03:29.640> guns<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.240> no<00:03:30.450> place<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.780> this

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
guns but real guns have no place in this

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.490 
guns but real guns have no place in this
game<00:03:31.260> at<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.790> more<00:03:32.790> transport<00:03:33.390> options<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
game at all more transport options so I

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.460 
game at all more transport options so I
think<00:03:34.770> segways<00:03:35.400> would<00:03:35.550> be<00:03:35.670> pretty<00:03:35.910> cool

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
think segways would be pretty cool

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.900 
think segways would be pretty cool
rollerblades<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:38.430> ability<00:03:38.760> to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
customize these vehicles we've like say

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.100 
customize these vehicles we've like say
water<00:03:41.460> pistols<00:03:41.970> or<00:03:42.180> egg<00:03:42.450> launches<00:03:42.990> or

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
water pistols or egg launches or

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.540 
water pistols or egg launches or
something<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:43.770> fire<00:03:44.070> them<00:03:44.250> while<00:03:44.430> you

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
something so you can fire them while you

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.400 
something so you can fire them while you
drive<00:03:44.820> them<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.270> think<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.930> would<00:03:46.020> be<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.170> neat

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
drive them I think that would be a neat

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.250 
drive them I think that would be a neat
touch<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.790> more<00:03:48.330> clicks<00:03:48.720> within<00:03:49.110> the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
touch and the more clicks within the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.350 
touch and the more clicks within the
school's<00:03:49.530> themselves<00:03:49.710> so<00:03:50.490> maybe<00:03:50.700> like<00:03:50.970> Goff's

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
school's themselves so maybe like Goff's

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.920 
school's themselves so maybe like Goff's
/<00:03:51.960> emos<00:03:52.440> or<00:03:52.830> skaters<00:03:53.670> or<00:03:53.970> if<00:03:54.390> they<00:03:54.510> really<00:03:54.660> want

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
/ emos or skaters or if they really want

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.080 
/ emos or skaters or if they really want
to<00:03:54.990> go<00:03:55.080> up<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.350> date<00:03:55.500> vampire<00:03:56.070> fags<00:03:56.400> no<00:03:56.790> offense

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
to go up to date vampire fags no offense

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.270 
to go up to date vampire fags no offense
to<00:03:57.300> any<00:03:57.450> Twilight<00:03:57.960> fans<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.950> think<00:03:59.130> maybe

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
to any Twilight fans and I think maybe

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.750 
to any Twilight fans and I think maybe
the<00:03:59.730> ability<00:04:00.210> to<00:04:00.450> bribe<00:04:01.170> bullies<00:04:01.740> or<00:04:02.040> prefex

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
the ability to bribe bullies or prefex

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.210 
the ability to bribe bullies or prefex
for<00:04:03.210> protection<00:04:03.720> would<00:04:04.080> be<00:04:04.230> cool<00:04:04.440> because

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
for protection would be cool because

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.740 
for protection would be cool because
mainly<00:04:05.490> we<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:05.760> got<00:04:06.060> our<00:04:06.180> asses<00:04:06.210> kicked<00:04:06.510> by

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
mainly we just got our asses kicked by

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.990 
mainly we just got our asses kicked by
them<00:04:07.020> in<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.200> last<00:04:07.380> game<00:04:07.590> but<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:07.950> think<00:04:08.220> as<00:04:08.370> you

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
them in the last game but I think as you

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.210 
them in the last game but I think as you
progress<00:04:09.570> in<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.990> game<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.500> accumulate

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
progress in the game and you accumulate

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.890 
progress in the game and you accumulate
a<00:04:11.430> certain<00:04:11.790> amount<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:12.000> money<00:04:12.270> without<00:04:12.720> a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
a certain amount of money without a

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.540 
a certain amount of money without a
great<00:04:13.140> deal<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.380> things<00:04:13.710> to<00:04:13.920> do<00:04:14.100> with<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.430> I

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
great deal of things to do with it I

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.840 
great deal of things to do with it I
think<00:04:14.880> maybe<00:04:15.030> bribing<00:04:15.750> certain<00:04:16.590> people<00:04:17.310> maybe

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
think maybe bribing certain people maybe

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.460 
think maybe bribing certain people maybe
even<00:04:17.970> members<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.450> staff<00:04:18.720> as<00:04:18.930> well<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.350> you

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
even members of staff as well so you

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.410 
even members of staff as well so you
could<00:04:19.650> sneak<00:04:20.040> around<00:04:20.310> at<00:04:20.640> night<00:04:20.670> on<00:04:21.150> though<00:04:21.600> is

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
could sneak around at night on though is

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.170 
could sneak around at night on though is
and<00:04:22.510> just<00:04:23.380> generally<00:04:23.950> have<00:04:24.250> people<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:25.000> fight

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
and just generally have people to fight

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.640 
and just generally have people to fight
in<00:04:25.330> your<00:04:25.450> corner<00:04:25.810> thing<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.230> would<00:04:26.320> be<00:04:26.470> an

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
in your corner thing that would be an

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.580 
in your corner thing that would be an
improvement<00:04:27.190> on<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.550> previous<00:04:27.910> game<00:04:28.600> quite<00:04:29.560> a

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
improvement on the previous game quite a

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.400 
improvement on the previous game quite a
big<00:04:29.830> one<00:04:30.070> for<00:04:30.310> me<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:31.030> next<00:04:31.330> one<00:04:31.540> is<00:04:31.690> an

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
big one for me this next one is an

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.190 
big one for me this next one is an
increase<00:04:33.070> in<00:04:33.100> difficulty<00:04:33.670> or<00:04:34.200> difficulty

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
increase in difficulty or difficulty

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.320 
increase in difficulty or difficulty
settings<00:04:35.560> because<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.430> default<00:04:36.820> difficult

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
settings because the default difficult

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.120 
settings because the default difficult
if<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.630> first<00:04:37.840> game<00:04:38.110> was<00:04:38.290> far<00:04:38.530> too<00:04:38.560> easy<00:04:38.950> for

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
if the first game was far too easy for

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.430 
if the first game was far too easy for
me<00:04:39.370> I'm<00:04:39.670> not<00:04:40.150> saying<00:04:40.360> make<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.810> game<00:04:40.990> insanely

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
me I'm not saying make the game insanely

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.740 
me I'm not saying make the game insanely
hard<00:04:41.770> I'm<00:04:42.010> just<00:04:42.250> saying<00:04:42.760> that<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.300> should<00:04:43.570> be

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
hard I'm just saying that it should be

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.170 
hard I'm just saying that it should be
more<00:04:44.560> difficult<00:04:44.800> than<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.400> last<00:04:45.580> one<00:04:45.820> because

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
more difficult than the last one because

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.690 
more difficult than the last one because
missions<00:04:46.960> could<00:04:47.230> be<00:04:47.380> done<00:04:47.710> more<00:04:48.310> or<00:04:48.340> less<00:04:48.550> the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
missions could be done more or less the

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.610 
missions could be done more or less the
first<00:04:48.940> time<00:04:49.210> every<00:04:49.570> time<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:50.050> think<00:04:50.530> a

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
first time every time I think a

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.110 
first time every time I think a
difficulty<00:04:51.190> same<00:04:51.370> would<00:04:51.580> probably<00:04:51.910> be<00:04:52.000> the

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
difficulty same would probably be the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.720 
difficulty same would probably be the
most<00:04:52.240> appropriate<00:04:52.500> form<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.620> action<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.520> give

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
most appropriate form of action to give

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.080 
most appropriate form of action to give
a<00:04:54.960> newcomers<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.250> veterans<00:04:57.250> alike<00:04:57.400> some

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
a newcomers and veterans alike some

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.360 
a newcomers and veterans alike some
options<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:58.810> lastly<00:04:59.440> one<00:04:59.740> thing<00:04:59.950> I<00:05:00.100> think

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
options and lastly one thing I think

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.060 
options and lastly one thing I think
they<00:05:00.820> should<00:05:01.060> include<00:05:01.570> taking<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.680> leap<00:05:02.860> out<00:05:03.040> of

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
they should include taking a leap out of

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.220 
they should include taking a leap out of
their<00:05:03.250> own<00:05:03.370> book<00:05:03.610> here<00:05:03.820> rockstar<00:05:04.300> is<00:05:04.540> being

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
their own book here rockstar is being

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.340 
their own book here rockstar is being
game<00:05:05.470> internet<00:05:06.220> from<00:05:06.700> GTA<00:05:07.180> 4<00:05:07.540> so<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.170> could

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
game internet from GTA 4 so you could

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.680 
game internet from GTA 4 so you could
use<00:05:08.560> this<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.800> order<00:05:09.640> items<00:05:09.940> and<00:05:10.180> stuff<00:05:10.270> like

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
use this to order items and stuff like

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.800 
use this to order items and stuff like
order<00:05:11.530> prank<00:05:11.980> supplies<00:05:12.460> I<00:05:12.490> don't<00:05:13.120> know<00:05:13.210> higher

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
order prank supplies I don't know higher

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.950 
order prank supplies I don't know higher
like<00:05:14.440> mercenary<00:05:15.100> students<00:05:15.790> or<00:05:15.940> something<00:05:16.390> I'm

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
like mercenary students or something I'm

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.210 
like mercenary students or something I'm
sure<00:05:17.290> they<00:05:17.440> could<00:05:17.500> do<00:05:17.680> some<00:05:17.860> really<00:05:18.100> good

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
sure they could do some really good

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.430 
sure they could do some really good
stuff<00:05:18.370> maybe<00:05:18.850> you<00:05:19.030> could<00:05:19.210> acquire<00:05:19.870> missions

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
stuff maybe you could acquire missions

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.770 
stuff maybe you could acquire missions
from<00:05:20.740> being<00:05:21.280> game<00:05:21.520> in<00:05:21.550> sin<00:05:21.910> that<00:05:21.940> either<00:05:22.390> way<00:05:22.750> I

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
from being game in sin that either way I

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.260 
from being game in sin that either way I
think<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.590> whole<00:05:23.800> system<00:05:24.220> have<00:05:24.790> been<00:05:24.820> in<00:05:25.090> Game

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
think the whole system have been in Game

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.480 
think the whole system have been in Game
internet<00:05:25.840> works<00:05:26.110> really<00:05:26.410> well<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:26.920> bully

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
internet works really well and bully

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.040
