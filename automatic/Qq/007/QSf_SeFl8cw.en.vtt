hello and welcome um as you can see this
is<00:00:04.339> what<00:00:05.339> looks<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.640> be<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:08.750> ocean

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750

is what looks to be and is a ocean
monster<00:00:11.030> fish<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.210> guess<00:00:12.360> you'd<00:00:12.540> say<00:00:12.840> trap<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
monster fish I guess you'd say trap the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.910 
monster fish I guess you'd say trap the
way<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.639> made<00:00:14.820> I'll<00:00:15.599> go<00:00:16.020> through<00:00:16.350> with

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
way this is made I'll go through with

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.950 
way this is made I'll go through with
you<00:00:17.070> guys<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.609> can<00:00:18.180> replicate<00:00:18.539> it

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
you guys so you can replicate it

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.560 
you guys so you can replicate it
yourself<00:00:19.460> but<00:00:20.460> I'm<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.850> didn't<00:00:21.090> know<00:00:21.300> as

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
yourself but I'm if you didn't know as

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.310 
yourself but I'm if you didn't know as
of<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.769> too<00:00:23.010> long<00:00:23.250> ago<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.910> patched<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of not too long ago they patched the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
of not too long ago they patched the
earlier<00:00:25.740> method<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.580> people<00:00:26.910> were<00:00:27.000> using<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
earlier method that people were using to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.109 
earlier method that people were using to
farm<00:00:27.810> sharks<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.380> jellyfish<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:30.090> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
farm sharks and jellyfish which was a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.420 
farm sharks and jellyfish which was a
new<00:00:30.720> place<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.260> platforms<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.219> top<00:00:32.399> of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
new place with platforms and on top of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
new place with platforms and on top of
the<00:00:32.610> wood<00:00:32.759> platforms<00:00:33.300> you'd<00:00:33.510> place<00:00:33.780> lava<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the wood platforms you'd place lava and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.010 
the wood platforms you'd place lava and
it<00:00:35.430> kills<00:00:35.910> them<00:00:36.030> much<00:00:36.239> faster<00:00:36.750> than<00:00:36.840> this

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it kills them much faster than this

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.310 
it kills them much faster than this
method<00:00:37.500> however<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.879> patched<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.600> lava

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
method however they patched it so lava

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
method however they patched it so lava
breaks<00:00:40.770> through<00:00:41.070> platforms<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.180> you

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
breaks through platforms now so you

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.750 
breaks through platforms now so you
can't<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.340> trying<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.670> think

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
can't do that so I was trying to think

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.389 
can't do that so I was trying to think
of<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.000> way<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.260> still<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.280> all

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
of a way to do this still because we all

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.310 
of a way to do this still because we all
know<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.850> frustrating<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> try<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.110> get

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
know how frustrating it is to try to get

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
know how frustrating it is to try to get
a<00:00:49.350> diving<00:00:49.649> helmet<00:00:49.980> from<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.910> shark<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
a diving helmet from a shark in the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.889 
a diving helmet from a shark in the
water<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.329> came<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.780> with

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
water so this is what I came up with

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.069 
water so this is what I came up with
here<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.829> really<00:00:56.610> simple<00:00:57.120> way<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.840> this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
here it's a really simple way to do this

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.349 
here it's a really simple way to do this
there<00:00:58.680> might<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.859> better<00:00:59.160> trap<00:00:59.579> methods<00:01:00.090> this

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
there might be better trap methods this

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.510 
there might be better trap methods this
just<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> thought<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.530> i'm<00:01:01.859> still<00:01:01.920> kind

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
just the one I thought of i'm still kind

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969 
just the one I thought of i'm still kind
of<00:01:02.760> new<00:01:02.879> tutor<00:01:03.149> area<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.719> hopefully<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.680> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
of new tutor area but hopefully this is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.310 
of new tutor area but hopefully this is
something<00:01:05.330> that<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.450> help<00:01:06.540> everybody<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.170> i

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
something that will help everybody as i

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.719 
something that will help everybody as i
can<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> video<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.520> youtube

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
can see a video like this on youtube

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.780 
can see a video like this on youtube
already<00:01:09.290> i'll<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.590> through<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.100> as

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
already i'll just go through it now as

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.230 
already i'll just go through it now as
you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.689> wiring<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.369> set<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.490> very

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you can see the wiring is set up very

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.200 
you can see the wiring is set up very
simply<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:17.040> you'll<00:01:17.189> end<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.430> needing<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
simply so what you'll end up needing to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.100 
simply so what you'll end up needing to
do<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.570> leaf<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.189> to<00:01:20.189> start<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.700> setup<00:01:21.299> you'll

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
do a leaf the to start the setup you'll

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.929 
do a leaf the to start the setup you'll
need<00:01:22.320> some<00:01:22.619> dirt<00:01:22.830> blocks<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.369> blocks<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.820> any

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
need some dirt blocks or blocks of any

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.200 
need some dirt blocks or blocks of any
kind<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.020> reason<00:01:25.350> i<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.189> part<00:01:27.030> that's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
kind the reason i have the part that's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.109 
kind the reason i have the part that's
over<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.700> slimes

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
over here like this is so that if slimes

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.359 
over here like this is so that if slimes
start<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> jump<00:01:31.140> over<00:01:31.470> they<00:01:31.680> can't<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.130> past

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
start to jump over they can't get past

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.580 
start to jump over they can't get past
this<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:33.000> area<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:34.229> start<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this little area here and will start to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
this little area here and will start to
hop<00:01:34.740> back<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> screen<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.420> well<00:01:36.689> as

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
hop back out of the screen as well as

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
hop back out of the screen as well as
this<00:01:36.990> area<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.180> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this area up here this is here so that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.170 
this area up here this is here so that
if<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:40.229> raining<00:01:40.530> flying<00:01:41.400> fish<00:01:41.520> will<00:01:41.909> crash

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
if it's raining flying fish will crash

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
if it's raining flying fish will crash
into<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.659> instead<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> getting<00:01:43.590> me<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:43.950> well

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
into this instead of getting me as well

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.179 
into this instead of getting me as well
as<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:45.509> demon<00:01:46.140> eyes<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.530> crash<00:01:46.799> into<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
as a demon eyes will crash into this

don't have to have this this chest is
just<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.229> store<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
just up here so that i can store all the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.069 
just up here so that i can store all the
freaking<00:01:58.740> glow<00:01:58.950> sticks<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> don't<00:01:59.790> need

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
freaking glow sticks that I don't need

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.510 
freaking glow sticks that I don't need
so<00:02:01.079> they<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> way<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
so they don't get in the way of the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
so they don't get in the way of the
important<00:02:03.000> stuff<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.420> we're<00:02:03.570> looking<00:02:03.899> for

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
important stuff that we're looking for

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.570 
important stuff that we're looking for
um<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.790> then<00:02:06.270> yeah<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.250> dart

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
um and then yeah you just put the dart

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.309 
um and then yeah you just put the dart
traps<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.060> way<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.629> set<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.200> can

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
traps the way I have them set up it can

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.339 
traps the way I have them set up it can
be<00:02:10.530> closer<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.910> further<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:13.170> way<00:02:13.290> you

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
be closer it can be further the way you

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.059 
be closer it can be further the way you
set<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.770> is

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
set it up is

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.039 
set it up is
to<00:02:14.249> the<00:02:14.549> timing<00:02:14.969> is<00:02:15.120> kind<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.540> always<00:02:15.749> going<00:02:15.989> to

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
to the timing is kind of always going to

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.860 
to the timing is kind of always going to
be<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.260> same<00:02:16.879> um<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.930> let's<00:02:19.799> get<00:02:20.010> into<00:02:20.069> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
be the same um so let's get into the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.300 
be the same um so let's get into the
wiring<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:22.079> but<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.590> guess<00:02:22.829> you<00:02:22.859> could<00:02:23.010> say<00:02:23.189> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
wiring or but I guess you could say the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.459 
wiring or but I guess you could say the
hard<00:02:23.519> part<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.909> this<00:02:23.939> which<00:02:24.269> would<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.599> the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
hard part of this which would be the

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.670 
hard part of this which would be the
wiring<00:02:26.459> set<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.810> got<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.989> one<00:02:28.230> second

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
wiring set up so we got a one second

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.459 
wiring set up so we got a one second
timer<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.109> it<00:02:31.290> keeps

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
timer here this is just so that it keeps

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.220 
timer here this is just so that it keeps
repeating<00:02:32.219> the<00:02:32.519> process<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:33.959> if<00:02:34.109> it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
repeating the process if you do if it

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.750 
repeating the process if you do if it
wasn't<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:34.799> if<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.010> press<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> switch<00:02:35.579> it

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
wasn't here if you press the switch it

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.399 
wasn't here if you press the switch it
wouldn't<00:02:36.030> keep<00:02:36.180> shooting<00:02:36.659> so<00:02:37.170> you're<00:02:37.290> going

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
wouldn't keep shooting so you're going

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.349 
wouldn't keep shooting so you're going
to<00:02:37.469> need<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> one<00:02:37.829> second<00:02:38.219> timer<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:39.090> need<00:02:39.329> a

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
to need a one second timer you need a

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.240 
to need a one second timer you need a
switch<00:02:39.689> you<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:39.959> also<00:02:40.109> have<00:02:40.439> our<00:02:40.680> lever<00:02:41.040> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
switch you can also have our lever you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.159 
switch you can also have our lever you
can<00:02:41.340> also<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:41.669> a<00:02:41.730> switch<00:02:41.969> switch<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.780> work<00:02:42.930> to

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
can also have a switch switch is work to

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.649 
can also have a switch switch is work to
just<00:02:43.499> put<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.739> there<00:02:43.919> and<00:02:44.370> click<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.939> and<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
just put it there and click it and the

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.149 
just put it there and click it and the
wirings<00:02:46.049> obviously<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.650> through<00:02:46.739> these

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
wirings obviously going through these

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.399 
wirings obviously going through these
then<00:02:47.969> you<00:02:48.090> bring<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.299> around<00:02:48.510> through<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
then you bring it around through the

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.110 
then you bring it around through the
first<00:02:49.620> our<00:02:49.859> trap<00:02:50.159> through<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.639> second<00:02:50.969> our

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
first our trap through the second our

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.089 
first our trap through the second our
trap<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.569> third<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.109> fourth<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.040> you

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
trap the third and the fourth so you

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.429 
trap the third and the fourth so you
just<00:02:53.219> put<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.819> wiring<00:02:54.269> through<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.049> of<00:02:55.079> these

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
just put the wiring through all of these

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.159 
just put the wiring through all of these
which<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.129> done<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> wrench<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.169> if

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
which can be done with the wrench and if

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.509 
which can be done with the wrench and if
you<00:02:58.260> ever<00:02:58.290> screw<00:02:58.680> up<00:02:58.799> just<00:02:59.069> use<00:02:59.189> the<00:02:59.340> wire

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
you ever screw up just use the wire

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.949 
you ever screw up just use the wire
cutter<00:02:59.819> to<00:03:00.780> fix<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.260> um<00:03:02.449> the<00:03:03.449> way<00:03:03.599> in<00:03:03.780> which<00:03:03.900> you

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
cutter to fix it um the way in which you

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.390 
cutter to fix it um the way in which you
can<00:03:04.139> get<00:03:04.409> all<00:03:04.500> these<00:03:04.620> items<00:03:04.829> will<00:03:05.099> be<00:03:05.159> in<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
can get all these items will be in the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.309 
can get all these items will be in the
description<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.840> you'll<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.139> worry

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
description so you'll have to worry

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.220 
description so you'll have to worry
about<00:03:07.439> that<00:03:07.549> also<00:03:08.549> just<00:03:08.849> another<00:03:09.150> pointer<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
about that also just another pointer to

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.110 
about that also just another pointer to
point<00:03:10.439> out<00:03:10.530> here<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.159> wood<00:03:11.340> platforms<00:03:12.000> that

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
point out here the wood platforms that

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.050 
point out here the wood platforms that
are<00:03:12.299> along<00:03:12.689> the<00:03:12.750> bottom<00:03:13.109> um<00:03:13.669> that<00:03:14.669> just

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
are along the bottom um that just

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.240 
are along the bottom um that just
putting<00:03:15.329> them<00:03:15.480> there<00:03:15.510> isn't<00:03:16.109> enough<00:03:16.349> if<00:03:16.799> you

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
putting them there isn't enough if you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.099 
putting them there isn't enough if you
notice<00:03:17.669> here<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.060> water<00:03:18.269> level<00:03:18.629> is<00:03:18.720> actually

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
notice here the water level is actually

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.349 
notice here the water level is actually
higher<00:03:19.680> over<00:03:20.159> on<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> right<00:03:20.609> side<00:03:20.909> that<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.209> is

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
higher over on the right side that it is

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.599 
higher over on the right side that it is
in<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.659> center<00:03:21.989> as<00:03:22.139> because<00:03:22.859> once<00:03:23.099> I<00:03:23.250> put<00:03:23.489> the

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
in the center as because once I put the

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.999 
in the center as because once I put the
wood<00:03:23.759> platforms<00:03:24.359> I<00:03:24.599> scooped<00:03:25.349> out<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.769> water

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.009 
wood platforms I scooped out the water

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:28.159 
wood platforms I scooped out the water
so<00:03:26.699> when<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:26.939> enemies<00:03:27.209> hop<00:03:27.479> up<00:03:27.689> to<00:03:27.720> hit<00:03:27.989> me

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
so when the enemies hop up to hit me

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.409 
so when the enemies hop up to hit me
they<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.799> stuck<00:03:29.159> up<00:03:29.370> here<00:03:29.609> because<00:03:30.150> if<00:03:30.269> there

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
they get stuck up here because if there

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.640 
they get stuck up here because if there
was<00:03:30.540> still<00:03:30.720> water<00:03:30.959> there<00:03:31.169> i'm<00:03:31.290> pretty<00:03:31.530> sure

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
was still water there i'm pretty sure

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.770 
was still water there i'm pretty sure
they<00:03:31.739> could<00:03:31.799> swim<00:03:32.129> down<00:03:32.400> still<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.479> you<00:03:33.540> need

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
they could swim down still so you need
