if you're just learning because you can

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
if you're just learning because you can

see where your moves are going but as
you<00:00:35.130> get<00:00:35.430> better<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.149> game<00:00:36.230> smart<00:00:37.230> casting

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you get better at the game smart casting

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
you get better at the game smart casting
is<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.790> much<00:00:38.940> more<00:00:39.000> helpful<00:00:39.540> for

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
is going to be so much more helpful for

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
is going to be so much more helpful for
you<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.980> won't<00:00:41.190> even<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> change

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
back so that is how normal modes work

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
back so that is how normal modes work
now<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.020> smart<00:00:46.260> casting<00:00:46.620> does<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.129> allows
