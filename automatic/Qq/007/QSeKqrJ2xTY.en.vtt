00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.790
 talk about us 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 not having a girlfriend not tuners nick another 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.099
 customized tool 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.310
 such a situation can happen to anyone 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:23.420
 whether you are on a hike or for 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.220
 minute to go on stage your guitar 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.990
 for some reason it turned out to be upset that is 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.990
 it sounds like this 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.380
 what to do in this situation 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.590
 tune your guitar by ear without a tuner either 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.450
 without another tool 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.150
 try to do it play the first 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.820
 open string 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.190
 she will be our starting point after 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.350
 this need to hold the second string on 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.540
 fifth fret and play the first open 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.760
 the second one clamped on the fifth fret we 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.340
 tune the second string under the first 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.320
 play first 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.250
 the second 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.250
 analyze 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.130
 There is a difference in sound and the second string 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.630
 configured a little lower than necessary 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.630
 then pull it up 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 check 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.790
 after that you need to play two strings 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.950
 simultaneously and make sure that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.970
 and the sounds merge the feeling that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.970
 one string sounds 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.710
 but 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.040
 we have already tuned the second string 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.550
 now we will tune the third one 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.050
 string 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.990
 we clamp the third string on the fourth fret 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.759
 play the second string open 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.739
 memorized sound and achieve 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.739
 the same sound on the third string 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:20.530
 analyze this string again 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.459
 is set higher than a yes that is it 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.459
 need to loosen 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.460
 check 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.159
 still need to praise 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.430
 further tune the fourth string 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.440
 we clamp it on the fifth fret 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.440
 play the third string open 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.040
 after that tune the fifth string 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.909
 we clamp it on the fifth fret and play 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.909
 fourth is already open 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.909
 she is set up and now choose the sixth 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.180
 string clamp it on the fifth fret play 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.180
 the fifth string is open and we check the sixth 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.020
 after that we have to play a few 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.830
 chords to ensure quality 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.830
 settings 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.120
 what are the disadvantages and advantages of such 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.920
 setting method 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.650
 the main plus is that you 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.930
 can tune your guitar absolutely in 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.000
 field conditions having no near 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.490
 another customized tool not 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.350
 the tuner 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.780
 just tuning the strings alone 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.110
 relative to another 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.540
 it is very convenient in the same lies and 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.490
 minus that the overall structure of the instrument 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.100
 may differ from standard 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.510
 so if you play musical 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.300
 group either 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.550
 along with other tools always 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.270
 tune your guitar with either 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.610
 the tuner either under the instrument tool with 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.070
 fixed build it can be 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.030
 for example piano or synthesizer 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.500
 if you are camping either 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.880
 perform solo you quickly need 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.150
 tune your guitar 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.010
 then this method is very effective to 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.930
 learn how to customize 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.770
 the guitar needs some time and 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.450
 constant practice over time your ears 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.670
 remember how it sounds right 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.330
 customized tool and you will be it 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.330
 very easy to do
