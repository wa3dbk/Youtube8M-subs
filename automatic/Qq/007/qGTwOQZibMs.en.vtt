00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.099
 and there you have nora who has helped me 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.870
 with this recipe to celebrate the six 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.630
 years of the blog more than cake 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.849
 chocolate we could call it tortilla 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.130
 chocolate does not carry flour but between 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.350
 butter and chocolate is a pump 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.270
 caloric let's go to it as you see what 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.789
 first thing we do is put the 100 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.859
 milliliters of coffee in a saucepan and add 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.630
 the chocolate we let it fall apart 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.960
 stirring so it does not stick in the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.960
 base 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.970
 designed of the butter that as you see 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.160
 is chopped and at room temperature 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.160
 to make it easier to incorporate 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.769
 when we have the mixture made we 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.929
 We put with the rest of ingredients 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.909
 we beat the eggs and as you see in this 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.420
 occasion now has click delete 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.420
 matilda 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.090
 and when they are well beaten we add the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090
 Brown sugar 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.439
 and once the sugar is well dissolved 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.700
 in the egg we are incorporating little to 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.740
 little the mix we have made 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 previously you do not have enough 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.070
 strength to add the beating 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.070
 at the same time so he does it in batches 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.149
 once you have a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 you can add a spoonful of 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.079
 vanilla or vanilla concentrate 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.969
 directly you know you open it by the 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.600
 half and you take out the seed that is what 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.600
 gives the aroma 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.750
 we dump it in a mold 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.460
 here 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.070
 and we put it in the oven that is 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.080
 preheated to 160 degrees and we leave it 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.690
 40 minutes past that time there will be 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.070
 up but letting it rest will go down and 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.070
 it will be like a brownie 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.160
 and there they are now enjoying good 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.610
 I hope you enjoyed a hug 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.610
 see you later
