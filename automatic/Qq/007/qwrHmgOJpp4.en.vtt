when you're on the bulletproof diet it's
really<00:00:08.490> important<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.910> understand<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:10.349> to

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
think about food so that you can sit

down<00:00:12.540> at<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> restaurant<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.469> understand<00:00:13.950> what

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
down at a restaurant and understand what

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.630 
down at a restaurant and understand what
you<00:00:14.759> should<00:00:14.940> order<00:00:15.139> most<00:00:16.139> diets<00:00:16.500> only<00:00:17.340> look<00:00:17.490> at

you should order most diets only look at
one<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.270> three<00:00:18.539> things<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.020> need<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.199> know

about<00:00:19.560> food<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:21.180> first<00:00:21.449> thing<00:00:21.660> most<00:00:22.260> diets

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
about food the first thing most diets

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.730 
about food the first thing most diets
look<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:24.050> macronutrients<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.590> that

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
look at is macronutrients what that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.460 
look at is macronutrients what that
means<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.939> made<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.240> protein<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:27.930> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
means is is it made out of protein or is

sugar and carbohydrate and they'll tell
you<00:00:31.980> forty<00:00:32.730> forty<00:00:33.180> thirty<00:00:33.480> eat<00:00:34.020> low

low fat there's all kinds of variations
this<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> very<00:00:40.290> simplistic<00:00:40.710> way<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.040> looking

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
this is a very simplistic way of looking

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.729 
this is a very simplistic way of looking
at<00:00:41.489> food<00:00:41.700> here's<00:00:42.660> how<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.320> know<00:00:43.559> it's

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
at food here's how you can know it's

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.279 
at food here's how you can know it's
simplistic<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:45.390> someone<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.050> tell<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
simplistic if someone was to tell you

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.020 
simplistic if someone was to tell you
eat<00:00:46.940> 20<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.059> 30<00:00:48.420> grams<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.960> protein<00:00:49.789> you'd<00:00:50.789> say

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
eat 20 or 30 grams of protein you'd say

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.860 
eat 20 or 30 grams of protein you'd say
okay<00:00:51.989> I'll<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.739> some<00:00:52.949> protein<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:54.120> say<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
okay I'll have some protein but say if I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.180 
okay I'll have some protein but say if I
was<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> present<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> bowl<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.949> eggs

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
was to present you with a bowl of eggs

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.260 
was to present you with a bowl of eggs
here<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.239> bowl<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> spider<00:00:58.020> venom<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:59.270> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
here and a bowl of spider venom here you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
here and a bowl of spider venom here you
know<00:01:00.570> spider<00:01:01.289> venom<00:01:01.500> isn't<00:01:01.800> food<00:01:02.129> yet<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.670> has

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
know spider venom isn't food yet it has

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
know spider venom isn't food yet it has
the<00:01:03.059> same<00:01:03.239> amount<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.600> protein<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:04.170> these<00:01:04.439> eggs

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the same amount of protein as these eggs

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.030 
the same amount of protein as these eggs
so<00:01:05.210> some<00:01:06.210> proteins<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.900> kill<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> some

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
so some proteins will kill you and some

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
so some proteins will kill you and some
proteins<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.640> food<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.450> good<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.780> you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
proteins are food and are good for you

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.289 
proteins are food and are good for you
it's<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.950> stretch<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> realize<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.030> some

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it's not a stretch to realize that some

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.960 
it's not a stretch to realize that some
proteins<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.869> better<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.560> than<00:01:13.740> others

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
proteins are better for you than others

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.640 
proteins are better for you than others
yet<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> diet<00:01:15.720> tells<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.140> eat<00:01:16.290> lots<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
yet when a diet tells you eat lots of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.100 
yet when a diet tells you eat lots of
protein<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.790> diet<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.210> sabotaging<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
protein that diet is sabotaging you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140 
protein that diet is sabotaging you
because<00:01:19.650> you're<00:01:19.799> likely<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> eat<00:01:20.580> lots<00:01:20.909> of

food<00:01:23.640> cravings<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.659> walk<00:01:24.930> around<00:01:25.110> all<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
food cravings so you walk around all the

willpower and at that point you're off

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880 
willpower and at that point you're off
the<00:01:30.180> diet<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> you've<00:01:31.049> gotten<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.530> inflamed

need to understand because after you get

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.179 
need to understand because after you get
past<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.579> macronutrient<00:01:48.329> question<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:50.040> need

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
and how to avoid them because it's

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.089 
and how to avoid them because it's
basically<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:58.080> having<00:02:58.140> kryptonite<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.069> your

the third thing the bulletproof diet
does<00:03:02.280> that's<00:03:03.120> different<00:03:03.540> than<00:03:03.720> other<00:03:03.870> diets

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
does that's different than other diets

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.350 
does that's different than other diets
is<00:03:04.709> we<00:03:04.860> look<00:03:05.010> at<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.340> timing<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.910> nutrients

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
is we look at the timing of nutrients

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.360 
is we look at the timing of nutrients
and<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:07.349> need<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.590> understand<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.099> as<00:03:08.250> well

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
and you need to understand that as well

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.420 
and you need to understand that as well
because<00:03:09.090> eating<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.690> ton<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.230> sugar<00:03:10.560> or<00:03:10.799> fruit

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
because eating a ton of sugar or fruit

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.820 
because eating a ton of sugar or fruit

so<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.890> roadmap<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.850> says<00:03:36.299> eat

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
so that you have a roadmap that says eat

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.559 
so that you have a roadmap that says eat
this<00:03:37.290> kind<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.650> food<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.150> eat<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.420> this

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
this kind of food and eat it at this

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.020 
this kind of food and eat it at this
time<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.109> when<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.739> do<00:03:40.859> that<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:41.730> feel

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
time and when you do that you feel
