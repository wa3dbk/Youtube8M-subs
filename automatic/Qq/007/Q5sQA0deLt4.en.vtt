three<00:01:01.739> features<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.359> make

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
three features which I think really make

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
three features which I think really make
this<00:01:03.719> differ<00:01:04.019> from<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> competition

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
this differ from all of the competition

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
this differ from all of the competition
out<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> first<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.680> file

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
out there so first we have the file

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.630 
out there so first we have the file
format<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.880> uses<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:10.320> uses<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.860> dot<00:01:11.100> MD

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
format that it uses it uses the dot MD

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.690 
format that it uses it uses the dot MD
file<00:01:12.360> format<00:01:12.840> markdown<00:01:13.470> text<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.460> greatly

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
file format markdown text to greatly

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.310 
file format markdown text to greatly
increase<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.270> compatibility<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
increase the compatibility and the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.679 
increase the compatibility and the
simplicity<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> user<00:01:17.400> interface<00:01:17.689> this

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
simplicity of the user interface this

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
simplicity of the user interface this
file<00:01:18.960> format<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.439> also<00:01:19.740> compatible<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.340> all

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
file format is also compatible with all

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.149 
file format is also compatible with all
other<00:01:20.759> major<00:01:21.060> text<00:01:21.630> editors<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.830> format

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
other major text editors so this format

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.100 
other major text editors so this format
is<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:23.490> better<00:01:23.700> than<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> dedicated<00:01:24.479> format

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
is a lot better than a dedicated format

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.960 
is a lot better than a dedicated format
that<00:01:25.350> maybe<00:01:25.680> someone<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.189> Microsoft<00:01:26.790> would

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
that maybe someone like Microsoft would

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.249 
that maybe someone like Microsoft would
use<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.020> the

through the writing stage the edits
stage<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.989> reading<00:02:14.319> stage<00:02:14.530> where<00:02:14.739> I

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
stage and then the reading stage where I

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.309 
stage and then the reading stage where I
can't<00:02:15.010> actually<00:02:15.159> edit<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.140> say<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.170> was

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319

the writer to highlight different syntax

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.530 
the writer to highlight different syntax
or<00:02:38.230> elements<00:02:38.739> within<00:02:38.890> your<00:02:39.159> sentences<00:02:39.790> this

allows for editing or for example verbs

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.690 
allows for editing or for example verbs
so<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.409> when<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.709> go<00:02:44.859> into<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.280> editing

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
so that when you go into the editing

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.030 
so that when you go into the editing
phase<00:02:45.909> you<00:02:46.150> might<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:47.290> may<00:02:47.440> be<00:02:47.500> able<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.859> think

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
phase you might you may be able to think

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.890 
phase you might you may be able to think
of<00:02:48.129> more<00:02:48.340> sophisticated<00:02:48.780> synonyms<00:02:49.780> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
of more sophisticated synonyms to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.500 
of more sophisticated synonyms to
replace<00:02:50.349> all<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.099> verbs<00:02:51.310> which<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:52.389> have

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
replace all of the verbs which you have

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.899 
replace all of the verbs which you have
used<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.870> far<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.799> this<00:02:53.950> allows<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.609> the

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
used so far and this allows you the

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.849 
used so far and this allows you the
freedom<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.450> knowledge<00:02:55.810> for<00:02:56.019> every<00:02:56.680> word<00:02:56.829> that

freedom of knowledge for every word that
you've<00:02:57.159> typed<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.760> if<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.939> see<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.269> this

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
you've typed so if you see in this

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.009 
you've typed so if you see in this
script<00:02:59.230> right<00:02:59.470> here<00:02:59.909> say<00:03:00.909> I<00:03:00.939> was<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
script right here say I was in the

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.220 
script right here say I was in the
editing<00:03:02.500> stage<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:03.189> creating<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.359> I<00:03:04.540> would

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
editing stage of creating this I would

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.649 
editing stage of creating this I would
slide<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:05.950> slider<00:03:06.370> down<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.790> verbs<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.359> it

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
slide this slider down to verbs and it

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.809 
slide this slider down to verbs and it
would<00:03:07.750> highlight<00:03:08.109> every<00:03:08.590> verb<00:03:08.859> in<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.489> script

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
would highlight every verb in the script

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.599 
would highlight every verb in the script
so<00:03:10.319> say<00:03:11.319> I<00:03:11.349> wanted<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:11.980> change<00:03:15.269> allows<00:03:16.269> or

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
so say I wanted to change allows or

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.659 
so say I wanted to change allows or
highlight<00:03:18.609> I<00:03:18.940> could<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:19.959> see<00:03:20.769> exactly<00:03:20.859> where

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
highlight I could just see exactly where

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.659 
highlight I could just see exactly where
highlight<00:03:22.329> is<00:03:22.540> written<00:03:22.959> or<00:03:23.410> reading<00:03:24.340> or

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
highlight is written or reading or

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.339 
highlight is written or reading or
editing<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.419> I<00:03:25.480> could<00:03:25.660> change<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.169> a

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
editing and I could change this to a

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.649 
editing and I could change this to a
similar<00:03:26.829> more<00:03:27.069> elegant<00:03:27.669> were<00:03:27.849> eloquent<00:03:28.389> word

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
similar more elegant were eloquent word

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.729 
similar more elegant were eloquent word
that<00:03:29.639> basically<00:03:30.639> is<00:03:31.030> nicer<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.540> read<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.019> this

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
that basically is nicer to read and this

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.789 
that basically is nicer to read and this
is<00:03:33.370> available<00:03:33.639> in<00:03:34.090> Spanish<00:03:34.900> French<00:03:35.470> and

is available in Spanish French and
English<00:03:36.489> at<00:03:36.909> the<00:03:36.940> moment<00:03:37.389> because<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.959> writer

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
English at the moment because the writer

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.229 
English at the moment because the writer
needs<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:40.389> developer<00:03:40.989> needs<00:03:41.019> to

needs to the developer needs to

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.699 
needs to the developer needs to
configure<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.359> with<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:43.959> dictionary<00:03:44.169> of<00:03:44.590> each

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
configure it with the dictionary of each

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.580 
configure it with the dictionary of each
language<00:03:44.919> so<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.579> can<00:03:46.319> do<00:03:47.319> all<00:03:47.379> of<00:03:47.409> these

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
language so that it can do all of these

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.159 
language so that it can do all of these
things<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.299> syntax<00:03:49.510> which<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.989> can

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
things so the syntax which you can

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.780 
things so the syntax which you can
outline<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.709> ranges<00:03:50.949> from<00:03:51.099> sentences

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
outline the ranges from sentences

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.099 
outline the ranges from sentences
adjectives<00:03:52.659> nouns<00:03:53.019> adverbs<00:03:53.859> prepositions

and<00:03:56.109> even<00:03:56.409> conjugations<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:58.229> find<00:03:59.229> this

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
and even conjugations I find this

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.490 
and even conjugations I find this
especially<00:03:59.560> useful<00:04:00.090> because<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.269> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
especially useful because of the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.309 
especially useful because of the
sentence<00:04:02.500> syntax<00:04:03.489> outlining<00:04:03.909> because<00:04:04.629> I<00:04:04.750> for

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
sentence syntax outlining because I for

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.869 
sentence syntax outlining because I for
example<00:04:05.440> if<00:04:05.739> I'm<00:04:05.919> writing<00:04:06.129> something<00:04:06.549> here

and<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.090> have<00:04:07.209> sentences<00:04:07.780> on<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.470> really<00:04:08.650> helps

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
and I have sentences on it really helps

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.170 
and I have sentences on it really helps
me<00:04:09.159> concentrate<00:04:09.790> on<00:04:11.579> what<00:04:12.579> I'm<00:04:12.699> writing<00:04:12.879> at
