 Macarras and demons seem to share a 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.920
 same but to finish with us

 Amman joint clean and unblocking 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.179
 new combos while we go into 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920
 history we will advance through the 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.710
 different play areas 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.690

 special against enemies too 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.180
 We can throw or use objects from 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.460
 environment the main characteristic of 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.380
 jane our protagonist is that he had 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.630
 the power of the voice so what 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.729
 allowed sporadic use of a force 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.940
 superhuman delivering blows 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.340
 special and most destructive of this 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.159
 brute force we can only take it off to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.080
 have the lower bar recharged 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.020
 spent using it gotham and recharging 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.090
 is with the effective combos throughout 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.940
 of the adventure we would accumulate more 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.220
 special blows taking advantage of the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.490
 action roulette that included 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.470
 curiously devastating movements to the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.690
 kill certain enemies or break some 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.269
 elements of the environment were given to us or 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.060
 good coins to spend or good food 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.830
 with which to recover part of life with 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.450
 the accumulated money we could go from 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.150
 purchases in order to improve our 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.760
 character with new actions 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.129
 the challenge was not too difficult 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.620
 although the final enemies with powers 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.629
 demonic people offered us a good challenge 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.579
 having to dodge more assiduously 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.950
 his attacks moving the right stick 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.629
 as well as having to use the powers 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.650
 of good hands and interactive actions 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.120
 to finish them as soon as possible 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.099
 spread across the stage we find 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.620
 some nadas that offered us missions 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.209
 secondaries mainly finish with 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.790
 certain number of enemies in X 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.579
 graphically time the game was 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.099
 quite irregular big characters 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.150
 well designed and animated 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.980
 they countered with scenarios something 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.680
 poor with parts that appeared and 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.920
 they disappeared counting on a pop and that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.659
 it ended up being usual in the game 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.659
 some scenarios presented a crowd 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.609
 of destructible elements was the 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.920
 gameplay what stood out from this 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.840
 most attractive and profound proposal 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.760
 they check we're going and we discover 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.430
 all the possibilities that we are 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.109
 offered from customize attacks 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.329
 we used to make certain buttons 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.710
 to the use of crazy roulette that enhanced 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.650
 the humorous touch 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.660
 both with okami and with gods and clover 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.610
 motor studio that do weird games 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.430
 of noses and bet on something very 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.430
 alternative can be novel and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.410
 appealing to players a game 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.320
 that it was worth remembering in 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.900
 sensation track and in the next chapter 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.900
 we remember the series without being
