take<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.740> look<00:01:36.920> at<00:01:37.010> this<00:01:37.100> photo<00:01:37.400> now<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:37.970> can

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
take a look at this photo now you can

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.090 
take a look at this photo now you can
see<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.510> probably<00:01:38.780> 40<00:01:39.230> or<00:01:39.320> 50<00:01:39.560> hairs<00:01:39.770> here

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
see this probably 40 or 50 hairs here

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.860 
see this probably 40 or 50 hairs here
and<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.820> could<00:01:40.970> be<00:01:41.000> any<00:01:41.210> part<00:01:41.540> of<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> body

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
and this could be any part of the body

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.220 
and this could be any part of the body
legs<00:01:42.260> arms<00:01:42.680> bikini<00:01:43.250> line<00:01:43.430> yes<00:01:43.970> even<00:01:44.480> underarms

legs arms bikini line yes even underarms

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.080 
legs arms bikini line yes even underarms
now<00:01:45.500> look<00:01:45.710> at<00:01:45.830> what<00:01:45.980> happened<00:01:46.400> this<00:01:46.550> person

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
now look at what happened this person

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.850 
now look at what happened this person
used<00:01:47.330> no<00:01:47.480> no<00:01:47.690> twice<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.020> week<00:01:48.350> for<00:01:48.380> six<00:01:48.590> weeks

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
used no no twice a week for six weeks

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.620 
used no no twice a week for six weeks
well<00:01:49.430> there's<00:01:49.610> certainly<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.060> lot<00:01:50.270> less<00:01:50.300> hair

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
well there's certainly a lot less hair

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.420 
well there's certainly a lot less hair
there<00:01:50.900> there's<00:01:51.290> really<00:01:51.470> only<00:01:51.590> about<00:01:51.920> half<00:01:52.220> of

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
there there's really only about half of

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.070 
there there's really only about half of
the<00:01:52.580> amount<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:52.940> that's<00:01:53.060> after<00:01:53.450> just<00:01:53.660> one<00:01:53.810> use

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
the amount and that's after just one use

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.990 
the amount and that's after just one use
but<00:01:54.530> look<00:01:54.710> again<00:01:54.830> we<00:01:55.250> ask<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:55.610> person<00:01:55.820> to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
but look again we ask this person to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.520 
but look again we ask this person to
stop<00:01:56.300> all<00:01:56.510> hair<00:01:56.780> removal<00:01:57.140> treatments

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
stop all hair removal treatments

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.650 
stop all hair removal treatments
including<00:01:58.070> no<00:01:58.220> no<00:01:58.400> for<00:01:58.610> another<00:01:58.910> six<00:01:59.240> week<00:01:59.450> and

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
including no no for another six week and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.110 
including no no for another six week and
the<00:01:59.870> hair<00:02:00.080> still<00:02:00.470> hasn't<00:02:00.860> grown<00:02:01.010> back<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.790> this

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
the hair still hasn't grown back is this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.120 
the hair still hasn't grown back is this
scientifically<00:02:02.690> proven<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.440> sure<00:02:03.800> is

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
scientifically proven it sure is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.010 
scientifically proven it sure is
clinical<00:02:04.760> studies<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:05.150> shown<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.570> hair

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
clinical studies have shown that hair

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.840 
clinical studies have shown that hair
regrowth<00:02:06.410> is<00:02:06.620> visibly<00:02:07.070> reduced<00:02:07.490> for<00:02:07.610> up<00:02:07.700> to

a week start now and just in
imagine<00:02:12.980> how<00:02:13.129> smooth<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.580> look<00:02:13.730> by<00:02:13.909> summer

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
imagine how smooth you look by summer

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
but the key is you must use it at least

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.009 
but the key is you must use it at least
twice<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.459> week<00:02:16.610> more<00:02:16.970> if<00:02:17.090> possible<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.720> the
