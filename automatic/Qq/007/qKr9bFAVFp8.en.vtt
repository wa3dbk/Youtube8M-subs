you could have been

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.510 
you could have been
it's<00:01:57.930> hard<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.140> say<00:01:58.260> when<00:01:58.470> I'm<00:01:58.680> saw<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.250> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
it's hard to say when I'm saw because I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.310 
it's hard to say when I'm saw because I
tend<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.150> focus<00:02:00.300> more<00:02:00.510> on<00:02:00.720> what<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:00.990> weaknesses

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
tend to focus more on what my weaknesses

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410 
tend to focus more on what my weaknesses
are<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> could<00:02:02.520> try<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.670> correct<00:02:03.000> them<00:02:03.150> but<00:02:03.390> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
are so I could try to correct them but I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.850 
are so I could try to correct them but I
think<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.020> biggest<00:02:04.200> strength<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.590> had<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860
