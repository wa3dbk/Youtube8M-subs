00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 reservation it is not recommended because we

 we have a fuel reserve in 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 around 5 to 7 liters and heating the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.160
 fuel pump that is larger than the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 then the life of this pump 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.050
 fuels and halved 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:18.479
 I'm going to give the engine a 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:19.470
 he rode his vehicle better here before 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.090
 to leave 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.610
 not recommended because you go 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 to grow only the part of the engine 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.780
 You will leave with the whole Exchange Exchange 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.130
 the transmission with the cold car also 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.020
 then it is not recommended to heat the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.030
 vehicle before the vehicle leaving home 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.630
 naturally warm you with it in 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.630
 movement 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.240
 foot on the clutch pedal that causes 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.609
 a wear of the tractor springs and 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.350
 clutch disc also exists 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.100
 today vehicles that work with the act 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.750
 pain 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.789
 you are forcing this set of 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.009
 the actuator being that you could be with 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.060
 the free foot the vehicle stopped and you with the 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.100
 foot on the brake 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.289
 Let's play the car in the trash can 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.090
 saving fuel is already in the 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.579
 booking in the bath also we did not 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.590
 we recommend by case that the vehicle 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.359
 vehicle has a system that it recognizes 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.019
 every moment that you are doing with 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.539
 the vehicle 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.360
 we have today basically three sensors 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.190
 the brake pedal and the brake pedal 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.470
 the accelerator you play 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.690
 this vehicle in banguela he does not have 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.880
 this information more then vehicle 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.340
 passes he continues to inject fuel 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.220
 the nozzles if you have with the vehicle 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.440
 geared the management system recognizes 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.329
 that you have trained and you will stop the 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.040
 vehicle then there is a moment that he 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.180
 cuts off the nozzles and stops 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.180
 keeping vehicle on 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.980
 with your hand on the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.050
 adriana exchange is not recommended 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.600
 first you only have one hand behind the wheel 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.819
 and this impairs the driving of the vehicle and 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.459
 second you will be walking in support of 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.930
 weight on the set of calculator 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.550
 shift of this vehicle goes 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.820
 damage the bushes and repair the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.820
 tuner 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.210
 pass through spines through 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.180
 cause of distortion of that body of the 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.280
 bushing suspension set and up to 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.230
 Aligning the vehicle on a street 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.450
 narrow in I think I'll stop the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.980
 car half over the curb when 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.340
 run the risk of someone taking a 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.340
 rearview mirror 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.990
 is also not recommended because the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.030
 vehicle there is a minimum twist 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.460
 or maximum body size and you can 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.170
 taking this twist to the maximum of 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.660
 bodywork damaging closure and 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.450
 opening the doors of the vehicle is not to 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.140
 to have better habits change habits 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.140
 direction right
