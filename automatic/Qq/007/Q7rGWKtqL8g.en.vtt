00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
 all right 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.360
 Y 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.080
 hi guys girls what are you like 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.670
 what game is this is all white and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.800
 black ops 2 multiplayer game 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.880
 domain in the cargo map I had 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.710
 opportunity to play the game during 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.779
 the last days and I bring you here my 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.300
 first opinions can not record the 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.610
 first game I recorded it I commented on 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.020
 direct but he had a technical problem he 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.669
 recorded with the comment but wrong the 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.439
 audio in order that I can not use it but 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.050
 well I brought my first good game 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.210
 jumps and dies and with my best 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.680
 impressions my impressions let's what 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.970
 what did I think in the first part 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.710
 of the video I do it super well so 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.870
 I will tell you so much on the floor 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.610
 I'm going to tell you the things that I 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.470
 like and in the second part of the video 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.610
 It worked out worse for me, I'll tell you 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.230
 the things that I do not like we are going to 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.760
 start with the things that I like the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.100
 first you are seeing it even in this 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.750
 map that is a bit like this industrial the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.550
 colors have improved the colors that is 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.740
 a bullshit but good the truth is that 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.410
 in black ops one may have left a little 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.479
 want the maps the textures of 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.009
 the colors I do not know the general feeling 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.930
 here the maps are still very good 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.520
 At least that seemed to me but 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.320
 with a little more colorful a bit more 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.789
 nice that looks like a bullshit but 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.110
 good at the end when you're going to throw 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.680
 many hours 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.880
 that matters according to the sound 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.340
 it was one of the weak points of black 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.030
 ops and I think they have improved it here 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.740
 the sound is more realistic based on 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.720
 who you have next if you have a wall 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.160
 but if you're closer to further the 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.100
 weapons explosions I think it's 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.020
 better there is not as much nonsense as 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.570
 in the black ops 1 that if the train that 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.979
 if he does not know that here we are going he dies here 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.270
 Well, today is what you have to 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.620
 living the truth which has also liked 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.479
 you can turn off the music you can 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.130
 activate what you want that more things 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.780
 have liked the animations there you see 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.780
 they are very simple animations 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.970
 they pretend to be realistic they do not pretend 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.220
 compete with battlefield 3 pretend to be 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.170
 an arcade arcade and I think what 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.850
 get has some air bounded 4 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.460
 also certain air to modern warfare 3 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.710
 it's not so comic the dolls are not so 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.509
 comic as in white but yes as black 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.979
 ops 1 sorry I think that's a 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.470
 improvement at least to me it gives me a 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.200
 feeling of efficiency that you see what 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.450
 what you have to see without too many 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.700
 complications not that more things have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.620
 liked the weapons here you see how I carry 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.830
 a mp7 before I looked at this look 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.200
 but move ivory man before he wore 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.360
 another wings I liked very much all 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.099
 they have little recoil but they are not 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.250
 so so easy to use has been 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.019
 lost a bit the retro air of black 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.120
 ops 1 but well I still like that and that 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.950
 it brings me to the second part when I speak 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.319
 of the attacks of improvements that can 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.120
 have the weapons I will talk about the creation 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.769
 of classes I do not know if you knew but the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.120
 class creation you have 10 slots 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.930
 attention because there launched an attack 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.790
 lightning that is kind of like 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.609
 aires burned is a kind of attack 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.079
 of mortar good then you have 10 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.760
 slots and in these 10 were some you 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.260
 you can use them as you want a weapon is 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.569
 one slot one secondary weapon is another 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.970
 an advantage of yours is another an improvement of the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.170
 weapon is another so you can handle it 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.390
 as you want and for now that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.700
 I really like weapons have a lot 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.129
 of improvements to attack things that 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.359
 you can put in and make the experience 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.430
 very different and that the truth has 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.310
 liked that I like more way cinema eye 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.049
 the game of 13-2 movie mode is the same 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.000
 that of black ops 1 which is to say 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.560
 a lot because for me it's the best way 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.340
 obviously the call of duty cinema 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.830
 you can 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.209
 leave it but good thing mode is very 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.160
 well and you also have good things like 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.800
 for example the creation of your best 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.510
 moments the game automatically you 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.980
 click with the best moments of 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.180
 your author part and you say I want all 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.920
 the casualties I want all the casualties with 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.640
 explosives I want every time there 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.379
 added points 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.360
 I want all the casualties that are 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.370
 spectacular because they are triple low 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.690
 you put it and it will automatically 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 catch the game and it makes you the best 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.220
 moments in a clip and that may be useful 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.980
 really for many people I think 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.959
 I that the gusts the gusts are a 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.790
 little like modern warfare 3 the ones 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.110
 there are I liked they are very cool 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.720
 they are very futuristic but neither 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.760
 too excessive there is no love 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.750
 or anything like that although the 19 the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.950
 swarm is a pass 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.989
 I like it because you then accumulate 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.360
 adding points you do not need to kill 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.549
 simply adding points assists 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.070
 pulling to v is when the goal is going 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.019
 adding gusts and that allows you then 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.850
 I obviously had to have them but when 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.680
 you get to the third one you come back from 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.900
 way that if you do not die and you did for 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.610
 example a 30-0 you could throw six 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.919
 or nine stripes or whatever it was not that 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.150
 like and also when you kill with a 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.260
 streak of points I do not know 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.410
 low streak and no streak of points 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.810
 when you kill with a streak of points that 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.700
 it also adds less but adds you and that 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.950
 the truth is that I liked it because 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.020
 You saw it there before with the mortar 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.500
 that each death added 25 instead of 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.000
 100 eye that you fry is this kind of 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.800
 pot that depressed I like a lot 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.870
 in order that with the gusts you can continue 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.640
 adding up but less it seems a success 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.530
 and I find it surprising that I do not 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.930
 had raised so far no 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.720
 call of duty those are the things that I 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.940
 like in the general feeling of the game 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.370
 It's very good I had a great time 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.660
 sincerely with modern warfare 3 no 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.860
 I had that feeling from the beginning 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.810
 attention that I kill him through the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.180
 wall so good things really 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.290
 they are many and the feeling when playing what 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.640
 that is one thing that I had seen 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.230
 many videos but until I do not 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.540
 you play you do not know the feeling has 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.310
 liked to see we go to the second round 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.140
 in which I do it much worse than it has 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.700
 finished 19-3 very well but now I know 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.260
 it's going to spoil and we're going to talk about the 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.390
 things that I do not like unfortunately 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.910
 bad news the connection the connection 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.840
 it's crap they're playing it on xbox 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.430
 but I will also have it in 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.140
 playstation and I 'll tell you when 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.670
 have the playstation but the connection 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.090
 continues to fail as in all call of 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.720
 duty 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.460
 if you have 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.680
 Stripe you always go a bullet from behind 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.150
 It is also true that when I played in 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.830
 these days before the launch of the 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.900
 game there were less people and others 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.460
 countries with which good I do not know either 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.050
 You can know better when I think 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.570
 with Spaniards because the connection is better 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.950
 but in general the connection is bad and 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.300
 you had that feeling that when 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.100
 you have a bad connection you are going to make a 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.690
 bad game yes or yes and that's very 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.580
 frustrating and it's the worst of the call of 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.010
 duty so in that sense bad 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.810
 news that there are no more code points or 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.270
 are all points of experience not 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.600
 you have like in the other one in the black ops 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.400
 the possibility of unlocking things 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.200
 and decide how you spend those points 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.510
 they're all experience points and that's how 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.010
 spend and I think that that is a mistake is 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.020
 simpler but I liked them a lot 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.240
 the code points are not there 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.220
 contracts there are betting games but 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.870
 No code points there are no contracts 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.000
 a lot of challenges in many ways 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.830
 different and that's fine but the idea 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.810
 of the black ops contract to me 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.360
 I loved and the truth honestly the 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.490
 I miss they have also removed a mode 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.660
 of game that is called sabotage that 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.430
 you know it's my favorite they've taken it 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.620
 surely because he did not play or Christ 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.690
 but I liked it with which he fucks me 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.770
 that they have removed it they have put a way 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.500
 new that is called 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.900
 in which there are three patrols of three 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.669
 playing at the same time you compete against 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.949
 another team but against two others 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.319
 equipment and that's fine but I like it 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.759
 then there are the league games that 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.530
 I honestly could not prove when 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.300
 I tried it with the two I can try it 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.229
 I'll explain it but good for now 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.930
 those would be the things that I do not 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:06.620
 eye eye eye eye eye eye kill it now 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.259
 at once 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.030
 fuck the customization and that and all 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:13.639
 those issues that I have not said is still 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.190
 great you can customize it all the 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:18.440
 arms the little symbol that has this there 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.020
 all of that all that the truth that not what 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.120
 have lost and I liked that but 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.819
 good in the end attention that I 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.280
 kill that has been my analysis of black 

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:29.449
 ops 2 my first impressions very 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.370
 fast I will obviously go up 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.139
 many videos made this very afternoon 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.940
 it will upload a video of a series that 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:37.039
 called gusts stitches that explained the 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.680
 larger gusts so you can see them in 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:41.030
 in instructions mode or yes but good 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.409
 I think it can be interesting for 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.930
 those who doubt and if you want to know 

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:46.699
 how is each streak of points not of casualties 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.350
 etcetera no, because this has been all this 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.460
 it will be my departure 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.290
 that you liked it I hope that I have 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:56.290
 served a lot and play black ops 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.290
 guys 28-12 see you then goodbye
