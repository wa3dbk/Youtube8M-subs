look at the vapor 40 shoulder pad and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.369 
look at the vapor 40 shoulder pad and
personally<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.719> probably<00:00:12.930> my<00:00:13.049> favorite

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
shoulder pad on the market it's

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.790 
shoulder pad on the market it's
unbelievably<00:00:15.539> mobile<00:00:15.990> just<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:16.619> you'd

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
unbelievably mobile just what you'd

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.439 
unbelievably mobile just what you'd
expect<00:00:16.860> from<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.369> vapor<00:00:17.670> line<00:00:17.910> they<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
expect from the vapor line they have a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.939 
expect from the vapor line they have a
lot<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.840> features<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.170> really<00:00:19.529> make<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> pads

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
lot of features to really make the pads

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.650 
lot of features to really make the pads
move<00:00:20.190> with<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.670> instead<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.420> kind<00:00:21.599> of

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
move with you instead of kind of

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.689 
move with you instead of kind of
restricting<00:00:22.109> your<00:00:22.230> movements<00:00:22.679> sorry<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
restricting your movements sorry on the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.480 
restricting your movements sorry on the
front<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.900> dense<00:00:25.589> sternum<00:00:26.009> protector

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
front we have a dense sternum protector

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.489 
front we have a dense sternum protector
that's<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.089> a<00:00:27.179> plastic<00:00:27.660> feel<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> but

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
that's like a plastic feel to it but

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.989 
that's like a plastic feel to it but
it's<00:00:28.619> only<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.130> portion<00:00:29.550> right<00:00:29.640> here

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
it's only in that one portion right here

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.609 
it's only in that one portion right here
so<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> don't<00:00:30.720> really<00:00:30.869> feel<00:00:31.079> it<00:00:31.230> binding

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
mobility out of it you have if you move

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.980 
mobility out of it you have if you move
this<00:01:11.310> guy<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.480> this<00:01:12.690> where<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
this guy up you have this where you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
this guy up you have this where you
actually<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.500> take<00:01:13.710> them<00:01:14.040> off<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> extend

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
actually can take them off and extend

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.720 
actually can take them off and extend
the<00:01:15.420> length<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:15.900> contrast<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.580> it's

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
the length or contrast it really it's

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.730 
the length or contrast it really it's
all<00:01:17.910> personalizing<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> fit<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.230> it<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.560> fit

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
all personalizing the fit of it to fit

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.370 
all personalizing the fit of it to fit
work<00:01:19.950> best<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.370> you<00:01:20.870> moving<00:01:21.870> on<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.170> back

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
work best for you moving on to the back

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
work best for you moving on to the back
pretty<00:01:23.100> similar<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> front<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.480> have<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
pretty similar to the front you have the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780 
pretty similar to the front you have the
outside<00:01:25.260> portions<00:01:25.800> that<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.490> single

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
outside portions that are the single

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.910 
outside portions that are the single
density<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.420> well<00:01:28.050> as<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.230> center<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.800> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
density as well as the center with the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920 
density as well as the center with the
dual<00:01:29.310> density<00:01:29.520> foams<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.270> well<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.660> you<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
dual density foams as well as you see a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.170 
dual density foams as well as you see a
lots<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> segments<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.640> allows<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
lots of segments in it this allows the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.300 
lots of segments in it this allows the
product<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.810> move<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.560> instead

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
product to really move with you instead

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.040 
product to really move with you instead
of<00:01:35.370> against<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.450> don't<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.780> feel

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
of against you you don't really feel

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.600 
of against you you don't really feel
like<00:01:37.230> you're<00:01:37.380> wearing<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:37.920> much<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
like you're wearing it as much when you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.540 
like you're wearing it as much when you
have<00:01:38.760> it<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.920> alright<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.070> moving<00:01:41.190> on<00:01:41.430> to
