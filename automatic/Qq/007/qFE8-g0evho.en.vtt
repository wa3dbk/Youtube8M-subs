go on to this side and clean it we need
to<00:01:25.110> pull<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.520> tensioner<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
to pull this one the tensioner is on the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
to pull this one the tensioner is on the
front<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.380> case<00:01:28.650> where<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.130> leaking

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
front in this case where it's leaking

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
front in this case where it's leaking
oil<00:01:31.430> may<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> pull<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.630> timing<00:01:33.960> belt

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
oil may have to pull the timing belt

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.090 
oil may have to pull the timing belt
we're<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.409> sure<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.860> yet

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
we're not sure just yet

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.390 
we're not sure just yet
hopefully<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:37.680> once<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
hopefully not but once we do it we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.010 
hopefully not but once we do it we
basically<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> exact<00:01:39.240> same<00:01:39.360> thing<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.869> did

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
basically do the exact same thing we did

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.859 
basically do the exact same thing we did
on<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.290> side<00:01:40.560> put<00:01:41.369> these<00:01:41.729> two<00:01:42.210> new<00:01:42.360> pieces<00:01:42.659> in

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
on that side put these two new pieces in

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.039 
on that side put these two new pieces in
a<00:01:43.290> new<00:01:43.979> gasket<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.670> outside<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> valve
