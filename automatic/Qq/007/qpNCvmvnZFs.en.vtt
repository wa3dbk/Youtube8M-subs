00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.439
 and while we continue to share a 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 mates let's know more about this 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.019
 field day that took place at the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.539
 experimental station bishop colombres 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.329
 in tafi del valle since the institution 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.800
 is analyzing varieties of blueberries 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.530
 with high requirements of hours of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
 cold the objective is to be able to find a 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.640
 variety that provides fruit in the months 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.560
 February and March which is when there is a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.690
 lack worldwide is this 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.820
 fruit why we to be able to 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.500
 learn more and about the answers 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.719
 that are already having the varieties in 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.850
 tafí of the base we have talked in form 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.829
 exclusive with lips roger a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.829
 specialist in varieties of blueberries 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.980
 claudio kubes to tucumán in the production 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.910
 of blueberries continue in this evolution 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:56.410
 how do you analyze the truth justly 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:00.670
 that we are surprised 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.989
 year after year of what is tucumán when I 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.900
 I came the first time I came with full of 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.300
 doubts hopefully say if the area was going to 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.540
 work and the truth that is 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.570
 here the spectacular production 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.760
 varieties what is the ventures 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.380
 at the economic level the return 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.380
 a more expensive surprise 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.560
 no no no 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.330
 there is no perfect variety but 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.330
 we if there are varieties that we carry 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.470
 years watching with very very good 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.380
 productive levels the case of google 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.040
 this one that stands out in that sense and that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.760
 maybe he is not so strong in what is the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.310
 firmness that is very important for what 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.280
 which evaluates the receiver there 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.200
 marketer although it has very good 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.220
 fruit quality but that's a little more 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.740
 loose in terms of firmness 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.410
 but good spectacular in what is the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.259
 productivity time little time 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.080
 that it takes them to reach many kilos 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.930
 plant in that excels and then good 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.820
 we have m to be within the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.480
 varieties that already have more years in the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.460
 province and after being more recent 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.430
 but that we already have more than three 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.120
 vintages of experience varieties that 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.490
 They are very good to hook the window 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.870
 early scoop which is the case of 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.090
 snow cheiser or primadonna and above all 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.480
 it's night and being is very very early 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.880
 Maybe it's a bit of a screw 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.640
 we say not too early can 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.630
 become in a warm year like the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.970
 last year then you have to fix a 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.060
 little bit 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.970
 the management issue that sometimes with the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.880
 variety the left and do what 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.010
 naturally does and in a year an autumn 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.250
 warm as it was last year is a 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.860
 variety is night and maybe it was 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.870
 too early and it generates another 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.470
 problematic is going to find us a 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.980
 early market or send it by ship 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.550
 what we said alternatives may arise 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.280
 but it generates a problem before 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.160
 We wanted to have it because it covers a lot 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.650
 better the window that and we have say or 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.690
 there is a range of other things that 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.630
 always new that are coming and that 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.850
 it's still too early to say 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.670
 because we've only seen one or 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.610
 two harvests then we try 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.350
 to be a little cautious about that and give them a 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.350
 little bit more we like to have so 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.290
 less 34 years of experience this because 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.270
 not every year are equal and good 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.280
 but we see some promising things 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.940
 some with very good fruit quality 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.020
 very good firmness that is something he 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.660
 look and other early and others very 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.640
 unfortunately productive 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.910
 we have is in a variety all 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.080
 attributes together but of course our 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.850
 early varieties that were what 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.220
 both looked for the producer did not for 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.260
 the exact commercial streak if today too 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.090
 is looking for the other window 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.269
 commercial for the months of February in 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.850
 March new alternatives through the 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.520
 cranberry if there are varieties that respond 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.610
 for those good months a little bit what 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.230
 the trial that we are here 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.500
 taking along with the 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.630
 experimental is about that or 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.870
 us this is an area that has 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.570
 some potential drawbacks and 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.680
 have because for example we are day 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.780
 typical of this rainy season 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.940
 when one produces more the pedemonte or 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.370
 down that problem we do not have it 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.020
 just towards the end of the harvest it 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.510
 it gets more rainy that would be a 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.970
 inconvenient but we see that for a 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.340
 question that there are more cold hours here and 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.320
 that the harvest would be later than 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.040
 maybe you can 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.750
 that window that is that second window 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.230
 of contraestation that has very good 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.120
 price for that what we did is not you 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.470
 I will give no variety name 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.390
 because it is what we are exactly 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.370
 looking here and we are still 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.550
 insufficient experience of both and 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.130
 we repeat we have trials of two 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.540
 crops that were finished and this one that 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.810
 is in progress 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.330
 this is but with some variability 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.360
 then we see that we still can not 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.390
 point something but if what we see is that 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.620
 in a group of 15 varieties that we are 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:48.170
 experiencing here of all kinds or 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.800
 north on high bus south high bus o 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.750
 rabbit à me eye of rabbits that say 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.330
 in that range of varieties that is a 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.940
 very important genetic variability 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.790
 we see that there are varieties that start 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:06.530
 produce since the end of December 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:09.530
 at the beginning of January and others that are 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.420
 giving the peak of the harvest during the 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.689
 second half of February and first 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.259
 March days 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:19.809
 that is, that potential of a fan a 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.729
 wide range of harvest dates 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:24.489
 different to hook maybe that 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:27.069
 window or upload the fruit to a boat if 

00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:29.469
 It has good quality and that the 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:32.919
 months those March that's where it starts 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:35.019
 to raise the price could exist but 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.239
 perhaps with smaller yields or until 

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:40.089
 let's learn some things from driving 

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:41.829
 own of the east area that we have 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:43.360
 decreased the renderings as for example 

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:46.779
 the theme of frost this year has been 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:50.139
 Here, the essay has no control 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:51.849
 of frost and it has been very significant 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.999
 there have been late frosts here in 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:57.309
 November and that has decreased since 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:59.379
 change the result between variety and 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:02.159
 very different varieties 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:02.159
 with respect to other years
