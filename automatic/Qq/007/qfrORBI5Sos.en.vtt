00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.140
 there are marquisians of your ideas for 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.240
 two of the ten southern two 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.100
 critics but who are not islands 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.090
 remote since the laws of my fact 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.750
 that they can not join our 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.610
 association 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.200
 the work is done according to bath 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.540
 already of the tattooist's intelligence if he 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.220
 is relational or not so artists 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.810
 he proposed his work and then it's 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.940
 a customer who says here this is it 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.770
 is running and pital tattooist a little bit more 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.810
 class that has the relational that is 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.430
 free like me a little bit that is a little 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.250
 blur girl from 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.410
 how to say of psychology so who 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.330
 like to work in discussions 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 first and done a job in 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.110
 function of the failures 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.540
 I work a lot in the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.860
 psychedelic in the abstract and the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.600
 trompe l'oeil but still staying 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.100
 to stay Polynesian and in addition in the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.970
 Southern style since I am 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.070
 originated from the ground Islands grounds 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.860
 very healthy but very warrior so a little 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.740
 harder the Marquesan style and at the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.000
 finesse ago 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.710
 there are certain forms that there are not 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.549
 elsewhere but since it is 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.350
 become very classic and evolve so 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.290
 many young people tattooed in marquisian 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.759
 between make evolve this style marchisio 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.009
 which is fine and what is asked 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.750
 if they want to last longer in this 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.790
 job where we make the effort of us 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.010
 to come together for fun already 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.510
 get together to organize 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.330
 something in common since everyone has 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.770
 his business every day so all the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.670
 world depends on oneself one has each one 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.470
 our fan club 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.300
 our clientele we need between 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.250
 parentheses of no one else but 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.520
 with time and maturity in this 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.479
 middle each of the tattooists understands that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.290
 in this environment it's good to 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.290
 find from time to time 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.810
 that's what they're part of this 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.790
 ala association that day more than one 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.070
 Fifty tattoo artists already have a 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.560
 hygiene training so this 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.060
 convention this is the moment or never of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.710
 make her soup to make her market of 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.400
 choose according to the qualities of 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.890
 each of tattoo 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.579
 from the customer's request and then especially 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.739
 lucky to have to find all and 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.239
 all in the same place at the same time without 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.599
 need to go right or left 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.599
