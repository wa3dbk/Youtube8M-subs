00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
all right welcome to episode number six

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570 
all right welcome to episode number six
from<00:00:15.839> chapter<00:00:16.170> 14<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.160> episode

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
from chapter 14 and in this episode

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.400 
from chapter 14 and in this episode
we're<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> cover<00:00:17.970> sickle-cell<00:00:18.660> disease

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we're going to cover sickle-cell disease

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.410 
we're going to cover sickle-cell disease
now<00:00:19.980> sickle-cell<00:00:20.460> disease<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> genetic

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
now sickle-cell disease is a genetic

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.960 
now sickle-cell disease is a genetic
disorder<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:23.160> found<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.519> people<00:00:23.699> of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
disorder that is found in people of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.570 
disorder that is found in people of
sub-saharan<00:00:24.869> African<00:00:25.289> descent<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
sub-saharan African descent so the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.429 
sub-saharan African descent so the
Sahara<00:00:26.970> Desert<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.539> remember<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
Sahara Desert if you remember is the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.730 
Sahara Desert if you remember is the
northern<00:00:29.039> part<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.670> Africa<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:31.019> lower<00:00:31.410> half

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
northern part of Africa the lower half

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.440 
northern part of Africa the lower half
of<00:00:32.009> Africa<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:32.759> actually<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> pretty<00:00:33.360> much

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
of Africa are actually the pretty much

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.920 
of Africa are actually the pretty much
lower<00:00:33.690> two-thirds<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.790> a<00:00:35.790> lot<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> rainforests

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
lower two-thirds is a lot of rainforests

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.139 
lower two-thirds is a lot of rainforests
you<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> savannas<00:00:37.739> etc<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.059> going

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
you have the savannas etc so it's going

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
you have the savannas etc so it's going
to<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.300> people<00:00:39.480> who<00:00:39.629> live<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.710> born<00:00:41.010> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
to be people who live or are born in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
to be people who live or are born in
that<00:00:41.250> area<00:00:42.350> they're<00:00:43.350> gonna<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> ones<00:00:43.860> who

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that area they're gonna be the ones who

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
that area they're gonna be the ones who
could<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.090> sickle<00:00:45.390> cell<00:00:45.600> disease<00:00:45.629> running

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
could have sickle cell disease running

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
could have sickle cell disease running
through<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.410> family<00:00:46.739> tree<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
through your family tree now this is a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.389 
through your family tree now this is a
result<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> point<00:00:49.050> mutation<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.649> fact<00:00:49.890> one

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
result of a point mutation in fact one

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.979 
result of a point mutation in fact one
letter<00:00:50.760> has<00:00:51.030> changed<00:00:51.570> okay

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
letter has changed okay

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.260 
letter has changed okay
and<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.829> that's<00:00:53.039> only<00:00:53.190> gonna<00:00:53.430> affect<00:00:53.789> one

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and so that's only gonna affect one

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
and so that's only gonna affect one
single<00:00:54.960> amino<00:00:55.230> acid<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.039> looked<00:00:56.280> on

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
single amino acid so if you looked on

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.090 
single amino acid so if you looked on
the<00:00:56.730> last<00:00:56.969> screencast<00:00:57.780> where<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.620> had<00:00:58.710> cystic

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the last screencast where we had cystic

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369 
the last screencast where we had cystic
fibrosis<00:00:59.129> where<00:00:59.789> an<00:00:59.879> entire<00:01:00.210> codon<00:01:00.930> was

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
fibrosis where an entire codon was

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.910 
fibrosis where an entire codon was
missing<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.960> point

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
missing this one we have a point

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.260 
missing this one we have a point
mutation<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.460> only<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.820> letter<00:01:06.090> has

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
mutation we're only one letter has

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
mutation we're only one letter has
changed<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.930> instead<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> having<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.740> entire

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
changed so instead of having an entire

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.609 
changed so instead of having an entire
amino<00:01:08.760> acid<00:01:09.090> missing<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.380> amino

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
amino acid missing we have one amino

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.399 
amino acid missing we have one amino
acid<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.010> gets<00:01:11.280> changed<00:01:11.760> okay<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:13.140> this

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
acid that gets changed okay now this

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.620 
acid that gets changed okay now this
will<00:01:13.650> affect<00:01:14.040> hemoglobin<00:01:14.700> hemoglobin<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
will affect hemoglobin hemoglobin is the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.380 
will affect hemoglobin hemoglobin is the
protein<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.560> carries<00:01:17.040> oxygen<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.270> red

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
protein that carries oxygen in your red

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
protein that carries oxygen in your red
blood<00:01:18.509> cells<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.619> will<00:01:19.799> cause<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.250> red

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
blood cells and this will cause your red

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.219 
blood cells and this will cause your red
blood<00:01:20.700> cells<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> wrong<00:01:21.630> shape<00:01:22.020> now

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
blood cells to have the wrong shape now

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.700 
blood cells to have the wrong shape now
this<00:01:22.409> occurs<00:01:22.710> under<00:01:22.950> acidic<00:01:24.500> situation<00:01:25.500> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
this occurs under acidic situation so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
this occurs under acidic situation so
when<00:01:26.310> you're<00:01:26.490> exercising<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.540> win

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
when you're exercising they win

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.050 
when you're exercising they win
something<00:01:27.930> vigorous<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.860> you're<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.759> really

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
something vigorous and you're you really

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.789 
something vigorous and you're you really
kicking<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.869> your<00:01:30.990> mitochondria<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> produce

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
kicking in your mitochondria to produce

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.160 
kicking in your mitochondria to produce
some<00:01:32.009> ATP<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.579> you're<00:01:32.670> creating<00:01:33.060> more<00:01:33.170> co2

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
some ATP and you're creating more co2

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.560 
some ATP and you're creating more co2
from<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> krebs<00:01:34.950> cycle<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:36.000> Bloods<00:01:36.450> gonna

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
from the krebs cycle your Bloods gonna

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.670 
from the krebs cycle your Bloods gonna
get<00:01:36.869> slightly<00:01:37.350> acidic<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.210> citizen

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
get slightly acidic and that a citizen

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.069 
get slightly acidic and that a citizen
is<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.009> cause<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.549> protein<00:01:42.479> hemoglobin

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
is going to cause the protein hemoglobin

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.440 
is going to cause the protein hemoglobin
to<00:01:43.470> change<00:01:43.829> its<00:01:44.070> shape<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> like

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
to change its shape and to think of like

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.899 
to change its shape and to think of like
a<00:01:45.479> Halfmoon<00:01:45.869> shape<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.579> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
a Halfmoon shape all right now this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
a Halfmoon shape all right now this
allele<00:01:48.240> shows<00:01:48.600> Co<00:01:49.020> dominus<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.680> remember<00:01:50.040> in

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
allele shows Co dominus now remember in

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.639 
allele shows Co dominus now remember in
codominance<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.450> heterozygous<00:01:52.079> individuals

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
codominance the heterozygous individuals

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.480 
codominance the heterozygous individuals
they're<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.729> express<00:01:54.770> both<00:01:55.770> alleles

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
they're going to express both alleles

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
they're going to express both alleles
okay<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.899> homozygous<00:01:58.380> recessive<00:01:58.950> now

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
okay now the homozygous recessive now

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
okay now the homozygous recessive now
those<00:01:59.310> are<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.790> codominance<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
those are when you have codominance you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.910 
those are when you have codominance you
don't<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> dominant<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
don't really have a dominant and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.410 
don't really have a dominant and
recessive<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.460> I'm<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.700> using<00:02:03.000> these<00:02:03.119> terms

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
recessive but I'm just using these terms

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.999 
recessive but I'm just using these terms
to<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:04.409> bit<00:02:04.560> easier<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:04.860> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
to make it a little bit easier for you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.289 
to make it a little bit easier for you
understand<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:05.969> tell<00:02:06.119> there's

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
understand so we can tell there's

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.570 
understand so we can tell there's
between<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.630> alleles<00:02:06.930> okay<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
between the alleles okay so the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.520 
between the alleles okay so the
recessive<00:02:09.030> allele<00:02:09.300> would<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.259> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
recessive allele would be the one that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.710 
recessive allele would be the one that
would<00:02:10.649> give<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.190> sickle-cell<00:02:12.090> disease<00:02:12.239> in

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
would give you sickle-cell disease in

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.369 
would give you sickle-cell disease in
this

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
this

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.280 
this
okay<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.969> are<00:02:15.120> homozygous<00:02:15.629> for<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
okay so if you are homozygous for the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.500 
okay so if you are homozygous for the
sickle<00:02:16.739> allele<00:02:16.890> your<00:02:17.790> red<00:02:17.969> blood<00:02:18.180> cells<00:02:18.420> are

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
sickle allele your red blood cells are

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.119 
sickle allele your red blood cells are
going<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.689> be<00:02:18.780> mostly<00:02:19.019> affected<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.650> fact<00:02:19.859> all

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
going to be mostly affected in fact all

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.459 
going to be mostly affected in fact all
of<00:02:20.189> them<00:02:20.639> will<00:02:20.939> be<00:02:21.060> affected<00:02:21.569> if<00:02:21.780> you're

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
of them will be affected if you're

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.580 
of them will be affected if you're
heterozygous<00:02:23.420> then<00:02:24.420> half<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.049> your<00:02:25.200> red<00:02:25.349> blood

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
heterozygous then half of your red blood

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.250 
heterozygous then half of your red blood
cells<00:02:25.859> will<00:02:26.219> will<00:02:26.609> have<00:02:26.790> good<00:02:27.120> hemoglobin<00:02:27.780> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
cells will will have good hemoglobin the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.280 
cells will will have good hemoglobin the
other<00:02:28.530> half<00:02:28.950> will<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.340> bad<00:02:30.090> hemoglobin<00:02:30.810> so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
other half will have bad hemoglobin so

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
other half will have bad hemoglobin so
you're<00:02:31.469> only<00:02:31.769> partially<00:02:32.310> effective<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.939> then

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you're only partially effective and then

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.580 
you're only partially effective and then
what<00:02:33.329> we're<00:02:33.510> calling<00:02:33.689> homozygous<00:02:34.260> dominant

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
what we're calling homozygous dominant

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.729 
what we're calling homozygous dominant
in<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.129> case<00:02:35.389> none<00:02:36.389> of<00:02:36.569> your<00:02:36.750> alleles<00:02:37.230> have

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
in this case none of your alleles have

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.649 
in this case none of your alleles have
the<00:02:37.920> sickle<00:02:38.280> cell<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:39.090> none<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.389> your<00:02:39.510> red

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
the sickle cell or none of your red

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.929 
the sickle cell or none of your red
blood<00:02:39.780> cells<00:02:40.109> are<00:02:40.349> affected<00:02:41.069> because<00:02:41.549> you're

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
blood cells are affected because you're

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.119 
blood cells are affected because you're
homozygous<00:02:42.389> good<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.139> in<00:02:43.260> other<00:02:43.319> words<00:02:43.560> you

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
homozygous good so in other words you

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.220 
homozygous good so in other words you
have<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.370> good<00:02:44.730> allele<00:02:45.209> for<00:02:45.840> perfect

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
have the good allele for perfect

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.970 
have the good allele for perfect
hemoglobin<00:02:46.859> okay<00:02:47.280> now<00:02:47.930> even<00:02:48.930> though<00:02:49.169> people

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
hemoglobin okay now even though people

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.490 
hemoglobin okay now even though people
with<00:02:50.099> sickle-cell<00:02:50.430> disease<00:02:51.019> they<00:02:52.019> typically

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
with sickle-cell disease they typically

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.589 
with sickle-cell disease they typically
don't<00:02:52.799> live<00:02:53.219> long<00:02:53.519> enough<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.969> reproduce<00:02:54.239> and

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
don't live long enough to reproduce and

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.289 
don't live long enough to reproduce and
pass<00:02:54.629> this<00:02:54.959> on<00:02:55.169> this<00:02:56.159> allele<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.730> relatively

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
pass this on this allele is relatively

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.839 
pass this on this allele is relatively
common<00:02:57.859> because<00:02:58.859> the<00:02:59.040> heterozygous

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
common because the heterozygous

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.470 
common because the heterozygous
individuals<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:01.469> resistance<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.519> malaria

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
individuals have resistance to a malaria

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.530 
individuals have resistance to a malaria
so<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:04.500> call<00:03:04.799> this<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.790> heterozygous

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
so we call this the heterozygous

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.750 
so we call this the heterozygous
advantage<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.859> is<00:03:08.069> why<00:03:08.189> this<00:03:08.400> allele

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
advantage and this is why this allele

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.240 
advantage and this is why this allele
has<00:03:09.060> been<00:03:09.269> propagated<00:03:10.109> through<00:03:10.590> family<00:03:10.949> trees

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
has been propagated through family trees

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.939 
has been propagated through family trees
because<00:03:11.879> heterozygous<00:03:12.480> individuals<00:03:13.230> can

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:13.949 
because heterozygous individuals can

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.470 
because heterozygous individuals can
handle<00:03:14.250> malaria<00:03:14.730> all<00:03:15.030> right<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.239> let's<00:03:15.359> look

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
handle malaria all right so let's look

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.809 
handle malaria all right so let's look
at<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.719> next<00:03:15.930> slide<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.560> we'll<00:03:17.400> show<00:03:17.639> you<00:03:17.669> a

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
at the next slide and we'll show you a

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.369 
at the next slide and we'll show you a
little<00:03:17.879> bit<00:03:18.150> better<00:03:18.269> pictures<00:03:18.689> and<00:03:18.900> we'll

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
little bit better pictures and we'll

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.080 
little bit better pictures and we'll
show<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.680> demographics<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.609> then<00:03:20.909> we'll

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
show you a demographics and then we'll

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.229 
show you a demographics and then we'll
also<00:03:21.269> show<00:03:21.659> you<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:22.109> punnett<00:03:22.680> square<00:03:22.949> okay<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:24.180> I

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
also show you a punnett square okay so I

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.069 
also show you a punnett square okay so I
want<00:03:24.389> you<00:03:24.479> to<00:03:24.509> look<00:03:24.599> over<00:03:24.720> here<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:24.989> this

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
want you to look over here in this

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.979 
want you to look over here in this
picture<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.280> normal<00:03:27.209> red<00:03:27.449> blood<00:03:27.479> cells

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
picture this is normal red blood cells

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.270 
picture this is normal red blood cells
red<00:03:28.109> blood<00:03:28.409> cells<00:03:28.650> kind<00:03:28.919> of<00:03:28.979> look<00:03:29.099> like<00:03:29.129> a

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
red blood cells kind of look like a

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280 
red blood cells kind of look like a
bagel<00:03:29.759> but<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.150> whole<00:03:30.419> hasn't<00:03:30.900> been<00:03:30.989> pushed

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
bagel but the whole hasn't been pushed

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.319 
bagel but the whole hasn't been pushed
all<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.500> way<00:03:31.620> through<00:03:31.949> okay<00:03:32.459> now<00:03:33.150> they're

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
all the way through okay now they're

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.240 
all the way through okay now they're
very<00:03:33.629> flexible<00:03:34.199> see<00:03:34.379> how<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.739> fit<00:03:35.040> through

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
very flexible see how it can fit through

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.580 
very flexible see how it can fit through
this<00:03:35.340> capillary<00:03:35.689> okay<00:03:36.720> now<00:03:37.439> in<00:03:37.939> abnormal<00:03:38.939> or

sickle cells in other words these are

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.270 
sickle cells in other words these are
red<00:03:42.720> blood<00:03:42.930> cells<00:03:43.229> who<00:03:43.470> have<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.859> sickle<00:03:44.250> cell

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
red blood cells who have the sickle cell

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.509 
red blood cells who have the sickle cell

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.319 
they can't fit through these Klapper
layers<00:03:55.859> so<00:03:56.009> it<00:03:56.099> see<00:03:56.280> how<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.489> forms<00:03:56.909> like<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> log

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
layers so it see how it forms like a log

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.749 
layers so it see how it forms like a log
jam<00:03:57.680> that's<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.889> problem<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.459> these

00:03:59.749 --> 00:03:59.759 
jam that's a problem for these

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.509 
jam that's a problem for these
individuals<00:04:00.359> now<00:04:00.599> over<00:04:00.840> here<00:04:00.959> on<00:04:01.079> this<00:04:01.169> map

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
individuals now over here on this map

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.550 
individuals now over here on this map
these<00:04:02.519> are<00:04:02.729> basically<00:04:03.120> rainforest<00:04:04.049> areas<00:04:04.439> so

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
these are basically rainforest areas so

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.199 
these are basically rainforest areas so
this<00:04:04.709> would<00:04:04.829> be<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.009> Congo<00:04:05.430> forest<00:04:05.759> this

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
this would be the Congo forest this

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.909 
this would be the Congo forest this
would<00:04:06.389> be<00:04:06.479> part<00:04:06.719> of<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.840> Ivory<00:04:07.199> Coast<00:04:07.290> and

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
would be part of the Ivory Coast and

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.830 
would be part of the Ivory Coast and
then<00:04:08.400> over<00:04:08.669> here<00:04:08.699> in<00:04:08.969> India<00:04:09.239> this<00:04:09.569> would<00:04:09.719> be

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
then over here in India this would be

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.589 
then over here in India this would be
like<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.169> Ganges<00:04:10.620> River<00:04:10.650> Valley<00:04:11.099> okay<00:04:11.699> these

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
like the Ganges River Valley okay these

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.390 
like the Ganges River Valley okay these
are<00:04:12.750> areas<00:04:13.169> where<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.889> have<00:04:13.919> a<00:04:14.069> lot<00:04:14.370> of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
are areas where you have a lot of

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.209 
are areas where you have a lot of
mosquitoes<00:04:14.969> a<00:04:15.000> lot<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.479> swamps<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.219> mosquitos

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:17.219 
mosquitoes a lot of swamps and mosquitos

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:20.270 
mosquitoes a lot of swamps and mosquitos

don't repay no soma okay now because of

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.340 
don't repay no soma okay now because of

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
this high malaria areas people who are

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.230 
this high malaria areas people who are
heterozygous<00:04:29.010> they<00:04:29.610> have<00:04:29.790> an<00:04:29.940> advantage

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
heterozygous they have an advantage

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.450 
heterozygous they have an advantage
because<00:04:30.600> half<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.710> their<00:04:31.830> red<00:04:31.980> blood<00:04:32.220> cells

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
because half of their red blood cells

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.120 
because half of their red blood cells
will<00:04:32.640> be<00:04:32.790> normal<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.770> what's<00:04:34.770> good<00:04:35.100> about

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
will be normal and what's good about

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.000 
will be normal and what's good about
sickle<00:04:36.000> cell<00:04:36.210> is<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.660> these<00:04:36.990> cells<00:04:37.380> cannot

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
sickle cell is that these cells cannot

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.100 
sickle cell is that these cells cannot
be<00:04:38.160> affected<00:04:38.670> by<00:04:38.820> malaria<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.630> malaria

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
be affected by malaria the malaria

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.320 
be affected by malaria the malaria
protozoa<00:04:40.650> will<00:04:40.830> not<00:04:40.980> infect<00:04:41.370> these<00:04:41.520> cells<00:04:41.820> but

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
protozoa will not infect these cells but

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.480 
protozoa will not infect these cells but
if<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.200> all<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.650> your<00:04:43.770> cells<00:04:43.980> have<00:04:44.160> sickle

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
if you all of your cells have sickle

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.250 
if you all of your cells have sickle
cell<00:04:44.580> disease<00:04:44.760> you've<00:04:45.450> got<00:04:45.480> something<00:04:46.080> worse

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
cell disease you've got something worse

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.770 
cell disease you've got something worse
than<00:04:46.290> malaria<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:47.070> deal<00:04:47.220> with<00:04:47.460> okay<00:04:47.670> so<00:04:48.510> if

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
than malaria to deal with okay so if

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.800 
than malaria to deal with okay so if
half<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.470> your<00:04:49.710> cells<00:04:49.980> are<00:04:50.250> sick<00:04:51.210> 'old<00:04:51.420> you

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
half of your cells are sick 'old you

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.630 
half of your cells are sick 'old you
don't<00:04:51.990> get<00:04:52.080> malaria<00:04:52.440> but<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.100> other<00:04:53.220> half<00:04:53.430> are

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
don't get malaria but the other half are

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.660 
don't get malaria but the other half are
good<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.600> can<00:04:54.750> still<00:04:55.020> survive<00:04:55.500> pretty<00:04:56.430> well

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
good you can still survive pretty well

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.760 
good you can still survive pretty well
all<00:04:56.940> right<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.240> let's<00:04:57.420> look<00:04:57.480> at<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.770> punnett

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
all right so let's look at a punnett

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.030 
all right so let's look at a punnett
square<00:04:58.980> here<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.930> we're<00:05:00.930> going<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.140> cross<00:05:01.440> two

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
square here and we're going to cross two

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.690 
square here and we're going to cross two
individuals<00:05:03.000> who<00:05:03.690> are<00:05:03.720> heterozygous<00:05:04.550> so<00:05:05.550> they

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
individuals who are heterozygous so they

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.320 
individuals who are heterozygous so they
are<00:05:05.850> partially<00:05:07.070> resistant<00:05:08.070> to<00:05:08.250> malaria<00:05:08.400> okay

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
are partially resistant to malaria okay

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.740 
are partially resistant to malaria okay
and<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:10.230> once<00:05:10.500> again<00:05:10.620> I'm<00:05:11.010> going<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.190> use<00:05:11.250> an<00:05:11.880> a

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
and so once again I'm going to use an a

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.860 
and so once again I'm going to use an a
is<00:05:13.110> dominant<00:05:14.040> so<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:15.030> would<00:05:15.210> we<00:05:15.390> will<00:05:15.720> say

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
is dominant so that would we will say

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.020 
is dominant so that would we will say
that's<00:05:16.020> non<00:05:16.380> sickle<00:05:16.890> cell<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.400> then<00:05:17.910> we're

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
that's non sickle cell and then we're

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.500 
that's non sickle cell and then we're
going<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.180> use<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.360> little<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:19.040> which<00:05:20.040> would<00:05:20.250> be

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
going to use a little a which would be

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.590 
going to use a little a which would be
with<00:05:21.510> sickle<00:05:22.050> cell<00:05:22.320> trait<00:05:22.350> okay<00:05:23.340> all<00:05:24.240> right<00:05:24.390> so

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
with sickle cell trait okay all right so

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.420 
with sickle cell trait okay all right so
we<00:05:24.870> got<00:05:25.020> one<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.230> heterozygous<00:05:25.650> individual

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
we got one a heterozygous individual

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.640 
we got one a heterozygous individual
here<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.060> these<00:05:27.690> are<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:27.960> gametes<00:05:28.350> from<00:05:28.470> the

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
here and these are the gametes from the

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.190 
here and these are the gametes from the
other<00:05:28.830> heterozygous<00:05:29.520> individual<00:05:30.180> so<00:05:31.020> now

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
other heterozygous individual so now

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.680 
other heterozygous individual so now
let's<00:05:31.410> use<00:05:31.890> a<00:05:32.010> new<00:05:32.190> color<00:05:32.400> because<00:05:32.970> we<00:05:33.000> can<00:05:35.690> so

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
let's use a new color because we can so

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.820 
let's use a new color because we can so
you<00:05:36.750> fill<00:05:36.990> in<00:05:37.080> your<00:05:37.110> punnett<00:05:37.410> square<00:05:37.650> like

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
you fill in your punnett square like

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.340 
you fill in your punnett square like
you've<00:05:38.010> probably<00:05:38.250> done<00:05:38.490> a<00:05:38.550> million<00:05:38.850> times

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
you've probably done a million times

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.650 
you've probably done a million times
okay<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:40.830> we'll<00:05:41.670> see<00:05:41.820> what<00:05:41.970> we<00:05:42.060> got<00:05:42.240> here<00:05:42.270> all

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
okay and we'll see what we got here all

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.190 
okay and we'll see what we got here all
right<00:05:42.720> so<00:05:43.020> this<00:05:43.200> individual<00:05:43.860> right<00:05:44.070> there

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
right so this individual right there

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.140 
right so this individual right there
this<00:05:46.200> person<00:05:46.770> has<00:05:47.990> perfectly<00:05:48.990> good

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
this person has perfectly good

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.370 
this person has perfectly good
hemoglobin<00:05:51.150> all<00:05:51.690> right<00:05:51.840> but<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:53.400> problem<00:05:53.580> is

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
hemoglobin all right but the problem is

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.100 
hemoglobin all right but the problem is
they<00:05:55.380> can<00:05:55.950> get<00:05:57.620> malaria<00:05:58.620> all<00:05:59.610> right<00:05:59.960> so<00:06:00.960> they

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
they can get malaria all right so they

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.290 
they can get malaria all right so they
got<00:06:01.320> a<00:06:01.350> problem<00:06:01.680> they<00:06:02.610> had<00:06:02.760> a<00:06:02.790> row<00:06:02.940> zygous

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
got a problem they had a row zygous

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.910 
got a problem they had a row zygous
individuals<00:06:04.070> and<00:06:05.070> they<00:06:05.900> they<00:06:06.900> sorta<00:06:07.740> have

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
individuals and they they sorta have

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.460 
individuals and they they sorta have
cicles<00:06:08.340> disease<00:06:08.850> but<00:06:09.090> not<00:06:09.150> too<00:06:09.540> much<00:06:09.690> right<00:06:10.050> so

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
cicles disease but not too much right so

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.450 
cicles disease but not too much right so
pretty<00:06:11.160> much<00:06:11.430> they<00:06:11.640> have<00:06:11.850> no<00:06:13.190> sickle<00:06:14.190> cell

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
pretty much they have no sickle cell

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.630 
pretty much they have no sickle cell
disease<00:06:14.630> SCD<00:06:15.630> for<00:06:15.840> short<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.640> they're

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
disease SCD for short and they're

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.750 
disease SCD for short and they're
partially<00:06:18.030> resistant<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.230> malaria<00:06:19.520> all<00:06:20.520> right

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
partially resistant to malaria all right

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.880 
partially resistant to malaria all right
and<00:06:21.050> then<00:06:22.050> these<00:06:22.260> individuals<00:06:24.320> they<00:06:25.320> can<00:06:25.620> get

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
and then these individuals they can get

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:33.230 
and then these individuals they can get
no<00:06:26.130> malaria<00:06:26.550> again<00:06:27.830> but<00:06:29.810> they<00:06:30.810> have<00:06:32.240> sickle

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
no malaria again but they have sickle

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.620 
no malaria again but they have sickle
cell<00:06:33.810> disease

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
cell disease

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.960 
cell disease
so<00:06:35.140> all<00:06:35.410> of<00:06:35.470> their<00:06:35.950> blood<00:06:36.190> cells<00:06:36.460> would<00:06:36.820> be

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
so all of their blood cells would be

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.540 
so all of their blood cells would be
like<00:06:37.150> this<00:06:37.420> okay<00:06:37.960> so<00:06:38.620> it's<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:38.920> heterozygous

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
like this okay so it's the heterozygous

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.910 
like this okay so it's the heterozygous
individuals<00:06:40.240> who<00:06:40.360> have<00:06:40.570> an<00:06:40.690> advantage<00:06:40.990> they

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
individuals who have an advantage they

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.920 
individuals who have an advantage they
don't<00:06:42.190> truly<00:06:42.640> have<00:06:42.820> sickle<00:06:43.090> cell<00:06:43.210> disease<00:06:43.360> and

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
don't truly have sickle cell disease and

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.070 
don't truly have sickle cell disease and
they're<00:06:44.290> partially<00:06:44.590> resistant<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.490> malaria

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
they're partially resistant to malaria

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.960 
they're partially resistant to malaria
no<00:06:47.080> sickle<00:06:47.440> cell<00:06:47.620> disease<00:06:47.650> but<00:06:48.460> they<00:06:48.640> can<00:06:48.820> get

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
no sickle cell disease but they can get

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.870 
no sickle cell disease but they can get
malaria<00:06:49.710> no<00:06:50.710> malaria<00:06:51.040> whatsoever<00:06:51.520> from<00:06:51.670> these

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
malaria no malaria whatsoever from these

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.880 
malaria no malaria whatsoever from these
individuals<00:06:52.480> but<00:06:52.960> they<00:06:53.110> also<00:06:53.260> have<00:06:53.560> sickle

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
individuals but they also have sickle

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.070 
individuals but they also have sickle
cell<00:06:54.040> disease<00:06:54.220> okay<00:06:54.940> so<00:06:55.030> hopefully<00:06:55.870> this

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
cell disease okay so hopefully this

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.630 
cell disease okay so hopefully this
helps<00:06:56.170> you<00:06:56.290> understand<00:06:56.680> that<00:06:56.860> what<00:06:57.100> sickle

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
helps you understand that what sickle

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.980 
helps you understand that what sickle
cell<00:06:57.790> disease<00:06:57.820> is<00:06:58.300> like<00:06:58.510> until<00:06:59.470> next<00:06:59.680> time
