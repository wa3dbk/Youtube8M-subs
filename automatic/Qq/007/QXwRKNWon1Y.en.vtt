wants to go on to now the answer is
actually<00:01:14.100> very<00:01:14.760> simple<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.600> go<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
actually very simple if we go into the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.490 
actually very simple if we go into the
system<00:01:16.890> preferences<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.810> go<00:01:18.810> into<00:01:18.930> displays
