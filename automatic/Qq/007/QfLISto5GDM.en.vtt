00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hi are you watching one more? 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.069
 video lab of the electronics laboratory 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.740
 if you want to learn more about 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.619
 electronic world access our portal 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.350
 at www.aeseletropaulo.com.br there 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.890
 you will find many videos articles 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.570
 news tutorials crises and everything else 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.710
 related to the fascinating world of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.410
 electronics 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.269
 Today I'll show you how 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.660
 control the speed of a v6 engine 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.250
 with arduino any theory related to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.590
 this project as well as the life of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.629
 schematic materials and procedures 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.480
 advantages are available at 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.309
 who is appearing there on your screen to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.960
 mount this project you need the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.960
 following materials an arduino 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:03.700
 a 9-volt battery a motor to be 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:24.890
 a potentiometer of 10 k 1 sei 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:27.470
 l 293 b filed today and a set of 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.289
 wires to make the connections 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.670
 circuit 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.220
 the first step you should take 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.950
 is to set up this circuit in the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.440
 prontocord on our site you have access 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.910
 to this circuit in high resolution and with 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.910
 all the details for your assembly 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.780
 the next step is to create the program that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.540
 a dozen not to control the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.090
 circuit on our site you will find 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.810
 obsession of the same code in a skit 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810
 for the arduino 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.690
 after the circuit is mounted on 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.130
 recorded in the anthem you will have a 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.130
 result similar to this 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.940
 so this is it I hope you have 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.090
 liked and if you want to access other 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:28.970
 videos tutorials among our 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.970
 website www.labmec.com.br until later
