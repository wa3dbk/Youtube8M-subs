lot and whereas Facebook it's kind of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
doesn't pertain to them necessarily but

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.360 
doesn't pertain to them necessarily but
they<00:02:35.760> might<00:02:36.120> share<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.750> personal<00:02:37.349> update<00:02:37.950> if

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
they might share a personal update if

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.780
