for<00:00:18.780> animated<00:00:19.290> objects<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:20.310> need<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> set<00:00:20.790> the

for animated objects we need to set the
pivot<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.450> in<00:00:21.570> 3ds<00:00:21.900> max<00:00:22.280> we<00:00:23.280> can<00:00:23.460> move<00:00:23.640> a

object together to another object in
unity<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.890> need<00:00:29.040> to<00:00:29.130> set<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> pivots<00:00:29.790> for

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100 
it goes necessarily I'll set the pivot
for<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.400> door<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:38.940> swings<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.600> well<00:00:39.960> what

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110

only on the x and y in this view i'll

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.380 
only on the x and y in this view i'll
start<00:01:34.800> out<00:01:34.979> by<00:01:35.399> grabbing<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> pivot<00:01:36.209> on<00:01:36.300> the

start out by grabbing the pivot on the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.770 
start out by grabbing the pivot on the
XY<00:01:36.810> plane<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.670> snapping<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.789> right<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.660> the

XY plane and snapping it right on the
corner<00:01:40.080> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> door<00:01:40.490> then<00:01:41.490> I'll<00:01:41.640> pull<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.910> up

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
corner of the door then I'll pull it up

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.180 
corner of the door then I'll pull it up
just<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.569> little<00:01:42.600> bit<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.500> case<00:01:43.770> pressing

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
just a little bit in this case pressing

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.669 
just a little bit in this case pressing
s<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.670> turn<00:01:44.880> off<00:01:45.060> snap<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.720> move<00:01:46.319> it<00:01:46.470> forward

s to turn off snap and move it forward

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.309 
s to turn off snap and move it forward
on<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.069> Y<00:01:47.330> we<00:01:48.330> can<00:01:48.479> move<00:01:48.599> it<00:01:48.780> where<00:01:48.929> we'd<00:01:49.080> like

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
on the Y we can move it where we'd like

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.990 
on the Y we can move it where we'd like
and<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.770> may<00:01:49.890> even<00:01:50.130> want<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> move<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.759> door

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and we may even want to move the door

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.359 
and we may even want to move the door
here<00:01:51.300> as<00:01:51.420> well<00:01:51.660> I'll<00:01:52.289> pull<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.920> pivot<00:01:53.220> just

going to set it separately I've already
set<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> door<00:02:24.450> pivot<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.950> still<00:02:26.220> there

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
set the door pivot and it's still there

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.850 
set the door pivot and it's still there
where<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> had<00:02:26.790> put<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> look<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:28.770> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
where I had put it now a look at the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.160 
where I had put it now a look at the
handle<00:02:29.250> for<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> handle<00:02:30.360> I'll<00:02:30.480> select<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
handle for the handle I'll select it

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.090 
handle for the handle I'll select it
choose<00:02:31.800> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
choose a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.690 
choose a
pivot<00:02:32.520> only<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.050> center<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.200> object<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:35.490> way

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
pivot only and center to object this way

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.000 
pivot only and center to object this way
it<00:02:35.880> rotates<00:02:36.060> around<00:02:36.450> its<00:02:36.810> exact<00:02:37.170> center<00:02:37.650> so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
it rotates around its exact center so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.950 
it rotates around its exact center so
when<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> spins<00:02:38.580> we'll<00:02:38.880> see<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.300> egg-shaped

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
when it spins we'll see that egg-shaped

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.560 
when it spins we'll see that egg-shaped
turning<00:02:40.350> I'll<00:02:40.950> turn<00:02:41.550> off<00:02:41.730> affect<00:02:42.150> pivot<00:02:42.300> only

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
turning I'll turn off affect pivot only

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.600 
turning I'll turn off affect pivot only
and<00:02:42.900> then<00:02:43.350> look<00:02:43.800> at<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.070> pivot<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and then look at the pivot of the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.910 
and then look at the pivot of the
doorframe<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.870> down<00:02:46.170> at<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> base<00:02:46.620> and

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
doorframe it's down at the base and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.410 
doorframe it's down at the base and
actually<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.490> back<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.000> door<00:02:48.180> because

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
actually at the back of the door because

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.750 
actually at the back of the door because
I<00:02:48.540> had<00:02:48.750> created<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.350> as<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> line<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.640> really

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
I had created this as a line it's really

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.060 
I had created this as a line it's really
fine<00:02:51.270> where<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.810> although<00:02:52.080> if<00:02:52.710> we<00:02:52.830> needed

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
fine where it is although if we needed

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.950 
fine where it is although if we needed
to<00:02:53.190> rotate<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:53.730> object<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.360> could<00:02:54.570> put<00:02:54.810> this

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
to rotate this object we could put this

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.530 
to rotate this object we could put this
in<00:02:55.170> somewhere<00:02:55.560> maybe<00:02:55.920> more<00:02:56.190> convenient<00:02:56.790> it's

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
in somewhere maybe more convenient it's

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.600 
in somewhere maybe more convenient it's
really<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.020> us<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.500> what<00:02:58.980> we<00:02:59.100> need<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> do

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
really up to us on what we need to do

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.700 
really up to us on what we need to do
with<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> door<00:03:01.050> frame<00:03:01.350> being<00:03:01.620> a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
with this and so the door frame being a

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.470 
with this and so the door frame being a
static<00:03:02.130> object<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.850> have<00:03:02.880> its<00:03:03.150> pivot

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
static object can have its pivot

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.690 
static object can have its pivot
wherever<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:03.960> like<00:03:04.200> what<00:03:04.980> I'll<00:03:05.070> do<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.370> put<00:03:05.610> it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
wherever we like what I'll do is put it

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.060 
wherever we like what I'll do is put it
over<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> corner<00:03:06.480> I'll<00:03:07.230> click<00:03:07.530> affect<00:03:07.920> pivot

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
over on a corner I'll click affect pivot

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.180 
over on a corner I'll click affect pivot
only<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.730> snap<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.570> pivot<00:03:10.020> right<00:03:10.800> onto<00:03:11.070> the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
orthographic view we can see the pivot

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.130 
orthographic view we can see the pivot
is<00:03:25.260> actually<00:03:25.740> mid<00:03:26.400> way<00:03:26.580> up<00:03:26.790> I'll<00:03:27.060> switch<00:03:27.960> over

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
is actually mid way up I'll switch over

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.370 
is actually mid way up I'll switch over
to<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.470> 3d<00:03:29.040> snap<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.670> click<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.780> drag<00:03:30.840> down<00:03:31.230> on

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
to a 3d snap and click and drag down on

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.730 
to a 3d snap and click and drag down on
the<00:03:31.470> y-axis<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:32.430> snap<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.420> pivot<00:03:33.840> right<00:03:34.470> down

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
the y-axis to snap this pivot right down

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.990 
the y-axis to snap this pivot right down
to<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> base<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.430> door<00:03:35.580> frame

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
to the base of the door frame

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.030 
to the base of the door frame
I'll<00:03:36.510> check<00:03:36.840> where<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.080> doors<00:03:37.380> pivot<00:03:37.770> is<00:03:37.860> as

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
I'll check where the doors pivot is as

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.460 
I'll check where the doors pivot is as
well<00:03:38.250> right<00:03:39.150> now<00:03:39.330> it's<00:03:39.600> down<00:03:39.750> at<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:39.960> base<00:03:40.200> and

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
well right now it's down at the base and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.930 
well right now it's down at the base and
that's<00:03:40.740> fine<00:03:40.980> because<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.460> only<00:03:41.610> going<00:03:41.850> to

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
that's fine because it's only going to

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.620 
that's fine because it's only going to
rotate<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.660> z-axis<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.700> doorknobs<00:03:45.180> pivot

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
rotate on the z-axis the doorknobs pivot

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.260
