00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.440
 attention this budget is simply 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.930
 My opinion there are 100 different and another 100 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.730
 variables comment with respect always 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.950
 is well received and throw a cable with 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.650
 that little hand up if you liked the video 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.859
 it's always a great reward and now 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:22.589
 so I hope late the video beats or the 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.589
 faces and if I the roquillos I'm here 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.499
 because if he 's fucked here with some strips 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:33.760
 you go out then good that that wanted them 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:36.250
 comment on things in Welsh that there is no 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.290
 moves the 700 video of the moment because 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.580
 I was re distraction to 700 and 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.710
 what we are going to start is that the pieces 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.820
 that I like the most, I have to work 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.100
 costs but like this time 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.800
 you're going to see about 800 that I like a lot 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.350
 I prefer to go up is 800 and for purposes 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.100
 you already know how I just taught 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.900
 the sign is worth if you have another opinion 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.210
 nothing happens is totally respectable 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.910
 but do it respectfully bastards 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.060
 but it is very easy 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.630
 and why not because I do not know why 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.460
 I do not know because I do not speak like that but 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.500
 good 700 but what I bring 800 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.290
 because I really liked how he has 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.600
 come out well then good I hope that you 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.640
 like you enjoy the video none and 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.130
 especially the comments if you want 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.869
 please if you have any ideas so that 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.940
 make a series is something that you are interested 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.060
 so in the serial roll I do not take it 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.280
 as for example explaining each piece or 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.130
 things like that but then in the comments 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.259
 good and good and one thing and one more thing 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.300
 the park do not forget me derive from the 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.460
 refrigerations I forgot to put the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.680
 page that I will forget completely 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.289
 and it is a very important situation that of 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.539
 passive cooling is typical that 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.580
 tehran among the graphic cards that 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.070
 good cuts to many young people who 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.150
 others have in people my age was like 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.190
 a dissipator stated above him 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.750
 from the graph that what he was doing was 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.820
 dissipate heat and already those 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.009
 refrigeration for themselves were worth a 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.170
 heat sink but no ventilation 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.950
 or anything to reduce noise what 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.780
 happens that of course we have left if you want to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.150
 a champions not but well this 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.590
 I'm sorry that many times for good 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.570
 is always be attentive to doing things 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.280
 talking to a hundred people we try 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.890
 many different things many things if 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.790
 not so you forget things and on youtube 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.500
 or challenges of something the torch takes out the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.630
 orca that we are going to put in the square 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.400
 May so well that no part of me 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.580
 it was too much to enjoy the video and even 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.580
 soon 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.070
 hello girls, I'm cufflinks, loquillo 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.640
 I extract the budget of 800 euros 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.030
 ok in this case let's put an intel 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.100
 11 55 since the 1150's there's no great 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.020
 difference between one and another and good 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.060
 let's start with the motherboard some 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.250
 rock 177 extreme 4 m which is a plate 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.500
 fairly good enough decent base 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.320
 for what we are looking for a future 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.970
 do is the joc crossfire acceptance of 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:13.930
 four ram ddr3 memory cards a 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.300
 2800 bone is worth and good is a plate 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.520
 that for those of us who are going to use it 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.570
 It serves perfectly as processors 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.610
 chosen in intel core i5 3,570 k to 3 o 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.620
 4 gigahertz many will think that 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.380
 what's not better and 7 good this is a pc 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.460
 gaming the 5 go very well for the theme 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.230
 of what the game is to play 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.420
 and the truth is that this processor 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.970
 it will yield quite well is in generation 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.650
 and we will not have any kind of problem 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.630
 the time for us to be cut off from 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.090
 some kind of job 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.900
 of hard disk put followed for the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.570
 cure of 500 gb sata 3 and you will say many 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.420
 but these 800 we do not have to have more 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:59.340
 memory 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.849
 here is a piston in the v 300 120 gb 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.400
 that we will dedicate here until the 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.930
 operating system and some programs 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.670
 that we use editing or whatever and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.440
 we will see some game also I by 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.880
 example I have installs to the bat fill 4 and 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.239
 that is to say that the difference is quite 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.850
 remarkable respect to the times 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.100
 load 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.200
 it is the truth that it is brutal necessity that 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.810
 I will not try it now, it will be given 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.780
 account that is almost necessary in 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.430
 that being but that to put budgets 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.630
 so more or less normalitos is very 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.390
 difficult to fit 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.560
 of graphics we have chosen a sacyr r 9 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.630
 270 of attitude dual x of 2 gb gddr5 vale 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.250
 is the graphics card that good for 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.320
 what is the theme of playing games 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.670
 current ones should give us any 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.860
 kind of problems if they have future 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.120
 better fits us shorter but without a 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.410
 future is shorter because the 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.960
 pressure is too high for this card 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.990
 graphic we can buy another one equal and 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.910
 create a side color to use the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.860
 two graphics cards and we will have 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.230
 short but tackles moment wins card 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.000
 graphic I have friends who are using the 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.449
 same when aouate the Chilean is 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.930
 without any problem 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.860
 we must narrate a shearing ares ddr3 of 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.020
 1600 good because two modules of 4 gigas 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.639
 each one to take advantage basically 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.069
 as always the dual 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.289
 it is a memory with some with one 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.740
 more or less average latency is worth it 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:28.470
 the set of 9 is the one that almost all and one 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.160
 good frequency and we need 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.800
 of reader as that the cheapest and most 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.440
 in a wild context 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.650
 of we marry regional salman z 11 plus 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.840
 blue is a tower speak x vale we 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.780
 I should easily enter you see the 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.540
 motherboard 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.699
 good design is a bit 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.810
 I like it a lot because it's a little someone 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:00.710
 an alien like cd spoke like that of Gordillo 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.710
 but come on, it's very good 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.100
 he is missing a corset of bs 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.860
 650 is a fountain per bolus 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.600
 how good is a great brand with good 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.280
 product quality and you'll see how 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.040
 it gives us a lot of problems he always talked 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.920
 of the typical specific problem but not 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.570
 It should be like this and registration 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:25.000
 for processing in a college master 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:27.400
 hyper 212 evo is worth enough for 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.150
 intel that are not very hot besides 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.110
 to cool our little 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.580
 processor so that it does not go beyond 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.780
 temperature and the process is worth what 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.050
 we have chosen if you want come 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.880
 unlocked to be able to overlock and 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.160
 so then, good with this is not that 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.930
 we can do it either but we do 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.940
 is going to have the sya removed 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.280
 better then go looking at tutorials what 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.960
 that maybe it gives us to 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.370
 go up a little bit 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.810
 and well you 're guys this is the 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.650
 the budget of 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.350
 of 800 euros here you see the price 798 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.200
 really this is going to be 700 but 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.440
 how I liked it so much has said good 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.940
 800 for the people who criticize it so 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.710
 good guys you know if you like the 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.240
 video dar light favorites and see you soon 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.240
 238 shot
