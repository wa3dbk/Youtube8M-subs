00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.929
 i 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.230
 how are you and friends once again more 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.510
 artistic in this episode we're going to 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.460
 continue because you asked for it with the 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.160
 Basic level pencil drawing tutorial 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.020
 in this episode we are going to try to do 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.250
 a slightly more complex figure I chose 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.510
 this figure because it has all the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.900
 concepts that we saw in the previous 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.940
 episodes that are geometric figures 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.130
 irregular as a circle 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.770
 complex as organic things are 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.170
 we need to portray things 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.050
 live or portraits people animals 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.989
 etc. organic things too 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.660
 concepts of light shadow transparency and 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.220
 reflection they know that I chose good 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.040
 probably if they clicked on this 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.780
 video you already know that an eye is an eye 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.520
 human to which I am tracing I am 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.559
 copying the screen right now 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.780
 it's a photograph of my own eye by 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.290
 certain I chose this photograph because it is 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.269
 a pretty good photo with macro 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.070
 then we can see in great detail 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.930
 all things all the little ones 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.280
 imperfections of the eye here I am 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.540
 putting what is the shadow the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.220
 darkness of the lens that is the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.140
 little ball that is inside the iris 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.659
 which is the part also circular that 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.800
 It has the color of the eye if they are fixed 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.780
 I'm drawing the lens 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.550
 completely dark because in front of the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.190
 crystalline is a thing called the 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.830
 cornea is something that covers the iris and the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.020
 crystal clear and it's a bit reflective 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.640
 too much because the eye is designed ex 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.200
 professed so that it does not reflect more towards 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.150
 light and it makes it much more efficient than 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.480
 any expensive camera lens that 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.890
 we can 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.710
 we manufacture 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.390
 so there is the reflection above and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.030
 well this is a diagram quickly 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.130
 what do I do to explain why it hits 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.140
 the light inside the eye there we see the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.909
 crystalline which is the dark part the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.159
 iris as some parts are shaded 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.229
 others more clear and as the reflector the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.850
 reflections have a minimum factor of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.410
 reflection but still we will be 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.869
 seeing the brightest parts 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.490
 reflected the brightest parts of 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.090
 the scene that is in front of the eye 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.950
 let's see reflected in the in the in the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.280
 cornea that is the most reflective part of 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.110
 Of the eye 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.120
 right now what we see is the scene 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.580
 we can see that in the lens that is 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.220
 the dark part looks much better 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.080
 things that are reflected and not so much in 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.390
 the colored part we can see in the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.860
 left part of the iris that looks a 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.630
 rectangular thing that is neither more nor less 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.850
 that a window that was in the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.090
 room where I took this photograph 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.300
 to my own eye then when giving these 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.530
 these little strokes of reflection you 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.980
 we give a lot of realism 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.180
 right now I'm tracing and shading 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.180
 what is the lower eyelid 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.640
 together with the lacrimal this is a 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.370
 exercise by the way in general 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.830
 observation and I do not know if they had already 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.370
 said but draw something realistic is a 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.770
 work that 50% skill to say the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.030
 Stroke of the stroke with the pencil and 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:11.060
 mastery with which to trace lines and 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.030
 another 50% is basically the observation 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.930
 the ability that one has to be able to 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.450
 scrutinize the ways to return them to their 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.340
 most basic expression by saying the stroke 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.650
 of the eyelid that is the most trustworthy 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.360
 possible because you are abstracting it to 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.980
 a single line and then you're doing it 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.959
 more complex you are adding shadows 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.000
 then lashes together just like what 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.709
 I'm doing right now at 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.720
 eyelashes by the way go on the edge 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.170
 quite far from the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.930
 the eyelid and he what is the globe 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.510
 eye the white part of the eye and come 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.120
 in clusters and this you can see it 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.610
 if they look at a mirror if it happens in the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.170
 enough time scrutinizing their own 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.790
 eyes in a mirror can realize 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.380
 of all these all these things 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.720
 curious that you do not realize until 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.700
 you really watch the lashes 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.840
 Clusters are not all pointing in 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.330
 the same address some are 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.670
 disheveled some are Swedish and 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.340
 adding this in a drawing is what gives 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.990
 that plus that makes it look a lot more 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.810
 real that if we were drawing a 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.209
 perfect eye 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.830
 here we can see those my eyebrows 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.049
 disheveled 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.150
 and precisely this to give you patterns 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.190
 irregular is what gives realism 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.780
 there for example to the middle of the eyebrow 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.400
 we can see a white part that is a 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.440
 scar that I have from a madrazo that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.320
 I put on my eyebrows many years ago 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.360
 then this type of imperfections will 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.110
 They give a lot of quality to the drawing and 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.940
 a lot of realism level so 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.710
 there we can see both the reflections 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.260
 gray is practically the room 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.820
 reflected on me in my cornea although not 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.440
 we want the reflection to be very strong 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.660
 because our eyes are going to be 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.820
 unreal as I repeat the eyes not 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.000
 reflect so many lights is only one 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.070
 minimum just enough to see the real 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.720
 there we can also see the pores of 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.970
 my forehead that are quite bigger 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.600
 than the rest of the mixed skin face 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.460
 and good I say goodbye I leave you with this 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.530
 image I hope you subscribe if you 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.900
 liked this video also share it here 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.050
 see you every week, take care 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.050
 bye
