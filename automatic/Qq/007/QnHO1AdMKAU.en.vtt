00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hello everyone, as always

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.210
 yes yes yes in his story and of course all 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.429
 I myself thought them up though none of you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.589
 probably already guessed to such or else 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.659
 anyone can this is shown anyway 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.560
 all 10 I came up with myself here on the spot 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:31.169
 so do not say that their child is not 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.690
 Yashin case that you can find it somewhere 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.629
 find one of them one looks like it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.090
 to the understandable principle of commons one 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.370
 reasonable on the planet yes and and and us and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.190
 someone else could have thought of such a thing 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.429
 so in general, we look and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.859
 enjoy and throw garbage out howls 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:58.370

 So 1 cool trash can which 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.759

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.930
 not cool like this trash can but he 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.880
 cute therefore don't you dare 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.610
 talk about him look in the trash can and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.439

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.229
 everything work everything works beautiful 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.799
 you yourself have to go there about no 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.890

 a chest that throws everything away intentionally 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.280
 I advise you to use exactly chests 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.049
 because you know these resources because they 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.060
 sometime you may need you such 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.100
 go down it will save you all there gold 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.210
 diamond lies here because any 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.859
 minecraft resource us sooner or later 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.079
 will need earth to heal 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.479
 territory or align there i don't know 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.580
 anything else you exactly you get shorter 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.790
 his use will find his 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.579
 application 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.829
 look further further steeper with us 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.530
 such a desktop is shorter before tanning we 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.810
 love to sit after maykravt so cool 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.340
 sit and do nothing but yes that 's it 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.379
 so sitting doing nothing not doing 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.530
 doin bang with staked rubbish to throw away 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.970
 yes you are sitting in front of you and from 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.099
 table and you do not want him to go 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.439
 because this is your favorite table and you 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.230
 such a bang in the picture threw and there is no paper 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.120

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.829
 take a whiff trying to get in 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.719
 this guy by and in short anyway 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.909
 nothing turns out you think is worth it for 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.220
 magicians are shorter than magic 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.349

 a chest like this can be done so we we 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.680
 let's not drop in water the main thing is 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.109
