field<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.699> size<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.149> that's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
field is this size right here that's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.090 
field is this size right here that's
actually<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> easy<00:00:55.140> field<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> small
