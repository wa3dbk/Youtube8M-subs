to understand how to lift things with

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.530 
to understand how to lift things with
just<00:03:25.439> maximum<00:03:26.069> efficiency<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:27.209> way<00:03:27.479> you

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
just maximum efficiency that way you

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.020 
just maximum efficiency that way you
have<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.019> greatest<00:03:28.379> carry<00:03:28.889> over<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.579> all

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
have the greatest carry over to all

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.670 
have the greatest carry over to all
different<00:03:30.329> tools<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.049> those<00:03:31.199> you<00:03:31.379> that<00:03:31.530> are

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
different tools and those you that are

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
going to be doing straight bars maybe

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.580 
going to be doing straight bars maybe
you<00:03:48.000> would<00:03:48.150> have<00:03:48.180> an<00:03:48.479> odd<00:03:48.689> object<00:03:49.259> here<00:03:49.470> and

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
you would have an odd object here and

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.409 
you would have an odd object here and
there<00:03:49.709> now<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:50.340> see<00:03:50.699> at<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.879> CrossFit<00:03:51.150> Games
