00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.860
 hello how are you doing this and lupita and 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.440
 today we are going to prepare some 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.599
 rich pumpkins to the Mexican for that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.880
 We're going to need a kilo of pumpkins 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.119
 already washed and chopped the 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.100
 washed and chopped tomatoes I'm also going 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.220
 to need two chilies which children 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.600
 green or of which you prefer 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.940
 chopped 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.890
 I will also need an onion already 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.840
 I have it also chopped 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.500
 a teaspoon of chicken bouillon in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.090
 powder this is optional 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.260
 and salt 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.850
 this is a very easy recipe very fast 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.420
 and it's going to be fat-free then it's going to 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.420
 look great 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.540
 I will accompany the pumpkins 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.600
 with the other one I'm going to put 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.670
 a cup of corn kernels is the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.309
 I'll drain and rinse for I will 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.899
 add the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.869
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.170
 our pumpkins in the house in a 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.170
 casserole 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.830
 without nothing the casserole has nothing 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.830
 I'm going to empty the pumpkins 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.920
 and I 'm going to add a little water 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.920
 this is just a trickle 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.909
 the good stage and I'm going to leave them 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:49.119
 next to add 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.319
 what is the tomato chili 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.319
 onion and consumption 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.410
 since our base scale softened 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.770
 we are going to add the consumption of 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.770
 chicken 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.619
 the tomato 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.950
 and the chilies 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.120
 and the onion 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.060
 let's mix everything 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.060
 ah 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.860
 and we are going to go to season with our 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.770
 blood 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.980
 I still have not added more water and 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.840
 defined of the hot water fruit and 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.660
 the pumpkins have been loosing their 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.360
 juice then that's why we do not know 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.490
 they're going to hit and we're going to burn what 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.100
 stay for about two or three 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.800
 minutes the pumpkins so alone for 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.840
 that they will start jumping juice 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.840
 Now I'm going to add the salt 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.870
 to later add this after 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.120
 that allow two or three minutes and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.120
 we started adding the ingredients 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.980
 the tomato onion and chilies the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.660
 control 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.630
 ah 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.630
 I'm going to add corn kernels 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.640
 here 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.330
 let's mix 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.000
 let's go back to cover our pan 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.540
 and we're going to let our 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.540
 pumpkins 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.380
 here we have our pumpkins and 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.310
 they were new lists to where with a 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.310
 little bit of cream 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.239
 they are very rich I hope they make it 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.580
 to try it, just prepare in your 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.710
 family 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.710
 and see you until the next recipe
