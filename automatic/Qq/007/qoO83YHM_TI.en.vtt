prototype of the weapon in existence now
in<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.580> opinion<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> regular<00:01:15.450> Chinese<00:01:15.630> pistol

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
in my opinion the regular Chinese pistol

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.749 
in my opinion the regular Chinese pistol
is<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.590> too<00:01:16.740> great<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.280> pretty<00:01:17.549> weak

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
is not all too great it is a pretty weak

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.490 
is not all too great it is a pretty weak
weapon<00:01:18.090> dealing<00:01:18.299> only<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.750> damage<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.290> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
weapon dealing only for damage and this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.170 
weapon dealing only for damage and this
weapon<00:01:19.799> also<00:01:20.220> only<00:01:20.460> deals<00:01:20.759> four<00:01:21.150> damage

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
weapon also only deals four damage

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.749 
weapon also only deals four damage
however<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.900> has<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> unique<00:01:22.409> effect<00:01:22.759> which

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
however it has a unique effect which

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.640

for five seconds dealing two damage
every<00:01:28.229> second<00:01:28.650> which<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> pretty<00:01:29.640> cool

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
every second which is a pretty cool

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.690 
every second which is a pretty cool
effect<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.630> unfortunately<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.799> only<00:01:32.070> 10

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
effect but unfortunately that's only 10

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
effect but unfortunately that's only 10
damage<00:01:33.030> over<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> whole<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:34.049> five<00:01:34.560> seconds

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
damage over the whole of five seconds

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.940 
damage over the whole of five seconds
and<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.119> four<00:01:36.329> damage<00:01:36.540> per<00:01:36.810> shot<00:01:36.950> really

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and the four damage per shot really

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.789 
and the four damage per shot really
really<00:01:38.579> isn't<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:38.939> much<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.350> damage

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
really isn't this much but the damage

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.950 
really isn't this much but the damage
are<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> damage<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.479> actually<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
are not the damage it actually is the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.210 
are not the damage it actually is the
longest<00:01:43.320> range<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> incendiary

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
longest range of all the incendiary

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.499 
longest range of all the incendiary
weapons<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.970> set<00:01:45.149> people<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.450> fire

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
weapons so you can set people on fire

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.660 
weapons so you can set people on fire
farther<00:01:46.470> away<00:01:46.590> than<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.009> anything<00:01:47.369> else

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
farther away than with anything else

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.120 
farther away than with anything else
I<00:01:48.020> don't<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.409> weapon<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.799> didn't

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I don't know this weapon just didn't

cool<00:01:51.810> thing<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.200> collect<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.579> would

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
cool thing to collect but this would

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.910 
cool thing to collect but this would
probably<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.750> biggest<00:01:54.990> option<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.710> sale
