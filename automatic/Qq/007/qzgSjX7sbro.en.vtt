my droid perturb the 500 I've come
across<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.619> small<00:00:17.039> feature<00:00:17.640> which<00:00:17.939> I<00:00:18.060> thought

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
across a small feature which I thought

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.450 
across a small feature which I thought
was<00:00:18.390> quite<00:00:18.570> interesting<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:20.279> thought

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
was quite interesting and just thought

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.540 
was quite interesting and just thought
I'd<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> very<00:00:20.910> quick<00:00:21.199> basic<00:00:22.199> video<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
I'd do a very quick basic video just to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.839 
I'd do a very quick basic video just to

it's obviously on these new tablets we

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.790 
it's obviously on these new tablets we
have<00:00:30.509> android<00:00:31.199> 3.0<00:00:31.800> honeycomb<00:00:33.470> one<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.560> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
have android 3.0 honeycomb one of the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.310 
have android 3.0 honeycomb one of the
interesting<00:00:35.300> things<00:00:36.300> available<00:00:36.600> was<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
interesting things available was that

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.850 
interesting things available was that
there<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.650> device<00:00:38.430> encryption<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.440> I've<00:00:40.590> been

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
there is device encryption so I've been

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.350 
there is device encryption so I've been
on<00:00:40.950> YouTube<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:42.720> various<00:00:43.170> other<00:00:43.320> sources

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
on YouTube and various other sources

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.170 
on YouTube and various other sources
just<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.510> faint<00:00:46.520> some<00:00:47.520> additional<00:00:47.970> information

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
just a faint some additional information

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.930 
just a faint some additional information
or<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.870> information<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.560> I<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.940> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
or as much information as I can and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.940 
or as much information as I can and
can't<00:00:51.240> find<00:00:51.480> anything<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.260> apart<00:00:52.650> from

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
can't find anything at all apart from

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.850 
can't find anything at all apart from
that<00:00:52.980> literally<00:00:53.970> supports<00:00:54.540> it<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.190> have

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
that literally supports it so I have

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.470 
that literally supports it so I have
just<00:00:58.860> started<00:00:59.250> interrupting<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.060> device<00:01:00.300> as

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
just started interrupting that device as

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
just started interrupting that device as
snow<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.970> there's<00:01:02.970> a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
snow as you can see here there's a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.980 
snow as you can see here there's a
sixty-two<00:01:04.500> percent<00:01:04.980> with<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.880> whole<00:01:09.480> process

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
sixty-two percent with the whole process

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.010 
sixty-two percent with the whole process
I<00:01:10.140> think<00:01:10.380> has<00:01:10.470> been<00:01:10.650> running<00:01:10.920> around<00:01:12.020> 25

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
I think has been running around 25

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
I think has been running around 25
minutes<00:01:13.380> 30<00:01:13.920> minutes<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.670> far<00:01:15.620> so<00:01:16.620> should<00:01:17.010> be

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
minutes 30 minutes so far so should be

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.710 
minutes 30 minutes so far so should be
told<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.420> finished<00:01:21.710> one<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:22.980> I

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
told and look be finished one thing I

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.969 
told and look be finished one thing I
would<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.500> add<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:27.000> prior<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
would like to add is that just prior to

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.230 
would like to add is that just prior to
the<00:01:29.060> encryption<00:01:30.060> process<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:31.680> had<00:01:32.280> basically

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the encryption process I had basically

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.440 
the encryption process I had basically
stripped<00:01:33.750> everything<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:35.270> thought<00:01:36.270> were

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
stripped everything I thought were

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.020 
stripped everything I thought were
relevant<00:01:36.690> from<00:01:37.200> isa<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.760> but

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
relevant from isa just to take this but

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
relevant from isa just to take this but
to<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:39.990> basic<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> install<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.370> I<00:01:41.490> could

to as as basic and install as I could

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.539 
to as as basic and install as I could
get<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.270> honeycomb<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:45.740> two<00:01:46.740> applications

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
get for honeycomb the two applications

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.000 
get for honeycomb the two applications
will<00:01:47.909> chance<00:01:48.150> talk<00:01:48.360> from<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.690> market<00:01:49.170> was

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
will chance talk from the market was

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.910 
will chance talk from the market was

and offers am quite impressed with her
performance<00:02:00.830> know<00:02:02.410> when<00:02:03.410> Pike<00:02:03.770> i<00:02:04.190> think<00:02:04.760> is

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
performance know when Pike i think is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:12.280 
performance know when Pike i think is
pretty<00:02:05.330> good<00:02:05.660> scores<00:02:06.140> off<00:02:06.940> around<00:02:11.170> 43,000<00:02:12.170> on

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
pretty good scores off around 43,000 on

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.000 
pretty good scores off around 43,000 on
average<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:14.210> obviously<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.690> can<00:02:14.870> just<00:02:15.080> do

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
average so obviously you can just do

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.070 
average so obviously you can just do

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
just see if the scores are somewhat a
