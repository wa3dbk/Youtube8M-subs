00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello to all the expression of the best 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
 friend lluÃ­s today we are going to make a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.560
 beautiful and white level tutorial we are going to 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.110
 teach them how to do their makeup and today 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.120
 is going to teach you how to do your hairstyle 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.370
 We had a lot of fun making this video 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.109
 so we hope you like it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.090
 lose the end as there are so many 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.619
 bloopers and old photos since this was 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.619
 of our diet last year 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.340
 we will start by applying balm to 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.340
 moisturize our lips 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.120
 now I'm going to apply mine does with a 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.200
 blush brush as this will make it 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.200
 see a lot more natural 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.260
 do not forget the neck 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.199
 since we need perfect skin 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.370
 let's use corrector for our 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.370
 dark circles and any imperfection 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.659
 now to remove the brightness of our 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.560
 face I will use my powders more than they give you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560
 excellent coverage 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.280
 then we will use a little bronzer 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.280
 to frame our face 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.689
 now a little flush in our 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.689
 cheeks 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.260
 and finally to finish the face 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.260
 we will use illuminator 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.340
 since the canyon has its lips 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 Red will do something very simple 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.450
 we are going to start using 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.280
 a test like that let's apply it in everything 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.730
 our eyelid so that the shadows 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.460
 last much longer 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.470
 I will be using mini pallets from 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.100
 liberbank and that I will use the color 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.100
 more clear 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.479
 to apply it in all my palm 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.739
 Now I'm going to use my little boy 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.680
 thunderbird and that I'm going to use a coffee 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.840
 mast 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.200
 that will help us frame our 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.200
 story 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.410
 and to illuminate our eyes we are going to 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.340
 take a white frost and we're going to 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.340
 apply less good 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.099
 now as always you will use a 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.019
 liquid designer and I'm going to apply a 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.940
 very thin line on top 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.310
 to the tabs 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.010
 and so that the line although so defined 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.120
 let's pass a black matte shadow 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.120
 over only 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.659
 Now we are going to apply a blink and go 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.400
 to try to apply it from the root of 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.400
 the tabs to make them look long 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.770
 we are also going to apply on the tabs 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.770
 down 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.370
 and we're going to start with the lips like that 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.950
 I'll take my green line and Ibon in 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.310
 the color red and I'm going to start delineating 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.310
 the 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.959
 do not worry if you do not have left 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.100
 perfect then you can fix them 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.990
 with a little 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.990
 now I am filling them 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.989
 and when we have finished applying a 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.989
 transparent shine 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.359
 and that's all I dance 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.560
 Y 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.660
 to have perfect skin like that of 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.549
 beautiful you are going to use a concealer and 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.139
 let's apply it under your eyes in 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.139
 all the imperfections you have 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.139
 to fix the concealer you will use 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.550
 your powders and you will apply them in all your 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.360
 this will face will also help 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.360
 remove the brightness 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.419
 now you take your favorite illuminator and 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.350
 apply it in those places where 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.350
 you want the light to come 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.710
 now to start with us going to 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.630
 aspire a test to cech and how I have them 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.250
 said helps the shadows last 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.820
 much longer and that colors are 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.820
 see better 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.870
 and now it's going to hire your tabs 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.969
 those are the ones we are going to use where 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.189
 I complain about the pimp 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.889
 so you're going to take that pink with 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:20.059
 frost and we will apply it in the 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.059
 half of the eyelid 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.180
 to take a golden tone and we're going to 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.990
 apply it in the other half of our 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.990
 middle eyelid 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.660
 to give more depth to our 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.400
 let's use a dark coffee and what 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.400
 we will apply throughout the hair 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.250
 let's concentrate on the part of 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.250
 outside 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.970
 now let's take a white mate and what 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.190
 let's apply below the eyebrows to 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.670
 frame them and they look much more 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.670
 defined 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.810
 with last eyeliner 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.680
 but below this will make your 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.330
 eyelashes are much more populated 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.780
 to delineate the bottom part we're going to 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.789
 use a brown shadow with dark gray 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.110
 and we are going to delineate the bottom part of 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.090
 our 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.250
 and to outline the top part we're going 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.440
 to use a gel eyeliner and let's go 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.120
 to try to make the line very close to 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.450
 the tabs here we want a look 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.450
 very natural 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.880
 now you are going to take your favorite lash 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.210
 and you are going to apply some layers in your 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.210
 tabs 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.650
 and we're done with our eyes now 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.930
 let's start with the lips first 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.930
 we are going to apply a balm to leave them 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.719
 and we're going to use a mac lipstick in 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.719
 the angel color 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.740
