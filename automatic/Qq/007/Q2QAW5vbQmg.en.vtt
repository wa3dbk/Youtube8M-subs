00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
not a piston a repeater redstone right

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.839 
not a piston a repeater redstone right
so<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.879> have<00:03:14.909> one<00:03:15.180> two<00:03:15.510> three<00:03:16.080> four<00:03:16.830> five<00:03:16.890> six

don't want this video to be too long
then<00:05:03.949> I'll<00:05:04.070> get<00:05:04.250> boring<00:05:04.699> bird<00:05:05.320> yeah<00:05:06.610> spill

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
then I'll get boring bird yeah spill

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.270 
then I'll get boring bird yeah spill
this<00:05:07.789> wall<00:05:08.030> up<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:09.110> water's<00:05:09.440> fine<00:05:09.650> is<00:05:10.009> there

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
this wall up the water's fine is there

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
this wall up the water's fine is there
kinetic<00:05:10.759> I<00:05:12.190> have<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.310> same<00:05:13.490> exact<00:05:13.789> candidate

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
kinetic I have the same exact candidate

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.580 
kinetic I have the same exact candidate
an<00:05:14.479> excel<00:05:14.870> file<00:05:15.169> to<00:05:15.289> show<00:05:15.470> you<00:05:15.530> from<00:05:15.770> this<00:05:16.009> one

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
an excel file to show you from this one

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.529 
an excel file to show you from this one
and<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:18.800> really<00:05:18.949> don't<00:05:19.190> need<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:19.460> much<00:05:19.909> TNT

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
and you really don't need this much TNT

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.159 
and you really don't need this much TNT
this<00:05:21.530> close<00:05:21.770> up<00:05:21.800> I'm<00:05:22.250> just<00:05:22.639> doing<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.389> cuz<00:05:23.690> why

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
this close up I'm just doing it cuz why

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.439 
this close up I'm just doing it cuz why
not<00:05:24.880> so<00:05:25.880> we're<00:05:26.030> going<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.210> do<00:05:26.330> that<00:05:26.539> and<00:05:28.449> just

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
not so we're going to do that and just

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.560 
not so we're going to do that and just
well<00:05:30.199> it's<00:05:30.860> probably<00:05:31.669> way<00:05:31.940> too<00:05:31.970> much<00:05:32.300> power

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
well it's probably way too much power

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.320 
well it's probably way too much power
for<00:05:32.720> like<00:05:33.080> this<00:05:33.289> one's<00:05:33.530> at<00:05:33.889> all<00:05:34.699> right<00:05:34.880> so<00:05:35.120> I'm

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
for like this one's at all right so I'm

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.870 
for like this one's at all right so I'm
gonna<00:05:35.900> do<00:05:36.199> that<00:05:36.380> again<00:05:36.680> for<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.979> with<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.460> lot

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
gonna do that again for it with a lot

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.350 
gonna do that again for it with a lot
less<00:05:37.909> power<00:05:38.360> cuz<00:05:38.810> it's<00:05:39.320> not
