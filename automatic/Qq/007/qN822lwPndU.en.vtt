same thing at the time nobody knew what

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.000 
same thing at the time nobody knew what
was<00:00:48.690> causing<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.469> coined<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.860> term

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
was causing it but they coined the term

was causing it but they coined the term
colony<00:00:50.430> collapse<00:00:50.550> disorder<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> cover

colony collapse disorder just to cover
this<00:00:51.660> sudden<00:00:52.020> disappearance<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.920> honey<00:00:53.430> bees

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this sudden disappearance of honey bees

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.340 
this sudden disappearance of honey bees
and<00:00:54.059> why<00:00:54.780> does<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.930> matter

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and why does it matter

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
and why does it matter
obviously<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.860> bad<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.190> honey<00:00:56.309> production

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
obviously it's bad for honey production

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
obviously it's bad for honey production
but<00:00:57.059> that's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> relatively<00:00:57.750> small<00:00:58.050> commodity

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
but that's a relatively small commodity

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.959 
but that's a relatively small commodity
why<00:00:58.739> else<00:00:58.890> does<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> matter<00:00:59.340> what's<00:00:59.789> bad<00:00:59.940> for

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
why else does it matter what's bad for

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.520 
why else does it matter what's bad for
honey<00:01:00.239> production<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.750> bad<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.440> B

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
honey production it's bad for for B

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.349 
honey production it's bad for for B
lovers<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.489> matters<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.879> well<00:01:03.000> because

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
lovers but it matters as well because

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.780 
lovers but it matters as well because
bees<00:01:03.949> pollinate<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> lot<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> crops<00:01:05.610> that

bees pollinate a lot of the crops that

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
bees pollinate a lot of the crops that

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
done on it suggests it is the pesticides

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.609 
done on it suggests it is the pesticides
that<00:01:42.060> are<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.450> least<00:01:42.479> involved<00:01:43.049> that's<00:01:43.380> right

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
that are at least involved that's right

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.350 
that are at least involved that's right
it<00:01:43.770> suggests<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.340> suggests<00:01:44.820> they're<00:01:45.030> involved

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it suggests it suggests they're involved

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
it suggests it suggests they're involved

it's building on on some other work
that's<00:01:47.369> been<00:01:47.549> done<00:01:47.610> some<00:01:48.090> lab<00:01:48.270> studies

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that's been done some lab studies

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.960 
that's been done some lab studies
whereby<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.710> expose<00:01:50.070> honeybees<00:01:50.670> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
whereby when you expose honeybees to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690 
whereby when you expose honeybees to
these<00:01:51.090> pesticides<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.750> lab<00:01:51.899> conditions<00:01:52.700> they

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
these pesticides in lab conditions they

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.460 
these pesticides in lab conditions they
sort<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> start<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> behave<00:01:54.600> strangely<00:01:55.049> they

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
sort of start to behave strangely they

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
sort of start to behave strangely they
become<00:01:56.070> confused<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.729> find<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.060> harder<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
become confused they find it harder to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
become confused they find it harder to
perform<00:01:57.719> sort<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> navigation<00:01:59.130> tasks<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
perform sort of navigation tasks and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.100 
perform sort of navigation tasks and
that<00:02:00.299> makes<00:02:00.509> sense<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:01.020> these

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that makes sense because these

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.350 
that makes sense because these
pesticides<00:02:01.649> are<00:02:02.149> neurotoxins<00:02:03.149> they're

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
pesticides are neurotoxins they're

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.120 
pesticides are neurotoxins they're
actually<00:02:03.600> very<00:02:03.750> similar<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.140> nicotine<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
actually very similar to nicotine the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.730 
actually very similar to nicotine the
stuff<00:02:05.310> that's<00:02:05.490> found<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.119> cigarettes<00:02:06.750> they

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
stuff that's found in in cigarettes they

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.339 
stuff that's found in in cigarettes they
called<00:02:07.979> neonicotinoids

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
called neonicotinoids

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.750 
called neonicotinoids
so<00:02:10.349> there<00:02:10.739> was<00:02:10.830> some<00:02:10.950> suspicion<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
so there was some suspicion that the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.190 
so there was some suspicion that the
pesticides<00:02:12.209> might<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.599> involved<00:02:12.959> but<00:02:13.080> these

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
pesticides might be involved but these

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.940 
pesticides might be involved but these
two<00:02:13.379> studies

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
two studies

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
two studies
were<00:02:14.250> field<00:02:14.520> trials<00:02:15.000> testing<00:02:15.330> us<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.629> in<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
were field trials testing us out in the

were field trials testing us out in the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.600 
real world as it were rather than in lab
conditions<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.160> them<00:02:20.310> was<00:02:20.370> done<00:02:20.519> on

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
conditions so one of them was done on

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.460 
conditions so one of them was done on
bumblebees<00:02:21.120> which<00:02:21.420> are<00:02:21.569> closely<00:02:21.959> related<00:02:22.319> to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
is obviously very bad if you're trying

is obviously very bad if you're trying
to<00:02:51.720> keep<00:02:51.840> your<00:02:52.049> bumblebee<00:02:52.739> populations<00:02:53.370> up

but the second study which comes from a
group<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.470> France<00:02:55.739> shed<00:02:56.670> some<00:02:56.819> light<00:02:56.849> on<00:02:57.150> that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
group in France shed some light on that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.780 
group in France shed some light on that
and<00:02:57.329> they<00:02:57.510> did<00:02:57.690> study<00:02:57.959> honeybees<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:59.340> similar

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
and they did study honeybees a similar

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.420 
and they did study honeybees a similar
sort<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.030> setup<00:03:00.239> where<00:03:00.540> they<00:03:00.660> had<00:03:00.900> hives<00:03:01.430> out

in the real world and they exposed the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.559 
in the real world and they exposed the
insects<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.500> these<00:03:04.620> pesticides<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.640> they

insects to these pesticides and they
what<00:03:06.900> they<00:03:07.019> did<00:03:07.140> was<00:03:07.290> they<00:03:07.380> actually<00:03:07.500> managed

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
what they did was they actually managed

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.920 
what they did was they actually managed
to<00:03:08.430> record<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.000> number<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.299> workers<00:03:09.720> coming

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
to record the number of workers coming

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.539 
to record the number of workers coming
back<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.319> forth<00:03:10.470> from<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.829> hives<00:03:11.010> by<00:03:11.250> gluing

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
back and forth from the hives by gluing

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.069 
back and forth from the hives by gluing
little<00:03:11.790> radio<00:03:12.060> transmitters<00:03:12.540> onto<00:03:12.780> them<00:03:12.900> and

little radio transmitters onto them and

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.020 
little radio transmitters onto them and
they<00:03:13.739> found<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.130> exposure<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.940> these

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
they found that exposure to these

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.610 
they found that exposure to these
pesticides<00:03:15.360> roughly<00:03:15.930> doubled<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.349> number<00:03:16.560> of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
pesticides roughly doubled the number of

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.520 
pesticides roughly doubled the number of
bees<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.040> went<00:03:17.220> awol<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:18.299> any<00:03:18.480> given<00:03:19.290> period

so<00:03:40.549> do<00:03:41.549> we<00:03:41.639> think<00:03:41.670> therefore<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.600> colony

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
so do we think therefore that colony

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.629 
so do we think therefore that colony
collapse<00:03:43.470> disorder<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:44.040> caused<00:03:44.310> by<00:03:44.489> these

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
collapse disorder is caused by these

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.940 
collapse disorder is caused by these
pesticides<00:03:45.049> it's<00:03:46.049> still<00:03:46.350> too<00:03:46.590> early<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.829> say

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
pesticides it's still too early to say

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.370 
pesticides it's still too early to say
that<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.180> evidence<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.630> mounting<00:03:48.870> and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
that but the evidence is mounting and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.740 
that but the evidence is mounting and
one<00:03:49.920> theory<00:03:50.430> now<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.120> that's<00:03:51.239> beginning<00:03:51.630> to

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
one theory now that that's beginning to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.129 
one theory now that that's beginning to
gain<00:03:51.900> quite<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.560> lot<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.829> adherence<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.430> that

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
gain quite a lot of adherence is that

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.360 
gain quite a lot of adherence is that
pesticides<00:03:55.139> are<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.350> sort<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.590> general<00:03:55.769> effect

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
pesticides are a sort of general effect

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.210 
pesticides are a sort of general effect
because<00:03:57.150> these<00:03:57.269> things<00:03:57.420> are<00:03:57.569> widely<00:03:57.900> used<00:03:58.220> and

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
because these things are widely used and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.089 
because these things are widely used and
what<00:03:59.519> the<00:04:00.299> theory<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.109> exposure<00:04:01.920> to

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
what the theory is that the exposure to

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.039 
what the theory is that the exposure to
these<00:04:02.220> pesticides<00:04:02.549> basically<00:04:03.209> weakens<00:04:03.660> the

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
these pesticides basically weakens the

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.960 
these pesticides basically weakens the
colony's<00:04:04.410> ability<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.920> cope<00:04:05.130> with<00:04:05.700> lots<00:04:05.880> of

colony's ability to cope with lots of
other<00:04:06.120> challenges<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.139> even<00:04:07.560> if<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.709> exposure

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
other challenges so even if the exposure

isn't<00:04:08.340> fatal<00:04:08.519> by<00:04:08.730> itself<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.299> makes<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.630> much

for sort of wildlife than for the
environment<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.070> in<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.520> traditional<00:05:02.970> way

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
environment and in the traditional way

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.659

but<00:05:04.290> ironically<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.830> seems<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.220> for<00:05:05.340> bees<00:05:05.490> at

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:06.940 
but ironically it seems that for bees at

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
least that and that isn't how it works

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.440 
least that and that isn't how it works

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
so no good deed goes unpunished

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.510 
so no good deed goes unpunished
