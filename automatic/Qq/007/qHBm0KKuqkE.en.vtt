 paint adhesion to it and significantly 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.150
 prolongs the life of the finished coating 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.970
 the choice is not only important 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.470

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 applying ceiling paint we 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 recommend swedish tool

 roll out before starting work 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.890

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.030
 uniform surface from correct 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.189
