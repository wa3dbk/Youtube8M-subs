00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.080 
minecraft redstone video today what I've
got<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.120> show<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:07.160> what<00:00:08.160> hoppers<00:00:08.670> have

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
got to show you is what hoppers have

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.560 
got to show you is what hoppers have
brought<00:00:09.420> into<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.440> game<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
brought into the game this is the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.340 
brought into the game this is the
smallest<00:00:13.400> redstone<00:00:14.400> clock<00:00:15.020> within<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> game

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
smallest redstone clock within the game

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.769 
smallest redstone clock within the game
it<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:17.160> really<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:17.880> small<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.510> only

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
it is really really small it's only

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.650 
it is really really small it's only
eight<00:00:18.990> block<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.619> space<00:00:19.920> meaning<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.939> two<00:00:21.270> by

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
eight block in space meaning it's two by

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.400 
eight block in space meaning it's two by
two<00:00:21.720> by<00:00:22.140> two<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.550> that's<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.060> same<00:00:24.359> size<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:25.109> my

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
two by two so that's the same size as my

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.730 
two by two so that's the same size as my
small<00:00:25.800> st<00:00:26.189> flip-flop<00:00:26.670> very<00:00:27.449> compact<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.199> it's

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
small st flip-flop very compact and it's

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980 
small st flip-flop very compact and it's
even<00:00:29.039> tileable<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.359> play<00:00:30.539> some<00:00:30.599> right

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
even tileable so you can play some right

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.749 
even tileable so you can play some right
next<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> each<00:00:31.500> other<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.550> won't

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
next to each other and they won't

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.940 
next to each other and they won't
interfere<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.420> one<00:00:33.750> another<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.739> also

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
interfere with one another you can also

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.950 
interfere with one another you can also
play<00:00:35.340> some<00:00:35.370> right<00:00:35.790> above<00:00:36.149> each<00:00:36.329> other<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
play some right above each other and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240 
play some right above each other and
they<00:00:37.140> won't<00:00:37.350> interfere<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:38.040> one<00:00:38.219> another

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
they won't interfere with one another

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.549 
they won't interfere with one another
let<00:00:39.120> me<00:00:39.210> show<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.600> an<00:00:39.840> example<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.350> me

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
let me show you an example of me

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.100 
let me show you an example of me
building<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.340> now<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.020> there's<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
building one right now and there's a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.450 
building one right now and there's a
trick<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.800> could<00:00:44.040> build<00:00:44.190> one<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
trick to how you could build one of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.279 
trick to how you could build one of
these<00:00:44.640> guys<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:46.700> I'll<00:00:47.700> tell<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
these guys so I'll tell you that as you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.910 
these guys so I'll tell you that as you
can<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.489> staying<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
can see here this one is staying on and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.500 
can see here this one is staying on and
that<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> problem<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.730> hopper<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that is a problem with hopper so all you

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.900 
that is a problem with hopper so all you
have<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.079> break<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.410> hopper<00:00:55.920> replace

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
have to do is break the hopper replace

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.369 
have to do is break the hopper replace
it<00:00:57.149> place<00:00:58.050> back<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.500> redstone<00:00:58.800> Gus<00:01:00.379> break

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it place back your redstone Gus break

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.070 
it place back your redstone Gus break
this<00:01:01.590> hopper<00:01:02.070> replace<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:04.070> there<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:06.080> so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
this hopper replace it there you go so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
this hopper replace it there you go so
yeah<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.250> trick<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.850> talking

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
yeah that's the one trick I was talking

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.330 
yeah that's the one trick I was talking
about<00:01:09.360> right<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:10.530> sometimes

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
about right there because sometimes

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.310 
about right there because sometimes
hoppers<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.960> behave

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
hoppers just don't like to behave

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.609 
hoppers just don't like to behave
correctly<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.450> comparators<00:01:16.080> asked<00:01:16.500> an

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
correctly to with comparators asked an

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.420 
correctly to with comparators asked an
output<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:18.229> if<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.380> look<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
output so if you look at this here it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
output so if you look at this here it
doesn't<00:01:20.729> work<00:01:21.119> properly<00:01:21.479> even<00:01:22.020> though<00:01:22.200> they

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
doesn't work properly even though they

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.830 
doesn't work properly even though they
are<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:22.710> posting<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.570> stuck

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
are actually posting and when it's stuck

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.630 
are actually posting and when it's stuck
in<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.920> want<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.130> break<00:01:26.400> this

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
in this one you want to break this

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.020 
in this one you want to break this
hopper<00:01:27.090> right<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.540> away<00:01:27.900> from<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.320> lever

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
hopper right here away from the lever

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.640 
hopper right here away from the lever
replace<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:32.850> will<00:01:33.060> post<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.079> when<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
replace it and it will post but when it

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160 
replace it and it will post but when it
doesn't<00:01:34.950> even<00:01:35.250> give<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> post<00:01:36.119> at<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.540> like

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
doesn't even give out a post at all like

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.410 
doesn't even give out a post at all like
this<00:01:37.530> even<00:01:37.799> though<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.150> because

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this even though this is just because

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.410 
this even though this is just because
I've<00:01:39.570> lever<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.140> right<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.150> want<00:01:42.329> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
I've lever on right now and you want to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.929 
I've lever on right now and you want to
break<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.380> then<00:01:43.470> replace<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.950> so

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
break this one and then replace it so

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.109 
break this one and then replace it so
yeah<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.930> has<00:01:46.430> quite<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> few<00:01:47.520> bugs<00:01:47.909> with

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
yeah this this has quite a few bugs with

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.840 
yeah this this has quite a few bugs with
it<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.930> bug<00:01:49.320> within<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> game<00:01:50.130> not

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it but this is bug within the game not

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.480 
it but this is bug within the game not
because<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.750> machine<00:01:52.170> itself<00:01:52.490> machine

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
because of the machine itself machine

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
because of the machine itself machine
itself<00:01:53.820> will<00:01:54.060> never<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.479> fixed<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
itself will never be fixed because it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.260 
itself will never be fixed because it's
not<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> bug<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.700> are<00:01:56.729> bugs<00:01:57.000> with

not a bug but there are bugs with

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.480 
not a bug but there are bugs with
building<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.780> machine<00:01:58.200> other<00:01:58.950> than<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.189> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
building this machine other than that I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.160 
building this machine other than that I
hope<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> guys<00:02:00.060> enjoyed<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:00.930> video
