00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.620
 good colleague here we have is the poster 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.250
 one touch screem s alcatel arrives because 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.630
 do not sim card 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.670
 after the client entered the sim 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.100
 bad card 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.300
 damage the contacts that have to do 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.519
 there comes the one to the sky 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.490
 damage to the contacts of the sim card the 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.099
 reader so there was loss 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.500
 total since I had not been able to give 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.890
 solution to that client as it is 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.890
 complicated to get that same reader 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.570
 then quite possibly in any 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.489
 side would tell you that it can not be done anymore 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.129
 nothing that would have no solution 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.800
 I would have an arrangement since I have complicated 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.380
 first get an equal reader and 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.870
 second power change since 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.460
 It is several contacts 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.809
 behind it has almost 12-14 contacts what 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.860
 which makes it a little more complicated 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.570
 of welding 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.280
 however you can as well as we have 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.880
 shown on other phones like the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.470
 alcatel this 60 30 and we're going to look 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.560
 who is reading the sim card 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.840
 perfectly then in this video and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.930
 make a small clarification and also 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.290
 give hope to some who 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.810
 people who follow us and who maybe 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.730
 have a similar phone damaged and that 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.380
 could not find a solution, not what 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.190
 have saved 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.010
 there is a method that although it is not the best 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.830
 if you save the phone and it is to leave a sim 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.920
 fully direct welded card what 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 we apply sim card is light 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.450
 sun we give some cords and cough when 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.210
 we are releasing the warm ones the sim 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.300
 card we have to be very fast and use 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.570
 a soldering iron that does not exceed 30 watts of 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.550
 power since we can reheat the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.119
 internal chip that has sugar and we damage 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.710
 in the procedure of the sim card in 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.649
 this case the client brought me the sim 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.090
 new card proceeds to weld the and here 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.520
 I will then give a small 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.349
 explanation of what we did 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.360
 and here until then the method that 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.760
 we use here are the contacts of the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.740
 farms the contacts where the soldier goes 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.470
 elector 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.560
 and where does each of the lines of 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.310
 voltage data of the 100 then 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.680
 is pending to which this point and is 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.920
 here are the first switch that has 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.660
 the sim card with this bridge here is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 indicates to the processor that the sim card 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.190
 is entered like these two 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.190
 points from here that is why they are united in 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.590
 tin 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.780
 indicating that the sim card is entered 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.690
 just this other switch remember that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.140
 these readers bring two switches and 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.880
 there it is already indicating the processor and 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.130
 the system that there is a sim card 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.740
 entered now I have to weld the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.870
 six contacts there see it remember that 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.660
 this farm is eight contacts but 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.570
 that we here in Colombia and in many 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.520
 countries the sim kallas still come from 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.160
 six contacts and that's why these two 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.290
 contacts that you see here are suspended 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.300
 because they are not going to be used and I'm not going to 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.130
 put me to be able to weld the first thing 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.950
 I do not have to weld it either since the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.140
 sim card just six-pointed here and 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.750
 then I do use the order and to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.920
 discover the order then took the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.950
 same damaged reader and I'm leaving like 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.440
 I know there are two contacts that I do not use there 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.360
 two contacts I locate what are in 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.730
 this case are these two contacts of 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.430
 this sector and these are two purposes that 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.209
 are those that are unused in the in the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.250
 hour then placed the sim card and I try to 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.920
 decipher if the sim card goes 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.590
 the position I watch as the faceless enters 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.670
 in this case it enters in this way 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.860
 upward entry is done with the guide 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.750
 to this side already we know that 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.900
 the microcement is going to be cut but the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.650
 guide arrives at this point here then 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.440
 I turn it over and I know that this point here 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.319
 makes contact with this one here and I start 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.480
 to weld and so on it is already I know 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.989
 that then would be the one of here let's say that 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.900
 I will try to weld this point from 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.970
 here of the sim card then what do I do 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.040
 I check here where he makes contact with 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.340
 contact here says that the first one this 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.040
 side and then released it the second and so 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.960
 successively and I give solution to this 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.750
 problem that had the connector damaged 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.900
 if I only thrust them well but I do not 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.639
 the jumpers to the switches the sim 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.009
 card will not be read nor will it be 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.620
 recognized by the system then 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.960
 apart from that I have to weld well the 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.419
 cables and cough I also have to isolate 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.080
 so that they do not make contact with 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.610
 the other here in this case I use cable that 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.490
 comes in the hands free that from a 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.000
 internal color and they are very easy to 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.069
 weld and it helps me that by the lines 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.930
 where there was hatton of colors if 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.690
 It has a coating like a wax 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.780
 color and that helps me not have 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.970
 loss of data or information 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.500
 so I will be able to solve any 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.840
 case by the background process are 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.520
 new only use as they do not reach it 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.520
 use the client because he bought the sim 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.349
 card and entered it badly and one year the 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.800
 phone I did not read any sim card 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:33.710
 and there was total loss but now with that 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.599
 method although it comes back and I repeat it is not 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.710
 the best but it is the one that is going to give 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:42.169
 solution and we are also going to 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.379
 let's say let's say it more clients because 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.789
 help solve something that maybe another 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.379
 rejects helpful arauca service 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.669
