 huge bipedal turtle that can extend 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.170
 its powerful cannons that have their 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.780
 back to shoot powerful jets 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.970
 of water with enough force to 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.640

 with enough precision to hit 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.300
 cans 50 meters away despite 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.160
 they are unable to point to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.040
 objectives too close 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.870
 the three of them is amazing or I love it 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.700
 surely many such thinkers 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.420
 you thought it was the top number one but 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.660
 not the top number one I give it to 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.510
 perform is a pokémon with 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.420
 violent presumptuous violent press and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.790
 very proud fuck has all you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.350
 Caritas is so much that it is not capable of 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.720
 fight against one because we have weaker 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.460
 that he is for this simple reason that 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.160
 I prefer to fight against opponents that 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.680
 read that they represent a challenge to you 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.440
 that does not defeat your adversary will not stop 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.360
 if it enters into a state of fury its flame will 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.220
 multiply by 10 and is capable of 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.980
 melt anything with its powerful 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.290
