00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 in the press release of the new skoda 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.490
 octavia scout is reading that it is the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.990
 best car in its segment is that is 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.730
 just not such an achievement as that it 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.510
 it seems is the only car 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.429
 the himself with 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.960
 just go after the subaru outback that is 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.790
 really a size too big and old as 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.440
 a volvo v40 cross country 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.570
 has no station wagon carriage so the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.949
 title best car is segment you can u 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.840
 already sign up before we too 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.070
 have only driven one meter 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.720
 but still find out if it really is 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.250
 has added value compared to one 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.250
 normal skoda octavia combi 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.220
 well the added value is that if you 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.620
 you ever on a slope of degree or 50 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.180
 down like we do now that you 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 Then you don't have to worry about it 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.649
 falls down because of course it stands 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.120
 the scout 30mm higher and he has that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.199
 black plastic bumpers for the extra 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.940
 own look 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.620
 but it's not just a little bit 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.629
 beautiful making as you sometimes do 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.070
 encountered with this type of crossover 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.360
 the skoda octavia scout is also possible 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.650
 actually what and that's why he becomes 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.610
 just come with 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.259
 four wheel drive 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.550
 it is according to the haldex principle 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.740
 so it's not the most advanced 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.060
 form of four-wheel drive but skoda 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.399
 was so kind to our either 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.930
 trail to serve and that does 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.700
 he actually quite nice 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.050
 it's not that tim coronel you will 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.920
 call at times that get stuck together 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.530
 sedan car body 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.850
 but if you now let's say one 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 swampy pasture has to go then that is 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.160
 absolutely no problem 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.539
 another advantage of the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.890
 four-wheel drive is that in the case 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.450
 of the diesel you can also do more 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.520
 so the mass may tow a trailer 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.440
 of 2,000 pounds behind 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.080
 so you move in like a horse trailer 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.520
 a soggy meadow then this is your car 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.450
 but what about added value 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.450
 if you are prepared on asphalt 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.149
 after one on the asphalt and there the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.219
 medical the dutch scouts or it 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.420
 Most of the time they go away 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.009
 actually not that much different feel 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.840
 but with a normal octavia combination 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.520
 it is a little higher injected is therefore 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.170
 that it is more resilient and so I see something 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.399
 comfortable but that difference is not 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.990
 very big 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.579
 so guess that code is targeted or 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.500
 that driving comfort that his car quite 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.939
 easy also gives bad roads 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.439
 drive you do not feel so much 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.579
 minute really nice 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.649
 because he is comfortable 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.030
 but not a week so also with you the bend 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.069
 enters or not you directly to the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.209
 exterior finish less berm so 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.489
 actually that is very good 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.260
 succeeded and actually all normal 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.760
 benefits of the normal combi also go 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.140
 up for the scout that means in whole 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.420
 spacious rear seats have a very large one 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.590
 luggage room where six minutes standard 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.079
 enter 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.670
 yes or long distance car so on vacation 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.090
 just goes very nice car 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.090
 to travel in 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.610
 we by offer that is very much 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.709
 well-organized schools choose to 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.420
 introduce him with 2 diesels and one 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.799
 gasoline engine and in the Netherlands we get 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.930
 so texas diesel not so the choice 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.489
 is limited to two 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.739
 a machine and a diesel is the diesel 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.330
 a 2 liter tdi 150hp coupled to one 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.890
 manual six-speed gearbox and the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.430
 gasoline engine of my driving that is one 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.010
 live 8 tsi with 180 hp and standard dsg 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.420
 and 180 hp which is quite a lot of mark 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.579
 This octavia scout best under smooth 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.989
 car but more than the raw power is the 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.489
 taizÃ© way will do its job 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.859
 basically what you remember it all 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.599
 so terribly naturally low 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.040
 which caught more beautiful object in one 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.750
 pass through their speed limiter without 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.400
 murmur without noise than me whole 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.560
 Obviously it got whole 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.329
 A lot of rest comes on board of course 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.620
 in part by those 6-speed DSG with 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.129
 double link is I am very sorry 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.260
 fast 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.030
 actually unnoticed and also from it on 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.290
 the right moment you are always in the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.549
 good gear without you 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.450
 notes 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.739
 then adjust the very well with it 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.329
 comfortable chassis so if 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.220
 long-distance cruising is just this one 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.709
 very successful car 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.030
 and yet that range of engines is what it 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.030
 weak point shape of this scout 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.160
 problem in the engine range of the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.840
 skoda octavia scout does not swear so much 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.130
 in the free now itself because they are 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.020
 otherwise fine but they are both 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.850
 fairly potent engines and engines 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.260
 are still off expensive in Netherlands 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.210
 hence this octavia was a scout 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.700
 is available from or more than 35,000 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.230
 euro and that is a lot of money and you have 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.620
 although a very reasonably equipped 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.150
 car 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.740
 but if you have a similar one 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.060
 motorized and equipped octavia 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.040
 If you are a combi you will soon see a few 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.720
 a thousand euros cheaper and you take it 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.920
 less powerful powertrain key 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.240
 the netherlands also still more than sufficient 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.130
 is then runs it just goes on 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.260
 further to your question is not so much 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.060
 This octavia scout has added value because 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.830
 that you have the question is will 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.580
 the Dutch consumer there is so high 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.580
 more price for paying
