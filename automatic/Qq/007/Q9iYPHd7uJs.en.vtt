are<00:01:31.749> probably<00:01:32.079> longer<00:01:32.319> than<00:01:32.469> we<00:01:32.709> actually

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
are probably longer than we actually

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.399 
are probably longer than we actually
want<00:01:33.249> them<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:34.299> what<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.539> do<00:01:34.749> is<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.139> take

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
parallel take your oblique cutters give

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.569 
parallel take your oblique cutters give
a<00:01:40.929> little<00:01:41.200> snippet<00:01:41.529> as<00:01:41.859> the<00:01:42.039> length<00:01:42.279> that<00:01:42.459> you

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
a little snippet as the length that you

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.879 
a little snippet as the length that you
want<00:01:42.789> them<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.939> be<00:01:43.179> once<00:01:43.869> again<00:01:44.200> hold<00:01:44.499> onto<00:01:44.679> the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
end of your wire and we have the basic

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.279 
end of your wire and we have the basic
form<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.969> now<00:01:49.090> we<00:01:49.149> have<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.689> do<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.109> use<00:01:50.259> our

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
form and now we have to do is use our

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.260
