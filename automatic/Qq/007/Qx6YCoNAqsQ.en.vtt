00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
good day it's got with what edge and

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140 
good day it's got with what edge and
today<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.830> are<00:00:10.950> looking<00:00:11.070> at<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> premier<00:00:11.820> stone

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
today we are looking at a premier stone

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.350 
today we are looking at a premier stone
crystal<00:00:12.870> coast<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.700> hope<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.120> tell

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
crystal coast and I hope you can tell

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.080 
crystal coast and I hope you can tell
from<00:00:15.890> this<00:00:16.890> shot<00:00:17.220> right<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.789> can<00:00:17.880> kind

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
from this shot right here you can kind

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.210 
from this shot right here you can kind
of<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> gradation<00:00:19.470> from<00:00:19.500> here<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
of see the gradation from here and the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.580 
of see the gradation from here and the
shallow<00:00:20.490> end<00:00:20.960> towards<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.020> deeper<00:00:22.320> end<00:00:22.470> down

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
shallow end towards the deeper end down

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.679 
shallow end towards the deeper end down
there<00:00:22.650> how<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.910> gets<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.420> little

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
there how you see this gets a little

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.200 
there how you see this gets a little
deeper<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:26.359> tone<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.720> an<00:00:28.050> orange<00:00:28.410> color

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
deeper in tone or an orange color

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.269 
deeper in tone or an orange color
because<00:00:30.210> that's<00:00:30.539> what<00:00:30.779> happens<00:00:31.109> when<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
because that's what happens when you you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.100 
because that's what happens when you you
go<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> shallow<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.149> deep<00:00:33.300> deeper<00:00:33.899> part

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
go from the shallow the deep deeper part

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.920 
go from the shallow the deep deeper part
of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> pool<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.360> deeper<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> water<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
of the pool the deeper the water the the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.310 
of the pool the deeper the water the the
darker<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> color<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.780> hoping<00:00:40.050> again

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
darker the color and I'm hoping again

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.940 
darker the color and I'm hoping again
you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.800> play<00:00:41.160> out<00:00:42.559> in<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.770> video

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you can see that play out in this video

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.979 
you can see that play out in this video
from<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.789> angle<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:47.629> primeira<00:00:48.629> stone<00:00:48.840> what

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
from this angle and primeira stone what

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
from this angle and primeira stone what
is<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.620> those<00:00:49.770> folks<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.460> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
is it for those folks that like that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.410 
is it for those folks that like that
aggregate<00:00:51.210> look<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
aggregate look but they don't like the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.360 
aggregate look but they don't like the
texture<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.750> pebble<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.190> first

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
texture of the pebble so when you first

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.400 
texture of the pebble so when you first
walk<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.210> you're<00:00:57.510> looking<00:00:57.809> down

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.569 

you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.160> an<00:01:02.280> aggregate

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you know you get you get an aggregate

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.189 
you know you get you get an aggregate
look<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> almost<00:01:02.969> looks<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.110> we

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
look it almost looks like a like what we

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
look it almost looks like a like what we
call<00:01:04.379> our<00:01:04.530> satin<00:01:04.860> matrix<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.670> small

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
call our satin matrix or the small

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.539 
call our satin matrix or the small
pebble<00:01:06.320> but<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> touch<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.250> it's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
pebble but when you touch it it's it's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
pebble but when you touch it it's it's
polished<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.750> plaster<00:01:10.229> smooth<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
polished you know it's plaster smooth I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.160 
polished you know it's plaster smooth I
really<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.330> premier<00:01:12.720> stone<00:01:12.990> finish

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
really do like this premier stone finish

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.200 
really do like this premier stone finish
I<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> fact<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> down<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> road<00:01:15.060> even

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
I like the fact that down the road even

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.230 
I like the fact that down the road even
a<00:01:15.360> pebble<00:01:15.540> finish<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> become

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
a pebble finish is going to become

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.429 
a pebble finish is going to become
overexposed<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.900> function<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> time

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
overexposed it's just a function of time

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.690 
overexposed it's just a function of time
it's<00:01:19.619> under<00:01:19.830> water<00:01:20.040> that's<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.430> water<00:01:20.580> does

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it's under water that's what water does

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789 
it's under water that's what water does
what<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> primeras<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.200> finish<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.650> don't

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
what the primeras don't finish you don't

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.780 
what the primeras don't finish you don't
have<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> repot<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
have to repot you don't have to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.960 
have to repot you don't have to
replaster<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.049> repolish<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.640> make<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
replaster you can repolish and make it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.149 
replaster you can repolish and make it
brand<00:01:27.180> new<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.560> another<00:01:28.740> feature<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
brand new and this is another feature I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.200 
brand new and this is another feature I
want<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> bring<00:01:29.549> highlight<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> see

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
want to bring highlight to and you see
