00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
that I don't like about this headset and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.190 
that I don't like about this headset and
really<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.459> only<00:02:52.670> thing<00:02:52.940> is<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
really the only thing is that the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.490 
really the only thing is that the
microphones<00:02:54.950> are<00:02:55.220> lacking<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:57.080> I

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
microphones are lacking a bit so I

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.590 
microphones are lacking a bit so I
haven't<00:02:57.980> heard<00:02:58.430> any<00:02:58.670> complaints<00:02:58.760> about

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
haven't heard any complaints about

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.800 
haven't heard any complaints about
people<00:02:59.900> not<00:03:00.170> being<00:03:00.320> able<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.680> hear<00:03:01.010> me<00:03:01.190> but<00:03:01.810> as

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
people not being able to hear me but as

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.570 
people not being able to hear me but as
you'll<00:03:03.140> hear<00:03:03.410> in<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.680> samples<00:03:04.100> the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
you'll hear in the samples the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.990 
you'll hear in the samples the
microphones<00:03:05.090> could<00:03:05.450> be<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:05.810> little<00:03:06.200> bit<00:03:06.380> better

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
microphones could be a little bit better

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.210 
microphones could be a little bit better
so<00:03:08.000> this<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.480> just<00:03:08.600> my<00:03:08.870> opinion<00:03:08.989> go<00:03:09.890> ahead<00:03:10.100> and

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
so this is just my opinion go ahead and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.740 
so this is just my opinion go ahead and
take<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> listen<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.180> can<00:03:11.330> tell<00:03:11.510> me<00:03:11.600> what

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
take a listen and you can tell me what

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.160 
take a listen and you can tell me what
you<00:03:11.840> think<00:03:12.400> all<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.580> all<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.940> think<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.600> rig<00:03:15.019> is

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
you think all in all I think the rig is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.410 
you think all in all I think the rig is
a<00:03:15.200> super<00:03:15.650> solid<00:03:15.920> super<00:03:16.130> versatile<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.209> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
a super solid super versatile and a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.840 
a super solid super versatile and a
really<00:03:17.780> good<00:03:17.989> sounding<00:03:18.350> headset<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.519> if<00:03:19.730> it

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
really good sounding headset so if it

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.160 
really good sounding headset so if it
weren't<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.239> microphones<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.870> would<00:03:20.989> say

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
weren't for the microphones I would say

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.500 
weren't for the microphones I would say
it<00:03:21.290> was<00:03:21.410> pretty<00:03:21.680> much<00:03:21.860> perfect<00:03:22.300> if<00:03:23.300> you're
