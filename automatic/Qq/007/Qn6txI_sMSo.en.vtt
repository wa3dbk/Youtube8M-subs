00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
that is what we're trying to do and this

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.810 
that is what we're trying to do and this
gives<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.260> professional<00:00:54.219> look<00:00:54.460> but<00:00:54.700> it

bags in another video today we're going
to<00:01:21.910> talk<00:01:22.119> about<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.539> wrap<00:01:22.750> because<00:01:23.259> there<00:01:23.560> are

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
to talk about the wrap because there are

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.499 
to talk about the wrap because there are
a<00:01:23.710> lot<00:01:23.830> of<00:01:24.100> options<00:01:24.280> out<00:01:24.610> there<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.210> lot<00:01:25.390> of

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
a lot of options out there and a lot of

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.340 
a lot of options out there and a lot of
sellers<00:01:25.930> use<00:01:26.290> big<00:01:26.850> fancy<00:01:27.850> machines<00:01:28.330> that<00:01:28.930> seal

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
sellers use big fancy machines that seal

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.730 
sellers use big fancy machines that seal
the<00:01:29.560> product<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:31.240> know<00:01:31.360> if<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.840> does<00:01:32.229> a

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
the product and you know if it does a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.520 
the product and you know if it does a
better<00:01:33.189> job<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:34.270> know<00:01:34.390> maybe<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.720> cleaner<00:01:35.170> look

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
better job you know maybe a cleaner look

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.030 
better job you know maybe a cleaner look
but<00:01:36.070> essentially<00:01:36.850> this<00:01:37.479> does<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.409> same<00:01:38.680> thing

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
but essentially this does the same thing

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.740 
but essentially this does the same thing
for<00:01:39.729> such<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:41.159> fraction<00:01:42.159> of<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.520> cost<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.509> if

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
for such a fraction of the cost so if

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.990 
for such a fraction of the cost so if
you<00:01:43.990> are<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:44.439> starting<00:01:44.770> out<00:01:45.040> or<00:01:45.369> if<00:01:45.880> you

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
you are just starting out or if you

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.399 
you are just starting out or if you
don't<00:01:46.180> have<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> lot<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.630> money<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.020> spend<00:01:47.170> on

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
don't have a lot of money to spend on

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.280 
don't have a lot of money to spend on
equipment<00:01:47.950> this<00:01:48.909> would<00:01:49.210> be<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.360> really<00:01:49.900> huge

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
equipment this would be a really huge

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.789
