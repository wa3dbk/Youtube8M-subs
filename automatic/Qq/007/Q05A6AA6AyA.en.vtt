00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that's pretty cool so this is the hobbit

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.439 
that's pretty cool so this is the hobbit
this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.219> Fellowship<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> Ring<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
this is the Fellowship of the Ring I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.729 
this is the Fellowship of the Ring I
think<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.789> elvish<00:00:59.789> maybe<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.530> think

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
think that's elvish maybe and I think

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.579 
think that's elvish maybe and I think
those<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.219> rings<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.000> there's

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
those are like rings and then there's

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.340 
those are like rings and then there's
Sal<00:01:04.589> ron's<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.129> i<00:01:05.489> believe<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
Sal ron's I i believe and then the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
Sal ron's I i believe and then the
circle<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.340> yellow<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
circle is in yellow because this is the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.060 
circle is in yellow because this is the
yellow<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:10.040> um<00:01:11.040> two<00:01:11.549> towers<00:01:11.939> has<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.920> two

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
yellow one um two towers has the two

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.429 
yellow one um two towers has the two
towers<00:01:14.280> over<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.330> red<00:01:15.570> circle<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
towers over there a red circle for the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.359 
towers over there a red circle for the
red<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> return<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.380> king<00:01:19.590> once

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
red and the return of the king once

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
red and the return of the king once
again<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> goal<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> green<00:01:21.299> circle<00:01:21.479> for

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
again the goal of the green circle for

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

yourself so the inside looks like this

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.710 
yourself so the inside looks like this
the<00:03:49.239> date<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.690> on<00:03:50.290> top<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.739> there<00:03:50.980> are<00:03:51.099> five

you<00:03:54.879> keep<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.359> journal<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:55.900> have<00:03:56.079> someone

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
you keep the journal so I have someone

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.050

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
who loves to document things and I used

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.530 
who loves to document things and I used
to<00:03:58.239> keep<00:03:58.449> journals<00:03:58.989> with<00:03:59.549> long<00:04:00.549> entries<00:04:01.269> for

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
to keep journals with long entries for

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.750 
to keep journals with long entries for
every<00:04:01.840> day<00:04:02.019> but<00:04:02.079> you<00:04:02.829> know<00:04:02.980> sometimes<00:04:03.280> life

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
every day but you know sometimes life

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.849 
every day but you know sometimes life
gets<00:04:03.940> busy<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.599> don't<00:04:04.750> have<00:04:04.900> time<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.739> do

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
gets busy and you don't have time to do

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.189 
gets busy and you don't have time to do
that<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:06.579> think<00:04:06.669> this<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.030> perfect<00:04:07.419> if<00:04:07.870> you

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
that so I think this is perfect if you

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.319 
that so I think this is perfect if you
want<00:04:08.319> to<00:04:08.560> keep<00:04:08.709> track<00:04:09.010> of<00:04:09.069> what<00:04:09.609> happens<00:04:10.030> in

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
want to keep track of what happens in

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.920 
want to keep track of what happens in
your<00:04:10.389> life<00:04:10.720> without<00:04:11.199> having<00:04:11.919> to<00:04:12.159> you<00:04:12.519> know

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
your life without having to you know

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.569 
your life without having to you know
have<00:04:13.930> all<00:04:14.229> these<00:04:14.379> books<00:04:14.739> filled<00:04:15.099> with<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.489> many

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
have all these books filled with so many

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.140 
have all these books filled with so many
words<00:04:15.819> that<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.329> probably<00:04:16.949> won't<00:04:17.949> read<00:04:18.669> again

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
words that you probably won't read again

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.120 
words that you probably won't read again
so<00:04:19.659> this<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:20.049> perfect<00:04:20.200> I<00:04:20.620> think<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.010> easiest

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
so this is perfect I think the easiest

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.080 
so this is perfect I think the easiest
way<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.549> remind<00:04:21.849> yourself<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.180> write<00:04:22.419> in<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:22.659> is

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
way to remind yourself to write in it is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.900 
way to remind yourself to write in it is
keep<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.570> at<00:04:24.199> your<00:04:24.470> bedside<00:04:24.680> with<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.550> pen

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
keep it at your bedside with a pen

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.390 
keep it at your bedside with a pen
beside<00:04:26.449> it<00:04:26.600> so<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:26.930> every<00:04:27.230> time<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.949> get

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
beside it so that every time you get

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.760 
beside it so that every time you get
ready<00:04:28.610> for<00:04:28.820> bed<00:04:28.940> at<00:04:29.120> night<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:30.169> see<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.590> and

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
ready for bed at night you see it and

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.710 
ready for bed at night you see it and
then<00:04:31.010> you<00:04:31.669> write<00:04:32.060> down<00:04:32.210> what<00:04:32.360> happened<00:04:32.660> in

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
then you write down what happened in

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.710 
then you write down what happened in
that<00:04:32.750> day<00:04:32.990> because<00:04:33.169> if<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.650> miss<00:04:33.949> like<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:35.150> week

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
that day because if you miss like a week

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.830 
that day because if you miss like a week
or<00:04:36.199> so<00:04:36.800> it's<00:04:37.100> hard<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:37.910> go<00:04:38.210> back<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.600> write

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
or so it's hard to go back and write

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.480 
or so it's hard to go back and write
down<00:04:38.990> what<00:04:39.199> happened<00:04:39.530> because<00:04:39.680> it's<00:04:40.190> hard<00:04:40.400> to

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
down what happened because it's hard to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.060 
down what happened because it's hard to
remember<00:04:40.610> things<00:04:41.150> so<00:04:41.930> it's<00:04:42.199> really<00:04:42.350> important

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
remember things so it's really important

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.520 
remember things so it's really important
to<00:04:43.100> write<00:04:43.449> every<00:04:44.449> night<00:04:44.630> sometimes<00:04:45.290> when<00:04:45.470> you

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
to write every night sometimes when you

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.930 
to write every night sometimes when you
don't<00:04:45.620> feel<00:04:45.800> like<00:04:45.979> writing<00:04:46.160> in<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.520> because<00:04:46.669> it

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
don't feel like writing in it because it

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.460 
don't feel like writing in it because it
was<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.090> crappy<00:04:47.300> day<00:04:47.570> or<00:04:47.780> you<00:04:47.930> don't<00:04:48.110> really<00:04:48.260> do

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470
