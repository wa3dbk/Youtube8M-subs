00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
also comes with a whistle originally it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.999

was attached to the back of the knife

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.749 
was attached to the back of the knife
here<00:01:34.369> I<00:01:34.780> moved<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.350> fire<00:01:36.860> steel<00:01:37.280> and

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
here I moved it to the fire steel and

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.850 
here I moved it to the fire steel and
you<00:01:38.360> can<00:01:38.509> wrap<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:38.720> around<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.290> fire<00:01:39.500> steel

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
you can wrap it around the fire steel

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.760 
you can wrap it around the fire steel
and<00:01:40.450> loop<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.600> through<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.320> doesn't<00:01:42.619> come

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
and loop it through so it doesn't come

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.790 
and loop it through so it doesn't come
off<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:44.180> way<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.720> doesn't<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.050> have<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.770> with

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
off that way it doesn't you have it with

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.649 
off that way it doesn't you have it with
you<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.399> can<00:01:46.580> still<00:01:46.790> use<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:47.180> but<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:47.509> not

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
you you can still use it but it's not

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.230 
you you can still use it but it's not
going<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.869> get<00:01:47.960> him<00:01:48.080> away<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.759> added<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:49.909> loop

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
going to get him away I added this loop

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.370 
going to get him away I added this loop
to<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.200> back<00:01:51.440> end<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.880> because<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:53.840> only

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
to the back end so because it's only

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.990 
to the back end so because it's only
held<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:54.800> with<00:01:55.399> velcro<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:57.369> this<00:01:58.369> may<00:01:58.550> fail<00:01:58.820> at

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
held on with velcro and this may fail at

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.440 
held on with velcro and this may fail at
some<00:01:59.210> point<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.720> wears<00:01:59.929> out<00:02:00.140> eventually<00:02:01.450> this

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
some point it wears out eventually this

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.210 
some point it wears out eventually this
way<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:02.720> can<00:02:02.869> loop<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.289> through<00:02:03.350> your<00:02:03.920> belt

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
way you can loop it through your belt

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.779 
way you can loop it through your belt
and<00:02:04.399> still<00:02:05.149> have<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.450> with<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:06.580> decent<00:02:07.580> sheath

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
and still have it with you decent sheath

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
if your survival situation good knife

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.539 
if your survival situation good knife
holds<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.290> decent<00:03:55.739> edge<00:03:55.859> like<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.190> said<00:03:56.400> the

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
holds a decent edge like I said the

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.170 
holds a decent edge like I said the
blade<00:03:57.090> steals<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.109> little<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.560> soft<00:03:58.890> side

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
blade steals a little on the soft side

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.759 
blade steals a little on the soft side
yet<00:04:00.180> that's<00:04:00.750> just<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.170> it's<00:04:01.319> easier<00:04:01.680> to

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
yet that's just so it's easier to

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.460 
yet that's just so it's easier to
sharpen<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.250> field<00:04:02.489> my<00:04:03.180> one<00:04:03.569> beef<00:04:03.840> coming<00:04:04.230> off

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470
