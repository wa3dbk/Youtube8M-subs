00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and then and then it just looks like

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.670 
and then and then it just looks like
this<00:01:14.750> they<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.780> come<00:01:16.049> down<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> pin

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.000 
up in the air and do that right I think
they<00:02:37.330> just<00:02:37.360> spin<00:02:37.840> but<00:02:38.380> either<00:02:38.470> way<00:02:38.680> they<00:02:38.800> need

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
they just spin but either way they need

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.430 
they just spin but either way they need
really<00:02:39.250> incredibly<00:02:39.790> powerful<00:02:40.480> legs<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:42.580> uh<00:02:43.440> he

trying to make in this seminar was that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.399 
trying to make in this seminar was that
it<00:03:52.400> doesn't<00:03:52.730> require<00:03:52.879> a<00:03:53.269> lot<00:03:53.719> of<00:03:53.750> muscular

this thin young lady who is performing a

this thin young lady who is performing a
sport<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.359> requires<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.750> tremendous<00:04:03.109> amount

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
sport that requires a tremendous amount

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.979 
sport that requires a tremendous amount
of<00:04:03.379> power<00:04:03.680> wasn't<00:04:04.400> getting<00:04:04.849> any<00:04:05.090> bulkier<00:04:05.810> and

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
of power wasn't getting any bulkier and

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.360 
of power wasn't getting any bulkier and
she<00:04:06.439> wasn't<00:04:06.620> getting<00:04:06.709> bulky<00:04:07.129> like<00:04:07.250> the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
she wasn't getting bulky like the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.789 
she wasn't getting bulky like the
football<00:04:07.639> players<00:04:07.879> because<00:04:08.599> she<00:04:09.139> was<00:04:09.469> simply

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
football players because she was simply

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.649 
football players because she was simply
training<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.340> nervous<00:04:10.819> system<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.269> respond

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
training the nervous system to respond

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.749 
training the nervous system to respond
in<00:04:11.959> such<00:04:12.379> a<00:04:12.409> way<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.889> could<00:04:13.480> overcome

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759 
in such a way that it could overcome

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.099 
in such a way that it could overcome
overcome<00:04:16.759> the<00:04:17.150> resistance<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.959> weight

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
overcome the resistance of the weight

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.870 
overcome the resistance of the weight
when<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:18.799> jump<00:04:19.099> it's<00:04:19.280> kind<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.669> same

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
when you jump it's kind of the same

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.969 
when you jump it's kind of the same
thing<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.419> know<00:04:20.539> jumping<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.320> overcoming<00:04:21.859> the

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
thing you know jumping is overcoming the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.339 
thing you know jumping is overcoming the
resistance<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.789> your<00:04:23.270> body<00:04:23.570> weight<00:04:23.870> against

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
resistance of your body weight against

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.070 
resistance of your body weight against
the<00:04:24.500> floor<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.160> in<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:26.270> very<00:04:26.889> powerful<00:04:27.889> or

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
the floor and in a very powerful or

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.540 
the floor and in a very powerful or
time-intensive<00:04:30.080> way<00:04:30.740> so<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.250> difference

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
time-intensive way so the difference

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.480 
time-intensive way so the difference
between<00:04:31.580> like<00:04:31.970> strength<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:32.690> powers<00:04:33.169> that

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
between like strength and powers that

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.870 
between like strength and powers that
time<00:04:34.490> is<00:04:34.910> one<00:04:35.509> of<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:36.460> parameters<00:04:37.460> within<00:04:37.669> the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
time is one of the parameters within the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.390 
time is one of the parameters within the
equation<00:04:38.449> has<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.930> be<00:04:39.020> done<00:04:39.169> quickly<00:04:39.500> right

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
equation has to be done quickly right

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.560 
equation has to be done quickly right
but<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:40.639> need<00:04:40.759> to<00:04:40.820> be<00:04:40.940> really<00:04:41.270> strong<00:04:41.509> in

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
but you need to be really strong in

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.230 
but you need to be really strong in
order<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:42.020> perform<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:43.160> movement<00:04:43.370> quickly<00:04:44.000> so

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
order to perform the movement quickly so

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.080 
order to perform the movement quickly so
anyway<00:04:44.630> my<00:04:44.870> point<00:04:45.110> here<00:04:45.440> is<00:04:45.500> my<00:04:45.979> friend<00:04:46.400> there

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
anyway my point here is my friend there

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.719 
anyway my point here is my friend there
is<00:04:47.270> no<00:04:47.449> need<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.720> gain<00:04:48.259> massive<00:04:49.220> amounts<00:04:49.639> of

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
is no need to gain massive amounts of

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.490 
is no need to gain massive amounts of
bulk<00:04:50.000> in<00:04:50.210> your<00:04:50.419> legs<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:50.900> order<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.139> jump

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
bulk in your legs in order to jump

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.649 
bulk in your legs in order to jump
really<00:04:51.710> high<00:04:51.860> in<00:04:52.760> fact<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.180> can<00:04:53.330> get<00:04:53.449> really

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
really high in fact you can get really

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.950 
really high in fact you can get really
really<00:04:53.870> strong<00:04:54.440> using<00:04:55.099> low<00:04:55.720> repetitions<00:04:56.720> with

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
really strong using low repetitions with

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.129 
really strong using low repetitions with
high<00:04:57.409> weights<00:04:57.770> followed<00:04:58.699> by<00:04:58.970> jumping<00:04:59.780> I<00:04:59.930> mean

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
high weights followed by jumping I mean

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.290 
high weights followed by jumping I mean
that's<00:05:00.349> you<00:05:01.159> get<00:05:01.310> get<00:05:01.669> better<00:05:01.820> at<00:05:01.940> jumping<00:05:02.210> by

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
that's you get get better at jumping by

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.510 
that's you get get better at jumping by
jumping<00:05:02.720> right<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.770> there<00:05:03.919> you<00:05:03.979> have<00:05:04.039> it<00:05:04.310> man

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
jumping right so there you have it man

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.180 
jumping right so there you have it man
so<00:05:04.849> there<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:05.360> is<00:05:05.449> you<00:05:05.780> can<00:05:05.810> gain<00:05:06.199> both<00:05:06.830> things

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
so there it is you can gain both things

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.510 
so there it is you can gain both things
you<00:05:07.400> can<00:05:07.550> have<00:05:07.699> your<00:05:08.240> cake<00:05:08.449> and<00:05:08.479> eat<00:05:08.659> it<00:05:08.840> too

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
you can have your cake and eat it too

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.909 
you can have your cake and eat it too
you<00:05:10.520> can<00:05:10.669> be<00:05:10.789> an<00:05:10.880> Iron<00:05:11.210> Cross<00:05:11.389> er<00:05:11.690> and<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:12.500> dunker

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
you can be an Iron Cross er and a dunker

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.800 
you can be an Iron Cross er and a dunker
done<00:05:14.110> Eliot<00:05:15.110> what
