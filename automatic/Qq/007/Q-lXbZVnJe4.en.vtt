stronger<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.479> what<00:01:39.570> we're<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> be

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
stronger in and what we're going to be

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.480 
stronger in and what we're going to be
weaker<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.829> fix<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> become

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
weaker in and what we can fix to become

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.950 
weaker in and what we can fix to become
stronger<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> replace<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
stronger because when you replace a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.510 
stronger because when you replace a
player<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.280> same

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
player it's not it's not like the same

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280 
player it's not it's not like the same
it's<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> same<00:01:45.720> strata<00:01:46.110> same

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it's not like the same strata same

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690 
it's not like the same strata same
mentality<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.520> bit

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
mentality it's like it's a little bit

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.330 
mentality it's like it's a little bit
different<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.899> alters<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.619> your

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
different it out it alters like your

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.740 
different it out it alters like your
chemistry<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> way<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.390> play<00:01:51.600> together

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
chemistry and the way you play together

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.690 
chemistry and the way you play together
so<00:01:52.200> we're<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> figure<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.579> needs

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so we're going to figure out what needs

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
so we're going to figure out what needs
to<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.909> done<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.240> i<00:01:54.329> think<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.990> think
