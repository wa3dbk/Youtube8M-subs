00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:11.360
 Good day, the first short acquaintance 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.799
 with a smartphone fly iq445 jeunes 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.150
 specifications with which I 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.699
 managed to get acquainted with the next machine 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.990
 on quite reasonable quite reasonable 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.310
 platform from mediatek 6577 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.450
 quite a joke platform i already have with her 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.170
 repeatedly encountered 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.629
 apparently very weak this simple 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.539
 test but nevertheless with different 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:50.250
 480 by 800 not too much 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.850
 impressive 1600 milliamp battery 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850
 o'clock 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.489
 5 megapixel camera with flash but 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.489
 like without autofocus 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:14.909
 get no wonder charging 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:20.000
 headphone cord micro usb even get 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.000
 there will be no paper for the battery 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:35.850
 dual core processor 1 league get a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:42.280
 gigabyte of ram 2 sim cards 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:46.050
 4 gigabytes of built-in flash you will understand 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:52.900
 Think support for micro sd memory cards 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:56.700
 let's turn it on looks looks 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:02.350
 plain black plastic very 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:07.020
 glossy and slippery connectors ordinary 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.020
 three and a half power button 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:17.280
 micro yusbi volume rocker 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.280
 everything in place is no surprise 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:42.709
 two SIM card slots 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:46.730
 a regular sized single adopted nest for 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.730
 memory cards 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.470
 it seems so 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.190
 I'm not ready here 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.530
 This unit is nothing unusual on 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.330
 really wo n't even leave 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:17.630
 for him to compose a full text 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.250
 review but want to measure 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.820
 I want performance as it should 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.800
 test battery but take off 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:33.380
 characteristics need of course all this 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.430
 Of course, you will find these x ones. 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:41.850
 what else is interesting is that 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.700
 despite its cheapness apparatus 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.500
 works on android 4.1 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:56.420
 judging by the description so how to then I 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.420
 add everything later 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.060
 I think I forgot to say about the most 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.370
 interesting about the price 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.549
 about four and a half thousand rubles 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.549
 Total 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:27.050
 agree a year ago about this difficult 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:31.570
 there was nothing that we have before android 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.570
 version 4.1.1 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.400
 to wash over 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.140
 well yes 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.350
 as you will understand you can see your memory 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.090
 but a little 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.470
 as usual 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:05.700
 decent amount of preinstalled 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:06.600
 applications for the first impression completely 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:14.430
 reasonable 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:17.490
 work speed and not really the most 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.740
 bad screen though of course when 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.720
 specific angle of inclination on one side 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.580
 inversion characteristic of cheap dough 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.680
 screens have full growth should I do 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.840
 start learning after a while 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.050
 all information will be on our site 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.050
 Thank you for your attention.
