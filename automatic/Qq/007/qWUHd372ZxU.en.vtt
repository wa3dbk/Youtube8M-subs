00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.510
 Sunday 12 May at the circuit 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 international of viterbo went into 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.410
 scene the second leg of the southern circle 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.150
 of the 2013 malossi trophies to the scooter 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.680
 ematica extreme italia and the scooter 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.900
 armed that of the regions has been added 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.670
 the scootermatic replica category entry 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.600
 level established by the rail service is 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.600
 dedicated to newcomers 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.540
 and the qualifications of the blood scooter 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.250
 extreme italy the reigning champion 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.900
 antonio paduano trims over half 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.640
 second to colella and melon that 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.379
 alongside in the front row complete it 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.360
 hedgehog coviello musella e 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.770
 real with the uncle four times to the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.660
 start paduano retains leadership 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.640
 while curly melon overtakes 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.230
 polella la mancha seems right away one 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.129
 Paduan quiver and imposing melon 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.110
 a hellish rhythm 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.550
 the train breaks and collapses in the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.260
 first bars take the third place 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.490
 front paduano seems to have taken 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.720
 a few meters on melon 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.009
 but the number 21 begins to do 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.259
 record fast repeating laps 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.550
 gradually reducing the curly cat the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.190
 coviello are in fourth and fifth square 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.390
 real musella sixth and seventh front in 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.860
 much less does it test the attack on the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.090
 hairpin but paduan uses 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.680
 at the intersection of the trajectories for 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.509
 bring yourself back to the next lap 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.800
 comes the episode that decides the tip 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.390
 Your have put pressure 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.100
 slips into the first part of the circuit 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.720
 also involving milone though 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.430
 manages to limit the damage and start again 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.289
 at the head followed by colella at two 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.729
 back from the end the number 69 yes 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.950
 at least the second square resumes 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.630
 while melon now wins solo 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.670
 which was a wet track at the start of the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.440
 second run good shot for paduano 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.910
 but unbelievable departure for today four 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.259
 times of real that turns into second 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.970
 position after shooting 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.679
 from the last box the team driver 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.330
 of ps even leads to the command 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.069
 already during the first round of the event 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.810
 historical for the circus of the lossy problem 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.399
 the glory for real however lasts only one 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.289
 around the hairpin loses control 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.179
 of the half slips and I leave in fifth 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.860
 location but the man and melon have so 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.429
 go ahead and like in race 1 they play 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.990
 victory 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.849
 the two exchange positions more 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.679
 sometimes melon is faster in the stretch 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.390
 start of the track while Paduan yes 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.009
 reports systematically to the command 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.750
 in the final corners at mid-race 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.819
 Melon tries to attack but Paduan closes 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.440
 the door number 21 from this moment 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.120
 then the grip is released but the man seems 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.620
 determined to bring home the victory 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.810
 colella meanwhile has moved into the third 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.190
 position bypassing real and with this 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.390
 ranking will get the flag to 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.459
 Paduan chess crosses the finish line 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.959
 preceding milone and colella and in the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.239
 sum even the victory in race 2 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.670
 gives the Viterbo stop at number 69 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.210
 if this year is much more difficult 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.000
 of the other years 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.520
 I found very competitive opponents 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.610
 this year 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.640
 so what to say about my first victory 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.680
 of the year is very important for me 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.530
 first tender 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.799
 I was with half a wrist injury 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.610
 fractured so had difficulty 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.440
 now instead I have struggled a little but 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.200
 I managed to win this is it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.790
 I would like to dedicate so much to my victory 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.720
 father who is gone now come to 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.400
 fail to fail in December too 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.410
 I would like to dedicate it to my mother today 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.840
 my mother's day endured with me 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.530
 it is seen that brought him luck 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.980
 then I dedicate it to her to kiss her 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.030
 all 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.030
 see you in sarno 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.190
 after having dominated the first stage of 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.470
 airola luciano formisano signs the pole 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.610
 position on the Viterbo track 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.200
 bastard and andrea who flank it in 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.520
 however, the first row was marked chrono 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.090
 very interesting and promise 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.709
 battle 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.900
 the first race starts and the poleman does 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.670
 fluttering silent, basking, takes advantage of it 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.440
 and turns to the command at the first corner on 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.120
 head train and well defined while a 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.690
 center group silota fiercely for a 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.340
 placing 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.930
 just three laps and formisano breaks the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.700
 delay taking the lead and years of 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.590
 stripped behind them fighting for the 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.300
 third place between d'andrea and at the nodes 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.220
 while tognarelli palomba and marino are 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.750
 slightly delayed, a few laps pass 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.760
 and andrea dangerously approaches a 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.410
 kneading formisano so much that in the seventh 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.940
 ride on the straight downhill section 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.510
 easily wins the second 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.640
 position 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.780
 however the three remain very close to and 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.730
 half of the race begins 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.200
 prick formisano the veteran of the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.910
 Malossi trophies, however, do not break down 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.680
 claiming all his experience 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.450
 systematically closes the door to each 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.430
 attack of young team bearers 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.410
 the four of Bari from the end 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.060
 bastard slips lose a position in 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.470
 in favor of the nights and so leaves from 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.959
 andrea formisano to play for the victory 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.250
 private street despite not looking like a patch 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.660
 repulses the blow on blow to the attacks 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.419
 by andrea up to the checkered flag 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.400
 making his race 1 a of nights and third in 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.810
 race 2 we start with the sun but the asphalt is 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.250
 made insidious by the sudden 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.090
 downpour arrived a few minutes earlier 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.650
 of the street 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.510
 now misano starts well but better than him 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.950
 st d'andrea but immediately slips to the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.780
 first corner starting last 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.610
 position the large group in front of the 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.229
 first curves very compact and from this 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.790
 tognarelli emerges who really looks like a 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.380
 comfortable on the wet track 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.360
 number 19 on the first lap 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.890
 commands on formisano marine coach 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.050
 cirillo and all the others 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.580
 coccia slips on the second lap as well as 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.900
 once again to andrea che 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.640
 compromises the beautiful comeback carried out 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.560
 in a few faults from the last to the second 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.479
 tognarelli place takes off 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.610
 formisano very hot in the early rounds is 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.169
 second while marine is attacked in 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.240
 bottom straight from cirillo to the third 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.890
 after a while the two are overcome 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.280
 to knead adinofi that are large 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.169
 vamp 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.090
 they are now playing for the podium 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.530
 so we come to the final lines with 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.910
 the crown rings with the victory one 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.710
 great performance in the wet 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.510
 second formisano can celebrate the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.860
 stage win at nights wins the 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.440
 duel with bastard and of and I think 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.750
 pretty good if i put it all up for 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.750
 make a good race and nothing I've done 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.090
 this boom for 23 days 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.970
 being able to take the good step of 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.840
 calais of the track and I have nothing 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.630
 made even now 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.810
 the dedication is the whole team again 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.330
 formisano and all the mothers that mine 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.850
 mom is not there but she is close to me too 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.850
 now thanks to the next one 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.530
 in the replica large blood scooters 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.510
 time in qualifying for Luigi relative 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.460
 with casey and the real wild card in 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.230
 second and third place to complete the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.880
 bindi and sosa grill 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.470
 at the end of the race 1 traffic light 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.419
 that everyone burns and takes the lead 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.040
 at the first corner, however, it comes along the 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.660
 real and easily slips it on 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.070
 goal of the first real round commands 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.930
 su casey who tries the attack on the first one 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.250
 curve took measurements and risks 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.410
 even to stop the treads 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.790
 to draw a position and relatives who 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.980
 thus conquers the second square 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.419
 a few more pd and sosa pass a pair 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.950
 of turns and relative of tries to mend 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.020
 the tear and try the attack on the 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.669
 surreal hairpin number 39 arrives 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.560
 but for a long time the real and let it slip away 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.669
 crosses the trajectories and maintains the 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.780
 head of the race 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.060
 halfway through the race the trio is enough 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.830
 near royal commands his relative and casey 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.690
 while sosa and bini are in the fourth and 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.400
 fifth place at the eighth lap relative 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.169
 in the heat of recovering surreal meters 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.880
 runs into a slip coming out of the 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.680
 hairpin stands up promptly for 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.580
 resume the race but its zip is not 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.200
 of the same opinion 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.850
 the positions do not vary up to 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.919
 checkered flag and alle wins over casey 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.479
 sosa and children a shower of rain 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.340
 complicates life and drivers in race 2 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.020
 real casey start well while i 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.220
 relatives and third in the first corner review 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.140
 immediately in second place 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.610
 conditions are critical the pilots yes 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.380
 they rely on prudence excepting 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.510
 for relative who pushes strong and yes 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.130
 the real number 39 approaches 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.419
 even in the lead on the third lap e 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.070
 appears able to stretch without 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.020
 relative problems with that but an error 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.760
 at the end of the fourth lap it slips and 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.860
 restart in second position in front 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.240
 real administers his advantage while 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.710
 that exist and bindi seem 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.510
 settle for the third quarter e 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.740
 fifth position the ranking yes 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.510
 crystallizes up to the flag a 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.490
 royal chess wins in front of relative 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.080
 that exists and bindi in the sum of 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.789
 marsh the real wild card does not take 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.220
 points the category win goes therefore 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.620
 cases follow sindi bindi and kin is 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.750
 been difficult 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.540
 race 1 went well 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.940
 race 2 was wet and I didn't have tires 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.600
 suitable, however, we did well 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.600
 absolutely right
