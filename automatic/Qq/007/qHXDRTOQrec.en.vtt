translation<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:16.960> so<00:02:17.050> we<00:02:17.170> hope<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:17.560> he's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
translation and so we hope that he's

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.470 
translation and so we hope that he's
translating<00:02:18.400> correctly<00:02:18.730> we<00:02:19.150> don't<00:02:19.360> know

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
translating correctly we don't know

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.000 
translating correctly we don't know
because<00:02:19.630> sometimes<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.200> translation<00:02:20.800> things

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
because sometimes in translation things

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.760 
because sometimes in translation things
happen<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.670> he<00:02:21.820> capitalizes<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.050> name<00:02:23.290> all

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
happen but he capitalizes the name all

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.260 
happen but he capitalizes the name all

all this the Dead Sea Scrolls manuscript
evidence<00:02:37.540> are<00:02:37.660> coming<00:02:37.930> into<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.170> Bible<00:02:38.320> now

evidence are coming into the Bible now
and<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.920> think<00:02:38.950> that's<00:02:39.520> good<00:02:39.850> for<00:02:39.880> some<00:02:40.270> things

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
and I think that's good for some things

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.630 
and I think that's good for some things

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
conspiratorial type mindset right right

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.560 
conspiratorial type mindset right right
and<00:05:14.440> even<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:15.099> translations<00:05:15.910> have<00:05:16.000> something

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
and even the translations have something

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.100

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
or to change the Bible right we'll talk

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.870 
or to change the Bible right we'll talk
about<00:05:23.530> that<00:05:23.650> when<00:05:23.800> we<00:05:23.889> come<00:05:24.099> back<00:05:24.280> but<00:05:24.520> it's

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
about that when we come back but it's

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.020 
about that when we come back but it's
kind<00:05:25.060> of<00:05:25.090> interesting<00:05:25.389> that<00:05:26.289> I<00:05:26.910> don't<00:05:27.910> know

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
kind of interesting that I don't know

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.200 
kind of interesting that I don't know
why<00:05:28.270> man<00:05:28.720> would<00:05:29.440> even<00:05:29.770> think<00:05:30.190> that<00:05:30.940> he<00:05:31.120> would

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
why man would even think that he would

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.940 
why man would even think that he would
have<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:31.479> tap<00:05:31.870> her<00:05:32.020> with<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.260> Bible<00:05:32.590> I<00:05:32.830> mean

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
have to tap her with the Bible I mean

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.320

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.659 
you take the Constitution United States
for<00:05:34.450> example<00:05:34.479> and<00:05:35.229> it's<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:36.520> know<00:05:36.550> two

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
for example and it's you know two

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:37.980 
for example and it's you know two
totally<00:05:37.120> different<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.450> work<00:05:37.570> God<00:05:37.750> because

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
totally different the work God because

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.080 
totally different the work God because
that's<00:05:38.139> inspired<00:05:38.560> obviously<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:39.910> wasn't

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
that's inspired obviously that wasn't

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.439 
that's inspired obviously that wasn't
you<00:05:40.690> know<00:05:40.810> we<00:05:40.990> used<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.560> word<00:05:42.060> men<00:05:43.060> were

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
you know we used the word men were

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.540 
you know we used the word men were
inspired<00:05:43.960> to<00:05:44.110> write<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.710> Constitution<00:05:45.430> but

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
inspired to write the Constitution but

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.070 
inspired to write the Constitution but
it's<00:05:45.669> not<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:45.849> same<00:05:45.970> inspiration<00:05:46.419> and<00:05:46.990> we're

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
it's not the same inspiration and we're

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.000 
it's not the same inspiration and we're
talking<00:05:47.349> about<00:05:48.599> but<00:05:49.620> every<00:05:50.620> time<00:05:50.740> we<00:05:50.800> have<00:05:50.979> a

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
talking about but every time we have a

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.730 
talking about but every time we have a
Supreme<00:05:51.580> Court<00:05:51.880> or<00:05:52.090> are<00:05:52.810> individuals<00:05:53.440> they

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
Supreme Court or are individuals they

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.879 
Supreme Court or are individuals they
all<00:05:53.889> interpret<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:55.210> Constitution<00:05:55.990> their<00:05:56.680> way

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
all interpret the Constitution their way

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.120 
all interpret the Constitution their way
and<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.870> I<00:05:58.930> can<00:05:58.990> really<00:05:59.260> do<00:05:59.530> it<00:05:59.620> you<00:06:00.039> know

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
and you and I can really do it you know

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.589 
and you and I can really do it you know
I<00:06:00.310> don't<00:06:00.370> get<00:06:00.729> that<00:06:00.910> out<00:06:01.090> of<00:06:01.120> that<00:06:01.360> but<00:06:01.510> the

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
I don't get that out of that but the

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.710 
I don't get that out of that but the
difference<00:06:01.930> is<00:06:02.050> they're<00:06:02.710> in<00:06:02.860> power<00:06:03.419> and<00:06:04.419> when

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
difference is they're in power and when

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.540 
difference is they're in power and when
they<00:06:04.840> interpret<00:06:05.349> it<00:06:05.500> we<00:06:06.099> have<00:06:06.280> to<00:06:06.400> follow

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
they interpret it we have to follow

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.950 
they interpret it we have to follow
their<00:06:06.880> interpretation<00:06:07.479> you<00:06:07.539> notice<00:06:07.810> that

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
their interpretation you notice that

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.790 
their interpretation you notice that
with<00:06:08.080> the<00:06:08.139> supreme<00:06:08.380> court<00:06:08.650> or<00:06:08.740> whatever
