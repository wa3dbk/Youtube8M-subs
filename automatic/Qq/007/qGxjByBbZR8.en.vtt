00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to run TouchWiz you can run s4 wrong on

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.110 
to run TouchWiz you can run s4 wrong on
your<00:02:04.650> Nexus<00:02:05.010> 4<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.430> let<00:02:05.610> me<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:05.730> what<00:02:06.030> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
think as far as performance battery life

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.690 
think as far as performance battery life
it's<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.850> comparable<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:10.700> CM

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it's going to be comparable to a CM

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.570 
it's going to be comparable to a CM
