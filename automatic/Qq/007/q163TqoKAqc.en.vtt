has Ho tools I need to work on this

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.230 
has Ho tools I need to work on this
thing<00:02:07.579> that<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:07.729> don't<00:02:07.999> already<00:02:08.210> have<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:10.240> this

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
thing that I don't already have so this

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.420 
thing that I don't already have so this
probably<00:02:11.570> doesn't<00:02:11.750> look<00:02:12.140> all<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.680> clean<00:02:13.040> but

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
probably doesn't look all that clean but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.130 
probably doesn't look all that clean but
compared<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:13.909> the<00:02:14.090> sludge<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.510> buildup<00:02:15.110> that

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
compared to the sludge and buildup that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.100 
compared to the sludge and buildup that
was<00:02:15.440> on<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.860> thing<00:02:16.069> it's

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
was on this thing it's

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.190 
was on this thing it's
I<00:02:17.200> think<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.530> really<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.250> clean<00:02:18.490> now<00:02:19.200> get

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
I think it really really clean now get

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.470 
I think it really really clean now get
in<00:02:20.440> here<00:02:20.920> close<00:02:21.190> where<00:02:21.550> it's<00:02:21.670> easy<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:21.970> see<00:02:22.270> but

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
in here close where it's easy to see but

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.510 
in here close where it's easy to see but
yeah<00:02:22.720> that's<00:02:22.840> rock<00:02:23.290> cast<00:02:23.590> iron<00:02:23.980> now<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.370> was

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
yeah that's rock cast iron now that was

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.200 
yeah that's rock cast iron now that was
this<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.540> had<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:26.020> like<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> nearly<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:28.120> know

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
those in the parts washer but um make

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.970 
those in the parts washer but um make
sure<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:40.750> got<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> block<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:41.740> pay<00:02:41.920> in

and then Barbara spent a bunch of time
out<00:03:25.000> here<00:03:25.030> at<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.140> parts<00:03:26.440> washer<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:28.410> bunch

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
out here at the parts washer so a bunch

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.199 
out here at the parts washer so a bunch
of<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.590> accessory<00:03:30.130> parts<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.760> were<00:03:30.940> pulled

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
of the accessory parts that were pulled

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.250 
of the accessory parts that were pulled
off<00:03:33.360> got<00:03:34.360> scrubbed<00:03:34.720> pretty<00:03:34.930> good<00:03:35.110> in<00:03:35.200> the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
off got scrubbed pretty good in the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.520 
off got scrubbed pretty good in the
parts<00:03:35.560> washer<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:37.750> start<00:03:38.019> going<00:03:38.260> through

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
parts washer and can start going through

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.990 
parts washer and can start going through
and<00:03:38.709> rebuilding<00:03:39.190> what<00:03:39.310> we<00:03:39.430> need<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.670> rebuild

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
and rebuilding what we need to rebuild

and rebuilding what we need to rebuild
and<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:41.170> replacing<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:41.890> stuff<00:03:42.130> I<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.549> found

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
and and replacing and stuff I I found

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.250 
and and replacing and stuff I I found
one<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.630> these<00:03:43.780> fuel<00:03:44.410> lines<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:46.080> one<00:03:47.080> of<00:03:47.140> the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
one of these fuel lines that one of the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.350 
one of these fuel lines that one of the
fittings<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.709> ends<00:03:48.220> was<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:49.209> would

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
fittings and ends was like it would

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.970 
fittings and ends was like it would
rotate<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.350> shouldn't<00:03:50.560> be<00:03:50.620> able<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.860> do

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
rotate it and it shouldn't be able to do

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.800 
rotate it and it shouldn't be able to do
our<00:03:51.160> sorry<00:03:51.459> when<00:03:51.760> he's<00:03:51.910> all<00:03:52.060> pumping<00:03:52.540> yeah

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
our sorry when he's all pumping yeah

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.070 
our sorry when he's all pumping yeah
look<00:03:52.989> at<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.760> spins<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.660> is

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
look at that that spins that that is

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.370 
look at that that spins that that is
probably<00:03:56.620> another<00:03:57.100> leak<00:03:57.370> source<00:03:57.700> so<00:03:58.200> I'll<00:03:59.200> to

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
probably another leak source so I'll to

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.740 
probably another leak source so I'll to
replace<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.890> oil<00:04:00.280> cooler<00:04:00.580> line<00:04:03.360> yeah<00:04:04.360> just

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
going through stuff the motor mounts

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.940 
going through stuff the motor mounts
will<00:04:06.220> get<00:04:06.370> replaced<00:04:06.640> with<00:04:07.650> some<00:04:08.650> heavy-duty

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
will get replaced with some heavy-duty

replacement pulleys out there but
they<00:04:30.410> don't<00:04:30.560> quite<00:04:30.770> look<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:30.980> same<00:04:31.250> as<00:04:31.400> the

they don't quite look the same as the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.070 
they don't quite look the same as the
stock<00:04:31.760> one<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.210> thought<00:04:32.540> this<00:04:32.690> was<00:04:32.870> kind<00:04:33.050> of

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
stock one I thought this was kind of

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.330 
stock one I thought this was kind of
cool<00:04:33.260> this<00:04:33.320> is<00:04:33.470> one<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.740> first<00:04:33.950> parts<00:04:34.220> I

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
cool this is one of the first parts I

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.580 
cool this is one of the first parts I
saw<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.610> was<00:04:34.730> actually<00:04:35.030> out<00:04:35.150> sourced<00:04:35.600> at<00:04:36.470> the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
saw that was actually out sourced at the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.840 
saw that was actually out sourced at the
Magna<00:04:36.950> logo<00:04:37.280> on<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:38.770> but<00:04:41.080> yeah<00:04:42.850> accessory

there with a small brush and clean some
of<00:04:50.660> these<00:04:50.780> up<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:51.170> we'll<00:04:51.290> paint<00:04:51.890> that

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
of these up and we'll paint that

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.570 
of these up and we'll paint that
flywheel<00:04:53.540> cover<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:54.200> some<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:55.220> stuff

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
flywheel cover and some of that stuff

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.680 
flywheel cover and some of that stuff
but<00:04:57.220> yeah<00:04:58.220> well<00:04:58.550> pump<00:04:58.820> gears<00:04:59.120> come<00:04:59.390> out<00:04:59.510> of<00:04:59.600> it

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
but yeah well pump gears come out of it

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.980 
but yeah well pump gears come out of it
there<00:05:00.670> anyway<00:05:01.670> that's<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.390> update<00:05:02.690> on<00:05:02.720> the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
there anyway that's the update on the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.790 
there anyway that's the update on the
Buick<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:04.930> don't<00:05:05.930> know<00:05:06.020> next<00:05:06.320> color<00:05:06.500> oh<00:05:06.620> yeah

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
Buick I don't know next color oh yeah

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.950 
Buick I don't know next color oh yeah
here's<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.040> intake<00:05:07.370> manifold<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:08.000> where<00:05:08.870> the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
here's the intake manifold it where the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.170 
here's the intake manifold it where the
upper<00:05:09.200> plenum<00:05:09.380> anyway<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:10.040> think<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.850> intakes

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
upper plenum anyway I think the intakes

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.370 
upper plenum anyway I think the intakes
still<00:05:11.420> over<00:05:11.600> there<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.870> parts<00:05:12.110> washer

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.900 

yeah<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.410> think<00:05:15.530> this<00:05:15.770> PCB<00:05:16.130> was<00:05:16.370> a<00:05:16.430> big<00:05:16.640> part<00:05:16.880> of

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
yeah I think this PCB was a big part of

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.370 
yeah I think this PCB was a big part of
our<00:05:17.000> problem<00:05:17.210> too<00:05:17.540> I<00:05:17.570> need<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:17.900> replace<00:05:18.170> that

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
our problem too I need to replace that

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.280 
our problem too I need to replace that
with<00:05:18.620> one<00:05:18.800> that's<00:05:19.750> prepared<00:05:20.750> for<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.110> boost

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
with one that's prepared for the boost

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.570 
with one that's prepared for the boost
that<00:05:21.500> we're<00:05:21.620> running<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:22.070> think<00:05:22.250> that<00:05:22.460> was

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
that we're running I think that was

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.060 
that we're running I think that was
pushing<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:22.940> lot<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.300> oil<00:05:23.510> out<00:05:24.070> actually

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
pushing a lot of the oil out actually

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.570 
pushing a lot of the oil out actually
saw<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.730> timing<00:05:26.000> cover<00:05:26.330> gasket<00:05:26.960> was

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
saw that the timing cover gasket was

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.250 
saw that the timing cover gasket was
blown<00:05:28.580> out<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.270> lot<00:05:29.480> of<00:05:29.630> places<00:05:29.840> around<00:05:30.020> the

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
blown out and a lot of places around the

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.010 
blown out and a lot of places around the
timing<00:05:30.650> cover<00:05:30.860> but<00:05:31.490> here's<00:05:32.270> our<00:05:32.390> heads<00:05:32.600> just

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
timing cover but here's our heads just

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.450 
timing cover but here's our heads just
got<00:05:33.170> those<00:05:33.320> back<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.740> machine<00:05:34.010> shop<00:05:34.220> on

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
got those back to the machine shop on

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.610 
got those back to the machine shop on
Friday<00:05:34.960> they<00:05:36.550> did<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.580> valve<00:05:37.790> job<00:05:37.940> I<00:05:38.540> put<00:05:39.500> new

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.970 
replacing the timing chain no matter
what<00:06:53.350> but<00:06:54.760> yeah<00:06:55.760> we'll<00:06:56.290> see<00:06:57.290> we<00:06:57.410> can<00:06:57.590> do<00:06:57.710> for<00:06:57.950> a
