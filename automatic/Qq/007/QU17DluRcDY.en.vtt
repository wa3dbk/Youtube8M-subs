00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.930

 more help the new good for the one who does not 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.010

 create or not the one that is taking the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.510
 how to tell the heavens in konami is not 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.190

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.780
 saga pro evolution soccer and good has 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.210
 spoken to give the first details 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.619
 about the next installment of the series of 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.570
 the one that she announced at the time 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.479
 will have a renewed graphic engine yes 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.840
 sir they say it will have the graphic engine 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.789
 like the lean today 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.259
 it was not counted that of this new game that 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.020
 it came out that I do not remember the name but that 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.270
 is going to have some graphics 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.979
 instead of coming to help us year 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.259
 a single player I hope there is at least 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.210
 11 says so that we can form a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.829
 team and catch them to the stars that is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 grab for whoever is wrong 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.909
 understood revealed more doubt says let's 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 completely revolutionize the finish 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.130
 graphic and the result will be spectacular 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.649
 concluded good masuda there says it will be 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.209
 something great good for me basically 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.040
 the game is not based on the graphics 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.380
 for me the game 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.230
 the graphic is a part of the game but 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.030
 no 100% of the game is not based 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.010
 graphic for me the gameplay influences 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.720
 much for example mario has a few 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.040
 filthy graphics get disgusting 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.040
 that are not new but have some 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.720
 passable graphics bone not so cool but 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.280
 it has a gameplay that I love and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.460
 many players are still playing it 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.200
 I am playing will be great I hope that 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.820
 improve the gameplay a bit that they 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.500
 still missing to pass the fifa and that 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.400
 go back to being the number one of the games 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.649
 of 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.180
 sports entertainment and good friends 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.460
 I hope you liked this 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.780
 information 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.490
 meditated above if you liked adding the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.020
 favorites 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.780
 if you liked it very much and comment that you 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.090
 it seems this information if you think that you 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.610
 2014 will be good if it should improve 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.470
 a lot in graphic for me in graphics 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.180
 it's fine I do not know I think it's okay 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.770
 but good, they want to improve even more 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.470
 I think in the gameplay tell me your 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.510
 opinion and how good maybe it comes out for 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.410
 the next generation and also for 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.120
 xbox 360 ps3 and pc let's see as if 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.120
