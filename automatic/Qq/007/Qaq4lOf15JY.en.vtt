00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
camera doesn't zoom in fully so you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.240 
camera doesn't zoom in fully so you
can't<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.040> detail<00:01:36.020> but<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
can't see it in detail but it's what you

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.819 
can't see it in detail but it's what you
notice<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.909> short-handled<00:01:39.840> brush<00:01:40.200> which

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
notice it's a short-handled brush which

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.429 
notice it's a short-handled brush which
means<00:01:41.100> you're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:42.000> control

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
means you're going to get more control

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
means you're going to get more control
when<00:01:43.439> you're<00:01:43.649> applying<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.670> opposed<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
when you're applying it as opposed to a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.359 
when you're applying it as opposed to a
long-handled<00:01:45.930> brush<00:01:46.229> which<00:01:46.710> gives<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.159> less

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
long-handled brush which gives you less

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.819 
long-handled brush which gives you less
control<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.229> thing<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.530> we

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
control so that's one thing that we

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.889 
control so that's one thing that we
really<00:01:49.860> wanted<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> focus<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.600> the
