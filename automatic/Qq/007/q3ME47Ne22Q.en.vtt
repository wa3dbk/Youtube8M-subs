be taking a look at something really
awesome<00:00:18.480> which<00:00:19.170> lets<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.619> slide<00:00:20.010> through<00:00:20.369> one

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
awesome which lets you slide through one

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.120 
awesome which lets you slide through one
white<00:00:21.060> blocks<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.070> is

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
white blocks just like this one this is

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.000 
white blocks just like this one this is
green<00:00:23.490> stained<00:00:23.850> clay<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:25.260> also<00:00:25.560> let

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
green stained clay but it will also let

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070 
green stained clay but it will also let
you<00:00:26.189> slide<00:00:26.460> through<00:00:26.820> bedrock<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.570> that's

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
you slide through bedrock and that's

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.349 
you slide through bedrock and that's
where<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.439> coming<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.920> handy<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.119> this

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
where it's coming in handy so how this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
where it's coming in handy so how this
all<00:00:30.570> works<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.320> place<00:00:31.349> down<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> mine<00:00:32.219> cart

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
all works is you place down a mine cart

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.120 
all works is you place down a mine cart
on<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> track<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.750> also<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.110> slided<00:00:35.100> down

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
on the track it can also be slided down

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.540 
on the track it can also be slided down
just<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.899> prefer<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.070> being<00:00:38.399> on

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
just like this but I prefer it being on

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.729 
just like this but I prefer it being on
the<00:00:38.700> track<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.780> need<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.230> track<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the track because you need the track to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.860 
the track because you need the track to
place<00:00:40.980> down<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> mine<00:00:41.550> cart<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.940> first<00:00:42.270> so

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
place down the mine cart at first so

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
place down the mine cart at first so
what<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.340> hop<00:00:44.610> into

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
what you just want to do is hop into

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.779 
what you just want to do is hop into
that<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:45.930> grab<00:00:46.590> yourself<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.250> bow<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.460> an

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that and then grab yourself a bow in an

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.389 
that and then grab yourself a bow in an
arrow<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.469> shoot<00:00:49.860> right<00:00:50.190> into

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
arrow and then just shoot right into

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.660 
arrow and then just shoot right into
down<00:00:51.059> there<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.250> slide<00:00:53.640> right

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
down there and then you will slide right

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.840 
down there and then you will slide right
through<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.670> I'm

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
through so this was just because I'm

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.139 
through so this was just because I'm
flying<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.719> also<00:00:57.989> works<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:59.149> survival

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
flying but this also works in survival

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.110 
flying but this also works in survival
mode<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.480> course<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.410> let<00:01:01.710> me<00:01:01.820> change<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:02.940> game

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
mode of course so let me change my game

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.340 
mode of course so let me change my game
or<00:01:03.480> real<00:01:03.690> quick<00:01:04.250> game<00:01:05.250> mode<00:01:05.519> 0<00:01:06.110> there<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.320> are

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
or real quick game mode 0 there we are

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.460 
or real quick game mode 0 there we are
and<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.490> hop<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> choose<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and then just hop on in and choose the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
and then just hop on in and choose the
minecart<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.700> you're<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
minecart just like that you're going to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300 
minecart just like that you're going to
take<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.110> damage<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.070> that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
take a little bit of damage but that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.850 
take a little bit of damage but that
should<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> big<00:01:15.390> deal<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.680> works

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
should not be a big deal that also works

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.820 
should not be a big deal that also works
with<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.400> bedrock<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.689> let's<00:01:18.930> try<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.470> real

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
with your bedrock so let's try that real

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.510 
with your bedrock so let's try that real
quick<00:01:20.220> game<00:01:21.000> mode<00:01:21.210> 1<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.340> hop<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.520> through<00:01:25.520> ok

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
quick game mode 1 and hop on through ok

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.170 
quick game mode 1 and hop on through ok
and<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.750> through<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:29.220> also<00:01:29.640> works

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and now we are through and it also works

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.649 
and now we are through and it also works
with<00:01:30.570> boats<00:01:31.110> these<00:01:32.100> are<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.759> glitchy<00:01:33.329> but

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
with boats these are kind of glitchy but

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.640 
with boats these are kind of glitchy but
it<00:01:33.960> also<00:01:34.409> acts<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.130> same<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:36.360> shoot<00:01:37.200> into

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it also acts the same just shoot into

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.649 
it also acts the same just shoot into
the<00:01:37.860> boat<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.880> you'll<00:01:39.060> slide<00:01:39.390> right

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the boat and then you'll slide right

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.950 
the boat and then you'll slide right
through<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.850> both<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.880> these<00:01:42.270> work<00:01:42.689> in

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
through so both of these work in

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.340 
through so both of these work in
survival<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.799> course<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.340> i<00:01:45.149> would<00:01:45.840> prefer

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
survival of course and i would prefer

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.889 
survival of course and i would prefer
using<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:47.070> guts<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.000> you're<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.479> low

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
using my guts but if you're really low

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.859 
using my guts but if you're really low
on<00:01:49.170> iron<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> mine<00:01:51.060> cards<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
on iron for the mine cards and for the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109 
on iron for the mine cards and for the
track<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.890> also<00:01:53.070> use<00:01:53.430> these<00:01:53.790> boats

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
track you can also use these boats

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.749 
track you can also use these boats
however<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.290> are<00:01:55.320> glittery<00:01:55.920> sometimes<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
however they are glittery sometimes so

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.719 
however they are glittery sometimes so
be<00:01:57.210> aware<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> might<00:01:59.430> say<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
be aware of that so you might say to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.120 
be aware of that so you might say to
yourself<00:01:59.909> well<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.140> cool<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.649> what<00:02:01.920> can

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
yourself well this is cool but what can

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
yourself well this is cool but what can
i<00:02:02.189> use<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.509> first<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.500> could

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
i use it for so first of all you could

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.190 
i use it for so first of all you could
use<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.159> hop<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.729> into<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> void<00:02:06.540> just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
use it to hop on into the void just

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.219 
use it to hop on into the void just
check<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> search<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.520> 1<00:02:09.149> wide<00:02:09.450> bedrock<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
