when<00:01:26.430> mega<00:01:26.820> rayquaza<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> field<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.140> i

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
when mega rayquaza is on the field and i

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.350 
when mega rayquaza is on the field and i
believe<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.009> disappears<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.790> mega<00:01:30.000> rayquaza

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
believe it disappears what mega rayquaza

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.060 
believe it disappears what mega rayquaza
leaves<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> field<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.380> essentially<00:01:32.009> the

leaves the field so it's essentially the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
leaves the field so it's essentially the

better<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.600> guess<00:01:36.750> actually<00:01:37.320> once<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.680> not

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
better I guess actually once it's not

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.090 
better I guess actually once it's not
really<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> lot<00:01:38.130> better<00:01:38.310> um<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.750> has<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.530> had

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
really a lot better um it has it had

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.219 
really a lot better um it has it had
instead<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.490> making<00:01:41.759> an<00:01:41.880> immune<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.570> makes<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
instead of making an immune it makes it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.230 
instead of making an immune it makes it
neutral<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> works<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.729> types<00:01:45.000> if

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
neutral but it works on more types if

came first and then the mega evolutions
came<00:05:44.729> second<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:45.389> you<00:05:45.780> get<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:45.960> little<00:05:46.080> bit

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
came second so you get a little bit

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.540 
came second so you get a little bit
lower<00:05:46.500> there<00:05:46.710> I<00:05:46.740> kind<00:05:47.099> of<00:05:47.190> like<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.490> how

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
lower there I kind of like that how

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.890 
lower there I kind of like that how
they're<00:05:47.729> doing<00:05:47.789> some<00:05:48.000> more<00:05:48.300> story<00:05:48.630> stuff

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.529 
they're doing some more story stuff
because<00:05:49.139> I<00:05:49.349> guess<00:05:49.800> in<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.280> pokemon<00:05:50.849> it's<00:05:51.360> not

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
because I guess in the pokemon it's not

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.060 
because I guess in the pokemon it's not
really<00:05:51.780> sort<00:05:52.050> of<00:05:52.110> fleshed<00:05:52.380> out<00:05:52.530> as<00:05:52.710> much<00:05:52.860> as<00:05:52.919> I

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
really sort of fleshed out as much as I

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.560

Rayquaza first mega evolution probably

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.430 
Rayquaza first mega evolution probably
most<00:06:06.120> powerful<00:06:06.570> to<00:06:06.660> be<00:06:06.690> honest<00:06:06.990> like<00:06:07.050> looking

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
most powerful to be honest like looking

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.050 
most powerful to be honest like looking
at<00:06:07.500> this<00:06:07.650> thing<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:07.979> mean<00:06:08.130> it's<00:06:08.310> definitely<00:06:08.669> on

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
at this thing I mean it's definitely on

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.820 
at this thing I mean it's definitely on
par<00:06:09.270> with<00:06:09.330> on<00:06:09.630> mega<00:06:09.900> Mewtwo<00:06:10.229> like<00:06:10.500> definitely

par with on mega Mewtwo like definitely
there's<00:06:11.340> no<00:06:11.490> no<00:06:12.000> doubt<00:06:12.300> about<00:06:12.449> it<00:06:12.599> and<00:06:12.930> of

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
there's no no doubt about it and of

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.480 
there's no no doubt about it and of
course<00:06:13.260> I'm<00:06:13.560> sure<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.830> primal<00:06:14.160> forms<00:06:14.400> the

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
course I'm sure the primal forms the

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.950 
course I'm sure the primal forms the
Grand<00:06:14.520> on<00:06:14.789> carragher<00:06:15.180> I'm<00:06:15.360> gonna<00:06:15.539> have<00:06:15.780> some

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
Grand on carragher I'm gonna have some

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.659 
Grand on carragher I'm gonna have some
really<00:06:16.229> ridiculous<00:06:16.800> based<00:06:17.039> at<00:06:17.250> probably<00:06:17.520> like

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
really ridiculous based at probably like

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.879 
really ridiculous based at probably like
seven<00:06:17.849> hundred<00:06:18.000> I'm<00:06:18.539> assuming<00:06:19.020> that<00:06:19.169> some<00:06:19.410> I'm

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
seven hundred I'm assuming that some I'm

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.110 
seven hundred I'm assuming that some I'm
assuming<00:06:20.190> they<00:06:20.250> gonna<00:06:20.400> do<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:20.610> whole<00:06:20.789> base

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
assuming they gonna do the whole base

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.909 
assuming they gonna do the whole base
that<00:06:21.330> increase<00:06:21.690> of<00:06:21.810> 100<00:06:22.199> *<00:06:22.440> sort<00:06:22.710> of<00:06:22.770> thing

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
that increase of 100 * sort of thing

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.260 
that increase of 100 * sort of thing
they<00:06:23.010> do<00:06:23.130> normally<00:06:23.820> with<00:06:23.940> our<00:06:24.060> mega

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
they do normally with our mega

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.029 
they do normally with our mega
evolutions<00:06:24.660> I<00:06:24.810> don't<00:06:25.169> see<00:06:25.260> why<00:06:25.380> they<00:06:25.530> change

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
evolutions I don't see why they change

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.500 
evolutions I don't see why they change
away<00:06:26.220> from<00:06:26.250> that<00:06:26.520> but<00:06:26.820> side<00:06:26.970> yeah<00:06:27.180> that's<00:06:27.419> the
