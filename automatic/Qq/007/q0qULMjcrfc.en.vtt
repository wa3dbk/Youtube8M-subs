when a rose is grafted it took the
variety<00:00:07.830> like<00:00:07.859> piece<00:00:08.490> iceberg<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.719> case

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
variety like piece iceberg in this case

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.169 
variety like piece iceberg in this case
and<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.679> grafted<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> seedling

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
and just grafted it on to a seedling

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.600 
and just grafted it on to a seedling
rose<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:13.019> give<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> root<00:00:13.530> vigor<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.370> top

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
rose to give the root vigor and the top

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.840 
rose to give the root vigor and the top
growth<00:00:14.940> if<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.960> graph<00:00:16.320> died<00:00:16.859> then<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.609> lost

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
growth if that graph died then we lost

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.840 
growth if that graph died then we lost
our<00:00:18.240> named<00:00:18.480> rose<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:19.980> these<00:00:20.100> old<00:00:20.369> types<00:00:20.670> of

our named rose so on these old types of
hybrid<00:00:21.180> tea<00:00:21.359> roses<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.080> had<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.529> was

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
hybrid tea roses what we had to do was

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
hybrid tea roses what we had to do was
protect<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.310> graft<00:00:23.670> Union<00:00:24.150> during<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
protect that graft Union during the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.599 
protect that graft Union during the
winter<00:00:24.869> months<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.769> easiest<00:00:26.010> way<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.279> do

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
winter months the easiest way that do

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.150 
winter months the easiest way that do
that<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.750> take<00:00:27.990> some<00:00:28.230> soil<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:28.830> compost

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
that was just take some soil or compost

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.759 
that was just take some soil or compost
and<00:00:29.730> create<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> man<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.750> soil<00:00:31.019> maybe<00:00:31.230> six<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and create a man to soil maybe six to

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.830 
and create a man to soil maybe six to
eight<00:00:31.859> inches<00:00:32.219> high<00:00:32.460> over<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.329> center<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
eight inches high over the center of the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
eight inches high over the center of the
plant<00:00:34.170> because<00:00:34.590> our<00:00:34.829> goal<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.610> protect

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
plant because our goal was to protect

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.240 
plant because our goal was to protect
this<00:00:36.210> crown<00:00:36.600> down<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> base<00:00:37.590> from

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
this crown down here at the base from

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.160 
this crown down here at the base from
the<00:00:38.370> freezing<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.940> thawing<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.329> winter<00:00:39.629> we

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the freezing and thawing a winter we

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.959 
the freezing and thawing a winter we
would<00:00:40.290> put<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.710> place<00:00:41.100> probably<00:00:41.550> after

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
would put this in place probably after

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.360 
would put this in place probably after
the<00:00:42.059> first<00:00:42.329> frost<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.140> fall<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> then

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the first frost in the fall and then

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
the first frost in the fall and then
we'd<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> remove<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> from<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> rose

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
we'd want to remove it from the rose

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
we'd want to remove it from the rose
come<00:00:46.739> spring<00:00:47.250> probably<00:00:48.000> somewhere<00:00:48.480> around

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
come spring probably somewhere around

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.500 
come spring probably somewhere around

there<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:52.020> type<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.289> material<00:00:52.890> used<00:00:53.129> for

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
there what type of material used for

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.670 
there what type of material used for
mulching<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:54.090> hybrid<00:00:54.420> tea<00:00:54.600> roses<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:55.530> will

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
mulching your hybrid tea roses some will

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
mulching your hybrid tea roses some will
recommend<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> good<00:00:56.670> quality<00:00:56.969> garden

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
recommend just a good quality garden

recommend just a good quality garden
soil<00:00:57.660> some<00:00:58.289> will<00:00:58.440> use<00:00:58.469> compost<00:00:59.129> others<00:01:00.000> will

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
soil some will use compost others will

soil some will use compost others will
use<00:01:00.180> mulch<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.350> problem<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> wood

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
use mulch the problem with the wood

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
use mulch the problem with the wood
mulch<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.760> very<00:01:02.910> light<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.449> airy

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.910 
mulch is that it's very light and airy
and<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.049> may<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> winter

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and you may not get the winter

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
and you may not get the winter
insulation<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.760> need<00:01:05.970> come<00:01:06.930> spring

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
insulation that you need come spring

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.899 
insulation that you need come spring
then<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> question<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.790> with

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
then the question is what do you do with

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.030 
then the question is what do you do with
that<00:01:09.119> mound<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.630> soil<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.229> compost<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that mound of soil or compost that you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
that mound of soil or compost that you
have<00:01:11.280> well<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.210> my<00:01:12.360> case<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:12.960> using

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
have well in my case where I'm using

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.570 
have well in my case where I'm using
compost<00:01:13.650> I'm<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
compost I'm just going to take that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.039 
compost I'm just going to take that
material<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.390> gonna<00:01:15.479> spread<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> out

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
material I'm just gonna spread it out

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 
material I'm just gonna spread it out
along<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> garden<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.159> then<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:17.729> come<00:01:17.970> back

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
along the garden and then I'll come back

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.999 
along the garden and then I'll come back
and<00:01:18.360> put<00:01:18.509> another<00:01:18.630> layer<00:01:18.840> mulch<00:01:19.380> over<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> top

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and put another layer mulch over the top

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.770 
and put another layer mulch over the top
that<00:01:20.549> organic<00:01:21.060> matter<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.450> help<00:01:21.630> improve

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that organic matter will help improve

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.740 
that organic matter will help improve
the<00:01:22.110> soil<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.820> give<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:24.030> extra<00:01:24.360> nutrients

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the soil and give some extra nutrients

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
the soil and give some extra nutrients
to<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.020> plants<00:01:25.580> well<00:01:26.580> when<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.820> comes<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to the plants well when it comes to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.789 
to the plants well when it comes to
getting<00:01:27.390> ready<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> winter<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.650> our

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
getting ready for the winter with our

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
getting ready for the winter with our
easy<00:01:28.979> care<00:01:29.340> roses<00:01:29.790> they're<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
easy care roses they're really the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.960 
easy care roses they're really the
answer<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.829> absolutely<00:01:32.100> nothing

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
answer is we do absolutely nothing

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.090 
answer is we do absolutely nothing
most<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.810> these<00:01:33.930> roses<00:01:34.229> are<00:01:34.560> grown<00:01:34.799> when<00:01:34.979> we

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
most of these roses are grown when we

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
most of these roses are grown when we
call<00:01:35.310> their<00:01:35.460> own<00:01:35.490> roots<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.210> other<00:01:36.360> words

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
call their own roots so in other words

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
call their own roots so in other words
there<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.259> variety<00:01:37.710> knock<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.939> has

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
there was a variety knock out and it has

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.270 
there was a variety knock out and it has
its<00:01:39.299> own<00:01:39.420> knockout<00:01:39.869> roots<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.070> dies

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
its own knockout roots so if it dies
