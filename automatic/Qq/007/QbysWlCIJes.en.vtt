00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
there's a couple of simple rules you
have<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.600> use<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> beat<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.740> I'll<00:01:50.070> leave<00:01:50.280> in

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
have to use the beat that I'll leave in

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.399 
have to use the beat that I'll leave in
the<00:01:50.640> link<00:01:50.880> because<00:01:51.450> everyone<00:01:51.869> has<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> scratch

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the link because everyone has to scratch

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.980 
the link because everyone has to scratch
over<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> same<00:01:53.100> beat<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.640> use<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> sound

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
over the same beat and use the sound

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.980 
over the same beat and use the sound
same<00:01:55.680> scratch<00:01:55.979> sound<00:01:56.420> that's<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.540> simple<00:01:57.810> rule

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
same scratch sound that's a simple rule

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.319 
same scratch sound that's a simple rule
second<00:01:58.829> rule<00:01:58.979> pretty<00:01:59.520> important<00:02:00.060> make<00:02:00.299> sure

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
second rule pretty important make sure

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.120 
second rule pretty important make sure
that<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> play<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.110> beat<00:02:01.409> at<00:02:01.560> its<00:02:01.860> normal

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that you play the beat at its normal

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
that you play the beat at its normal
tempo<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.850> don't<00:02:03.090> change<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> pitch<00:02:03.659> don't

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
tempo so don't change the pitch don't

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.209 
tempo so don't change the pitch don't
make<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> faster<00:02:04.530> don't<00:02:04.710> make<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> slower

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
make it faster don't make it slower

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.059 
make it faster don't make it slower
because<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.880> means<00:02:06.149> more<00:02:06.960> work<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.409> me<00:02:07.860> in

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
because that means more work for me in

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.369 
because that means more work for me in
the<00:02:08.340> editing<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> first<00:02:09.330> session<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the editing in the first session a

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.110 
the editing in the first session a
couple<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.160> guys<00:02:11.310> they<00:02:11.580> change<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> pitch

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
couple of you guys they change the pitch

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.880 
couple of you guys they change the pitch
and<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.540> had

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
and I had

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.020 
and I had
change<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.280> pitch<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.700> whole<00:02:13.850> video

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
change the pitch on the whole video

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.530 
change the pitch on the whole video
that's<00:02:14.660> extra<00:02:15.140> work<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:15.770> play<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.819> at<00:02:16.970> normal

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
that's extra work so play it at normal

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.220 
that's extra work so play it at normal

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.620 
sound is going to be clipped and it's
not<00:03:34.040> going<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.280> sound<00:03:34.430> good<00:03:34.670> make<00:03:35.299> sure<00:03:35.329> that

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
not going to sound good make sure that

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.050 
not going to sound good make sure that
it's<00:03:35.750> not<00:03:35.900> too<00:03:36.200> far<00:03:36.530> away<00:03:36.560> because<00:03:37.459> then<00:03:37.820> I<00:03:37.850> get

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
it's not too far away because then I get

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.060 
it's not too far away because then I get
a<00:03:38.090> lot<00:03:38.269> of<00:03:38.329> reverb<00:03:38.780> from<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.110> room<00:03:39.320> try<00:03:40.010> to

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
a lot of reverb from the room try to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.400 
a lot of reverb from the room try to
make<00:03:40.310> sure<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.790> can<00:03:41.060> hear<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.630> audio<00:03:42.049> well

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
make sure that I can hear the audio well

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.410 
make sure that I can hear the audio well
and<00:03:42.739> get<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.100> good<00:03:43.310> balance<00:03:43.790> between<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.150> beat

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
and get a good balance between the beat

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.289 
and get a good balance between the beat
and<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.720> scratches<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.790> might<00:03:47.030> sound

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
and the scratches so that might sound

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.060 
and the scratches so that might sound
complicated<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.170> it's<00:03:48.410> really<00:03:48.560> not<00:03:48.799> make

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
complicated but it's really not make

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.770 
complicated but it's really not make
sure<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.579> sounds<00:03:49.910> okay<00:03:50.150> check<00:03:50.390> out<00:03:50.540> some

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
out how the balance between the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.759 
out how the balance between the
scratches<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.239> beat<00:03:56.420> sounds<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.170> try<00:03:57.709> to

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769

that<00:05:05.900> was<00:05:06.020> very<00:05:06.229> cool<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:07.250> time<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.520> want<00:05:07.880> to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
that was very cool this time I want to

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.670 
that was very cool this time I want to
make<00:05:08.090> sure<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:08.570> we<00:05:08.660> get<00:05:08.810> even<00:05:09.260> more<00:05:09.470> than
