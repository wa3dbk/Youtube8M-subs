this<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.430> an<00:02:11.640> orange<00:02:12.060> tree<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.780> stories

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
this is an orange tree the stories

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.440 
this is an orange tree the stories
here<00:02:13.310> since<00:02:13.550> as<00:02:14.480> long<00:02:14.540> as<00:02:14.900> I've<00:02:15.020> been<00:02:15.050> alive

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
here since as long as I've been alive

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.900 
here since as long as I've been alive
and<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.890> just<00:02:19.010> like<00:02:19.130> perfectly<00:02:19.400> ripe<00:02:19.790> right

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
and it's just like perfectly ripe right

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.070 
and it's just like perfectly ripe right
now<00:02:20.000> base<00:02:20.210> every<00:02:20.450> day<00:02:20.540> go<00:02:20.750> out<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.020> was

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080
