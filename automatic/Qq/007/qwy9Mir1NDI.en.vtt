nasally<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> bit<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.550> cold<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
nasally I do have a bit of a cold and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.759 
nasally I do have a bit of a cold and
that's<00:00:30.210> why<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.570> been<00:00:30.689> twice<00:00:31.260> taking<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
that's why it's been twice taking me I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.979 
that's why it's been twice taking me I
think<00:00:32.009> because<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.940> came<00:00:33.270> back<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
think because I I came back right on the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.900 
think because I I came back right on the
day<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.140> divination<00:00:34.739> came<00:00:35.100> out<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> that's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
day that divination came out and that's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729 
day that divination came out and that's
why<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.510> taking<00:00:36.899> me<00:00:36.989> kind<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> long<00:00:37.469> time

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
why it's taking me kind of a long time

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.959 
why it's taking me kind of a long time
to<00:00:37.770> make<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.219> video<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:38.520> I've<00:00:38.790> had<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
to make this video because I've had a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.420 
to make this video because I've had a
cold<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> entire<00:00:39.660> time<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.010> at<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.219> point

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
exciting things about this skill is the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.780 
exciting things about this skill is the
fact<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.879> actually<00:02:09.200> semi<00:02:10.200> AFK<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
fact that it's actually semi AFK and the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.400

only reason I came back let's train the

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.430 
only reason I came back let's train the

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
on runescape is trained skill so

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.430 
on runescape is trained skill so
probably<00:03:55.430> other<00:03:55.730> videos<00:03:56.120> where<00:03:56.480> I'm<00:03:56.780> where<00:03:57.410> I

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
probably other videos where I'm where I

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.710 
probably other videos where I'm where I
like<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.889> to<00:03:58.099> be<00:03:58.220> away<00:03:58.459> from<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.269> stuff

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
like have to be away from this and stuff

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.589 
like have to be away from this and stuff
and<00:03:59.989> I<00:04:00.709> might<00:04:01.160> end<00:04:01.400> up<00:04:01.819> straying<00:04:02.180> away<00:04:02.299> from

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
and I might end up straying away from

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.080 
and I might end up straying away from
those<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.430> unfortunately<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.819> means

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
those and unfortunately that means

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.270 
those and unfortunately that means
videos<00:04:05.540> like<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.079> on<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.470> RuneScape's<00:04:06.950> and

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
videos like the on the RuneScape's and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.659 
videos like the on the RuneScape's and
the<00:04:07.970> quest<00:04:08.239> for<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.690> pixel<00:04:09.500> women's<00:04:10.400> and

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
the quest for the pixel women's and

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.000 
the quest for the pixel women's and
females<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.209> stuff<00:04:11.419> and<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:12.530> probably<00:04:12.829> won't

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
females and stuff and I probably won't

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.770 
females and stuff and I probably won't
be<00:04:13.160> making<00:04:13.310> those<00:04:13.579> but<00:04:14.120> what<00:04:14.389> I<00:04:14.419> will<00:04:14.660> be

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
be making those but what I will be

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.930 
be making those but what I will be
making<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.349> the<00:04:15.680> occasional<00:04:16.160> commentaries

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
making is the occasional commentaries

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.870 
making is the occasional commentaries
and<00:04:17.829> obviously<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.979> story<00:04:19.190> time<00:04:19.400> video<00:04:19.519> just

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and obviously the story time video just

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.400 
and obviously the story time video just
because<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.180> can<00:04:20.419> do<00:04:20.599> those<00:04:20.780> while<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.079> trains

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
because I can do those while I trains

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.950 
because I can do those while I trains
heal<00:04:21.680> but<00:04:21.979> I<00:04:22.280> mean<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.880> don't<00:04:23.270> really<00:04:23.419> know<00:04:23.750> what

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
heal but I mean I don't really know what

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.430 
heal but I mean I don't really know what
else<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.430> talk<00:04:25.430> about<00:04:25.490> um

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440
