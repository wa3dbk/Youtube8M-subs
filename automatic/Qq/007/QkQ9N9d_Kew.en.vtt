think<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> works<00:01:44.070> great<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
think it works great you have the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.840 
think it works great you have the
ability<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.979> customize<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.189> text<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
ability to customize the text there and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.850 
ability to customize the text there and
set<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> unlock<00:01:48.990> sequence<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.500> i<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.649> it's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
set the unlock sequence so i think it's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.469 
set the unlock sequence so i think it's
a<00:01:49.920> pretty<00:01:50.040> cool<00:01:50.189> tweak<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.700> i<00:01:50.939> highly<00:01:51.180> suggest
