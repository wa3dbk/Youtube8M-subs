00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.689
 well we are back here now 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.600
 let's prepare what is pasta 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.610
 alfredo as you can see here I already have 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.730
 some melted butter that come 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.160
 being practically two tablespoons of 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.019
 of a spoon normally that we occupy 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.740
 to cook two tablespoons of 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:24.070
 butter and three spoons and three 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.199
 tablespoons of parmesan cheese that is a 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.029
 spoon normally the one that we occupy for 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.350
 eat the little one that is coffee but 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.660
 the one that follows size 3 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.820
 we throw the cheese 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.690
 these very important parts at the time 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.930
 to make this sauce because if they do not cook 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.380
 the cheese does not leave the flavor it should 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.140
 leaving 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.830
 how it is that I like ok you must 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.680
 perfectly cooking this cheese is 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.260
 very difficult to cook because as it is a 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.360
 cheese and close friend type costs 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.230
 work that releases the flavor for the same 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.060
 that is hard then let's leave 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.450
 that this success cook well well well 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.979
 well as it should be until it starts 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 to remove the fat that is the cheese 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.330
 you will usually find out why 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.710
 it's completely different from fat 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.450
 that brings and that brings butter ok to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.780
 principle this credit is going to do well 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.350
 As a chic, he cited him as if 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.710
 sticky another important part of this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.570
 sauce that is very but very very very 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.900
 important 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.150
 is the evaporated milk although that is the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.570
 let's take a look at a moment yes 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.450
 since this who quoted starts to grab 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.229
 and the consistency that we want then 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.280
 we are going to occupy that cheetah that also 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.280
 will serve to go mixing 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.140
 all this is going to be the cream that 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.650
 is going to be used for alfredo pasta there 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.620
 many ways to prepare 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.100
 the alfredo pasta but this is one of my 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.440
 favorite ok 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.530
 here is more or less the pasta of 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.150
 cheese is discarded now we are going to throw 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.520
 a little trickle 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.930
 of condensed milk 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:28.140
 and we will continue to beat 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.030
 we will beat beat beat until 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.900
 fall apart again 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.150
 and this has to be done a creampie 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.500
 what do we want to use 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.500
 in the pasta ok 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.890
 this pasta takes more time to be 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.890
 because knowledge is very slow ok 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.550
 Now we come back when the pasta 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.960
 is finished to not be waiting 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.420
 so long but nothing else is 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.600
 question of being stirring moving 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.490
 moving and moving so that it 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.300
 make the pasta 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.220
 forgive the cream and in perfect you need and 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.440
 with the consistency that we occupy for 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.200
 put it already in what is the pasta that 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.490
 we have here ready 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.490
 we came back in a little while
