it's<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> slot<00:01:48.960> machine<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> rails<00:01:49.710> will

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it's a slot machine so the rails will

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
it's a slot machine so the rails will
spin<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> modes<00:01:51.420> will

spin and then one of the modes will

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.050 
spin and then one of the modes will
begin

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060

from<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.160> gumball<00:03:07.489> machine<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:09.200> get<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.470> play

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
from the gumball machine you get to play

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.890 
from the gumball machine you get to play
with<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.859> ball<00:03:10.010> its<00:03:10.220> ceramic<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:11.269> it's<00:03:11.510> lighter

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
with a ball its ceramic so it's lighter

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.930 
with a ball its ceramic so it's lighter
so<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.319> flies<00:03:12.590> around<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:13.069> machine<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.700> lot

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
so it flies around the machine a lot

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.620 
so it flies around the machine a lot
faster<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.579> it's<00:03:16.579> not<00:03:16.760> affected<00:03:17.150> by<00:03:17.239> any<00:03:17.390> sort
