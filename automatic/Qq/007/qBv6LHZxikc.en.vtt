performance so it almost becomes like

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.020 
performance so it almost becomes like
steroids<00:02:45.560> it's<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.430> what's<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.700> next<00:02:46.760> thing

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
to if we could just get the mental edge

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.870 
to if we could just get the mental edge
we<00:03:14.630> have<00:03:14.750> all<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.080> talent<00:03:15.380> but<00:03:15.980> we're<00:03:16.700> just

thing and if we could just get the
mental<00:03:19.610> edge<00:03:19.760> if<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.060> could<00:03:20.180> just<00:03:20.209> figure<00:03:20.450> out

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
mental edge if we could just figure out

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.300 
mental edge if we could just figure out
the<00:03:20.660> mental<00:03:20.930> piece<00:03:21.290> then<00:03:21.769> we'd<00:03:21.920> have<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.160> all

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
the mental piece then we'd have it all

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.800 
the mental piece then we'd have it all
all<00:03:22.670> down<00:03:23.060> we'd<00:03:23.510> be<00:03:23.600> all<00:03:23.720> good<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:26.600> that's

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
all down we'd be all good and that's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.140

like a diet coke and that's that's how
most<00:03:29.299> people<00:03:29.660> look<00:03:29.870> at<00:03:30.280> mental<00:03:31.280> training<00:03:31.519> is

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
most people look at mental training is

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.080 
most people look at mental training is
it's<00:03:32.450> just<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.690> diet<00:03:32.900> coke<00:03:33.200> it's<00:03:33.470> just<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.970> just<00:03:34.970> a

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
it's just a diet coke it's just a just a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.750 
it's just a diet coke it's just a just a
tip<00:03:35.330> it's<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.720> trick<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:39.340> what<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.370> believe

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
tip it's a trick and so what I believe

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.520 
tip it's a trick and so what I believe
is<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:40.940> everything<00:03:41.630> impacts<00:03:42.019> everything

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
is that everything impacts everything

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.809 
is that everything impacts everything
because<00:03:42.709> if<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:42.860> do<00:03:43.040> five<00:03:43.310> minutes<00:03:43.549> of

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
because if you do five minutes of

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.990 
because if you do five minutes of
purposeful<00:03:44.299> visualization<00:03:45.640> but<00:03:46.640> then<00:03:46.790> for

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
purposeful visualization but then for

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.660 
purposeful visualization but then for
the<00:03:47.090> next<00:03:47.120> 23<00:03:47.959> hours<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.530> 55<00:03:48.980> minutes<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.519> your
