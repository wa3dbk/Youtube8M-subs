tour so I figured perfect example to
show<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.270> high-definition<00:00:21.869> 1080<00:00:22.830> my

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
show you in high-definition 1080 my

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.300 
show you in high-definition 1080 my
three<00:00:23.939> finger<00:00:24.269> restring<00:00:24.779> method<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:26.130> did

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
three finger restring method I just did

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.429
