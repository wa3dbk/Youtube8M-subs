glad you asked
connor<00:00:22.439> miller<00:00:22.650> patella<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.070> actually<00:00:23.670> it's

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
connor miller patella is actually it's

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759 
connor miller patella is actually it's
an<00:00:23.910> irritation<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.500> cartilage

an irritation to the cartilage

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.519 
an irritation to the cartilage
surrounding<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> patella<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.180> kneecap<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
surrounding the patella or kneecap it

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.960 
surrounding the patella or kneecap it
can<00:00:28.710> extend<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> way<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.609> into<00:00:29.789> the

of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.009> femur<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> bone<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:33.059> behind<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
of the femur the bone that's behind it

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.450 
of the femur the bone that's behind it
but<00:00:34.230> we'll<00:00:34.440> show<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.590> some<00:00:34.680> anatomy<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> little

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
but we'll show you some anatomy a little

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.889 
but we'll show you some anatomy a little
bit<00:00:35.550> later<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> kind<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
bit later just to kind of get you a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.119 
bit later just to kind of get you a
better<00:00:37.050> idea<00:00:37.110> we're<00:00:37.380> talking<00:00:37.680> about<00:00:37.800> but

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
better idea we're talking about but

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.590 
better idea we're talking about but
mainly<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.940> breakdown<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
mainly it's a breakdown of that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
mainly it's a breakdown of that
cartilage<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.379> happen<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.920> tons<00:00:41.670> of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
cartilage it can happen to tons of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.670 
cartilage it can happen to tons of
people<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.450> who<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:43.020> happen<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
people do you know who can happen to and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.729 
people do you know who can happen to and
why<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:44.610> did<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.870> 30%<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
why actually did you know that 30% of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
why actually did you know that 30% of
athletes<00:00:47.280> will<00:00:47.489> experiences<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.390> it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
athletes will experiences and it's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
athletes will experiences and it's
actually<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> most<00:00:49.200> common<00:00:49.800> injury<00:00:50.190> found<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
actually the most common injury found in

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150 
actually the most common injury found in
sports<00:00:50.910> medicine<00:00:51.120> offices<00:00:51.770> you<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
sports medicine offices you know that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.360 
sports medicine offices you know that
cool<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> let's<00:00:55.289> go<00:00:55.469> over<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> anatomy<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
cool so let's go over the anatomy of the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000 
cool so let's go over the anatomy of the
knee<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.879> find<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> patella<00:00:57.989> you're<00:00:58.859> going

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
knee and find the patella you're going

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.319 
knee and find the patella you're going
to<00:00:59.070> start<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.520> with<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.789> knees<00:00:59.940> slightly

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
to start here with the knees slightly

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.080 
to start here with the knees slightly
flexed<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.170> bent<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.670> bone<00:01:02.879> that's

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
flexed or bent and the bone that's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.320 
flexed or bent and the bone that's
popping<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.830> patella

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
popping out right there is the patella

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.899 
popping out right there is the patella
bingo<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> people<00:01:07.979> who<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.369> chondromalacia

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
bingo so people who have chondromalacia

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
bingo so people who have chondromalacia
