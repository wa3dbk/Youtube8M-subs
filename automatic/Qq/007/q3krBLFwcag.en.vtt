pin my tracks in place to see how I'm
gonna<00:02:50.270> lay<00:02:50.540> them<00:02:50.780> before<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.140> actually<00:02:51.350> begin

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
gonna lay them before I actually begin

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.420 
gonna lay them before I actually begin
sewing<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.520> then<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:54.380> begin<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.740> track<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.220> go

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
sewing and then to begin the track I go

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.790 
sewing and then to begin the track I go
through<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.970> West<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.630> then<00:02:57.260> through<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
through the West and then through the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.050 
through the West and then through the
cap<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.570> then<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.600> loop<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.790> know<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
cap and then I loop it on you know the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.840 
cap and then I loop it on you know the
thread<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.720> tied<00:03:03.050> into<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.470> knot<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:04.550> go

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
thread that I tied into a knot and I go

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.210 
thread that I tied into a knot and I go
through<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.360> weft<00:03:05.780> maybe<00:03:06.380> three<00:03:07.010> or<00:03:07.040> four

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
through the weft maybe three or four

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.720 
through the weft maybe three or four
times<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.450> secure<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.340> at<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.520> very

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
times just to secure it at the very

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.050 
times just to secure it at the very
start<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.530> track<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.160> then<00:03:13.340> going

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
start of the track and then going

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:37.860 
start of the track and then going
forward<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.600> would<00:03:14.630> just<00:03:14.959> go<00:03:15.230> under<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.980> track

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.650 

so<00:03:38.870> then<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.170> go<00:03:39.350> ahead<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.850> flip<00:03:40.850> over<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.420> web

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
so then I go ahead and flip over the web

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.140 
so then I go ahead and flip over the web
I<00:03:42.020> fold<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.530> over<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.830> then<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.220> stitch<00:03:43.610> through

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
I fold it over and then I stitch through

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.780 
I fold it over and then I stitch through
the<00:03:44.209> weft<00:03:44.540> maybe<00:03:45.110> two<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.769> three<00:03:45.799> times<00:03:46.310> and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
the weft maybe two to three times and

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.750 
the weft maybe two to three times and
then<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.600> continue<00:03:48.200> on<00:03:48.230> with<00:03:48.799> just<00:03:49.040> going<00:03:49.340> under

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
then I continue on with just going under

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.180 
then I continue on with just going under
the<00:03:49.880> weft<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.739> continue<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:51.890> same

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
the weft and I continue this same

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.090 
the weft and I continue this same
pattern<00:03:52.519> throughout<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.330> wig<00:03:53.570> I<00:03:53.930> wanted<00:03:54.920> to

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
pattern throughout the wig I wanted to

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.190 
pattern throughout the wig I wanted to
do<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.489> turnover<00:03:56.120> method<00:03:56.510> because<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:56.870> didn't

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
do the turnover method because I didn't

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.190 
do the turnover method because I didn't
want<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.470> cut<00:03:57.709> any<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.250> my<00:03:58.400> webs<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:59.540> just

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
preferred not to do that and it also

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:09.340 
preferred not to do that and it also
cuts<00:04:02.810> down<00:04:02.900> on<00:04:03.049> shedding
