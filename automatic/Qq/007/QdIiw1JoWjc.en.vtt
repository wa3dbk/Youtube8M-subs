00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.600
 hello everyone with you stone and skin could 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.670
 notice you now with screens t95 2 this in 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.980
 currently auction machine which 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.070
 you can only get well or promotional 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.650
 you can get it right only with 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.010
 help invitation if you are there 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.170
 invite how much i remember someone from 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.150
 friends who have not started yet 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.460
 play and here's a char deflate ten 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.730
 for example, then you are automatically in the hangar 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.769
 T95 2 gets there 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.739
 opportunities but I will only remember this in 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.570
 overall I am not interested in this car in 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.640
 first for the reason that there is not 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.379
 increased pharma well, and for the one in 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.559
 Basically nothing outstanding here 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.680
 no, but I would like to show you a replay 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.479
 which first proves that on 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.520
 This machine does not have a larger format. 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.190
 have this mindless car if you 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.130
 just want a unique tank you can 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.540
 Of course, to participate in this action or 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.310
 if you already participate it is you just 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.130
 at least be warned that 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.230
 there is no increased farm is the main 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.060
 problem well and just show you what 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.890
 Was this car worth it? 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.810
 at all 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.430
 risk risking for it 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.560
 other i know some people by 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.320
 created twinks and in these markets found 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.660
 pump out a dozen for even one guy 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.910
 who zadonatil himself on prem for a month 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.690
 and deflate 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.600
 for this month yourself top and there is something else 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.659
 well now this guy is writing on 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.830
 tvinka us too k he scored the view and 95 up 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.090
 generally sold along with the account 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.159
 certainly not a good deed and very 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.770
 stupid but nonetheless 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.540
 month he raised the statue as for me it's all 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.810
 it was very stupid and generally so stupid 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.090
 act the most important plus then t95 2 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.190
 as for me it's not bad for him 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.440
 amerikos mobility because well how 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.019
 relatively good but such a bird 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.569
 not bad but he has his maximum speed and that's it 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.879
 but unfortunately there is no good 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.129
 power density that takes us 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.099
 some dynamics is a minus 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.819
 and the fact that here the towers are cumbersome 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.920
 also a big minus 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.959
 and the most standard weapons for 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.909
 amerikosov in fact, too, that 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.620
 superpershing only there at 3 penetration 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.599
 more but the main plus as for me 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.930
 that's what cumulatives added here mom 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.689
 I think it might have noticed that 240 alpha is not 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.489
 have 250 armor penetration not all the same 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:47.969
 more such more punch it but how about 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.459
 I am the main motives only from the fact that 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.859
 the distance of the penetration is not lost as well 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.329
 they are not as good as podacibers 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.000
 subscalibers shed as for me better 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.859
 than cumulative on since cumulative 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.620
 there are some degree or something else 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.109
 given hard on them you need to shoot 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.500
 when there is almost no degree but when 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.629
 he is already having problems 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.969
 Accuracy Medium tank 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.569
 not bad quite good relatively 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.500
 wold 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.019
 whether there is a 95 but cola hundreds of general vld under 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.069
 not bad degree you see here a little 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.579
 slightly more than 60 degrees I think somewhere 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.889
 again here and nld which is big everything 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.389
 spoils plus in nld armor less 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.310
 if you are long and even a mine 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.250
 there will be problems or art 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.769
 throws a bottom and a place under the bottom here 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.930
 very many here even experienced apt-2 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.209
 if he sees that he does not make his way well yes 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.060
 just throw on the bottom and everything I did 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.840
 on apt-2 and so doing on e100, as if everything 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.669
 what else can I say 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.829
 tank basically well I donâ€™t know the tower here 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:55.349
 us from patton yes it is certainly on the eighth 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.060
 levels this is cool yes because for 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.620
 Eighth level then the tower is very 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.560
 not bad but here it is a little bit 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.720
 changed first here with us 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.699
 damn you will not fail when in sight 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.739
 and comes in here with me with me 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.419
 it seems that the hatch 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.489
 top more can I just on just 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.699
 not for a long time and did not ride a little bit 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.539
 the shape of the tower is different there is this here these 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:20.669
 what can you call canisters 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.190
 This here is hrenaty which as far as I 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.710
 I remember no attacks 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.069
 the towers are different yes and at the tower 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.470
 small not great turning speed then 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.930
 have it spinning not very fast here 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.319
 if someone has to twist it like 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.380
 a bit of a problem so basically i don't know 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:43.380
 what else can you say about the tank 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.110
 just such a tolerable machine as if 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.759
 just there who is not bad yes well damn why 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.870
 do at the car pass and do not give it 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.000
 enhanced farm if anything she 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.849
 need if there is no strong farm 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.949
 will you tell me if the farm here is the most 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.470
 ordinary what just show what 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.199
 I will have and 95 2 in the village cool 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.479
 boyfriend my friend pumped the top ten zealously 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.419
 third skated and easily doing worse 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.220
 you shook 1 5 2 but what is this nonsense 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.099
 I know it was not worth it even 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.289
 if you were killing time or there and 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.780
 created tvinkov you have committed a common 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:21.470
 big fall like i think but if 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.610
 just there is some real friend 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.979
 you called a friend to play literally 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.009
 pumped out the top ten there or how many there 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.740
 experience with you in the platoon scored how well 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.139
 you would be great i'm the other way around 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.190
 I am proud of you and got a very free 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.940
 not a bad machine but still what is here 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:45.900
 not done in personal farm it is very bad 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:48.270
 it's sad not know well how would you 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.630
 agree then write in the comments on 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.580
 about it if there is a pancake otpishite 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.530
 why not and what you think 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.460
 about all of this because well, how about 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.400
 me again this is not very good yes in 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.620
 principle boris color machine shows 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.330
 relatively well, as for me, 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.860
 refugees could do this 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.509
 I explained about this tank to 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.270
 make it like a branch top because 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.050
 if his little bit send her give him 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.440
 armament 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.960
 which here he should have been 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:27.730
 from the same patton it would be 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:31.460
 Not bad for yourself; well, I donâ€™t know 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:34.520
 senseless general car hope you 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.900
 it was interesting yes you were rude if 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.790
 you are upset then be sure to put 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.060
 dizlaik I'll know what upset you 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.740
 but if u somehow sold you or you 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.260
 it was interesting then like 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.440
 subscribe to the channel if you want 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.380
 still vidos field play mta 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.890
 or throw off replays 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.710
 laykat vidosy or simply that you will 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:00.760
 want such vidos 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.760
 good luck and goodbye
