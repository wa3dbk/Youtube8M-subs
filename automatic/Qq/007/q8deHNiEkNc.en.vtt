when you see that HQ pop up you're
trying<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.139> figure<00:05:31.349> out<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.500> best<00:05:31.710> path<00:05:31.949> to<00:05:31.979> I

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
trying to figure out the best path to I

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.020 
trying to figure out the best path to I
want<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.370> cut<00:05:32.520> through<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.820> tight-knit

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
corners where I could easily be pinned

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.279 
corners where I could easily be pinned
down<00:05:35.250> right<00:05:35.699> you<00:05:36.180> know<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:36.389> that's<00:05:36.510> a<00:05:36.780> obvious

down right you know so that's a obvious

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.350 
down right you know so that's a obvious
choke<00:05:37.530> points<00:05:38.010> right<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.460> which<00:05:38.789> just<00:05:39.000> make<00:05:39.180> it

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
choke points right I which just make it

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
different you know it's wide open space

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.969 
different you know it's wide open space
and<00:06:08.940> I<00:06:09.210> mean<00:06:09.360> and<00:06:09.780> I<00:06:09.930> used<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.650> always<00:06:10.770> talk

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
and I mean and I used to always talk

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.409 
and I mean and I used to always talk
about<00:06:11.039> overgrown<00:06:11.610> being<00:06:11.820> one<00:06:11.970> of<00:06:12.000> our<00:06:12.180> biggest

about overgrown being one of our biggest

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.050 
about overgrown being one of our biggest
right<00:06:12.840> right<00:06:13.139> fuel<00:06:13.470> is<00:06:13.800> really<00:06:14.190> competing<00:06:14.909> for

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
right right fuel is really competing for

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.279 
right right fuel is really competing for
that<00:06:15.150> time<00:06:15.389> that<00:06:15.539> does<00:06:15.690> this<00:06:15.870> feel<00:06:15.990> have<00:06:16.169> the

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
that time that does this feel have the

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.379 
that time that does this feel have the
same<00:06:16.440> up<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:16.800> downs<00:06:16.949> like<00:06:17.070> overgrown<00:06:17.400> did<00:06:17.729> it

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
same up and downs like overgrown did it

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.930 
same up and downs like overgrown did it
does<00:06:19.050> because<00:06:19.650> it's<00:06:19.889> basically<00:06:20.190> broken<00:06:20.729> up

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
does because it's basically broken up

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.080 
does because it's basically broken up
into<00:06:21.090> two<00:06:21.979> sections<00:06:22.979> you<00:06:23.340> could<00:06:23.520> say<00:06:23.669> you<00:06:23.729> have

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
into two sections you could say you have

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.909 
into two sections you could say you have
basically<00:06:24.900> what<00:06:25.110> it<00:06:25.139> is<00:06:25.229> it's<00:06:25.470> an<00:06:25.710> oil

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
basically what it is it's an oil

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.980 
basically what it is it's an oil
refinery<00:06:26.250> right<00:06:26.639> so<00:06:27.090> you<00:06:27.150> have<00:06:27.419> like<00:06:27.630> you<00:06:27.960> know

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
refinery right so you have like you know

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
all that and that's wide open space

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:33.950 
all that and that's wide open space
scarce<00:06:32.520> cover<00:06:32.849> you<00:06:33.389> know<00:06:33.479> that's<00:06:33.690> where<00:06:33.870> the
