let me show you a technique that I use
why<00:00:17.609> are<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.510> someone<00:00:18.840> else<00:00:19.020> technique<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
why are you someone else technique and I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.230 
why are you someone else technique and I
felt<00:00:19.980> comfortable<00:00:20.369> with<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.850> tried<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
felt comfortable with it so I tried it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.859 
felt comfortable with it so I tried it
myself<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.619> sewing<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.869> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
myself and I like it like sewing up to

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.439 
myself and I like it like sewing up to
weave<00:00:25.529> threads<00:00:26.039> together<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.789> stitching

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
weave threads together and stitching

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.120 
weave threads together and stitching
them<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> size<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> board<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.010> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
them to the size of the board so it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
them to the size of the board so it
gives<00:00:29.340> me<00:00:29.460> support<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> little

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
gives me support and this is a little

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229 
gives me support and this is a little
grease<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.730> smooth<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
grease that I use you just to smooth and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.180

the<00:00:41.370> thread<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.710> make<00:00:43.710> sure<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the thread like this make sure that it's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.690 
the thread like this make sure that it's
even<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> end<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.129> I'm<00:00:47.309> gonna<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
even at the end and all I'm gonna do is

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
even at the end and all I'm gonna do is
just<00:00:47.879> separate<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.539> into<00:00:48.660> three<00:00:48.780> parts<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
just separate it into three parts and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.850 
just separate it into three parts and
braid<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.309> regular<00:00:50.550> braid

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
braid it like a regular braid

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.430 
braid it like a regular braid
and<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:53.910> will<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.329> braiding<00:00:54.719> mines<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> way

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and I will be braiding mines all the way

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.279 
and I will be braiding mines all the way
to<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> end<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.610> want<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> be

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
to the end because I want them to be

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.870 
to the end because I want them to be
linked

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.350 

because<00:01:02.480> that<00:01:02.810> would<00:01:02.930> be<00:01:02.960> wrapping<00:01:03.500> them<00:01:03.590> up

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
because that would be wrapping them up

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.050 
because that would be wrapping them up
you<00:01:05.360> just<00:01:05.600> got<00:01:05.990> him<00:01:06.580> bread<00:01:07.580> make<00:01:07.790> sure<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.000> get
