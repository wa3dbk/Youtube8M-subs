00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.390
 so already hello to all of you 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.580
 today I present to you how 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.460
 to make dough and fish for 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.679
 especially for the keep one that attracts 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.870
 well then his death well I tried 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.150
 many times and it works well 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:28.289
 so then as an ingredient you need 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:32.399
 water the normal sugar of the flour of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.239
 olive oil like that is a whole 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.489
 little bit of delay then already for 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.489
 start by putting the flour 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:56.190
 these are just like water 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.420
 we will go back little by little because 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.430
 it must not be too much 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.480
 liquid and or so must do and that 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.480
 the fingers it's easier 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 I put a little sweet not too up 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.380
 then the dough must not be 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.979
 it sticks to your fingers 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.180
 in fact for her to be ready 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.180
 showing after 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.290
 at 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:31.690
 oh he has me everywhere but it's not 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:33.910
 it's serious you do not need it 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.110
 be homogeneous must not they have not 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.030
 that they have a lot of lumps there in 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.040
 done so little because for roach 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.110
 for the soul its faux pas at all but of 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.540
 many form is just a bit of 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.130
 learn on the spades like that as soon as 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.140
 his death they will explain because 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.800
 otherwise you go missed bouquet a lot 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.340
 of keys of the months so here is once 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:02.050
 you made a dough like that 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:11.020
 near good as sarlat and well where you 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:13.350
 go put olive oil I 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.600
 put that that sticks me that can 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:22.180
 here you have but not a tiny 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.820
 little olive oil at the bottom really not 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.440
 many insist on giving a little bit of 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:36.240
 taste here is a little background like that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.240
 should be enough and you're cheating in 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:47.220
 and you mix 2 well mix well 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:02.730
 once you did that you 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:11.250
 put sugar we were not much 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:15.810
 that since yesterday that's enough it's even a 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:19.850
 little hole but now you take and then 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.850
 give you change as usual 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.750
 that's it then once you've done well 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.810
 mix everything that's good they have 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.060
 no lumps that are quite smooth 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.060
 you put a little bit of rigor 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.830
 really a little bit more to give 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.830
 a little taste 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:06.240
 I put you tÃ©treault has no good 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:06.660
 this is how it is and gives you back to change 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.630
 etc. 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:16.790
 because it's better we can come 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:19.770
 well then mix So here here 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.450
 so the dough is ready and now 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.370
 you are ready to go fishing 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:32.220
 so I have already done many times 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:34.770
 and it works great, that's good 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.990
 about if you go not a day 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.210
 you can fish at least 100 just 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.870
 with that and you really do not want to 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.200
