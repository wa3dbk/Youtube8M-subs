00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.230 
think with any job like this is gonna be
a<00:04:31.469> lot<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.650> challenges<00:04:32.030> one<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.180> biggest

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
a lot of challenges one of the biggest

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.010 
a lot of challenges one of the biggest
is<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.319> cooling<00:04:34.949> systems<00:04:35.430> how<00:04:36.419> is<00:04:36.659> that<00:04:36.780> going

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
is the cooling systems how is that going

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.809 
is the cooling systems how is that going
that<00:04:37.229> technology<00:04:37.800> because<00:04:38.129> that<00:04:38.159> is<00:04:38.460> truly

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
that technology because that is truly

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.339 
that technology because that is truly
innovative<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.599> could<00:04:39.810> leave<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:39.960> lasting

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
innovative and could leave a lasting

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.649 
innovative and could leave a lasting
legacy<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:41.129> mean<00:04:41.669> it's<00:04:41.759> going<00:04:41.909> well<00:04:42.150> lads<00:04:42.360> it's

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
legacy I mean it's going well lads it's

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.469 
legacy I mean it's going well lads it's
proven<00:04:43.080> it's<00:04:43.319> proven<00:04:43.879> technology<00:04:44.879> it's<00:04:45.180> not

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
proven it's proven technology it's not

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.809 
proven it's proven technology it's not
not<00:04:46.020> something<00:04:46.409> that<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:46.889> we're<00:04:47.550> going<00:04:47.729> to

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
not something that that we're going to

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.369 
not something that that we're going to
be<00:04:47.939> creating<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:48.750> it's<00:04:48.930> not<00:04:49.050> something<00:04:49.289> we're

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
be creating and it's not something we're

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.689 
be creating and it's not something we're
gonna<00:04:49.469> be<00:04:49.650> pulling<00:04:49.889> out<00:04:49.979> of<00:04:50.009> thin<00:04:50.219> air<00:04:50.310> the

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
gonna be pulling out of thin air the

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.540 
gonna be pulling out of thin air the
technologies<00:04:51.389> they're<00:04:51.569> solar<00:04:52.460> you<00:04:53.460> know

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
technologies they're solar you know

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.010 
technologies they're solar you know
production<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.120> energy<00:04:54.539> using<00:04:54.990> solar

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
production of energy using solar

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.230 
production of energy using solar
technology<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.860> their<00:04:56.069> cooling<00:04:56.729> of<00:04:56.849> stadiums

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
technology is their cooling of stadiums

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.790 
technology is their cooling of stadiums
is<00:04:57.419> there<00:04:57.629> yes<00:04:57.840> it's<00:04:58.020> an<00:04:58.139> it's<00:04:58.379> being<00:04:58.560> cooled

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
is there yes it's an it's being cooled

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.740 
is there yes it's an it's being cooled
in<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:58.979> traditional<00:04:59.430> sense<00:04:59.580> it's<00:05:00.120> hooked<00:05:00.539> up<00:05:00.629> to

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
in a traditional sense it's hooked up to

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.540 
in a traditional sense it's hooked up to
the<00:05:00.870> grid<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.229> country<00:05:01.590> but<00:05:02.099> now<00:05:02.250> we<00:05:02.310> need

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
the grid of the country but now we need

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.100 
the grid of the country but now we need
just<00:05:02.699> need<00:05:02.819> to<00:05:02.939> marry<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.300> two<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:03.659> we've

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
just need to marry the two and we've

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.540 
just need to marry the two and we've
done<00:05:04.289> it<00:05:04.409> we've<00:05:04.560> done<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.770> on<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:04.979> small<00:05:05.310> scale

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
done it we've done it on a small scale

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.719 
done it we've done it on a small scale
small<00:05:06.029> size<00:05:06.650> prototype<00:05:07.650> stadium<00:05:08.069> now<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.550> just

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
small size prototype stadium now we just

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.850 
small size prototype stadium now we just
got<00:05:08.879> to<00:05:08.909> scale<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:09.300> up<00:05:09.360> Misha<00:05:10.139> Platini<00:05:10.529> says

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860

towards<00:05:41.210> 2022<00:05:42.210> being<00:05:42.479> held<00:05:42.719> in<00:05:42.839> the<00:05:42.960> summer

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
towards 2022 being held in the summer

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.219 
towards 2022 being held in the summer
and<00:05:43.379> I<00:05:43.529> said<00:05:43.770> that<00:05:44.009> if<00:05:44.190> for<00:05:45.180> some<00:05:45.210> reason<00:05:45.810> the

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
and I said that if for some reason the

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.839 
and I said that if for some reason the
people<00:05:46.409> who<00:05:46.589> govern<00:05:46.740> world<00:05:47.099> football<00:05:47.490> decide

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
people who govern world football decide

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.640 
people who govern world football decide
that<00:05:48.000> it's<00:05:48.150> best<00:05:48.389> for<00:05:48.779> football<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.319> change<00:05:49.529> it

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
that it's best for football to change it
