00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
doing it I'm gonna make a guide to show

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.599 
doing it I'm gonna make a guide to show
people<00:00:23.760> who<00:00:24.420> are<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> lower<00:00:24.930> level<00:00:25.199> how<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> make

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
people who are a lower level how to make

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.990 
people who are a lower level how to make
a<00:00:26.640> tier<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.900> plane<00:00:28.320> I've<00:00:28.710> never<00:00:29.160> tried<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.550> so

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
a tier one plane I've never tried it so

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
a tier one plane I've never tried it so
we're<00:00:30.779> gonna<00:00:30.869> figure<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.500> gonna<00:00:31.590> figure

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
we're gonna figure it I'm gonna figure

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.790 
we're gonna figure it I'm gonna figure
this<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.160> using<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.000> knowledge<00:00:33.770> that<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this out using the knowledge that I

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.990 
this out using the knowledge that I
already<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:40.190> all<00:00:41.190> right<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.640> got<00:00:41.760> eight

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
already have all right so we got eight

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.069 
already have all right so we got eight
white<00:00:42.239> blocks<00:00:47.270> four<00:00:48.270> wings<00:00:50.480> it's<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.899> right

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
white blocks four wings it's all right

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
white blocks four wings it's all right
he<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.680> l2<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.649> then<00:00:55.649> he's<00:00:56.370> probably<00:00:56.969> got

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
he has one l2 and then he's probably got

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
he has one l2 and then he's probably got
a<00:00:57.360> bunch<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.780> these

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:15.950 

okay<00:01:06.460> let's<00:01:06.729> try<00:01:06.939> this<00:01:07.000> out

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.469 

look<00:01:16.960> it<00:01:17.170> flies<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.780> flies<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:21.670> really

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
look it flies it flies actually really

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.999 
look it flies it flies actually really
good<00:01:22.750> compared<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.350> what<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.590> thought<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.890> would

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
good compared to what I thought it would

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.560 
good compared to what I thought it would
be<00:01:24.159> I<00:01:25.890> mean<00:01:26.890> it's<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.700> Tier<00:01:27.940> one<00:01:28.030> playing

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
be I mean it's a Tier one playing

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.639 
be I mean it's a Tier one playing
Internet<00:01:28.899> and<00:01:29.080> you're<00:01:29.170> not<00:01:29.320> gonna<00:01:29.440> get<00:01:29.619> that

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
Internet and you're not gonna get that

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.170 
Internet and you're not gonna get that
much<00:01:29.770> comfort<00:01:30.369> out<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.610> one<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.820> these<00:01:30.940> things

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
much comfort out of one of these things

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.539 
much comfort out of one of these things
but<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:31.509> thing<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.780> really<00:01:32.020> small<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:33.039> it

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
but this thing is really small and it

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.850 
but this thing is really small and it
flies<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.869> just<00:01:35.049> got<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.350> know<00:01:35.380> how<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.710> use

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
flies you just got to know how to use

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.499 
flies you just got to know how to use
you<00:01:36.039> your<00:01:36.399> space<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.030> Shift<00:01:37.330> key<00:01:39.360> all<00:01:40.360> right

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
you your space and Shift key all right

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.450 
you your space and Shift key all right
so<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.720> got<00:01:42.300> four<00:01:43.300> l1<00:01:44.140> thrusters<00:01:44.770> on<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.100> with

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
so I got four l1 thrusters on it with

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.620 
so I got four l1 thrusters on it with
one<00:01:45.729> l2<00:01:46.179> on<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:47.140> front<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.759> then<00:01:49.360> I'm<00:01:49.479> gonna

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
one l2 on the front and then I'm gonna

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:00.270 
one l2 on the front and then I'm gonna
put<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:55.060> one<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:56.619> two<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.880> three<00:01:58.259> L<00:01:59.259> ones<00:01:59.920> on

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
put not one not two with three L ones on

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:12.000 
put not one not two with three L ones on
it<00:02:02.700> we're<00:02:03.700> gonna<00:02:03.789> try<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.149> out

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.759

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
took me all of like three seconds to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.539 
took me all of like three seconds to
figure<00:02:22.519> out<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:26.750> was<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.959> complete<00:02:27.769> piloting

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
figure out that was a complete piloting

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:37.360 
figure out that was a complete piloting
error<00:02:34.450> all<00:02:35.450> right<00:02:35.709> but<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.829> know<00:02:36.919> it's<00:02:36.980> it's

these<00:03:03.260> blocks<00:03:04.540> are<00:03:05.560> half<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.889> weight

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
these blocks are half the weight

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.809 
these blocks are half the weight
oh<00:03:07.989> wait<00:03:08.989> if<00:03:09.139> I<00:03:09.230> do<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.530> then<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:09.919> I<00:03:10.430> can't

see<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:52.800> since<00:03:53.190> my<00:03:53.580> center<00:03:53.849> of<00:03:53.879> gravity<00:03:54.360> is

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
see now since my center of gravity is

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.160 
see now since my center of gravity is
more<00:03:54.660> towards<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.050> front<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:56.420> lifting<00:03:58.459> these

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
more towards the front and lifting these

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.930 
more towards the front and lifting these
thrusters<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.950> lower<00:04:02.129> you<00:04:02.370> put<00:04:02.640> them<00:04:02.930> on<00:04:04.940> your

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
thrusters the lower you put them on your

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.130 
thrusters the lower you put them on your
flier<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.640> more<00:04:08.879> upward<00:04:09.390> movement<00:04:09.989> you'll

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
flier the more upward movement you'll

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.550 
flier the more upward movement you'll
get<00:04:10.410> you'll<00:04:10.650> go<00:04:11.420> you'll<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.780> like<00:04:12.989> at<00:04:13.500> a

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
get you'll go you'll you like at a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.180 
get you'll go you'll you like at a
standstill<00:04:13.950> when<00:04:14.370> you're<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:14.670> pressing<00:04:14.879> W

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
standstill when you're just pressing W

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.229 
standstill when you're just pressing W
it<00:04:17.190> will<00:04:17.459> go<00:04:17.639> up<00:04:18.739> gradually<00:04:19.739> or<00:04:20.130> fastest<00:04:21.120> how

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
it will go up gradually or fastest how

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.200 
it will go up gradually or fastest how
old<00:04:21.479> depending<00:04:22.049> on<00:04:22.460> how<00:04:23.460> much<00:04:23.700> your<00:04:23.910> flyer

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
old depending on how much your flyer

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.040 
old depending on how much your flyer
weighs

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.240 

all<00:04:33.050> right<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.350> still<00:04:33.620> flying<00:04:33.830> pretty<00:04:34.040> good

all right so still flying pretty good

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.890 
all right so still flying pretty good
but<00:04:34.430> see<00:04:34.610> how<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.880> went<00:04:35.000> like<00:04:35.210> straight<00:04:35.870> up

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
but see how it went like straight up

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.160 
but see how it went like straight up
like<00:04:36.170> that<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.880> got<00:04:37.880> too<00:04:38.090> much<00:04:38.270> thrust<00:04:38.630> going

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
like that I got too much thrust going

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.250 
like that I got too much thrust going
upwards<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:42.740> know<00:04:42.830> cuz<00:04:43.040> if<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.580> put<00:04:43.730> my<00:04:43.820> nose

let<00:05:00.830> me<00:05:00.920> try<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.100> level<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.490> out<00:05:04.930> okay<00:05:05.930> maybe<00:05:06.170> it

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
let me try to level it out okay maybe it

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.400 
let me try to level it out okay maybe it
was<00:05:06.500> good<00:05:06.890> as<00:05:07.100> it<00:05:07.250> was<00:05:07.400> before<00:05:07.640> I<00:05:11.410> actually

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
was good as it was before I actually

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.070 
was good as it was before I actually

driver dude so let's go we're gonna

00:05:50.630 --> 00:06:14.659 
driver dude so let's go we're gonna
figure<00:05:50.870> this<00:05:50.990> out<00:05:51.320> together

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:28.740 

still<00:06:15.330> good<00:06:15.509> shots<00:06:16.729> still<00:06:17.729> pulling<00:06:17.970> off<00:06:18.210> shots

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.110 

BAM<00:06:30.370> goes<00:06:31.370> right<00:06:31.400> up

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
BAM goes right up

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.550 
BAM goes right up
I<00:06:33.070> can<00:06:34.070> I<00:06:34.310> can<00:06:34.520> just<00:06:34.790> do<00:06:34.940> this<00:06:35.350> stop<00:06:36.350> for<00:06:36.530> a

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
I can I can just do this stop for a

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.000 
I can I can just do this stop for a
second

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
second

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.110 
second
BAM<00:06:39.400> I'm<00:06:40.400> out<00:06:40.580> of<00:06:40.610> there

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
BAM I'm out of there

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.890 
BAM I'm out of there
out<00:06:41.750> of<00:06:41.930> there<00:06:42.020> son<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:44.090> it<00:06:44.180> goes<00:06:44.270> down<00:06:44.510> great

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
out of there son and it goes down great

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.060 
out of there son and it goes down great
and<00:06:45.290> here<00:06:45.620> we<00:06:45.710> go

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
and here we go

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.420 
and here we go
there's<00:06:46.700> a<00:06:46.790> lot<00:06:46.940> of<00:06:46.970> lift<00:06:47.980> so<00:06:48.980> you<00:06:49.010> can<00:06:49.190> catch

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
there's a lot of lift so you can catch

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.780 
there's a lot of lift so you can catch
yourself<00:06:49.580> feel<00:06:50.330> I<00:06:50.420> guess<00:06:50.600> and<00:06:50.930> yeah<00:06:51.670> it's<00:06:52.670> got

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
yourself feel I guess and yeah it's got

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.970 
yourself feel I guess and yeah it's got
a<00:06:52.820> really<00:06:53.060> good<00:06:53.180> turning<00:06:53.480> radius<00:06:53.780> all<00:06:54.500> right

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:03.040 

so<00:07:00.400> that's<00:07:01.400> the<00:07:01.700> entire<00:07:01.820> guide<00:07:02.300> how<00:07:02.660> to<00:07:02.720> build

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
so that's the entire guide how to build

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.760 
so that's the entire guide how to build
a<00:07:03.140> simple<00:07:03.320> airplane<00:07:04.540> you<00:07:05.540> can<00:07:05.750> add<00:07:05.990> armor<00:07:06.560> to

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
a simple airplane you can add armor to

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.390 
a simple airplane you can add armor to
it<00:07:07.150> you<00:07:08.150> know<00:07:08.350> this<00:07:09.350> is<00:07:09.500> basically<00:07:09.950> the<00:07:10.190> shape

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
it you know this is basically the shape

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.910 
it you know this is basically the shape
that<00:07:10.430> I<00:07:10.640> started<00:07:11.060> out<00:07:11.210> with<00:07:11.450> I<00:07:11.690> had<00:07:12.410> big<00:07:12.620> I<00:07:12.800> had

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:12.920 
that I started out with I had big I had

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.710 
that I started out with I had big I had
and<00:07:13.130> higher<00:07:13.310> tier<00:07:13.610> thrusters<00:07:14.180> though<00:07:14.390> so<00:07:14.690> I

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
and higher tier thrusters though so I

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.890 
and higher tier thrusters though so I
had<00:07:14.990> one<00:07:15.890> big<00:07:16.160> one<00:07:16.370> here<00:07:16.880> and<00:07:17.090> then<00:07:17.660> two

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
had one big one here and then two

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.860 
had one big one here and then two
smaller<00:07:18.260> ones<00:07:18.620> on<00:07:19.100> the<00:07:19.670> side<00:07:19.880> but<00:07:20.480> all<00:07:20.690> around

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
smaller ones on the side but all around

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:27.610 
smaller ones on the side but all around
the<00:07:21.260> pilot's<00:07:21.830> seat<00:07:22.480> I<00:07:25.240> don't<00:07:26.240> really<00:07:26.450> use<00:07:26.810> in

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
the pilot's seat I don't really use in

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.340 
the pilot's seat I don't really use in
terms<00:07:28.070> of<00:07:28.370> radar<00:07:28.790> receivers<00:07:29.300> I<00:07:29.630> just<00:07:30.140> use<00:07:30.320> a

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.350 
terms of radar receivers I just use a

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.370 
terms of radar receivers I just use a
jammer<00:07:30.710> and<00:07:30.980> a<00:07:31.160> radar<00:07:31.370> I<00:07:31.810> can<00:07:32.810> usually<00:07:32.990> just

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:33.380 
jammer and a radar I can usually just

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:42.110 
jammer and a radar I can usually just
pop<00:07:33.800> this

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.760 

put<00:07:43.050> that<00:07:43.200> there<00:07:43.260> and<00:07:43.800> you<00:07:43.950> put<00:07:44.669> a<00:07:44.700> a<00:07:45.770> jammer

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:46.770 
put that there and you put a a jammer

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.420 
put that there and you put a a jammer
back<00:07:47.040> here<00:07:47.480> and<00:07:48.480> you're<00:07:48.600> all<00:07:48.690> good<00:07:48.930> to<00:07:49.050> go<00:07:49.430> you

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.430 
back here and you're all good to go you

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.710 
back here and you're all good to go you
won't<00:07:50.550> really<00:07:50.790> need<00:07:51.090> to<00:07:51.180> see<00:07:51.360> what<00:07:51.570> your

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 
won't really need to see what your

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.590 
won't really need to see what your
allies<00:07:52.050> can<00:07:52.320> see<00:07:52.500> because<00:07:52.910> ground<00:07:53.910> units<00:07:54.330> need

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:54.600 
allies can see because ground units need

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.590 
allies can see because ground units need
that<00:07:54.919> block<00:07:55.919> to<00:07:56.700> see<00:07:56.910> what<00:07:57.300> Flyers<00:07:57.660> can<00:07:58.050> see<00:07:58.580> so

00:07:59.590 --> 00:07:59.600 
that block to see what Flyers can see so

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.879 
that block to see what Flyers can see so
you<00:08:00.600> don't<00:08:00.780> need<00:08:00.900> one<00:08:01.080> it's<00:08:01.260> just<00:08:01.410> a<00:08:01.500> waste<00:08:01.740> of

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:01.889 
you don't need one it's just a waste of

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.320 
you don't need one it's just a waste of
that<00:08:01.950> so<00:08:02.310> you<00:08:02.370> can<00:08:02.490> put<00:08:02.610> more<00:08:02.790> guns<00:08:03.090> on<00:08:03.300> it

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:03.330 
that so you can put more guns on it

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.879 
that so you can put more guns on it
relative<00:08:03.810> to<00:08:03.990> putting<00:08:04.230> another<00:08:04.500> radar

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:04.889 
relative to putting another radar

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:07.670 
relative to putting another radar
receiver<00:08:05.280> on<00:08:05.430> ever<00:08:05.630> not<00:08:06.630> another<00:08:06.930> just<00:08:07.560> a

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 
receiver on ever not another just a

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.830 
receiver on ever not another just a
radar<00:08:08.160> receiver<00:08:08.430> all<00:08:09.210> right<00:08:09.330> I<00:08:09.389> hope<00:08:09.660> that

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 
radar receiver all right I hope that

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.150 
radar receiver all right I hope that
