00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
coached on was at the energy bus back

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.930 
coached on was at the energy bus back
way<00:03:30.350> when<00:03:30.590> we<00:03:30.680> started<00:03:31.070> my<00:03:31.430> word<00:03:31.579> for<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.760> was

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
way when we started my word for that was

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.660 
way when we started my word for that was
consistency<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.920> think<00:03:33.920> my<00:03:34.340> senior<00:03:34.640> year

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
consistency and I think my senior year

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.460 
consistency and I think my senior year
was<00:03:34.910> anything<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:35.329> consistent<00:03:35.870> but<00:03:35.989> when<00:03:36.410> I

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
was anything but consistent but when I

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.750 
was anything but consistent but when I
was<00:03:36.590> out<00:03:36.709> there<00:03:36.829> on<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.010> field<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.340> felt<00:03:37.549> like<00:03:37.610> I

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
was out there on the field I felt like I

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.400 
was out there on the field I felt like I
was<00:03:37.940> pretty<00:03:38.450> consistent<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:38.989> i<00:03:39.049> have<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.260> say

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
was pretty consistent so i have to say

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.199 
was pretty consistent so i have to say
consistent<00:03:40.040> was<00:03:40.190> almost<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.549> year<00:03:40.820> turned<00:03:41.090> out

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209
