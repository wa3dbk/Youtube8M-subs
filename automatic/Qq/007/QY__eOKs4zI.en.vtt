lights<00:00:11.040> up<00:00:11.190> we're<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.519> outside<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
lights up we're on the outside the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.030 
lights up we're on the outside the
windows<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.300> my<00:00:12.420> house<00:00:12.599> I'm<00:00:13.049> experimenting

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
windows of my house I'm experimenting

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.460 
windows of my house I'm experimenting
with<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.519> different<00:00:15.420> siding<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:16.350> not

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
with some different siding I'm not

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.570 
with some different siding I'm not
really<00:00:16.560> sure<00:00:16.800> what<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.100> called<00:00:17.400> it's

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
really sure what this is called it's

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
really sure what this is called it's
it's<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.390> vinyl<00:00:19.230> plastic<00:00:19.830> or<00:00:19.980> siding<00:00:20.390> strips

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
it's a vinyl plastic or siding strips

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.140 
it's a vinyl plastic or siding strips
I<00:00:21.630> guess<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:22.529> hold<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.670> siding<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
I guess they hold the the siding on the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.519 
I guess they hold the the siding on the
house<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.930> anyways<00:00:25.320> I'm<00:00:25.410> not

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
house or what have you anyways I'm not

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.810 
house or what have you anyways I'm not
really<00:00:25.710> exactly<00:00:26.010> sure<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.430> piece<00:00:26.699> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
really exactly sure what this piece is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.269 
really exactly sure what this piece is
called<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.150> was<00:00:27.269> $5.00<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
called it was $5.00 and I think it was a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.590 
called it was $5.00 and I think it was a
10-foot<00:00:29.670> length<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:31.369> contemplating<00:00:32.369> on

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
10-foot length and I'm contemplating on

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
10-foot length and I'm contemplating on
see<00:00:33.600> if<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.899> trim<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.559> shove<00:00:35.190> some

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
see if I can trim it down and shove some

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.830 
see if I can trim it down and shove some
lights<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.850> see<00:00:35.969> how<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.329> get

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
lights in there and see how I can get

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.950 
lights in there and see how I can get
the<00:00:36.989> space<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:38.219> easier<00:00:39.059> removal<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.899> off

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the space for easier removal on and off

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
the space for easier removal on and off
the<00:00:40.170> windows<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> home<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the windows of the home so this is a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.030 
the windows of the home so this is a
piece<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.360> bought<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
piece that I just bought I'm going to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
piece that I just bought I'm going to
see<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.420> I'll<00:00:45.719> get

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
see what I can do with it so I'll get

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.580 
see what I can do with it so I'll get
back<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> minute

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
back in a minute

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.400 
back in a minute
when<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.770> experiment<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> bit<00:00:48.140> okay<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.320> this

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
when I experiment a bit okay for this

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.490 
when I experiment a bit okay for this
test<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.460> took<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> table<00:00:51.270> saw<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
test I just took the table saw and I

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.549 
test I just took the table saw and I
trimmed<00:00:53.340> off<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> edges<00:00:54.360> around<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
trimmed off all the edges around the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680 
trimmed off all the edges around the
outside<00:00:55.980> which<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> difficult

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
outside which was kind of difficult

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.680 
outside which was kind of difficult
because<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.410> kind<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.120> flimsy<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.359> work<00:01:00.510> with

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
because it's kind of flimsy to work with

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.000 
because it's kind of flimsy to work with
it<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.410> bit<00:01:01.530> dangerous<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it it's a little bit dangerous so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.340 
it it's a little bit dangerous so
anyways<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:03.539> wasn't<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:04.080> happy

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
anyways I really wasn't really happy

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.420 
anyways I really wasn't really happy
with<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> outcome<00:01:04.589> either<00:01:04.949> because<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> didn't

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
with the outcome either because I didn't

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
with the outcome either because I didn't
really<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.880> enough<00:01:06.150> material<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.750> didn't

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
really have enough material I didn't

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.289 
really have enough material I didn't
think<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.610> screwing<00:01:08.610> holes<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:09.060> but

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
think for screwing holes down but

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.520 
think for screwing holes down but
anyways<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.369> did<00:01:11.369> manage<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.420> put<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:13.290> set

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
anyways I did manage to put in one set

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.550 
anyways I did manage to put in one set
of<00:01:13.650> lights<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> try<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> then

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
of lights here just to try it and then

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.120 
of lights here just to try it and then
basically<00:01:16.759> what<00:01:17.759> goes<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.830> it's<00:01:19.830> just

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
basically what goes in for you it's just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
basically what goes in for you it's just
some<00:01:20.250> purple<00:01:21.210> ones<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.540> had<00:01:21.659> left<00:01:21.869> over

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
some purple ones that I had left over

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.920 
some purple ones that I had left over
from<00:01:22.140> Halloween<00:01:22.490> but<00:01:23.490> basically<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.630> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
from Halloween but basically that's it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
from Halloween but basically that's it
and<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.680> next<00:01:25.920> clip<00:01:26.070> I'll<00:01:26.220> show<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and the next clip I'll show you is a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.030 
and the next clip I'll show you is a
purple<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.930> orange<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.579> strip<00:01:29.820> ties<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
purple and orange with the strip ties is

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.649 
purple and orange with the strip ties is
which<00:01:32.040> would<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.310> basically<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.299> same<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.630> I

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
which would be basically the same one I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.109 
which would be basically the same one I
showed<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.900> before<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.220> I'm<00:01:35.520> thinking<00:01:36.030> about

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
showed you before so I'm thinking about

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
showed you before so I'm thinking about
leaving<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.400> fitting

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
leaving it as is and then just fitting

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.649 
leaving it as is and then just fitting
in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.630> various<00:01:40.490> colors<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.329> thinking

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
in the various colors and I'm thinking

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.030 
in the various colors and I'm thinking
about<00:01:42.869> maybe<00:01:43.140> four<00:01:43.560> or<00:01:43.590> five<00:01:45.860> strands<00:01:46.860> per

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
about maybe four or five strands per

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.999 
about maybe four or five strands per
section<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> probably<00:01:49.140> three<00:01:49.380> inches<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
section and probably three inches but I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340 
section and probably three inches but I
would<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.189> stagger<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.600> bulb<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.229> all

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
would just stagger the bulb so they all

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.010 
would just stagger the bulb so they all
fit<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.460> anyways<00:01:53.700> I'll<00:01:53.820> show<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.450> next

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
fit so anyways I'll show you the next
