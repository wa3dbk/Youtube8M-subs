if you ever run into a hardware issue
they<00:00:04.230> can<00:00:04.290> sometimes<00:00:04.620> be<00:00:04.950> difficult<00:00:05.670> to

they can sometimes be difficult to
troubleshoot<00:00:06.049> especially<00:00:07.049> if<00:00:07.290> it's<00:00:07.500> a

troubleshoot especially if it's a
problem<00:00:07.890> with<00:00:08.520> bad<00:00:08.820> memory<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.570> occasionally

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
problem with bad memory and occasionally

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.500 
problem with bad memory and occasionally
you'll<00:00:10.380> find<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.950> part<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.849> memory<00:00:12.240> module

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
you'll find a part of a memory module

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.629 
you'll find a part of a memory module
that<00:00:13.019> isn't<00:00:13.410> working<00:00:13.620> quite<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.490> might

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
that isn't working quite as you might

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.490 
that isn't working quite as you might
expect<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.240> system<00:00:15.420> might<00:00:15.719> boot<00:00:15.929> up<00:00:16.110> it<00:00:16.320> might

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
expect the system might boot up it might

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
expect the system might boot up it might
work<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:17.009> a<00:00:17.040> little<00:00:17.279> bit<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.640> then<00:00:18.150> when<00:00:18.240> you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
work for a little bit and then when you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.390 
work for a little bit and then when you
really<00:00:18.510> start<00:00:18.869> using<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.859> happen<00:00:20.190> to<00:00:20.220> get

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
really start using it you happen to get

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
really start using it you happen to get
an<00:00:20.550> odd<00:00:20.789> error<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> might<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.840> useful<00:00:21.990> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
an odd error so it might be useful to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.279 
an odd error so it might be useful to

launch it from your installation media
or<00:01:00.930> find<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.649> inside<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.219> Windows

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
or find it right inside your Windows

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
or find it right inside your Windows
environment<00:01:03.149> by<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
environment by going to the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.469 
environment by going to the
Administrative<00:01:04.979> Tools<00:01:05.160> and<00:01:05.489> finding<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
memory diagnostic icon right there this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
memory diagnostic icon right there this
is<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> relatively<00:01:10.890> easy<00:01:11.010> utility<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> use

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
is a relatively easy utility to use

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.030 
is a relatively easy utility to use
because<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.780> doing<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.530> work<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
because it's doing all of the work and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.310 
because it's doing all of the work and
usually<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.610> memory<00:01:14.939> diagnostic<00:01:15.689> takes<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> bit

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
usually a memory diagnostic takes a bit

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.499 
usually a memory diagnostic takes a bit
of<00:01:16.439> time<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.920> run<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.640> start<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.360> my

you'll<00:01:23.070> find<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> memory<00:01:23.670> diagnostic<00:01:24.479> tool

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
you'll find the memory diagnostic tool

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.450 
you'll find the memory diagnostic tool

time<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.740> start<00:01:41.130> my<00:01:41.250> computer<00:01:41.820> well<00:01:41.970> let's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
time I start my computer well let's

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.460 
time I start my computer well let's
demonstrate<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
demonstrate this now I'm going to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.649 
demonstrate this now I'm going to
restart<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:43.920> system<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> run<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
restart my system and have it run the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.380 
restart my system and have it run the
memory<00:01:45.990> check<00:01:46.229> right<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:46.939> when<00:01:47.939> your<00:01:48.060> system

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
memory check right now when your system

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.690 
memory check right now when your system

starts up eating immediately goes into
the<00:01:51.420> memory<00:01:51.630> diagnostics<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.040> also

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the memory diagnostics and you can also

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
the memory diagnostics and you can also
change<00:01:53.790> some<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.390> settings<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.960> in

basic standard or extended set of tests

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.959 
basic standard or extended set of tests
and<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.860> change<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> cache<00:02:02.579> whether

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
and you can change the cache whether

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.639 
and you can change the cache whether
you're<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.390> turn<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.780> cache<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.259> for

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you're going to turn the cache on for

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
you're going to turn the cache on for
all<00:02:04.799> tests<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.490> cache<00:02:05.729> off<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.600> tests

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.749 
all tests or the cache off for all tests
and<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.560> set<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> number<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> passes<00:02:08.729> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and then set the number of passes that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.969 
and then set the number of passes that
you<00:02:09.000> might<00:02:09.329> want<00:02:09.660> maybe<00:02:10.319> you'd<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> have

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you might want maybe you'd like to have

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.470 
you might want maybe you'd like to have
this<00:02:11.160> run<00:02:11.430> through<00:02:11.670> 10<00:02:11.879> different<00:02:12.300> passes

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
this run through 10 different passes

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.510 
this run through 10 different passes
maybe<00:02:13.080> you'd<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.530> set<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.040> infinite

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
maybe you'd like to set it for infinite

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.020 
maybe you'd like to set it for infinite
number<00:02:14.790> of

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
number of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.480 
number of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
houses so it continues to run until you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.790 
houses so it continues to run until you
decide<00:02:17.880> when<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.209> stop<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.350> case<00:02:19.590> I'm

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
decide when to stop so in this case I'm

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.830 
decide when to stop so in this case I'm
going<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.100> set<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.520> test<00:02:20.730> mix<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.300> extended

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
going to set the test mix to extended

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.480 
going to set the test mix to extended
will<00:02:21.990> turn<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.319> cash<00:02:22.530> off<00:02:22.800> we'll<00:02:23.069> just<00:02:23.280> run<00:02:23.430> a

will turn the cash off we'll just run a

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.430 
will turn the cash off we'll just run a
two<00:02:23.730> pass<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:24.690> I'm<00:02:24.810> done<00:02:24.990> I'm<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.350> to
