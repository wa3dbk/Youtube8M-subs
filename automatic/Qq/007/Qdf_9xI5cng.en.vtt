00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.120
 hello guys in this tutorial we'll see 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.610
 how to turn around and then inverting the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.000
 spin direction in technical jargon 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.760
 this is called hills today 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.440
 we will have a basic one and then start in 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.829
 next tutorials to study of 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:59.510
 variations and advanced then we can 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:02.239
 starting from a 6 a time seems action e 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.909
 start trying to understand right away 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.830
 this type of spin 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.260
 in fact if we know it well we can 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:15.200
 note that there is a time when yours 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.259
 damage to the inclusion of calais by searching 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.500
 to identify it because it serves us indeed 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.270
 it is at this moment that we can 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.020
 go to the next step or 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:35.510
 join wrists and bring them to the side of the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:39.260
 our part so then they fall I join 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.360
 the wrists and brings them both to one side 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:48.860
 of the right body is in the sense is 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:51.770
 indifferent then tech track and the 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.190
 I let this movement commute 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.930
 implies that I make an endowment of 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.280
 90 degrees 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.060
 ok of the body then from a plain uil him 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.890
 I find the wall klein for a second 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.460
 now once I'm in this 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.530
 position 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.490
 I have enough drive to 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.110
 and then pull up and continue in one 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.600
 spin on the other tech side 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.870
 then when we find on the then 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.900
 on the other hand the direction of play is 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.739
 in fact changed while I was playing in 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.260
 forward 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.260
 but we would like to play backwards 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.190
 then step 1 and then fall 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 step 2 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:51.220
 often both arms in one 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:54.280
 direction en plein step 3 withdrawal 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.610
 then sending them both to one side 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.470
 the body is my game in one in a 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.260
 feel back when he started 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.190
 to combine these three steps in a manner 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.030
 fluid 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.030
 here is the result 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:27.580
 ok so basically this ruiz is 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.080
 composed of one a world perspective 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:36.190
 plan in front used to then switch to 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.630
 a work lane to reverse the game in which 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.630
 the plain but from the other direction 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:49.930
 1 2 and 3 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:53.040
 perfect I find myself had to play all 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.720
 back and so now let's see how 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.390
 move from an English game to ha 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.840
 in front while he but just then 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:07.890
 the impression we now had was falling 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.890
 to look for is that then go up tech 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.880
 we are going to take advantage of this now with 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:20.140
 the time to do the same thing as 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.830
 first break the wells and then in one 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.580
 direction 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:28.240
 now left and find a web well 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:34.660
 then trying 90 degrees then and then 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:37.180
 they rise exploit and we do not now 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.400
 he runs a lot of the fact if they continue 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.650
 to look for it pendulum the important thing is to understand 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.650
 the moment when we have to turn around 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.330
 now i wish i'm here not 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.970
 they left the region then to make you 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.620
 understand the movements but as we follow 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.080
 the trick and then continue to be high 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.100
 since from here having started from this 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.060
 side will now have to go down the other and a 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:17.020
 find ourselves playing forward again 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:20.550
 then step 1 is 2 ball plein 3 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.260
 freeing the game from the other side 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.130
 even here cleaning the movement in 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.419
 fluid manner 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.419
 the result is this one 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:48.930
 hi tech ok a bit of suggestions that 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.950
 I see this is the beginning of this 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.430
 then if you look at this tricks in 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.430
 frontal mode 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.810
 meanwhile you can see how the wrists are 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.420
 go together a common error indeed 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.330
 is to try to turn around leaving 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.750
 a then in the native side 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.970
 but no we have to bring them together and it is 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.320
 interesting the question of gender a 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.320
 right or left 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.310
 in fact in the tutorial I turn around only in 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.090
 one direction and then to return c 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:40.140
 instead I can play the same game 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:43.560
 both directions of the body that them 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:46.200
 can also allow you to play wheels 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.900
 have completely cooked this way 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.650
 here for example I say to go towards 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.350
 left instead of returning path goes 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:58.520
 so done here or I'll go to the other one 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.520
 part why 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.430
 with such 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.050
 to train 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.919
 this was the first tutorial dedicated to 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:28.150
 reds in the next we will see one 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.310
 variation but probably more 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.620
 important involving this type of 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.430
 game applied within the evening 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.430
 thank you
