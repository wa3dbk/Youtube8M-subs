00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello to everyone, people welcome 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.119
 welcome to a new spore video 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.330
 let's create more creatures come come 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.610
 and today the subject is going to be the insects I'm going 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.449
 to great try to create a kind of 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:31.109
 insects that are mutants are evil epic 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.970
 or I do not know to see what comes out first 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.059
 place I think I'm going to create a spider in 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.150
 the truth because spiders always give 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.370
 that fear everyone has them like that 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.370
 that we are going to create a deadly spider 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.400
 all right 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.310
 well what do you think that you think that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 you think the super spider could run 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.620
 as if it were a horse 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.850
 ta ta ta na 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.210
 the spider horse I decided to call her 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.910
 spider what happened has been fun 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.580
 because he spits out at everyone who chases him 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.970
 that is bigger than her by the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.100
 poison and now cushion also this also 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.600
 for itself there is a larger eagle than 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.360
 she that I doubt it because it measures two meters 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.370
 I can not take it because 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.510
 he has not even the skewers to defend himself 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.680
 see to see what our 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.100
 spider robotic dance hey if we're going to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.400
 a half to see to see will breakdance 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.890
 but it will be for this team that to see how 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.100
 do truth with that prick that comes 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.100
 come on 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.350
 or 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.350
 what kind of load 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.440
 Attack Attack Look I'll teach you what 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.440
 only one that can kill my spider is 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.580
 with pieces I think this time it will be 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.750
 stiff man, how good is it, although yes 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 although it is a bit scary but good 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.280
 let's create another kitchen in second 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.440

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.360

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.530
 it's Peter that has a knife and what 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.180
 happens is that this is more dead face 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.210
 because it has more arms plus blades 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.040
 more danger and more spikes all over the 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.700

 the couriers of the ciborium let's see the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.900
 mouth that comes 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:57.240
 oh my god too hurry malignant 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.300
 and something 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.120
 but also hatred 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.790
 comfort 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.440
 that's what he does to intimidate 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.209
 all its prisoners no one can escape to 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.069
 she because she has a running paw 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.769
 very much so that nobody attacks me for 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.190
 the back and the blades in the hands 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.010
 Well, it has six arms, let's leave it 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.780
 practically infallible and good after 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.880
 of having created our super mante 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.449
 knife let's go create the last 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.550
 thing the last super insect that I say 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.400
 that try to make me that I am a 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.540
 butterfly or a worm or something like that already 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.540
 You will see what comes out 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:15.400
 with god that gives me laugh but what kind of 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.220
 butterflies and you're

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.800
 like god has called it trip worm 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.930
 a mix between travel and worm so 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.580
 As you can see, it looks like a jet plane 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.979
 has multiple helicopter blades here 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.810
 has butterfly wings is to travel 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.699

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.070
 fly in a hunt on a hyper plane 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.470

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.380
 will take you wherever you want me

 I go in the worm could look for what 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.270
