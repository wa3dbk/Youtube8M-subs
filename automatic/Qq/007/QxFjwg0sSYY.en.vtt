00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.560
 lead to more powerful ones 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.130
 in small towns we can

 converse with its inhabitants to 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.329

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.959
 something the game life although they are not very 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.959
 numerous 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.120
 and miku light is a fundamental part of 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.860
 the adventure since it has several uses we 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.020
 allows to interact with certain areas 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.120
 of the scenario to locate spheres of 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.250
 colors that recover vitality or magic 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.410
 solve puzzles by using your 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.970
 light and stop the enemies during the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.770
 exploration to avoid them or 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.740
 surprise them to have the first 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.660
 action in the fighting during the 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.699
 battles can also interact with 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.009
 the environment to get more vitality 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.990
 or magic as well as slow down the progress of 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.229
 the enemies in the timeline of 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.000
 recover energy from our character 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.860
 when performing actions without vehicles 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.050
 losing vitality for what we have 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.699
 that collect spheres so that he recovers 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.699
 although you should not abuse your power 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.750
 child of light has a mode 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.150
 local cooperative where one of the two 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.440
 players drive vehicles to serve 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.440
 of support to the main character 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.610
 the game is quite simple in its 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.560
 normal difficulty so 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.870
 we recommend starting in difficult the 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.690
 treating their difficulties to all kinds 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.340
 of players when we complete the 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.770
 adventure also appears a game 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.600
 new plus that allows us to keep what 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.370
 obtained at the end of the adventure and that 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.370
 increasing the power of enemies 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.039
 although its translation into Spanish is 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.199
 pretty good with dialogues written in 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.759
 verse lose some grace when trying 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.759
 square them with the original texts 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.730
 graphically it is a very striking title 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.610
 in all its aspects with a section 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.290
 superb artistic the graphic engine will 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.540
 has allowed the company to perform 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.690
 Live illustrations in both characters 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.760
 as in its spectacular scenarios it 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.310
 moves with a lot of fluidity in all the 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.730
 platforms in addition to running at 1080p 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.410
 in consoles of new generation ipc their 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.370
 Load times between screens are 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.370
 pretty short 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.810
 the sound also enjoys a very large 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.340
 quality with melodies that adapt in 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.860
 every moment to the different situations 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.360
 that are given throughout the adventure and the 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.920
 narrator's voice in full 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.410
 Spanish since the rest of the 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.770
 characters do not have voices so alone 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:59.700
 with subtitles the effects are also 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.700
 really got 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.710
 in conclusion the software dow fly to 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.780
 simple sight enters through the eyes due to 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.639
 its great artistic and graphic design 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.699
 always accompanied by melodies that 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.560
 harmonize perfection with what we see 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:19.060
 fluency and simple controls make 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.060
 that is very easy to manage 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.590
 his turn-based battle system is 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.600
 classic style although it brings some 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.900
 news and curiosities that make it 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.970
 very entertaining fun and strategic the 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.920
 incorporation of vehicles to perform 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.780
 Certain actions give variety to your 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.850
 playability either for exploration 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.850
 of scenarios or in the puzzles 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.250
 the story and its characters are 

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.870
 quite improvable in some aspects 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.850
 but for its price it is not a game 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:08:00.099
 highly recommended for lovers 

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.099
 of the adventures and the rpg by turns
