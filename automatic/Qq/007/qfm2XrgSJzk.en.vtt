 appeared thanks to my brother who 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.090
 when we were small could not 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.120

 laugh nickname how a long time 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.609
 I stuck to me a lot 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.619
 positive memories of the game in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.159
 street football with their cousins 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.170
 In Brazil, football is everywhere the first days 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:40.019
 school my mom called 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.299
 teacher and said your son is different 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.940
 from the rest of the children he has expressed 

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:47.399
 talent for playing football if you allow 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.089
 I would recommend you to write 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.749
 him on my football classes it is very 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.459
 liked it and now like football 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:01:00.690
 always brought displeasure 

00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:04.530
 this is my hobby this is a gift that is me 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.329
 endowed the bean and I am very very grateful 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.380
 for that and whenever i could play 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.479
 with my friends i was very pleased i 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.429
 went to school in the morning the rest of the day 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.119
 playing football so little by little football became 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.119
 my career 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.110
 when I was exactly 15 I realized that I 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.520
 I want to be a football player 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.230
 I told myself I will dedicate this all my 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.220
 time to become professional 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:43.570
 as a player, I knew what to run into 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.310
 difficulties since thousands of young people 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.220
 same as me 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.220
 want to become football professionals 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.340
 big competition who knows what 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.869
 will be but I decided I will try to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.869
 all forces had not been 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.870
 the coach called me and said this from the edge 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.160
 on the bench of professional players 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:20.030
 honestly i didn't expect it then he called 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.550
 I never imagined me playing 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.310
 imagine that I can play in the final 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.400
 only 18 year olds stadium 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.310
 was crowded at the stadium was 80 thousand 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.300
 viewers I went on the field and during the game 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.300
 I scored two goals 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.330
 with these two goals sÃ£o paulo left 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.170
 for the status of champion in the Rio tournament 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.170
 sao paulo 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.690
 but I did not know that these two goals 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.000
 completely changed my life because 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.900
 the next day my house was surrounded 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.030
 by reporters 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.750
 people wanted to know who I am and what I am 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.760
 doing what I live and much more 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:08.090
 that's how my story is literally 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.519
 changed in just one day then 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.940
 what happened to me in the 17 year old 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.370
 boys forgot two goals in the final game 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.880
 I do not even know how to describe it was so much 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.070
 emotions that i couldn't even sleep i 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.560
 I looked through all the newspapers and photo games 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.390
 goal photo is fantastic 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.390
 I woke up a star 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.750
 I never imagined that I can 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.530
 achieve all this i became a legend like 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.800
 football player 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.340
 I achieved just in a flash imagine 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.320
 in an instant in 2007 which is still 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.950
 long remains the best year in my 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.260
 career 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.050
 then I got the title of the best 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.720
 soccer player of the world 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.700
 I was injured with a pubic bone and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.250
 left knee problem 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:08.790
 which I had to operate on 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.450
 fight for your health for physical 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:19.400
 strength and the ability to be back in the game 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:22.670
 Moscow I have no fear I believe that 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.360
 difficulties will sing or 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.820
 especially in moments of injury because in 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.030
 that time you are limited in your 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.030
 opportunities 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.820
 there are many questions that are few 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.980
 answers and some 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.750
 uncertainty I did not know what will happen to 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.420
 me six months after surgery 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:53.930
 i don't know i didn't know what state i am 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.540
 I will be as I will undergo rehabilitation 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.850
 will I play again will the stones be back 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.420
 former health 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:07.650
 tags yes I didn't know if I would continue 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:11.060
 their fight for it or not many many 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.520
 questions on learned to live daily 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.500
 waiting and knowing that god is bread for me 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.700
 every day I believe that at any moment 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.990
 everything will change 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.290
 I have a few phrases that I 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.889
 telling other people telling myself 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:31.620
 one of them i belong to jesus 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.740
 I always wear this phrase on my own 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.749
 t-shirts during the most significant 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.749
 moments in my professional career 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.499
 this is an easy way to tell the world about 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.499
 that i belong to jesus 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.020
 i will tell you how we live in the world 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.080
 football we always compete between 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.610
 a victory has primacy here 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.960
 great value because at the moment and 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.259
 reflections on the word of God 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.889
 moments of searching something always remains 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.979
 with me 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.530
 Jesus comes first because even 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.830
 when i play against others i think about 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.930
 tom to win i believe that 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.639
 jesus is much more important than all of this 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.190
 more important than winning or losing during 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:32.819
 games are more important than winning the championship 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:36.900
 or defeat in it in my whole life 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:39.150
 jesus comes first because i wear 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:44.580
 this idea with you throughout the game 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:46.560
 Jesus comes first I think the family 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.259
 this is one of the most beautiful things 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.900
 which god gave us on earth i have a lot 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.669
 learned thanks to my children because i 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.529
 I see a lot of parallels in that dagblog 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:59.849
 treats us and i think love 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:05.430
 unconditional love and which is 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:08.430
 part of something big i think its measure 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.830
 much more still our measure is love 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:14.279
 given to us so that we learn and 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.639
 understand at least partially that his love 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.639
 unlimited 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:26.819
 i learn a lot i learned to live knowing that 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:31.949
 faith is in many situations of understanding 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:34.250
 the fact that god controls everything even when 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:37.560
 everything goes wrong as we would like 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:40.259
 because today I also see today 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.889
 that there is someone better and tomorrow will be 

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:47.069
 someone else is better and in a day more and more 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:50.099
 and so on and in life there is success but no 

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:52.639
 nothing and no one else god no such 

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:52.639
 like God 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.150
 if i'm riccardo language dream dos santos 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.400
 personally 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.400
 as well you and 2
