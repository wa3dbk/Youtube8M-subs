00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.890
 hey as anna my crumbs i am talent and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.519
 before starting the video I would like 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.380
 ask them how they are like this is how 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.110
 they are how they feel right now they are 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.269
 I taste good what good for people 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.740
 from spain that also follows me how 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.999
 I hope you are getting up early because 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.349
 I would be very late at the time you are 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.449
 watching the video if they are from Spain 'un 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.579
 I greet all the people over there or good 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.220
 good night good evening what 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.899
 I hope you are having a good time 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.250
 that before I start the top I love them 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.580
 say that this top is going to be very 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.160
 different because it's not top 5 that's how it is 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.140
 it will not be a top 5 stunts that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.910
 are going to see below are the 5 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 better this week but they are not going to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.250
 be classified and classified all 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 I liked them and the truth is that I did not want 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.410
 label them with the 5 the 4 the 3rd and the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 1 for me, they are all great right now 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.220
 what are you going to see and I hope you understand 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.530
 why this top is called top 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.690
 all good 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 so fine to start with the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.280
 number 1 we're going to have Mr. Bache 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.080
 that based on a very good croatia 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.000
 so fast that you are going to know what 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.250
 wave see how it grabs a rail gives the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.170
 back and he arrives here but he did what 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.759
 they got to see me do not either 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.009
 know the first one but seeing it from 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.860
 again the video see what it does grab 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.440
 the rail and who knows how it grabs a 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.840
 twig that is an impulse to give you the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.149
 height needed to get up here 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.909
 the class is amazing, see how well 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.770
 new with that rail and with that turn that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.539
 makes nothing gives you the impetus to 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.340
 get me up was a stunt 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.740
 magnificent of mister bat hd 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.109
 so going with the others of the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.329
 numbers 1 we're going to have 1 already what 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.299
 we all know that it's called the vector 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.920
 13 and he is not exactly 13 years old but 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.990
 if he does some very good stunts and very 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.689
 crazy what you're going to do here is do 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.310
 one of the spots that he invented and 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.350
 that he created because when to send 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.380
 messages to croatia told me spot 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.030
 found by me grabs there's a bounce 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.560
 of a barrier and it will reach a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.590
 parking that we had never before 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.360
 seen but unfortunately the vÃ­ctor is 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.789
 it is a bit short and does not enter 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.980
 perfectly but for making a spot 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.989
 public and for doing something new in this 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.150
 top we give you the opportunity of the victor 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.640
 I wish I had gone in there perfect but 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.180
 well I'm not demanding and thank you very much 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.180
 he vctor 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.690
 in the next stand we will have to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.310
 nando youtube team is also another 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.810
 the really cool shelves that I've been 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.940
 sending lately we had not 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.349
 seen but how good it comes back and the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.180
 this week's stand is also 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.580
 amazing because it grabs a bounce of a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.590
 almost impossible place in real life 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.000
 it will be impossible sincerely does all 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.920
 these studies in real life I do not think 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 that are possible but see there with that 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.480
 barrier is that narrowness that has 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.250
 grab the necessary this did not have to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.049
 having the front side had to see 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.910
 with that narrowness to get here 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.910
 Above the roof it looks very good 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.390
 in the next acrobatics we will see 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.069
 next acrobatics walk in the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.930
 next acrobatics let's have edu 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.569
 mix 21 who is going to be one of those 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.760
 epic stunts that they spend in the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.890
 air longer than you 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.599
 they sleep like this so this recording 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.969
 let's put it in fast camera and 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.159
 They know this is not a facelift and trick 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:19.650
 that check anything of that is simply 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.810
 put the bike all back and grab 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.609
 Well, luck so you never fall 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.439
 what is going to be 2006 that is not going to 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.629
 grab any spot is simply going to 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.329
 go down there from the dock and go to 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.010
 get here perfectly without falling 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.959
 so for the dedication of doing that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.579
 thing because I know by ear of stunt ers that 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.620
 it's a bit difficult to do that thing 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.989
 matter was down here and give the back yes 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.020
 for the end we put it in this week 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.450
 to the unics 21 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.550
 and finally in the best acrobatics do not 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.040
 they create all are the best is that by 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.260
 the custom we have pablito skype 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.090
 but if you do not sincere with you to me 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.400
 This was the one I liked most of all 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.650
 5 o'clock so let's see what it does 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.600
 very much like last week with the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.910
 acrobatic of the second place is going to be 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.650
 something same and I like that they send these 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.570
 things that are different from motorcycles 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.430
 because it's some diversity for the top 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.920
 acrobatics so what are you going to do 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.070
 here is amazing me when I saw him said 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.590
 son of a bitch I honestly said that 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.540
 because where it happened is amazing the hole 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.150
 that is looking for pablito skype to enter here 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.100
 It's like a bastard, as they can 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.600
 see there is the gap there is the hole 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.540
 and he gets it 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.820
 pablito sky gets it and 3 is croatia 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.100
 very very good so that has been all 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.080
 in the 5 in the 5 best acrobatics of 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.300
 this week I hope you have them 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.770
 liked tell me what if all of 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.000
 You were really so good there were some 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.680
 better than the others 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.780
 I am talent remember garzon like 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.200
 subscribe and see you next 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.200
