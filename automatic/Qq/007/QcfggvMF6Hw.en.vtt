it's also a gel consistency perfect for
oily<00:02:11.480> combination<00:02:12.080> skin<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.840> a

oily combination skin and it is a
thicker<00:02:15.410> cream<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.760> probably<00:02:17.720> better<00:02:18.020> suited

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
thicker cream so probably better suited

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.250

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
skin I don't like it as much because it

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260

doesn't<00:02:24.530> make<00:02:24.650> my<00:02:24.830> skin<00:02:25.010> feel<00:02:25.400> smooth<00:02:25.820> as<00:02:26.030> this

pack<00:04:15.410> because<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.070> richer<00:04:17.049> but<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.500> know

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
pack because it is richer but you know

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.819 
pack because it is richer but you know
that<00:04:18.919> just<00:04:19.130> depends<00:04:19.400> on<00:04:19.549> here

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
that just depends on here

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.429 
that just depends on here
my<00:04:20.280> skin<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.669> oily<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.599> that's<00:04:21.810> probably<00:04:22.109> why

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:22.439 
my skin is oily so that's probably why

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:26.330 
my skin is oily so that's probably why
so<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.400> pros<00:04:24.000> from<00:04:24.240> these<00:04:24.509> are<00:04:24.949> brighter<00:04:25.949> skin

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
so the pros from these are brighter skin

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.600 
so the pros from these are brighter skin
instantly<00:04:27.000> after<00:04:27.419> you've<00:04:27.810> used<00:04:27.840> them<00:04:28.379> and<00:04:28.650> the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
instantly after you've used them and the

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.689 
instantly after you've used them and the
smell<00:04:30.199> so<00:04:31.199> to<00:04:31.259> continue<00:04:31.650> my<00:04:32.099> review<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.490> the

cream the number two I guess um I find
that<00:04:57.389> it<00:04:57.539> works<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.930> lot<00:04:58.110> better<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:58.979> a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
that it works a lot better and it's a

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.339 
that it works a lot better and it's a
lot<00:04:59.430> less<00:04:59.699> sticky<00:05:00.030> when<00:05:00.479> you<00:05:00.599> just<00:05:00.780> Pat<00:05:01.110> it<00:05:01.139> on

cream and so the night that I was doing

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.519 
cream and so the night that I was doing
the<00:05:22.319> review<00:05:22.650> earlier<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:23.400> had<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.900> on<00:05:25.080> my<00:05:25.110> face

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:25.529 
the review earlier I had that on my face

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.129 
the review earlier I had that on my face
and<00:05:25.919> some<00:05:26.460> other<00:05:26.610> face<00:05:26.849> products<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.569> the

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
and some other face products and the

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.469 
and some other face products and the
next<00:05:28.379> morning<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:29.219> was<00:05:29.610> only<00:05:29.759> wearing<00:05:30.060> it<00:05:30.300> for

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
next morning I was only wearing it for

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.540 
next morning I was only wearing it for
about<00:05:30.599> maybe<00:05:30.900> five<00:05:31.319> hours<00:05:31.349> and<00:05:32.219> the<00:05:32.310> next

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
about maybe five hours and the next

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.029 
about maybe five hours and the next
morning<00:05:32.909> I<00:05:33.090> got<00:05:33.599> a<00:05:33.629> huge<00:05:33.930> sit<00:05:34.319> like<00:05:34.740> right<00:05:34.770> over

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
morning I got a huge sit like right over

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.010 
morning I got a huge sit like right over
here<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.819> it<00:05:36.029> didn't<00:05:36.270> go<00:05:36.389> away<00:05:36.509> for<00:05:36.900> a<00:05:36.930> couple

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
here and it didn't go away for a couple

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.309 
here and it didn't go away for a couple
of<00:05:37.319> days<00:05:37.469> so<00:05:37.770> I'm<00:05:38.430> pretty<00:05:38.819> sure<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.900> BB<00:05:40.110> cream

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
of days so I'm pretty sure the BB cream

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.700 
of days so I'm pretty sure the BB cream
broke<00:05:40.680> me<00:05:40.889> out<00:05:41.270> so<00:05:42.270> I<00:05:42.719> don't<00:05:42.779> know<00:05:43.080> it's<00:05:43.500> a

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
broke me out so I don't know it's a

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.860 
broke me out so I don't know it's a
little<00:05:43.889> bit<00:05:44.129> way<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.449> moisturizing<00:05:45.449> for<00:05:45.750> my

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
little bit way to moisturizing for my

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.219 
little bit way to moisturizing for my
oily<00:05:46.440> face<00:05:46.650> so<00:05:47.270> that's<00:05:48.270> probably<00:05:48.569> not<00:05:49.080> a<00:05:49.139> good

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
oily face so that's probably not a good

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.399 
oily face so that's probably not a good
idea<00:05:49.440> it's<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.759> are<00:05:51.150> prone<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.900> breaking

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
idea it's you are prone to breaking

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.189 
idea it's you are prone to breaking
stuff<00:05:53.069> ok<00:05:53.909> so<00:05:53.969> the<00:05:54.240> last<00:05:54.419> product<00:05:54.719> that<00:05:55.050> we
