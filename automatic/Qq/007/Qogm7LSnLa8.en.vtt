00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.839
 hello everyone I'm dan and I'm here 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.360
 new in minecraft to bring you a new 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.450
 mode is called better block san items and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.759
 is for the 1.3 points requires module 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.289
 but to install it you will have to 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.029
 drag the contents of the file 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.000
 compressed from the mod inside the minecraft 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.619
 hard point this mode includes improvements in 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.620
 some blocks like for example in the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.410
 stairs or on the fences and also 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.690
 modify some graphics and let's go 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.309
 to go see everything separately what 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.989
 first thing that does this mode is change the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.300
 way in which the fences are placed 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.550
 let's see it earlier when we wanted 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.110
 join these corners we had to put 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.480
 here a slab and here a block uy 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.210
 well then now simply placing 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.650
 the staircase in its place 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.840
 if we put it here it becomes a 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.660
 outer corner and if we place it here 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.589
 an inner corner as you see is 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.600
 much better 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.270
 and another thing that includes this mod is 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.840
 that as you can see the berries do not come together 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.420
 to the blocks that you have on the sides what 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.329
 you see to make them sink we will have 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.179
 have to place a fence in a straight line and 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.250
 already if they will join two this is quite 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.510
 okay since we can make beams like 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.760
 these 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.980
 something else as you see the color of the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.340
 Wood from the center of the wood changes 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.950
 depending on the wood that generates 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.770
 It's pretty cool and the truth is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.530
 pretty logical now let's go to the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.719
 recipes this is the original recipe of 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.049
 the cookies and this mode changes it by 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.539
 this one here will need a wheat one 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.159
 egg sugar and cocoa seeds what 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.140
 good that has this recipe is that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.880
 apart from being more logical you can 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.850
 place the ingredients in any 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.460
 position and it will continue to work 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.619
 the same thing happens with this one here with the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.840
 mushroom stew we can place the 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.049
 ingredients be it as well and also 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.450
 will work and with this step like this this is 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.550
 the recipe for the cake and we can also 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.930
 change the ingredients in any 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.609
 position 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.540
 and it will continue to work perfectly 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:20.280
 It also changes the character of the rails 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.439
 detectors this is this is the crafter 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.450
 original and this is the one that includes this 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.700
 mod using a rail one of the rest and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.209
 one of pressure plates we can do 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.819
 a rail detector and it also changes this 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.980
 of the propulsion trailers this one uses 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.590
 six ingots to produce six rails 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.540
 and this uses six pips to produce a 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.819
 raid therefore we will save ourselves a 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.620
 little gold in each track also teo 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.460
 changes the texture of charcoal 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.740
 as you see 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.450
 this is the texture of normal coal 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.020
 therefore there will be no confusion 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.870
 between what coal is what thanks to this 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.730
 we can use the flame powder 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.910
 as if it were fertilizer to make 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.920
 grow to abyssal warts this is 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.620
 useful as warts abyssal 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.830
 they grow very slowly we can also 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.010
 use the shears to cut the fabrics 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.140
 of spider you see us release the object 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.640
 it's pretty good since there is not in the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.670
 default game no way 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.370
 get them or create them for craft 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.650
 see the latest offering this mod 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.379
 see what I have here up 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.019
 as you see add all these types of 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.010
 stairs the glass ones the stone ones 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.189
 abyssal 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.720
 the stone obsidian snow mucous 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.610
 ice and stone 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.470

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.700
