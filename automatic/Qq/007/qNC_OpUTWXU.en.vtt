where you have really dry skin after it
soaks<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:34.090> that's<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.910> this

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
soaks in so that's it I like this

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.030 
soaks in so that's it I like this
because<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.050> kind<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.410> gave<00:02:38.590> me<00:02:38.620> color

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
because it just kind of gave me color

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.729 
because it just kind of gave me color
without<00:02:39.400> doing<00:02:39.670> anything<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.269> my<00:02:40.360> face<00:02:40.739> so

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
without doing anything to my face so

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.910 
without doing anything to my face so
it's<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.069> like<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> lotion<00:02:43.230> with<00:02:44.230> color<00:02:44.739> like

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
it's just like a lotion with color like

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.759 
it's just like a lotion with color like
tinted<00:02:45.220> moisturizer<00:02:45.640> for<00:02:46.390> acne<00:02:46.840> with<00:02:47.080> SPF<00:02:47.790> now

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
tinted moisturizer for acne with SPF now

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.870 
tinted moisturizer for acne with SPF now
depending<00:02:50.769> on<00:02:50.830> where<00:02:50.980> I'm<00:02:51.069> going<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.640> probably

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
depending on where I'm going I probably

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.000 
depending on where I'm going I probably
won't<00:02:52.090> put<00:02:52.450> anything<00:02:52.630> else<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.290> but

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
won't put anything else on it but

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.400 
won't put anything else on it but
because<00:02:54.580> today<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.060> have<00:02:55.330> work<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.350> don't

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
color it's relatively close my best bet

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.110 
color it's relatively close my best bet
is<00:03:14.079> just<00:03:14.350> get<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:15.280> lightest<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.820> they<00:03:15.910> have

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
is just get the lightest that they have

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.660 
is just get the lightest that they have
and<00:03:16.450> I'll<00:03:16.600> be<00:03:16.720> good<00:03:17.340> that's<00:03:18.340> what<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.489> usually

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
and I'll be good that's what I usually

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.430 
and I'll be good that's what I usually
just<00:03:18.970> do<00:03:21.269> it's<00:03:22.269> almost<00:03:22.600> kind<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.140> yellow

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
just do it's almost kind of the yellow

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.050 
just do it's almost kind of the yellow
which<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:23.829> good<00:03:24.160> because<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.640> don't<00:03:24.850> wanna<00:03:24.970> be

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
which is good because you don't wanna be

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.720
