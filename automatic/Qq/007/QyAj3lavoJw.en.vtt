Ward<00:00:29.760> actually<00:00:30.359> teased<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.560> could<00:00:31.859> be

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
Ward actually teased that there could be

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.540 
Ward actually teased that there could be
a<00:00:32.189> price<00:00:32.640> multiplied<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> skin<00:00:34.079> coming<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.190> call

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
a price multiplied a skin coming to call

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.090 
a price multiplied a skin coming to call
of<00:00:35.760> duty<00:00:36.149> ghosts<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.710> didn't<00:00:38.070> really

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of duty ghosts and this didn't really

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
of duty ghosts and this didn't really
seem<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.579> good<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> wasn't<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
seem that good I wasn't really going to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.380 
seem that good I wasn't really going to
cover<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:40.920> i'm<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.090> really

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
cover it because i'm not really a really

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.229 
cover it because i'm not really a really
big<00:00:42.690> fan<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.020> microtransactions<00:00:44.090> but<00:00:45.090> more

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
big fan of microtransactions but more

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.380 
big fan of microtransactions but more
than<00:00:45.300> likely<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:46.050> will<00:00:46.260> come<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.100> an<00:00:47.460> Xbox<00:00:48.210> in

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
than likely this will come to an Xbox in

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.150 
than likely this will come to an Xbox in
the<00:00:48.510> next<00:00:48.809> couple<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> weeks<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the next couple of weeks if it is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.850 
the next couple of weeks if it is
actually<00:00:50.640> true<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> probably<00:00:51.899> cost<00:00:52.559> around

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
actually true and probably cost around

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.430 
actually true and probably cost around
three<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.670> four<00:00:53.910> dollars<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
three to four dollars but one of the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
three to four dollars but one of the
things<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.800> actually<00:00:56.010> interested<00:00:56.910> me<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
things that actually interested me the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.290 
things that actually interested me the
most<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.500> fact<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.250> he's<00:00:59.550> holding<00:01:00.059> some

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
most was the fact that he's holding some

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.170 
most was the fact that he's holding some
kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.719> weapon<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:02.010> me<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.550> looks<00:01:02.879> like

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
kind of weapon and to me it looks like

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.080 
kind of weapon and to me it looks like
the<00:01:03.449> end<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.019> barrel<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.830> an<00:01:04.949> m4<00:01:05.519> carbine

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the end of a barrel to an m4 carbine

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
the end of a barrel to an m4 carbine
this<00:01:06.299> means<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.900> could<00:01:07.140> possibly<00:01:07.439> be

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
this means that this could possibly be

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.899 
this means that this could possibly be
one<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> future<00:01:09.689> guns<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
one of the future guns for the

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
one of the future guns for the
devastation<00:01:11.909> DLC<00:01:12.420> we're<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.290> sure<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.530> we're

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
devastation DLC we're not sure if we're

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
devastation DLC we're not sure if we're
going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> see<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.760> two<00:01:14.970> guns<00:01:15.299> for

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
going to see one or two guns for

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
going to see one or two guns for
devastation<00:01:16.380> however<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.490> does<00:01:17.820> look<00:01:18.060> like

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
devastation however this does look like

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.920 
devastation however this does look like
an<00:01:18.630> m4<00:01:19.200> carbine<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.640> possible<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.509> we

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
an m4 carbine and it is possible that we

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.190 
an m4 carbine and it is possible that we
will<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.439> seeing<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.729> weapon<00:01:24.299> come<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
will be seeing and this weapon come as a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.070 
will be seeing and this weapon come as a
part<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.850> devastation<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.810> pretty

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
part of devastation but that is pretty

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.679 
part of devastation but that is pretty
much<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.439> I'm<00:01:28.650> interested<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.310> note<00:01:29.610> your
