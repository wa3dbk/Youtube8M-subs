now this felt is made from recycled

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.160 
now this felt is made from recycled
plastic<00:00:32.130> bottles<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.510> mildew<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.079> mold

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
plastic bottles so it is mildew and mold

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.680 
plastic bottles so it is mildew and mold
resistant<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.280> also<00:00:35.460> will<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
resistant and it also will because the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.479 
resistant and it also will because the
fabric<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> will<00:00:37.320> allow<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> water<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> drain

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489

through the rocks through the fabric and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
through the rocks through the fabric and
then<00:00:40.710> down<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> dirt<00:00:41.370> below<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.000> don't

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
then down to the dirt below so we don't

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.760 
then down to the dirt below so we don't
have<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> worry<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.780> mold<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.260> mildew<00:00:43.379> like
