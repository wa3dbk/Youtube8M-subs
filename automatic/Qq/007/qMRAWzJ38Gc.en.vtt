mentioned this in an earlier video when
we<00:00:17.130> were<00:00:17.760> discussing<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:19.350> mod<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> made<00:00:19.949> doing

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
we were discussing the mod I made doing

we were discussing the mod I made doing
the<00:00:21.630> dual<00:00:21.810> batter<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.529> dual<00:00:22.710> battery<00:00:23.100> wires

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
the dual batter the dual battery wires

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.210 
the dual batter the dual battery wires
to<00:00:24.330> put<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> wire<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.680> bottom<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.130> the

to put the wire on the bottom of the
bottom<00:00:26.519> plate<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.680> I<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
bottom plate and I think you can see it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.700 
bottom plate and I think you can see it
there<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.539> top<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.250> bottom<00:00:32.579> frame<00:00:32.820> plate

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
there the top of the bottom frame plate

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.350 
there the top of the bottom frame plate
in<00:00:34.710> order<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.070> make<00:00:35.250> room<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.210> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
in order to make room for that so that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.490 
in order to make room for that so that
things<00:00:36.540> weren't<00:00:36.719> gonna<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.989> laying<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.260> top<00:00:37.320> of

Center walked around till I found
something<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.120> thought<00:00:51.390> would<00:00:51.539> work<00:00:51.690> it's

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
something that I thought would work it's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.760 
something that I thought would work it's
a<00:00:52.590> very<00:00:52.890> thin<00:00:53.309> tape<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.969> fabric<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:55.410> got<00:00:55.649> an

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
a very thin tape it's fabric it's got an

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.240 
a very thin tape it's fabric it's got an
adhesive<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.430> each<00:00:56.640> side<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:58.739> doesn't<00:00:59.070> add

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
adhesive on each side so it doesn't add

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.090 
adhesive on each side so it doesn't add
any<00:00:59.640> thickness<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.420> stuff<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.350> very<00:01:01.710> tacky

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
any thickness to stuff it's very tacky

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
any thickness to stuff it's very tacky
and<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:03.870> put<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.519> between<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.850> foam<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and I put that between the foam and the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.050 
and I put that between the foam and the
frame<00:01:07.080> plate<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.310> between<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.700> foam

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
holding it I put an elastic band over

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.440 
holding it I put an elastic band over
the<00:01:22.229> top<00:01:22.490> elastic<00:01:23.490> band<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.090> exactly

the top elastic band it's not exactly

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.670 
the top elastic band it's not exactly
the<00:01:24.630> greatest<00:01:24.720> option<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the greatest option it's not going to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440 
the greatest option it's not going to
last<00:01:25.830> forever<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.759> am<00:01:26.909> gonna<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> check

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the elastic band down through the little

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.950 
the elastic band down through the little
space<00:01:53.579> i<00:01:53.790> had<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.119> either<00:01:54.240> side<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> foam

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
space i had on either side of the foam

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.170 
space i had on either side of the foam
and<00:01:55.290> i<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.100> stuck<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> wooden<00:01:56.700> dowel<00:01:56.909> through

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and i just stuck a wooden dowel through

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.850 
and i just stuck a wooden dowel through
it<00:01:57.590> okay<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.009> will<00:01:59.070> keep<00:01:59.219> my<00:01:59.399> Naza

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
it okay so that will keep my Naza

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.350 
it okay so that will keep my Naza
from<00:02:01.860> busting<00:02:02.579> loose<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:03.090> if<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.299> thing

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
from busting loose because if this thing

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.289 
from busting loose because if this thing
busts<00:02:04.049> loose<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.460> starts<00:02:05.460> floating<00:02:06.210> around

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
busts loose and starts floating around

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.809 
busts loose and starts floating around
as<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.799> floating<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.310> thinks<00:02:08.550> that's<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
as it's floating it thinks that's the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.300 
as it's floating it thinks that's the
helicopter<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.770> floating<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
helicopter and so if it's floating and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.190 
helicopter and so if it's floating and
it's<00:02:11.489> floating<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.989> going<00:02:13.140> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it's floating to the right it's going to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.730 
it's floating to the right it's going to
try<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.440> make<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
try to make the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.340 
try to make the
helicopter<00:02:14.450> do<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> opposite<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.050> write

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
helicopter do the opposite to write

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.250 
helicopter do the opposite to write
itself<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:18.150> actually<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.570> helicopter<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
itself but actually the helicopter and

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.750 
itself but actually the helicopter and
the<00:02:19.380> Naza<00:02:19.560> are<00:02:19.920> going<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.160> be<00:02:20.220> independent<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the Naza are going to be independent of

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.080 
the Naza are going to be independent of
each<00:02:20.850> other<00:02:21.000> at<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.360> point<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.880> just

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
each other at that point so it's just

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180 
each other at that point so it's just
gonna<00:02:24.210> go<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.570> control<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:25.140> actually<00:02:25.890> had<00:02:26.160> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
gonna go out of control I actually had a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.590 
gonna go out of control I actually had a
quad<00:02:26.460> almost<00:02:26.760> hit<00:02:26.880> me<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> flight

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
quad almost hit me because the flight

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.860 
quad almost hit me because the flight
controller<00:02:27.990> came<00:02:28.290> loose<00:02:28.560> inside<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.460> frame

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
controller came loose inside the frame

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.440 
controller came loose inside the frame
long<00:02:30.870> story<00:02:31.520> that<00:02:32.520> was<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> early<00:02:32.970> dark<00:02:33.210> days

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450

long story that was the early dark days
of<00:02:33.870> quad<00:02:34.410> copters<00:02:35.720> but<00:02:36.720> anyway<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.620> Naza<00:02:37.830> has

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
of quad copters but anyway the Naza has

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.880 
of quad copters but anyway the Naza has
to<00:02:38.520> be<00:02:38.640> pointing<00:02:39.090> forward<00:02:39.570> okay<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.290> put<00:02:40.590> my<00:02:40.710> red

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890

wires<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> front<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.880> a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
wires have to be in the front this is a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.270 
wires have to be in the front this is a
huge<00:02:45.420> huge<00:02:45.930> mistake<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.770> lot<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:46.980> people

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.870 
out the back and you see here I just put
a<00:03:08.790> zip<00:03:09.090> tie<00:03:09.300> very<00:03:09.750> loosely<00:03:10.550> around<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> wires

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
a zip tie very loosely around the wires

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.000 
a zip tie very loosely around the wires
at<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.210> front<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.600> frame<00:03:12.780> plate<00:03:13.050> and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
at the front of the frame plate and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.580 
at the front of the frame plate and
that's<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.030> neat<00:03:15.330> okay<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.380> then<00:03:16.470> one

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
that's just to be neat okay and then one

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.450 
that's just to be neat okay and then one
more<00:03:16.770> thing<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:17.750> mentioned<00:03:18.750> early<00:03:19.020> on<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:20.250> zip

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
more thing I mentioned early on the zip

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.040 
more thing I mentioned early on the zip
ties<00:03:20.670> have<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.000> tendency<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.540> slide<00:03:21.780> around

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
ties have a tendency to slide around

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.380 
ties have a tendency to slide around
against<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.770> hard<00:03:22.980> plastic<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.210> put

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
against this hard plastic so I just put

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.960 
against this hard plastic so I just put
a<00:03:24.420> little<00:03:24.600> glob<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:25.110> hot<00:03:25.290> glue<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.830> each<00:03:26.700> side

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
a little glob of hot glue on each side

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.010 
a little glob of hot glue on each side
to<00:03:27.210> keep<00:03:27.390> them<00:03:27.600> from<00:03:27.870> wandering<00:03:28.080> around

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
to keep them from wandering around

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.880 
to keep them from wandering around
somebody<00:03:31.020> comes<00:03:31.170> up<00:03:31.260> with<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.500> better<00:03:31.650> way<00:03:31.830> to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
somebody comes up with a better way to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.400 
somebody comes up with a better way to
do<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.310> would<00:03:32.430> love<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.700> hear<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.780> for

now that's what I'm going with I really

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.630 
now that's what I'm going with I really
want<00:03:36.960> to<00:03:37.020> get<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:37.230> thing<00:03:37.290> flying<00:03:37.770> we<00:03:38.430> still

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
want to get this thing flying we still

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.160 
want to get this thing flying we still
have<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.940> put<00:03:39.300> it<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.570> computer<00:03:39.990> that's

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
do with this my original intent was just

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.630 
do with this my original intent was just
a<00:04:09.990> hard<00:04:10.620> mount<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:12.150> GoPro<00:04:12.900> on<00:04:12.930> there<00:04:13.290> for<00:04:13.640> fpv

his N muse h3 2d on it this actually has

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.020 
his N muse h3 2d on it this actually has
to<00:04:22.440> mount<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.220> lower<00:04:23.370> frame<00:04:23.700> plate

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
to mount to the lower frame plate

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.100 
to mount to the lower frame plate
there's<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.300> little<00:04:24.450> bit<00:04:24.540> of<00:04:24.630> planning<00:04:24.810> that

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
there's a little bit of planning that

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.600 
there's a little bit of planning that
has<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.320> go<00:04:25.410> into<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.710> there's<00:04:26.010> three<00:04:26.160> mounting

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
has to go into it there's three mounting

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.909 
has to go into it there's three mounting
points<00:04:29.390> so<00:04:30.390> although<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.350> guess<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.650> could<00:04:31.770> use

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
points so although I guess you could use

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.620 
points so although I guess you could use
these<00:04:32.100> three<00:04:32.490> holes<00:04:32.640> also<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.120> haven't<00:04:33.419> really

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
these three holes also I haven't really

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.270 
these three holes also I haven't really
looked<00:04:33.990> at<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.290> directions<00:04:34.770> very<00:04:34.919> closely

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
looked at the directions very closely

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.300 
looked at the directions very closely
yet<00:04:35.669> but<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.390> point<00:04:36.630> is<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:37.380> has<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.650> go<00:04:37.919> here

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
yet but the point is this has to go here

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.430 
yet but the point is this has to go here
and<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:39.510> don't<00:04:39.570> want<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.870> have<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.140> go<00:04:40.260> buy

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
and I don't want to have to go buy

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.980 
and I don't want to have to go buy
somebody<00:04:40.950> else's<00:04:41.510> adapter<00:04:42.510> plate<00:04:42.750> or

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
somebody else's adapter plate or

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.780 
somebody else's adapter plate or
mounting<00:04:43.620> kit<00:04:43.830> or<00:04:43.950> anything<00:04:44.130> like<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.430> it

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
mounting kit or anything like that it

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.700 
mounting kit or anything like that it
should<00:04:44.910> be<00:04:45.030> pretty<00:04:45.180> simple<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.690> do<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:45.900> you

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
should be pretty simple to do but you

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.409 
should be pretty simple to do but you
have<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.919> plan<00:04:47.100> ahead<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:48.030> isn't<00:04:48.330> gonna

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
have to plan ahead so this isn't gonna

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.969 
have to plan ahead so this isn't gonna
go<00:04:48.600> on<00:04:48.750> here<00:04:48.960> I'm<00:04:49.020> gonna<00:04:49.140> go<00:04:49.260> back<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.470> my<00:04:49.650> plan

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
go on here I'm gonna go back to my plan

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.050 
go on here I'm gonna go back to my plan
it's<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.729> hard<00:04:50.940> mount<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:52.010> GoPro<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.760> I'll

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
it's a hard mount the GoPro and I'll

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.440 
it's a hard mount the GoPro and I'll
still<00:04:54.300> show<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.570> guys<00:04:54.840> what<00:04:55.530> my<00:04:55.710> trick<00:04:56.010> was

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
still show you guys what my trick was

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.900 
still show you guys what my trick was
for<00:04:57.450> adding<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.050> third<00:04:58.290> axis<00:04:58.800> we'll<00:04:59.490> still<00:04:59.729> do

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
for adding the third axis we'll still do

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.390 
for adding the third axis we'll still do
that<00:05:00.090> at<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.419> end<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:00.660> this<00:05:00.750> project<00:05:01.260> but<00:05:02.190> for

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
that at the end of this project but for

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.980 
that at the end of this project but for
now<00:05:02.490> we're<00:05:02.700> gonna<00:05:02.820> get<00:05:02.970> moving<00:05:03.360> I'm<00:05:03.870> gonna

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
now we're gonna get moving I'm gonna

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.900 
now we're gonna get moving I'm gonna
finish<00:05:04.700> putting<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.910> frame<00:05:06.120> together<00:05:07.910> we'll

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
finish putting the frame together we'll

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.060 
finish putting the frame together we'll
do<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.060> video<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.720> short<00:05:10.020> video<00:05:10.229> on<00:05:10.380> programming

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
do a video a short video on programming

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.130 
do a video a short video on programming
I<00:05:11.160> might<00:05:11.370> just<00:05:11.580> find<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:12.000> programming<00:05:12.750> video<00:05:12.960> on

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
I might just find a programming video on

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.050 
I might just find a programming video on
the<00:05:13.229> internet<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.830> post<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.610> there's<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.910> lot

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.340 
the internet and post that there's a lot
of<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.270> math<00:05:15.419> there<00:05:15.630> I'll<00:05:15.720> just<00:05:15.870> look<00:05:16.140> for<00:05:16.290> a

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
of the math there I'll just look for a

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.409 
of the math there I'll just look for a
good<00:05:16.530> one<00:05:16.680> for<00:05:16.800> you<00:05:16.919> guys<00:05:17.070> alright<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.240> that's
