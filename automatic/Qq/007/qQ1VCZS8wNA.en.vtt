00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:09.570
 communication inside and outside fake 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.360
 and zero date blocks until you 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.080
 You will not know that it will seem 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.930
 that the blender is actually buggy you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.619
 just don't understand how it works and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.410
 so it seems lessons produto blocks I you 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.080
 already all ears buzzed and here on 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.210
 sweetie there was one more piquant 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.989
 theme 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.309
 I will create a cube and material on top of it 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.780
 connection object is something empty room 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.020
 night hotel 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.140
 to tie the material and the mouse into one 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.469
 the whole that is, the grid appears 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.020
 material in the same room can 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.920
 various perversions occur with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 modifiers 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 and even group grid connections with 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.410
 several materials 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.090
 this is the essence of the object link date 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.970
 blocks 0 connection sometimes it happens that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.000
 date block turns out to be outside 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.299
 the rooms are not enough characters did not agree 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.240
 Here, for example, I delete one material from 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.080
 list of materials of the object and here it is 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.619
 worth 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.130
 freewheel he if you look at him in 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.040
 list, he even appeared icon toe 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.400
 like you want to be alone ask me 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.850
 how does this mean that this date block is not 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.110
 associated with no object is not 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.729
 in one room of the hotel restart 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.540
 attention lonely zero date blocks 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.630
 after reboot disappear near the hotel 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.960
 customs duty police takes away the lonely 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.070
 date blocks into the wood and bury it so without 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.680
 noise and dust 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.200
 you can get rid of unnecessary date 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.950
 block just breaking his connection with 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.909
 object and reloading the file if 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.450
 material 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.599
 then he may have connections with several 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.660
 objects by the way the number of connections 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.200
 denoted by 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.020
 somewhere block special tsiferkoy 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.050
 For example, I will duplicate a cube there will be two 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.140
 dice with one material even when 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.020
 independent duplication shift d to 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.840
 strip the material so wasteful 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.620
 closeness at breaking 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.630
 click on the cross hold key 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.570
 shift 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.560
 the material will drive out of all the hotel rooms 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.800
 at the same time even if the second cubes 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.860
 the material remained there his connection 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.920
 reset to zero when the file is reloaded 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:00.490
 The material will disappear fake date block 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.850
 if you need the other way around 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.060
 with nothing the date block is preserved after 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.670
 reboot maybe you collect 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.430
 material library or in one file 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.390
 you have some animated 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.940
 action games for stock or their versions 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.100
 fake communication is created simple 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.610
 by clicking on the letter e 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.880
 opposite date block if after that 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.580
 break the connection date of the block with the object a 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.980
 then look at the list 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.180
 then there you will see this little letter e 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.230
 to the left of the date block 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.770
 he speaks like I'm in the house and the police 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.260
 morals 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.380
 can't do anything with him 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.640
 How much file does not restart the date block 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.970
 will remain inside 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.220
 securely like in a swiss bank that is 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.430
 you have no object at all 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.209
 Not a single mesh file and materials at least 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.900
 one hundred five hundred 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.440
 if only all fake lin forged date 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.770
 blocks 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.940
 sometimes a hotel appears 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:13.060
 exotic any date block yes not 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.760
 only group location or character but also 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.660
 separate material or animated 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.380
 action can be linked and here it is 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.990
 appeared inside our file lin forged 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.979
 foreigner listed with 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:37.840
 letter l link depending on the type 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:41.979
 connection 0 l 0 or associated l or ling 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.229
 Forged fake lf by the way it 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:48.099
 applies to lin action shod 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.639
 fake materials are not here I will tie 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:55.000
 wedge forged date block with object all 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.880
 just like with nilin forged date 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.909
 blocks only lin can not be forged 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.740
 edit any changes with it 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:06.060
 can be done only in the native file 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.280
 lined 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.740
 suddenly you needed to edit lin 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.220
 Forged date block right in the file 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:19.000
 all lenkova on here it blocks 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.349
 An icon and this arrow at 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.990
 clicking on which 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:26.349
 blog date becomes local not 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.319
 associated with the source file of it 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.110
 now you can edit but no 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:35.530
 changes to the original file from 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.460
 which he would not be under Lenka 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.430
 influence the material of all this information 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.130
 should be enough so that you do not have 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.960
 Questions regarding built-in 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.860
 morality blender 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.860
 but there is another postponed topic remember 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.280
 relative paths are when double 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.580
 slash 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.419
 on the way means the same folder where 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.969
 there is an editable blend file but I 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:07.180
 I really hope so for the most meticulous 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.719
 when using relative paths 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.060
 the question arose how to mark the exit from 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:16.659
 folders up through the directory 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:21.099
 and the most attentive question is what it is 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:23.759
 two points on the texture path such as 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:28.030
 You already understood this mutually exclusive 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:31.840
 questions down the double slash catalog 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:35.469
 folder name slash folder name and so 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.820
 then the desired file up the directory 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:38.800
 double slash 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.069
 two points with 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.580
 eat this output up from the folder 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:48.340
 where is the editable file of such 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.340
 exits up from the folder can be 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.970
 as much as necessary when you have reached the desired 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.460
 level 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.840
 you can start the dive again 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:01.830
 the previous method slash folder name 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:05.020
 slash and so on up the file 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:08.349
 Naturally you do not register it 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.979
 handles just specify the file and the path 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:15.940
 prescribed himself but know these subtleties 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:19.629
 you owe that's all Lenko's theme 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:22.229
 and the ways revealed are pretty full hopefully 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:24.789
 no one else will be unknowingly 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:28.599
 swear at the missing action games 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:30.009
 or materials and someone can even perry 

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:33.400
 hang textures 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:36.340
 changing the way practical applications 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.440
 this knowledge is much more than it can 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.740
 seem 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.860
 good luck to you in work until new meetings 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.860
 until
