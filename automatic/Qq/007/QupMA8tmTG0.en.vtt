fuels are dry that certain weather will
cause<00:02:36.730> problematic<00:02:37.599> fire<00:02:37.840> behavior<00:02:38.140> or

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
cause problematic fire behavior or

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.680 
cause problematic fire behavior or
extreme<00:02:38.829> fire<00:02:39.040> behavior<00:02:39.190> because<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.450> is

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
extreme fire behavior because that is

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.030 
extreme fire behavior because that is
what<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:40.930> want<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:41.140> watch<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:41.769> what's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
what we want to watch for that's what's

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.470 
what we want to watch for that's what's
going<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.310> cause<00:02:42.459> us<00:02:42.640> problems<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.269> that's

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
going to cause us problems and that's

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.930 
going to cause us problems and that's
what<00:02:43.870> has<00:02:44.110> led<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.190> lot<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.610> injuries

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940

and<00:02:46.540> fatalities<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:47.290> year<00:02:47.349> we<00:02:48.340> see<00:02:48.519> extreme

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and fatalities this year we see extreme

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.990 
and fatalities this year we see extreme
fire<00:02:49.120> behavior<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.260> form<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.829> rapid<00:02:51.819> rates

those two things that's how we judge

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.559 
those two things that's how we judge
fire<00:02:56.590> behavior<00:02:56.890> how<00:02:57.160> hot<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.519> burns<00:02:57.760> how<00:02:58.209> fast

the fire spread fire direction change
rapidly<00:03:08.640> adjusting<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.730> those<00:03:09.910> changes<00:03:10.359> in

between themselves in the fire edge the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.620 
between themselves in the fire edge the

best way to mitigate those circumstances

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.090 
best way to mitigate those circumstances
is<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.139> always<00:03:23.380> fight<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.680> fire<00:03:23.859> from<00:03:23.889> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
is to always fight the fire from the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.220 
is to always fight the fire from the
black<00:03:24.310> no<00:03:25.150> fire<00:03:25.389> fighter<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:26.019> we're<00:03:26.139> going

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
black no fire fighter is if we're going

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.170 
black no fire fighter is if we're going
to<00:03:26.290> get<00:03:26.440> burned<00:03:26.620> over<00:03:26.819> standing<00:03:27.819> in<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.940> black

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
to get burned over standing in the black

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.120 
to get burned over standing in the black
finding<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.600> fire<00:03:28.810> there's<00:03:29.500> no<00:03:29.560> fuel<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:29.950> burn

finding the fire there's no fuel to burn
they're<00:03:30.579> safe<00:03:30.850> it's<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:31.930> simple<00:03:32.109> as<00:03:32.350> that
