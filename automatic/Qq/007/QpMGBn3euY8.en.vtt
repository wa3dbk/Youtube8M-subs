00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.560
 welcome, you will surely be 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.110
 so much of a word that in this 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.890
 program repeats a lot can that 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.630
 it even bores you and me yes this 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 comes from the street that the other one learns 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.189
 in the street that the street gives us the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.890
 authenticity and to know that more then guess 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.989
 what is the pure truth but equally 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 it's fair to talk about the schools that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 They have roof schedules and even rates 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.780
 in the case of bboying the phenomenon is 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.850
 singular 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.829
 we used to fill games 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.289
 subway stations and tunnels tickets 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.329
 of underground matches and so on is there 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.420
 where we met, we trained 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.250
 We taught 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.410
 and lydia we go with urban life in 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.260
 general today there are still some of 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 these sites but we have accommodated 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 today it is more common to gather in centers 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.350
 civic and gyms to train is in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.540
 these places well where the big girls and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.450
 the most experienced living pass their 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.040
 knowledge to the new generations 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.430
 perpetuating this element and helping 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.380
 to its evolution 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.330
 although for a while there is another 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.910
 place where you can learn the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.600
 dance schools are traditionally 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.490
 they did not teach urban dances virus but 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.070
 from the media boom of this culture 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.180
 in the 90's it is usual to send the children 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.160
 to dance hip hop you understand me today 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.970
 We talk to the boys who are 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.970
 passing the witness 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.180
 I currently live the dance of imparting 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.579
 classes not only breaking but also 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.869
 of hip hop and house that only transmitted 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.759
 within the culture of hip hop and 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.890
 basically they have traced the school and 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.840
 I'm working my own school I have 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.350
 to develop in my style and my 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.189
 creativity is no longer just by necessity 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.920
 monetary but also by necessity 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.860
 internal staff that I have to 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.110
 develop this through teaching 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.179
 in scenarios with companies through 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.160
 my own projects good I 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.959
 basically now I earn my life 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.519
 completely with the dance in fact by 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.260
 the mornings I am forming in others 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.019
 dances what we live for a part of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.459
 give classes and for other shows my 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.750
 base salary let's say yes that is the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.690
 classes the truth that would not be enough 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.239
 if you do not combine it with good position with 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.160
 what is show theater work or 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.599
 of event management or something of judge 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.549
 I do everything that has to do with the 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.080
 conep and boeing besides that it is very 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.000
 bored as a teacher does a little bit of 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.110
 all 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.150
 the truth that discovered a little bit my 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.860
 vocation with the subject of the classes 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.510
 because I like teaching so much 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.830
 I really feel that the teachers 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.840
 we have a great responsibility over 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.680
 the students everything that is not learned in 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.700
 the street that you think in a classroom is 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.340
 a lot more than people think 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.870
 from a warm up a stretch 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.860
 Fueling care injuries to 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.440
 I have always liked teaching 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.200
 I think I'm good at communicating started 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.520
 giving classes in high schools then I already had 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.050
 the opportunity of classes in schools of 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.000
 dance at the same time that will impart the 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.950
 classes was growing my discipline and 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.540
 also the responsibility he had in 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.090
 the time of the classes is a 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.400
 very big responsibility explaining and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.680
 expanding this art not in a way 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.480
 adequate and correct to assume a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.700
 responsibility for the fact that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.890
 he knew he was aware that what 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.900
 I was teaching involved a risk 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.030
 you have to know what you're 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.770
 teaching is going to be used from a 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.690
 way or another you also have to 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.340
 understand that you will also forget about 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.610
 some way and it's going to rebuild from another 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.610
 way 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.159
 apprentice of all master in nothing I want 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.670
 say not all students are equal 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:47.459
 then it is very good to adapt to each 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.799
 moment and go learn new things 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.659
 to go putting them in your language as 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.480
 of break there is no clear document 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.370
 of study is worth how it is taught 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.540
 really the big part is intuitive 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.099
 but I liked that 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.139
 complement half study money 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.340
 performance in sports gym because 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.750
 this is what came closest to 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.760
 breakdance mostly I like 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.829
 difference of the one of alive in two sections 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.389
 of the most artistic section that comes to 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.459
 be the whole subject of all football product 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.750
 I've set aside a lot more technical than I thought 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.599
 and put your feet is not enough 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.299
 intuitive while trying too 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.820
 more than just teaching movements he tried 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.009
 teach the essence that is I think it is 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.650
 more important that the student understands 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.259
 well the issue of where it comes from because of 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.419
 what a way that doing it like that 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.759
 I do not say something that I always say 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.680
 classes I will not explain a double 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.699
 deadly if you do not know how to make a 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.699
 somersault and a mortal 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.970
 you throw a lot of months without seeing a 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.069
 student who is no longer doing classes 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.500
 because they simply mark a path 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.960
 and he has started to train animas to 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.090
 go really to throw him hours out 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.280
 the room was very excited when 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.990
 you see babies leave school as 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.909
 better one year later they are already doing 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.560
 things that you have taught me everything when 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.300
 we danced the street was approaching a lot 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.409
 of people learning a few really 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.240
 they were as alive 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.069
 the percentage of men is small but 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.689
 I've always liked practically 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.000
 since I knew how to make four movements 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.860
 basic to tell you that the class is a 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.539
 complement but really lift your 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.569
 personal training the material that 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.949
 I have to teach to show 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.650
 normally a person is usually 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.150
 finish in 23 years as much is clear 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.770
 that I also invite my students always 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.900
 to go to training rooms 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.430
 to know more alive or beagles that 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.860
 share with other people with others 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.449
 teachers from the beginning is very 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.199
 good that they can choose the fact of 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.120
 be in a place where it does not get cold 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.279
 demolishing the winter but all the 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.729
 floors all climates and all 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.780
 people teaches us nothing so only 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.850
 in my class 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.080
 they are limiting themselves just in the street 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.080
 they are also bidding 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.349
 They look good for the week 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.599
 that comes more and remember to teach everything 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:00.069
 that you know well so what you have to 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.069
 learn you will discover
