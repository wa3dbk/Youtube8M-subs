00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
how it's very hard to have the kind of

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.359 
how it's very hard to have the kind of
bipartisan<00:01:29.439> work<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.950> we're<00:01:30.039> going<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.189> do

because that the whole question was

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.260 
because that the whole question was
structured<00:01:33.669> as<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.909> talking<00:01:34.450> point<00:01:35.579> for

by<00:01:49.630> line<00:01:49.919> the<00:01:50.919> fact<00:01:51.189> of<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.399> matter<00:01:51.429> is<00:01:51.700> is

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
by line the fact of the matter is is

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.479 
by line the fact of the matter is is
that<00:01:52.149> when<00:01:52.329> we<00:01:52.450> came<00:01:52.689> into<00:01:52.929> office<00:01:53.489> the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:54.489

so when you say that suddenly I've got a

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.469 
so when you say that suddenly I've got a
monthly<00:02:01.989> budget<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.849> higher<00:02:04.059> than<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.450> a
