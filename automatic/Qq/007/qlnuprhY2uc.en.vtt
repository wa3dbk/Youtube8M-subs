00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.240
 and there to know all or linux ps just look 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.519
 Where am I at the samsung store? 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 I'm here with samsung 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.630
 galaxy to 7 what is this device that I 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.509
 I'm here with representatives from samsung 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.220
 also that bruno also did not 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.050
 Let's talk a little about your device and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.660
 What are your characteristics? 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.820
 example the screen size of a processor 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.939
 little for me crab too on the screen 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:34.500
 your Galaxy device with seven screens 5 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:38.850
 five right at full HD 1080p resolution and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.559
 80 in 1900 and 1920 x 1080p hd né 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.719
 I also banana that was also ours 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.050
 but come on, let's go there from line 3 is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.590
 interesting it is unique because it is optimal 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.260
 colleagues the front camera is still here 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.420
 five years ago and was pleased to be in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.800
 a camera just like 5 né 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.800
 already the rear and frontal 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.840
 lion for me I think this works 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.910
 best 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.490
 the sensor is better than the first has 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.260
 that angle of 85 degrees to 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.470
 take self-same panoramas and follow 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.690
 also has not given 120 degree motive 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.790
 120 degrees not knowing that it is not 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.880
 generally people catch that in the skies 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.100
 so it is not so right eetado result 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.840
 very cool this detail did not know 120 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.080
 degrees he also takes a photo also only with 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.060
 the palm too right or even voice 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.979
 of the voice command would be stronger are 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.800
 living there the bruno that also the people 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.250
 He's going to put his hand here. 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.900
 A little more behind but behind there is now 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.490
 You know you're filming is not going to work. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.420
 also in Tokyo then let's go there 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.369
 there it's beauty, huh 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.650
 What's milder than you can say 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.740
 For me though the van's van is 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.799
 2gb 2gb ram memory super screen 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.890
 amoled super super anti symbol is very 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.409
 important is dual yes aerial so let's 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.710
 show that it has two entries like this 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.670
 here also dark slot one just enter one 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.580
 chip and enamel 2 is the second yes or no 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.250
 it's game gives or the memory card is either 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.550
 whether you have the option of the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.300
 memory or oxy cano so you do not want 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.910
 two cards that the two operators that 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.880
 have already been sent away and they will 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.330
 the 16 gigs resolution you can expand 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.290
 up to 64gb of it as you could 16gb 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.170
 of ram 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.140
 how many do you know the best is 16 gb of 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.970
 memory or I or excuse me 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.760
 neither do I always say that sometimes 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.080
 video memory and 16gb storage of 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.580
 market memory to poor zoning and 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.890
 how many days available for the eyes 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.210
 knows more or less but at least 11 where 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.450
 the system when there 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.700
 Saturday 11 say some tips and I here 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.470
 talking 16 gb of ram are not 16 gb of 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.720
 storage and 2 GB of RAM 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.300
 correct the timing and what else has more 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.510
 thing that comes with it have been falling on 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:12.730
 usb cable and a headset charger 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:15.280
 was heard someone tire rubbers the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.270
 weather take off the hp had that glaze 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.070
 right and on time we do not talk about 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.650
 thickness of the thickness of freedom 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:30.340
 while three millimeters 6.3 of books 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:34.570
 here what is cool, no problem to 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.760
 We will not download the video, we're not 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.680
 taking nothing and let's go there it's hot it was 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.920
 compare with the 3 thickness 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.830
 the a3 is a little bit more is the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.800
 so the a7 here is a bit thinner than 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.340
 that the correct a3 it is same as the lot 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.950
 4 of the whole line of the market can serve 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.540
 This is another year and this one now that at 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.340
