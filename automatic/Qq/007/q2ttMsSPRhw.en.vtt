00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.370
 so come on 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:04.350
 you will need an application 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:07.140

 input usb connect the sector already lit 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:06.710
 now let's make the program 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.710
 the application finds the control signal 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.310

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.819
 with a small square click on it already goes 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:29.090
