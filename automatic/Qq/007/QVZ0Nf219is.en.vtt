00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello my victoria petrova here 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.290
 he is a long-awaited vacation this time we 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.469
 we spend it in an Italian campsite on 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.099
 halfway between Rome and Naples 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:17.460
 we came here yesterday and about something of his 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.480
 Is the name of the Palm Beach once fully 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.590
 justified because already from the entrance of us 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.279
 met a palm tree 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.320
 although we arrived at night it was not visible 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.320
 But in the morning they got up and saw and were delighted 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.660
 mid italy therefore despite 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.590
 the end of July is still blooming everywhere 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 flowers example when we rested in 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.079
 Calabria such blooming oases there 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.980
 it was no longer so it was drier and more 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:59.579
 it's hot it's great here too 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.129
 this camping program is going on just like 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.290
 we used to have it at recreation centers 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.270
 once upon a time in childhood since 9 30 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.510
 music lift mini club bathing and 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.369
 so on and so forth and ends the day 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 dancing under the stars while not seen 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.619
 because yesterday arrived late and it was 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.619
 not before 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.540
 farther here right you see the access to the sea 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.070
 left right 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.460
 go the streets of this campsite me very 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.140
 I like this here 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.320
 palm alley is really here 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.610
 stand at home but they are not for 5-6 people 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.930
 whom I have seen families or companies with 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.930
 more than ten children 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.830
 what camping is generally a family place 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.860
 recreation so here so families 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.650
 Children come and video well, starting from 6 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.550
 months 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.400
 The following streets are clear of camper and 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.920
 fate belongs to the camping part 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.240
 vacationers come with their 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.929
 equipped van them on to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.470
 him there attaches a tent kitchen 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.380
 terrace and so on there on these 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.530
 tent terraces stand tv here 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.709
 like for example on this one today i even 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.920
 I saw work Italians not only with 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.370
 a laptop but also stood in it 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.540
 printer-scanner-copier 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.540
 Internet of course here too 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:44.850
 it is farther out to sea wonderful 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.850
 kid 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.390
 it is now 5 pm so everything is already 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:59.050
 returned to the beach in the afternoon heat that all 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.970
 rest and here is empty and now the beach 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.750
 words again full of people on the way if 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.080
 compare with the same rimini or other 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.080
 crowded places people here are few and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.110
 here is the sea 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.700
 a lot of boats boats 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.580
