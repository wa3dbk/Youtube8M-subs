00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
those proper-- plan zones to just

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.580 
those proper-- plan zones to just
because<00:02:07.179> they're<00:02:07.330> 16th<00:02:07.780> notes<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.349> just

because they're 16th notes and just
because<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.340> right-hand<00:02:09.970> trip<00:02:10.270> all<00:02:10.479> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
because it's a right-hand trip all the

because it's a right-hand trip all the
way<00:02:10.899> from<00:02:11.110> 4<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.830> drum<00:02:12.040> 3<00:02:12.370> doesn't<00:02:12.819> mean<00:02:12.910> you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
way from 4 to drum 3 doesn't mean you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.630 
way from 4 to drum 3 doesn't mean you
can<00:02:13.150> cheat<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.390> playing<00:02:13.870> zones<00:02:14.170> especially

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
can cheat the playing zones especially

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.550 
can cheat the playing zones especially
when<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.730> go<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.910> add<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.390> those<00:02:16.660> 32nd<00:02:17.380> notes

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
when you go to add in those 32nd notes

so moving on to b4 of the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.020 
so moving on to b4 of the
first<00:02:19.959> measure<00:02:20.230> again<00:02:21.220> it's<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.490> right<00:02:21.730> hand

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
first measure again it's a right hand

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.480 
first measure again it's a right hand
check<00:02:22.330> pattern<00:02:22.750> across<00:02:23.290> two<00:02:23.740> drums<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.250> time

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
check pattern across two drums this time

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.570 
check pattern across two drums this time
but<00:02:25.030> still<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.569> same<00:02:25.780> main<00:02:26.050> points<00:02:26.470> plot<00:02:29.580> bar

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.330 
but still the same main points plot bar
two<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.300> this<00:02:31.480> exercise<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:32.470> my<00:02:32.709> opinion<00:02:33.130> is

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
two of this exercise in my opinion is

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.520 
two of this exercise in my opinion is
probably<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.970> most<00:02:34.090> challenging<00:02:34.270> one<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
probably the most challenging one the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.740 
probably the most challenging one the
last<00:02:35.740> two<00:02:36.040> beats<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:36.730> all<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.600> right

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
last two beats it's all on the right

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.990 
last two beats it's all on the right
hand<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.440> we<00:02:38.560> kind<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.890> we<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.220> little<00:02:39.880> bit

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
hand and we kind of we have a little bit

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.880 
hand and we kind of we have a little bit
of<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.150> weird<00:02:40.420> pattern<00:02:40.720> here<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.560> have<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
of a weird pattern here we have the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.240 
of a weird pattern here we have the
right<00:02:42.069> hand<00:02:42.220> going<00:02:42.610> one<00:02:43.360> one<00:02:43.660> two<00:02:44.110> one<00:02:44.410> one<00:02:44.950> two

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
right hand going one one two one one two

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.460 
right hand going one one two one one two
four<00:02:45.819> two<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.360> then<00:02:46.510> back<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.930> one<00:02:47.140> for<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
four two and then back to one for the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.270 
four two and then back to one for the
downbeat<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.100> measure<00:02:48.760> three<00:02:49.270> now<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.440> it's

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
downbeat of measure three now this it's

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.340 
downbeat of measure three now this it's
an<00:02:51.489> awkward<00:02:51.820> pattern<00:02:52.269> but<00:02:52.690> if<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.959> look<00:02:53.170> at

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
an awkward pattern but if you look at

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.320 
an awkward pattern but if you look at
the<00:02:53.470> last<00:02:53.739> bar<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.340> last<00:02:54.550> two<00:02:54.790> counts<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
the last bar the last two counts the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.830 
the last bar the last two counts the
entire<00:02:55.660> mix<00:02:55.930> exercise<00:02:56.940> that's<00:02:57.940> exactly<00:02:58.690> what

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
entire mix exercise that's exactly what

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.509 
entire mix exercise that's exactly what
the<00:02:58.959> hand<00:02:59.170> motion<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.739> for<00:03:00.400> those

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
the hand motion is for those

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.880 
the hand motion is for those
thirty-second<00:03:01.330> notes<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:08.200> key<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.470> these<00:03:08.620> two

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
thirty-second notes the key to these two

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.050 
thirty-second notes the key to these two
beats<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:10.000> one<00:03:10.239> start<00:03:11.050> slow<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:12.280> make<00:03:12.880> sure

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
beats is to one start slow to make sure

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.729 
beats is to one start slow to make sure
you<00:03:13.150> maintain<00:03:13.300> all<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.019> basic<00:03:14.350> points

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
you maintain all the basic points

question<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.090> might<00:03:25.239> come<00:03:25.480> up<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:26.140> this

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
question that might come up for this

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.520 
question that might come up for this
part<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:27.700> crossover<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:28.510> drum<00:03:28.780> four<00:03:29.049> is<00:03:29.320> it

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
part is the crossover on drum four is it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.740 
part is the crossover on drum four is it
a<00:03:29.590> crossover<00:03:30.040> or<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:30.700> not<00:03:30.850> now<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.630> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
a crossover or is it not now on the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.289 
a crossover or is it not now on the
sheet<00:03:31.930> music<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.500> did<00:03:32.709> not<00:03:32.920> notate<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.519> as<00:03:33.790> a

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
sheet music I did not notate it as a

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.509 
sheet music I did not notate it as a
crossover<00:03:34.840> because<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.799> don't<00:03:35.950> have<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.340> play

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
crossover because you don't have to play

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.490 
crossover because you don't have to play
it<00:03:36.610> as<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.730> crossover<00:03:37.180> if<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.450> can<00:03:37.720> or<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.380> can

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
it as a crossover if you can or you can

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.380 
it as a crossover if you can or you can
choose<00:03:38.650> not<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.549> all<00:03:39.730> depends<00:03:40.120> on<00:03:40.180> what

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
choose not to it all depends on what

you're<00:03:40.510> wanting<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.840> work<00:03:41.079> on<00:03:41.350> at<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.829> time

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
you're wanting to work on at the time

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.729 
you're wanting to work on at the time
now<00:03:42.820> when<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:43.090> film<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.750> demonstrations<00:03:44.470> I

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
now when I film the demonstrations I

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.310 
now when I film the demonstrations I
figured<00:03:45.730> why<00:03:46.000> not<00:03:46.030> throw<00:03:46.420> in<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.570> crossover<00:03:46.959> you

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
figured why not throw in a crossover you

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.900 
figured why not throw in a crossover you
know<00:03:47.470> we're<00:03:47.709> working<00:03:48.280> on<00:03:48.459> some<00:03:48.609> advanced

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
know we're working on some advanced

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.340 
know we're working on some advanced
stuff<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.480> might<00:03:49.630> as<00:03:49.720> well<00:03:49.810> throw<00:03:49.900> in<00:03:50.230> a

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
stuff you might as well throw in a

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.599 
stuff you might as well throw in a
little<00:03:50.470> extra<00:03:50.680> something<00:03:51.040> something<00:03:51.489> in

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
little extra something something in

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.060 
little extra something something in
there<00:03:51.820> so<00:03:52.180> again<00:03:52.510> cross<00:03:53.230> over<00:03:53.560> or<00:03:53.680> no<00:03:53.829> cross

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
there so again cross over or no cross

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.440 
there so again cross over or no cross
over<00:03:54.310> it's<00:03:54.760> your<00:03:54.970> choice

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
over it's your choice

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.810 
over it's your choice
I<00:03:55.480> recommend<00:03:56.019> trying<00:03:56.230> both<00:03:56.500> out<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:57.700> know

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
I recommend trying both out you know

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.699 
I recommend trying both out you know
throw<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.329> crossover<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.109> then<00:03:59.530> next

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
throw in the crossover and then next

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.890 
throw in the crossover and then next
time<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.190> know<00:04:00.310> move<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.730> left<00:04:00.910> hand<00:04:01.180> over<00:04:01.480> to

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
time you know move the left hand over to

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.449 
time you know move the left hand over to
get<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.079> drum<00:04:02.500> for<00:04:02.739> part<00:04:03.040> because<00:04:03.310> when

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
get that drum for part because when

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.650 
get that drum for part because when
you're<00:04:03.549> playing<00:04:03.730> with<00:04:03.880> thirty-second<00:04:04.480> notes

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
you're playing with thirty-second notes

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.599 
you're playing with thirty-second notes
it's<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.590> not<00:04:05.799> going<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.010> be<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.160> crossover

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
it's it's not going to be a crossover

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.640 
it's it's not going to be a crossover
it's<00:04:06.940> gonna<00:04:07.060> be<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.930> know<00:04:08.109> all<00:04:08.260> on<00:04:08.470> drum

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
it's gonna be you know all on drum

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.890 
it's gonna be you know all on drum
before<00:04:08.769> so<00:04:09.489> play<00:04:10.030> around<00:04:10.090> with<00:04:10.329> both<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:10.780> them

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
before so play around with both of them

with<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.980> crossover<00:04:54.700> pattern<00:04:55.180> now<00:04:55.300> know

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
with a crossover pattern now know

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.390 
with a crossover pattern now know
there's<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.810> name<00:04:56.020> for<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.410> but<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.740> me<00:04:56.920> it's

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
there's a name for it but to me it's

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.980 
there's a name for it but to me it's
just<00:04:57.520> thirty-second<00:04:58.180> notes<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.840> are<00:04:58.960> played

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
just thirty-second notes that are played

on<00:04:59.260> a<00:04:59.590> certain<00:04:59.920> drum<00:05:00.190> pattern<00:05:00.550> that's<00:05:00.940> all<00:05:01.120> it

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
on a certain drum pattern that's all it

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.050 
on a certain drum pattern that's all it
is<00:05:01.480> and<00:05:01.830> some<00:05:02.830> special<00:05:03.040> technique<00:05:03.520> notes<00:05:03.790> here

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
is and some special technique notes here

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.560 
is and some special technique notes here
now<00:05:04.690> this<00:05:05.560> is<00:05:05.920> what's<00:05:06.100> known<00:05:06.310> as<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:07.060> fulcrum

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
now this is what's known as a fulcrum

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.000 
now this is what's known as a fulcrum
crossover<00:05:08.260> there's<00:05:08.440> two<00:05:08.620> types<00:05:08.860> of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
crossover there's two types of

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.070 
crossover there's two types of
crossovers<00:05:09.640> you<00:05:10.030> have<00:05:10.150> wrists<00:05:10.390> over<00:05:10.570> wrists

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
crossovers you have wrists over wrists

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.470 
crossovers you have wrists over wrists
and<00:05:11.260> then<00:05:12.070> stick<00:05:12.490> over<00:05:12.700> stick<00:05:12.910> or<00:05:13.090> fulcrum

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
and then stick over stick or fulcrum

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.420 
and then stick over stick or fulcrum
crossovers<00:05:14.050> so<00:05:14.470> what<00:05:14.590> we<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:14.860> again<00:05:15.130> is<00:05:15.400> a

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
crossovers so what we have again is a

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.450 
crossovers so what we have again is a
fulcrum<00:05:16.360> crossover<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.890> thing<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.250> note

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
fulcrum crossover and the thing to note

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.700 
fulcrum crossover and the thing to note
here<00:05:18.490> is<00:05:18.940> that<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.570> right<00:05:19.750> hand<00:05:19.960> is<00:05:20.290> crossing

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
here is that the right hand is crossing

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.980 
here is that the right hand is crossing
over<00:05:20.890> at<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.520> left<00:05:21.670> hand<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.750> what<00:05:22.870> you're

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
over at the left hand and so what you're

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.800 
over at the left hand and so what you're
going<00:05:23.140> to<00:05:23.200> have<00:05:23.410> to<00:05:23.590> do<00:05:23.800> is<00:05:24.100> pick<00:05:24.910> up<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.570> right

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
going to have to do is pick up the right

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.200 
going to have to do is pick up the right
hand<00:05:25.840> very<00:05:26.530> slightly<00:05:27.040> I'm<00:05:27.400> you're<00:05:27.880> gonna<00:05:28.000> have

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
hand very slightly I'm you're gonna have

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.340 
hand very slightly I'm you're gonna have
to<00:05:28.330> do<00:05:28.450> it<00:05:28.570> enough<00:05:28.780> so<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:28.960> you're<00:05:29.200> not

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350

clicking sticks when you go to play that

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.660 
clicking sticks when you go to play that
but<00:05:31.660> not<00:05:31.870> enough<00:05:32.230> so<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.650> you're<00:05:32.920> you<00:05:33.550> know

nose-diving into the drum that's bad you

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.850 
nose-diving into the drum that's bad you
need<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:36.880> keep<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.810> forearms<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.560> wrists

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
need to keep the the forearms and wrists

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.490 
need to keep the the forearms and wrists
levels<00:05:39.160> as<00:05:39.310> close<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.240> even<00:05:40.390> as<00:05:40.780> possible

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
levels as close to even as possible

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.410 
levels as close to even as possible
but<00:05:41.980> let's<00:05:42.190> be<00:05:42.400> real<00:05:42.610> if<00:05:42.760> you<00:05:42.880> keep<00:05:43.090> them<00:05:43.240> both

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.030 
but let's be real if you keep them both
at<00:05:43.600> the<00:05:43.690> same<00:05:43.930> level<00:05:44.290> and<00:05:44.440> try<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.680> do<00:05:44.890> that

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
at the same level and try to do that

the left should be no problem actually
it<00:06:24.520> might<00:06:24.970> even<00:06:25.090> make<00:06:25.210> it<00:06:25.480> a<00:06:25.540> little<00:06:25.690> easier
