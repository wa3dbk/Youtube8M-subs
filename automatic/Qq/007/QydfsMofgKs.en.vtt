using<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> every<00:01:35.369> day<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.670> every<00:01:35.820> time<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> take

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
using it every day and every time I take

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
using it every day and every time I take
my<00:01:36.390> phone<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.170> home<00:01:37.350> button<00:01:37.649> Wiggles

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
my phone out the home button Wiggles

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.469 
my phone out the home button Wiggles
back<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.430> forth<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.759> its<00:01:38.850> little<00:01:39.060> position

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
back and forth in its little position

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.620 
back and forth in its little position
ever<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:40.290> slightly<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.850> really

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
ever so slightly and it really really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
ever so slightly and it really really
bothers<00:01:42.780> me<00:01:43.020> over<00:01:43.470> time<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.890> wish<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.190> was<00:01:44.310> just

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bothers me over time I wish it was just

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.730 
bothers me over time I wish it was just
set<00:01:44.820> securely<00:01:45.450> where<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.440> didn't

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
set securely where it is and it didn't

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.469 
set securely where it is and it didn't
move<00:01:46.830> at<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.670> instead<00:01:47.789> it<00:01:48.119> has<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> little

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
move at all but instead it has a little

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.330 
move at all but instead it has a little
wiggle<00:01:48.720> room<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:49.920> bothers

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
wiggle room and it just really bothers

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.800 
wiggle room and it just really bothers
me<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.729> something<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.209> should<00:01:51.420> note<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
me and it's something I should note that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050 
me and it's something I should note that
I<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.679> wish<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.459> just<00:01:53.670> set

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I really wish that it was just set

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.969 
I really wish that it was just set
securely<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.720> did<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.899> move<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.410> reason

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
securely and did not move at all reason

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.949 
securely and did not move at all reason
number<00:01:56.069> three<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.550> glass<00:01:57.090> back<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> call

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
number three is a glass back and I call

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.199 
number three is a glass back and I call
this<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.170> iPhone<00:01:58.649> 4<00:01:58.950> syndrome<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> 4s<00:02:00.030> I

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
this the iPhone 4 syndrome and 4s I

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.029 
this the iPhone 4 syndrome and 4s I
guess<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.319> the<00:02:01.410> iPhone<00:02:01.530> 4<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:01.920> 4s

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
guess because when the iPhone 4 and 4s

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.190 
guess because when the iPhone 4 and 4s
had<00:02:02.429> a<00:02:02.459> glass<00:02:02.789> back<00:02:03.060> everybody<00:02:03.750> complained

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
had a glass back everybody complained

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.199 
had a glass back everybody complained
because<00:02:04.500> glass<00:02:04.740> backs<00:02:05.069> are<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> bad<00:02:06.000> idea

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
because glass backs are a bad idea

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.059 
because glass backs are a bad idea
there's<00:02:06.569> really<00:02:06.750> nothing<00:02:07.200> good<00:02:07.470> about<00:02:07.709> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
there's really nothing good about a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
there's really nothing good about a
glass<00:02:08.369> back<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.060> very<00:02:09.630> fragile<00:02:09.959> also<00:02:10.470> if

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
glass back they are very fragile also if

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.809 
glass back they are very fragile also if
you<00:02:10.619> drop<00:02:10.830> your<00:02:10.860> phone<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.250> back<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
you drop your phone on the back the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.820 
you drop your phone on the back the
whole<00:02:11.970> glass<00:02:12.300> back<00:02:12.599> could<00:02:12.870> shatter<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.500> they

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
whole glass back could shatter and they

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.440 
whole glass back could shatter and they
are<00:02:13.980> fingerprint<00:02:14.580> magnet<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.300> whenever

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
are fingerprint magnet so whenever

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.550 
are fingerprint magnet so whenever
you're<00:02:15.690> touching<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.050> back<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.200> your<00:02:16.380> phone

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
you're touching the back of your phone

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.410 
you're touching the back of your phone
if<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.860> flip<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.160> around<00:02:17.220> you'll<00:02:17.819> see<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.120> ton

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
if you flip it around you'll see a ton

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.330 
if you flip it around you'll see a ton
of<00:02:18.450> fingerprints<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> way<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> fix<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.310> by

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
of fingerprints the way I fix this is by

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670 
of fingerprints the way I fix this is by
using<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.000> bamboo<00:02:21.209> skin<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:22.230> if<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.500> don't

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
using that bamboo skin but if you don't

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.410 
using that bamboo skin but if you don't
have<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> skin<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.280> are<00:02:23.310> stuck<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.090> glass

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
have a skin you are stuck with a glass

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.240 
have a skin you are stuck with a glass
back<00:02:24.660> reason<00:02:25.319> number<00:02:25.410> four<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
back reason number four is that the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.220 
back reason number four is that the
phone<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.760> slippery<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> combination

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
phone is slippery this is a combination

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.500 
phone is slippery this is a combination
of<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.590> glass<00:02:28.860> back<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.640> metal<00:02:30.000> edges

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
of the glass back and the metal edges

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.420 
of the glass back and the metal edges
it's<00:02:30.959> just<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.380> very<00:02:31.560> slippery<00:02:31.920> phone<00:02:32.250> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
it's just a very slippery phone and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.070 
it's just a very slippery phone and
without<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> skin<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.420> dropped<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.840> more

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
without the skin on it I dropped it more

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.809 
without the skin on it I dropped it more
than<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.230> few<00:02:34.440> times<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.280> my<00:02:35.490> room<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
than a few times just in my room and

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.970 
than a few times just in my room and
luckily<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.450> carpet<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> did<00:02:37.530> drop<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
luckily on to carpet but I did drop it a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.500 
luckily on to carpet but I did drop it a
lot<00:02:38.130> because<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.819> slippery<00:02:39.209> phone

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
lot because it's just a slippery phone

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.080 
lot because it's just a slippery phone
not<00:02:40.020> quite<00:02:40.380> as<00:02:40.530> slippery<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> HTC<00:02:41.520> One<00:02:41.700> m9

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
not quite as slippery as the HTC One m9

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.210 
not quite as slippery as the HTC One m9
but<00:02:42.599> still<00:02:42.870> pretty<00:02:43.020> slippery<00:02:43.500> even<00:02:43.800> with<00:02:44.040> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
but still pretty slippery even with a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.040 
but still pretty slippery even with a
skin<00:02:44.550> on<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.000> metal<00:02:45.270> edges<00:02:45.569> are<00:02:45.720> slippery

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
skin on the metal edges are slippery

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.930 
skin on the metal edges are slippery
because<00:02:46.170> there's<00:02:46.470> no<00:02:46.620> real<00:02:47.040> sharp<00:02:47.520> edges<00:02:47.760> to

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
because there's no real sharp edges to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.270 
because there's no real sharp edges to
grab<00:02:48.209> onto<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.080> sometimes<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.739> does<00:02:49.950> fall<00:02:50.160> out

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
grab onto so sometimes it does fall out

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.730 
grab onto so sometimes it does fall out
of<00:02:50.310> your<00:02:50.520> hand<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.810> mean<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.350> could<00:02:52.530> break

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
of your hand and I mean it could break

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.690 
of your hand and I mean it could break
if<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.070> dropped<00:02:53.490> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
if you dropped it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.949 
if you dropped it
on<00:02:53.730> something<00:02:53.970> harder<00:02:54.330> than<00:02:54.450> carpet<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.930> I

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
on something harder than carpet like I

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.510 
on something harder than carpet like I
did<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:55.560> that's<00:02:55.680> something<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.160> keep<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.459> mind

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
did so that's something to keep in mind

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.580 
did so that's something to keep in mind
reason<00:02:57.180> number<00:02:57.300> five<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.900> off-screen

buttons<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.489> for<00:02:59.849> two<00:02:59.970> reasons<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
buttons and this is for two reasons the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.600 
buttons and this is for two reasons the
first<00:03:00.690> reason<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.709> hate<00:03:02.099> off-screen

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
first reason is that I hate off-screen

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.970 
first reason is that I hate off-screen
buttons<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.090> much<00:03:03.420> prefer<00:03:03.840> on-screen<00:03:04.560> Android

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
buttons I much prefer on-screen Android

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.559 
buttons I much prefer on-screen Android
buttons<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:05.760> that's<00:03:05.879> not<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
buttons but that's not it

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.930 
buttons but that's not it
these<00:03:06.840> off-screen<00:03:07.379> buttons<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.099> way<00:03:08.730> that

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
these off-screen buttons in the way that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.460 
these off-screen buttons in the way that
they<00:03:09.060> are<00:03:09.180> positioned<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.930> phone<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
they are positioned on the phone and the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.080 
they are positioned on the phone and the
fact<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.739> they<00:03:10.890> are<00:03:11.010> capacitive<00:03:11.580> buttons<00:03:11.910> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
fact that they are capacitive buttons I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.809 
fact that they are capacitive buttons I
press<00:03:12.599> them<00:03:12.810> by<00:03:12.959> accident<00:03:13.110> way<00:03:14.069> too<00:03:14.130> often<00:03:14.730> if

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
press them by accident way too often if

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.490 
press them by accident way too often if
I'm<00:03:14.940> trying<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.239> one-hand<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.959> phone<00:03:16.200> and

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
I'm trying to one-hand the phone and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.990 
I'm trying to one-hand the phone and
like<00:03:16.890> reach<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.340> other<00:03:17.519> corner<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
like reach the other corner of the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.120 
like reach the other corner of the
screen<00:03:18.180> with<00:03:18.420> my<00:03:18.450> thumb<00:03:18.870> my<00:03:19.349> palm<00:03:19.620> will<00:03:19.950> almost

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
screen with my thumb my palm will almost

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.160 
screen with my thumb my palm will almost
always<00:03:20.489> hit<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.209> button<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.930> cause

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
always hit that button and cause

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.750 
always hit that button and cause
something<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.650> happen<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.099> phone<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.730> I

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
something to happen on the phone that I

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.940 
something to happen on the phone that I
didn't<00:03:24.209> want<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.450> happen<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.590> so

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
didn't want to happen and that is so

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.699 
didn't want to happen and that is so
annoying<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.730> really<00:03:27.330> really<00:03:28.170> wish<00:03:28.349> they<00:03:28.560> had

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
annoying I really really wish they had

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.650 
annoying I really really wish they had
at<00:03:28.860> least<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.280> option<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.880> use<00:03:30.060> on-screen

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
at least the option to use on-screen

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.360 
at least the option to use on-screen
buttons<00:03:30.989> instead<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.890> sixth<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.340> final

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
buttons instead the sixth and final

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.370 
buttons instead the sixth and final
reason<00:03:32.819> is<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.329> fingerprint<00:03:33.870> scanner<00:03:33.989> now

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
reason is the fingerprint scanner now

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.780 
reason is the fingerprint scanner now
the<00:03:34.440> fingerprint<00:03:34.920> scanner<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.370> good<00:03:35.579> enough

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the fingerprint scanner is good enough

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.850 
the fingerprint scanner is good enough
to<00:03:35.940> use<00:03:36.150> as<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.390> primary<00:03:36.930> security<00:03:37.470> instead<00:03:37.709> of

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
to use as a primary security instead of

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.710 
to use as a primary security instead of
like<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.130> swipe<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.640> unlock<00:03:38.670> but<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:39.569> just

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
like a swipe to unlock but it's just

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.569 
like a swipe to unlock but it's just
nowhere<00:03:39.989> near<00:03:40.349> as<00:03:40.470> good<00:03:40.500> as<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.890> iPhones<00:03:41.400> I

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
nowhere near as good as the iPhones I

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.370 
nowhere near as good as the iPhones I
even<00:03:41.819> added<00:03:42.000> both<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.390> my<00:03:42.480> thumb<00:03:42.720> prints<00:03:42.989> twice

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
even added both of my thumb prints twice

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.259 
even added both of my thumb prints twice
into<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.920> database<00:03:44.519> on<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.880> phone<00:03:45.090> to

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
into the database on the phone to

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.940 
into the database on the phone to
increase<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.750> chances<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.620> gets<00:03:46.829> it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
increase the chances that it gets it

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.130 
increase the chances that it gets it
right<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:47.640> still<00:03:47.970> every<00:03:48.390> single<00:03:48.690> time<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.930> take

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
right but still every single time I take

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.780 
right but still every single time I take
out<00:03:49.230> my<00:03:49.290> phone<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.890> try<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.130> unlock<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.610> phone

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
out my phone and try to unlock the phone

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.330 
out my phone and try to unlock the phone
it<00:03:51.090> regularly<00:03:51.840> takes<00:03:52.170> two<00:03:52.500> or<00:03:52.530> three<00:03:52.709> tries<00:03:53.040> it

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
it regularly takes two or three tries it

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.400 
it regularly takes two or three tries it
just<00:03:53.549> very<00:03:53.790> rarely<00:03:54.180> goes<00:03:54.569> right<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.170> first

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
just very rarely goes right on the first

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.380 
just very rarely goes right on the first
try<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.680> lesson<00:03:56.069> specifically<00:03:56.940> placing<00:03:57.299> my

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
finger perfectly on that button now it

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.309 
finger perfectly on that button now it
is<00:03:59.639> better<00:03:59.790> than<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.150> Samsung<00:04:00.510> Galaxy<00:04:00.930> s5

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
is better than the Samsung Galaxy s5

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.979 
is better than the Samsung Galaxy s5
still<00:04:02.280> not<00:04:02.489> perfect<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.090> would<00:04:03.299> like<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.720> see<00:04:03.900> it

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
still not perfect I would like to see it

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.259 
still not perfect I would like to see it
much<00:04:04.350> better<00:04:04.650> on<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:04.889> galaxy<00:04:05.340> s7<00:04:05.670> because<00:04:06.120> it

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
much better on the galaxy s7 because it

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.390 
much better on the galaxy s7 because it
is<00:04:06.389> very<00:04:06.690> inconvenient<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.829> try<00:04:08.160> multiple

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400
