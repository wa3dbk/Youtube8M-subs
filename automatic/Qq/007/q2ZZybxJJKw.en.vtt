00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
gone back in the history at that stage

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.380 
gone back in the history at that stage
and<00:06:53.740> the<00:06:53.890> lower<00:06:54.250> ranked<00:06:54.520> players<00:06:54.790> were<00:06:54.970> asking

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
and the lower ranked players were asking

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.330 
and the lower ranked players were asking
for<00:06:55.660> the<00:06:56.110> top<00:06:56.290> players<00:06:56.530> to<00:06:56.680> go<00:06:56.800> back<00:06:57.010> into<00:06:57.190> the

for the top players to go back into the

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.980 
for the top players to go back into the
1<00:06:57.460> to<00:06:57.640> 8<00:06:57.820> there<00:06:58.030> would<00:06:58.150> be<00:06:58.180> the<00:06:58.330> threats<00:06:58.840> of<00:06:58.930> a

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
1 to 8 there would be the threats of a

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.510 
1 to 8 there would be the threats of a
breakaway<00:06:59.440> the<00:06:59.770> top<00:06:59.950> players<00:07:00.160> wouldn't<00:07:00.430> have

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
breakaway the top players wouldn't have

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.760 
breakaway the top players wouldn't have
had<00:07:00.610> any<00:07:00.820> of<00:07:00.880> it<00:07:01.090> and<00:07:01.960> that<00:07:02.080> was<00:07:02.200> prepped<00:07:02.500> some

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
had any of it and that was prepped some

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.020 
had any of it and that was prepped some
of<00:07:02.890> the<00:07:02.950> problems<00:07:03.280> of<00:07:03.370> politically<00:07:03.850> in<00:07:03.940> the

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
of the problems of politically in the

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.000 
of the problems of politically in the
game<00:07:04.210> that<00:07:04.420> the<00:07:04.510> top<00:07:04.720> players<00:07:04.990> wanted<00:07:05.920> to

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
game that the top players wanted to

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.500 
game that the top players wanted to
control<00:07:06.340> things<00:07:06.670> I<00:07:06.850> think<00:07:07.090> perhaps<00:07:07.210> things

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
control things I think perhaps things

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.450 
control things I think perhaps things
have<00:07:07.630> changed<00:07:07.930> now<00:07:08.110> but<00:07:08.290> I<00:07:08.500> can't<00:07:09.130> speak<00:07:09.280> for

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
have changed now but I can't speak for

world wouldn't change the UK I think

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.990

strictly<00:07:20.980> from<00:07:21.100> the<00:07:21.160> ticket<00:07:21.520> point<00:07:21.730> of<00:07:21.850> view

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
strictly from the ticket point of view

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.890 
strictly from the ticket point of view
them<00:07:22.090> for<00:07:22.210> what<00:07:22.300> people<00:07:22.570> want<00:07:22.690> to<00:07:22.720> come<00:07:22.870> on

them for what people want to come on
watch<00:07:23.140> I<00:07:23.260> think<00:07:23.290> it's<00:07:23.530> it's<00:07:23.860> logistically<00:07:24.400> a

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
watch I think it's it's logistically a

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.310 
watch I think it's it's logistically a
nightmare<00:07:24.970> to<00:07:25.180> put<00:07:25.540> start<00:07:25.840> them<00:07:25.960> in<00:07:26.050> the<00:07:26.110> front

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.320 
nightmare to put start them in the front

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.320 
nightmare to put start them in the front
of<00:07:26.410> the<00:07:26.470> UK<00:07:26.830> I<00:07:27.010> think<00:07:27.340> people<00:07:27.700> need<00:07:27.850> to<00:07:27.910> book<00:07:28.270> a
