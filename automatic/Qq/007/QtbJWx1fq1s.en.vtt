00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello there I am again with mine 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.790
 month's favorites this time a little bit 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.350
 Later I just have it at the beginning of the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.599
 months failed you know move 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 and blah blah blah and then among others 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 videos that I wanted to talk to first 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.639
 and anyway come anyway 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.460
 now the months favorites and me 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.800
 Just start right away I have the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.080
 eyes two things totally like worn 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.779
 in the last month and once by 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.689
 Essens here this you your milla systems 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.840
 latte and there I mostly only 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.000
 worn this very light tone when I am 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.600
 also get him show you and that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 Do this family and me here 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.840
 sometimes have the other one like that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.030
 bit in the outer corner of the eye 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.980
 but quite often I just have 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.070
 the sound once over the entire eyelid 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 done over it and the screen has easy 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.239
 totally beautiful and is very whole 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.500
 inconspicuous so they actually first 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.230
 so one does not like to whether 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.600
 that in the eyes but this schema that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.300
 very nice if you just mascara 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 She wears it very nice and then 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.650
 So it was the month of nude tones on 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.830
 the oven with me the note range 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.260
 absolutely palette of patrice I have 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.439
 several tones of much worn 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.170
 do this bright here as well and then 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.040
 I have these two as well 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.610
 often worn 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.710
 and yes are not my absolute 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.259
 favorite eyeshadow in itself so the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.030
 palette is not that I say that 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 so is the palette one necessarily 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.750
 I have to have them but I always like them 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.759
 again like 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.369
 especially if I'm a bit more discreet 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.150
 eye make-up make-up the color delivery 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.530
 is not the stark madness but yes 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.540
 for subtle things looks nice but 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 you absolutely need a base underneath 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.600
 are the colors really work? 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 I do not have a lot here at all 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.340
 this kohl pencil worn by essen- 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.329
 And only this side of the pen is called 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.020
 2 1 1 number 14 torin suite and how 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.430
 said dark brown quite often quite simply 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.040
 the waterline and a bit around 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.570
 eye and a bit blurred 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.250
 and much more is needed then 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.720
 I do not have any cheeks here 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.500
 this place from sleek again 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.750
 excavated 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.150
 it is so beautiful and you do not need it 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.580
 we still have highlighters for that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.510
 not really because it shimmers 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.610
 It is the color red gold 926 and the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.970
 so has particles in it what I shimmer 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.410
 not always likes blanche and sometimes 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.630
 that's too much for me 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.100
 consider if I wear highlighter 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.750
 I want or not so I want that 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.910
 it is true or not but where it is 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.040
 really great and it is such a choral 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.570
 So really powerful choral direction and 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.209
 I think you can see the swimmers 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.480
 Particles are not that good in the light though 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.930
 it 's like gold so it's really as gold 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.020
 red actually fits really well with it 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.140
 has such a rosÃ© undertone and has so 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.270
 really beautiful golden very very fine 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.080
 so I can really tell you about each particle 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.790
 just recommend 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.680
 and I like that on the other 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.020
 side here so mirror has that is me 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.370
 Take this thing even if I am 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.190
 I do not like cheeks 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.870
 because it's always so practical 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.430
 to have mini dress mirror with you 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.930
 I have a lot of pink on my lips 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.560
 worn and preferably easy 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.090
 only gloss and that is here of 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.800
 patrice infinite seems to be going on in the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.720
 colors and 80 loud pink and happiness 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.100
 and I have really often on the lips 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.430
 Had we not lipstick 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.230
 was 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.720
 if it was just too warm for me and me 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.980
 thought oh somehow just come 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.440
 not make up big but just 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.630
 so a bit glossy and remembered 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.519
 me just so from the color 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.430
 strawberry daiquiri and strawberry daiquiri 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.040
 I think that's the summer drink though 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.510
 I hardly ever drink alcohol though 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.030
 then there is indeed also an alcohol-free 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.350
 Variant or so afraid moody's so 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.680
 fruit just like a sender 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.930
 me too and that's just mine 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.450
 Sommerdrinks totally love and yes the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.190
 has a little bit of a shimmer in it 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.290
 and I can see that again in the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.660
 camera that it does not look pink 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.700
 we are totally red so have a look 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.100
 in the shop if you like it is right 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.110
 that a great color easy to care for 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.730
 have come to me with things to use 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.570
 that have cooled my skin a bit 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.040
 was just so warm in the last month for 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.180
 it was really true 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.250
 others on the other hand I was all 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.680
 time things up in fourth floor 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.780
 to carry in my new apartment and me 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.020
 i was real i was too i was easy 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.510
 finished and would like to have five times on 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.520
 day so cool showered and always have 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.410
 thought when will it finally be back 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.390
 I love it when it's warm 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.760
 but not when I'm so physically 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.190
 I do not have to work so much and 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.530
 I was very grateful for this 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.520
 baby here is from beautyworld 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.920
 fly high active and that's what you wear 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.290
 just on the feet and can do it 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.560
 also apply to the lower leg and 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.180
 that cools completely pleasant and smells like that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.910
 a little bit of peppermint and me 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.190
 hope that from the glossybox and yes can 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.570
 Just really recommend it 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.370
 I would have liked this brand for sure 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.550
 otherwise never bought or something in the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.650
 art probably not bought because 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.170
 I honestly never think so 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.730
 Come and buy something cool for me 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.340
 Of course that makes complete sense for the 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.990
 summer but somehow it 's always on 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.550
 Me over and I was really glad that 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.260
 that was in my glossybox and me 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.430
 that could try and yes have 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.570
 I really loved the last one 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.610
 Last but not least, something about me 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.860
 to feel a little better and fresher 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.870
 I have here from valea such a deo 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.390
 usually i always put on 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.870
 from rexona the maximum protection cream 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.840
 de 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.680
 and this is just nice 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.350
 because such a totally cold spray is in 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.190
 I hate winter, the total super cold 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.320
 somehow on this one 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.900
 a spray bottle comes in the summer 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.450
 i love it so i use it then 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.040
 anyway my rexona and if so 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.870
 between the emotionally have the middle of the 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.970
 I need something refreshing 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.010
 then I'll jump this way and so 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.010
 this is coconut and nectarine deospray 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.530
 without aluminum side i have honest 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.330
 No idea what aluminum are 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.490
 I often feel that way 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.580
 something reader from a pack without 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.680
 something and then I think what is that 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.970
 and most of all, it's bad now 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.320
 that I probably that whole 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.730
 time uses but if already somewhere 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.860
 it says or something then it says 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.330
 everywhere else it is inside and whole 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.800
 different think I have that time 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.010
 google but if you know what 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.300
 aluminum are and what they do then 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.260
 Write me that in the 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.750
 Comments 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.970
 I would be very grateful for yes and 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.180
 the smell of that is really nice too 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:40.470
 so a little cocktail moderate me 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:44.400
 like soft cream cocos 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.480
 Cocktails really like the immediately on the 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.160
 go hip and taste like one 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.110
 bonbon but rather start like me 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.600
 that's just cocos and nectarines real 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.520
 really delicious good my love that 's it 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.930

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.520
 See you soon and I wish 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.790
 Have a wonderful day until then 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.790
 bye
