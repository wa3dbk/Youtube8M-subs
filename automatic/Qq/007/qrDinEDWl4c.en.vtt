00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
new game mechanic each and every stage

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.580 
new game mechanic each and every stage
for<00:02:30.550> example<00:02:30.640> there's<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.480> sponges<00:02:32.080> these

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
for example there's the sponges these

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.110 
for example there's the sponges these
things<00:02:32.860> will<00:02:33.040> inflate<00:02:33.400> as<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.640> shoot<00:02:33.880> them

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
things will inflate as you shoot them

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.460 
things will inflate as you shoot them
which<00:02:34.360> will<00:02:34.510> turn<00:02:34.630> them<00:02:34.810> into<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:35.020> big<00:02:35.200> platform

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
which will turn them into a big platform

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.350 
which will turn them into a big platform
and<00:02:35.950> if<00:02:36.190> an<00:02:36.340> enemy<00:02:36.490> shoots<00:02:36.910> them<00:02:37.180> they'll

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and if an enemy shoots them they'll

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.150 
and if an enemy shoots them they'll
shrink<00:02:37.630> back<00:02:37.900> down<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.590> that'll<00:02:38.740> cause<00:02:38.980> you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
shrink back down and that'll cause you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.310 
shrink back down and that'll cause you
to<00:02:39.250> fall<00:02:39.430> off<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.210> way<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.540> game<00:02:40.720> teaches<00:02:40.990> you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
to fall off the way the game teaches you
