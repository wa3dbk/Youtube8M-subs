 hello friends, well today 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.590
 group your public yes I will spread 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.480
 let's look at the results 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 qualifications for the positions we have taken 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.600
 bar sat spectrum 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:36.960
 to tell the qualification was the last 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.399
 the segment was raining and I have 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:46.980
 suspicion that he was a candy he was on 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:50.090
 rain settings so he on the whole 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.539
 second and go to believe the mass 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:58.109
 what I want to note the difference 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.420
 he just flashed today even surprised 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.160

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.110
 alonso 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.689
 well then he comes this form I only 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.720

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.060
 All Vettel Felipe Mass 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.420

 webb nico rosberg kimi rayon kimi 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.170
 Raikkonen 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.659
 fined for blocking not to kin so 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.140
 what's inside the meat so it moves 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:34.550
 10 so it will be a tripod dozen 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:38.520
 filmed for an hour loaf 9 class a day and 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.820
 hit wait for all songs last time 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.300
 This is a list of Kimi Raikkonen 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:49.880
 Well tomorrow we promise 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:54.270
 also rain let's see the track 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:59.360
 let's go round and and I already uploaded the video so 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.360
 let's get a look 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.229
 and there is nothing and desire 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.640
 so let's start have to delete 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.540
 blood but pity him this year with us not 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:28.040
 will be so we approach the first 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.069
 gate i'm sorry i bad little talk 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:37.040
 i recently broke my right arm and 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:40.480
 Now I enter the left so I need to show 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:46.980
 ours turns out so we 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.980
 and finish the first sector suddenly here 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:58.329
 a little bit cut them off even scary on 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.900
 very difficult to turn 10 roman town on 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:05.079
 practice will not be able to turn around 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.920
 fit in and here is also very 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:13.260
 slippery was very beautiful turn was 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.260
 full collection begins Cindy ifolder.ru 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.010
 so finish the second sector 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:25.870
 sorry not learned all kind since 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.870
 we would not find it nazir 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.129
 so we'll do it today 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.270
 so here is a very strong hungry turn 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:41.530
 main or brake and 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.530
 so okay and surprisingly well 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.560
 here you can only all the holes 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.700
 use for sharing the figure we can 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.040
 do should be becoming right here and now 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.670
 will be management yes and he first with this 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.510
 lines can be opened by its 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:05.939
 what's ending suddenly 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.939
 one at 40 and 65 and won 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:19.970
 and so let's look at 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:23.250
 in circles q leaders let's choose 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.350
 Vettel and here the question is on let's 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.350
 let's see how they drove their brane 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.300
 then all the circles here we see the best 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.319
 result 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:44.629
 now of course showed drought 1 37 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:46.140
 here is the sixth lap today and see u mark 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.720
 of choice 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.650
 better will be faster 1 364 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.290
 but ultimately he gave way yielded 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.190
 mate 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:05.560
 gender position 40 to 49 and 6 and 7 not 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.540
 wrong in general as I said well 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.170
 I think there were already settings on 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.920
 the rain since the dry land he lost on 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.250
 bread so now let's take robert 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.770
 he is the leader in the second segment 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.770
 let's look at the scumbag 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:31.560
 answer time is 1 36 and 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:34.020
 and two dozen right to consider that is 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.060
 second quicker than dry land 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.760
 I do not know maybe red bull saved 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:43.920
 rubber but still they looked very 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.890
 pale for what brand and mast yourself in 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.420
 September staff do not know why here on 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.610
 whole second 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:56.970
 Rosberg ahead of 2 suck svetulya 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.900
 but in the end he took the floor and why 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:05.520
 that it started to rain this is my opinion 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:09.560
 let's see what will happen tomorrow and so here 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.190
 all I wanted to say we will wait for the wolf 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.160
