tornado-proof<00:01:08.549> already<00:01:09.950> should<00:01:10.950> weigh<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
tornado-proof already should weigh it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.890 
tornado-proof already should weigh it
down

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900

this<00:02:31.360> these<00:02:31.629> logs<00:02:31.900> all<00:02:32.140> blown<00:02:32.830> over<00:02:32.950> or<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.310> it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
this these logs all blown over or is it

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.740 
this these logs all blown over or is it
fences<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.849> something<00:02:34.060> fences<00:02:34.599> no<00:02:34.900> roofs<00:02:36.750> this

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750

fences or something fences no roofs this
game-mode<00:02:38.019> would<00:02:38.260> be<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.380> lot<00:02:38.530> better<00:02:38.560> if<00:02:38.769> there

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
game-mode would be a lot better if there

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.819 
game-mode would be a lot better if there
