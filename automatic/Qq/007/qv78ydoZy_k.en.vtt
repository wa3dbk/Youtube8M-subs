00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.579
 guys ceccato I hope you go 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.619
 well we're here today for a 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.789
 little video a little bit special 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.960
 as you will have seen in a small 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.529
 basin it's a case m 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.300
 nay phonie so on ghost before any 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.789
 thing I just wanted to talk to you that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.460
 this video will be sent to qg code 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.629
 as well as at the united navfor so when 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.040
 that I have I no longer present all the 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.510
 world knows and the night for the united 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.329
 it's just the chain 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.050
 community of French swimmers but 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.719
 not that short end 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.180
 so here I thank him both 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.190
 if he clauds me then I'll go 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.870
 talk fast is the gameplay before 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.510
 talk about the main subject of the video 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.969
 so the gameplay is like you 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.359
 will have seen the kid is the 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.280
 drop zone so on freight so I 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.780
 I was playing my class 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.820
 to say it is simply not so 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.199
 senior weapon in secondary 44 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.310
 magnum with tactical knife 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.340
 besides as much for me I have the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.470
 sniper in the main so I use it 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.080
 it's never used to do anything brief 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.840
 of 44 magnum costs the tactics 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.780
 I have a knife throwing a grenade 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.899
 will speak after all that is 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.039
 trumps I reflexed so to throw 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.750
 the knives throw faster 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.899
 I had also looters for 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.940
 pick up the knives to throw I 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.039
 agility so to run faster and the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.899
 last I say no nonsense it's 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.440
 extra mortals so to have double 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.729
 throwing knives 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.979
 so that's what about the 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.569
 class and gameplay I also held 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.700
 also to clarify immediately before 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.920
 everything a moment I wanted to do 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.929
 a kilo snipers I did not do it 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.280
 I shot but I did not touch so 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.250
 it's really a car 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.820
 the iphone nor there really was the 25th at 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.770
 knife 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.740
 and I also wanted to clarify 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.150
 so I played without parents 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.520
 specialists because that's the area of 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.030
 dropping so I had money score 0 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.149
 to help me no drone nothing here 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.200
 so I was playing solo and so 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.090
 I came across a lobby at the beginning there 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.030
 Exceeds me a little bit we can see it 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.260
 fall from 1.5 here are 2 6 3 and from 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.670
 there I believe that the series will start or 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.600
 it's from this two sets jo 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.290
 what seems to me that the series is going 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.880
 start so here it was solo I 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.890
 did not have any friends to tell me 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.720
 enemies all that I was playing without the sound 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.280
 it's also a small peculiarity I 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.620
 really plays samson I was counting 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.660
 skype with friends so that was enough 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.250
 fun diaries or an epic reaction that's 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.630
 pity I did not record on 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.560
 my gameplay so she was on skype 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.530
 registered people 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.810
 So here and we will go not just yet 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.989
 following the main subject of this 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.030
 gameplay it's just naming 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.709
 on the school usually offers 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.980
 so I want to clarify immediately 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.739
 before being criticized this is my 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.480
 personal opinion but I know it 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.190
 joined the opinion of a good 9 hours in 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.930
 general even though I'm part of 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.040
 new iphone and not those who are 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.000
 there from the beginning 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.260
 so here I really wanted to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.650
 specify to be in agreement 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.250
 start so bah the naming for me on 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.930
 the call of 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.600
 what is it started to evolve 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.650
 even though I was not there at the beginning 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.450
 so I started naming 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.560
 in 2014 so mid 2014 we will say was 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.090
 so I joined there there is a case that 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.829
 I think everyone knows too 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.950
 also two teams 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.379
 french give george lane head a 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.359
 sim only with a knife 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.000
 after his throwing knives or high 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.310
 waves drone on to w or any equivalent 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.280
 rather ballistic on bo 2 for example 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.109
 great short life so the children inc 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.709
 for me I started in as I 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:46.019
 you say on ghost and modern 3 so 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.069
 monein 3 which is for me a very good 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.389
 quite complicated game, moreover, vis-à-vis 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.209
 lobbies so the lobbies are pretty 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.549
 complicated there are a lot of people say 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.049
 they do not play very well even 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.120
 if there is not necessarily a style of play 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.510
 okay I mean each one his style of 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.430
 So here monein game 3 is a great 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.720
 game so here it was it was me who the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.709
 sniper I did not touch them I read you 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.680
 marks and you will have seen it 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.230
 so there's no ambiguity over 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.900
 that ghost after stays for the naive 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.609
 hours I think the best game even though 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.739
 I know it's pretty much shared 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.970
 vis-à-vis the o2 my kids I think 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.020
 that we all come together to say that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.520
 it's the game of racing in general be2 that 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.860
 quite complicated so I know that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.860
 many like but many do not like 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.480
 not so that's it's really shared 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.910
 awc different nos it's new there 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.230
 had a little fashion effect I know that 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.720
 the same everyone was going on 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.790
 in the beginning what is normal it is enough 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.470
 complicated then I little by little we have 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.420
 taken our landmarks so naive and we have 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.860
 took a little bit our mark on it and 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.540
 of a little by little precisely this has 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.910
 started also a little bit at the it's 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.770
 a little people the fact that there is no 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.900
 a lot of diversity his game actually he 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.700
 is that the knife so tactical 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.470
 the west where the spac drones but the spac 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.020
 customs it's pretty ugly so I find 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.160
 this is my opinion it's pretty ugly 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.260
 because let's say we can do 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.260
 really way too many kills say 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.750
 random ie not expected we will say 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.830
 that like that, sometimes I know 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.270
 that I put some teams in 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.250
 which there were boomerangs so 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.350
 spider returns that was not 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.670
 inevitably asked and in the end it gives 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.410
 a clip and I find it really 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.700
 ugly and I know that there are some who 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.910
 really put the Gossip 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.170
 but despite knowing I find one there it is 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.650
 really my opinion to me though I 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.510
 find that for example what a fido 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.270
 knives throwing on ghost will be more 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.320
 nice that a speedrun cifit tonight w the 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.870
 are ready that's my opinion but I 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.850
 know that a lot of nice will close johan 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.170
 on it to say that w is not 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.280
 necessarily good vis-à-vis a and girls 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.730
 let's say because the game itself 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.380
 is not not ugly 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.550
 so here I talked about 2003 after 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.590
 it's true that I did not know so much 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.830
 racing on be1 and on others call 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.450
 of 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.220
 even though everyone knows of course 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.630
 the commando so there any commando of 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.040
 modern that allowed a little bit 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.320
 Medea costs rather anywhere 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.670
 anyhow to anyone and good 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.020
 here I know it was not great this 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.180
 was not very beautiful to watch because 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.340
 that good it was not necessarily planned so 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.450
 here I am in the process I am in series 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.050
 tomorrow so I 'm at five kits of 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.340
 acca m 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.750
 and yet we can see I stay when 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.700
 even a little bit just archi middle map 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.530
 I waited for three guys quickly 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.820
 we copper where I do not have a game it's 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.050
 because they finally have short I want 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.720
 to say that the lobby was not magic 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.460
 so here we go 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.310
 what did I mean on 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.200
 be1 i know it's the same it's pretty 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.400
 complicated vis-à-vis the lobbies and then 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.250
 it must be said that the knives of 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.170
 launch the ballistics are pretty slow 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.580
 compared to the old claj bellac am 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.560
 we can see that I move more I was 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.760
 in gt mode in epic mode no reaction 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.490
 I was in a relationship I was like crazy 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.990
 this is my first can am guys my 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.160
 first of all a confused everything I 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.360
 mean I never liked anyway 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.970
 alarm or not because I do not play 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.140
 never alarm and in the same day in 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.970
 is like three hours after I put 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.470
 a fortnight sniper live so 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.550
 it was still pretty epic case 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.650
 even in the day it was my 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.270
 first time anyway it's pretty fun and 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.560
 so it's still sniper enough 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.700
 rare there was not much I do not say 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.890
 that he never has because there is one 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.380
 of our fellow French Taillefer 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:08.160
 across the Atlantic who made it so 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:10.020
 Here I was pretty proud of myself so bah 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.850
 as I tell you I hope that like 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.770
 subject the navfor united you clauds me and

 unfortunately I did not have too much 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.780
 time and now it's complicated 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.190
