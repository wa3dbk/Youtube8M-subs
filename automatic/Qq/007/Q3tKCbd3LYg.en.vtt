available on every single class but we
did<00:01:41.490> are<00:01:41.640> seeing<00:01:42.000> off<00:01:42.210> road<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.540> time<00:01:42.600> but

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
did are seeing off road this time but

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
did are seeing off road this time but
the<00:01:43.470> best<00:01:43.649> thing<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.880> like

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the best thing about this is it's like

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
the best thing about this is it's like
jumps<00:01:45.600> jumps<00:01:45.780> jumps<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.590> better<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
jumps jumps jumps but just better and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
jumps jumps jumps but just better and
there's<00:01:47.850> multiple<00:01:48.210> choices<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.780> either

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

there's multiple choices you can either
take<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> huge<00:01:49.740> jumps<00:01:50.159> or<00:01:50.899> there's<00:01:51.899> twists

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
take the huge jumps or there's twists

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.620 
take the huge jumps or there's twists
and<00:01:52.560> turns<00:01:52.740> where<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.670> somehow<00:01:54.149> or

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and turns where you can somehow or

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.319 
and turns where you can somehow or
suddenly<00:01:55.399> there's<00:01:56.399> options<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.119> that

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
suddenly there's options so see that

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.240 
suddenly there's options so see that
side<00:01:57.570> ramp<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.350> go<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.740> side<00:01:58.979> ramp

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
side ramp you can go up that side ramp

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.060 
side ramp you can go up that side ramp
and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
and

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.710 
and
around<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.520> missed<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.909> jump<00:02:01.150> depending<00:02:01.659> on

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
around and missed the jump depending on

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.600 
around and missed the jump depending on
watch<00:02:01.870> cars<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.290> pick<00:02:02.530> because<00:02:03.070> not<00:02:03.370> every

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
watch cars you pick because not every

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.340 
watch cars you pick because not every
car<00:02:03.820> make<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.300> jump<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.659> sometimes<00:02:05.140> it's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
car make the jump and sometimes it's

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.860 
car make the jump and sometimes it's
faster<00:02:06.150> towards<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.240> end<00:02:07.390> there's<00:02:07.630> lots<00:02:07.780> of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
faster towards the end there's lots of

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.690 
faster towards the end there's lots of
twists<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.289> turns<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.920> might<00:02:09.100> find<00:02:09.130> some

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
twists and turns and you might find some

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.150 
twists and turns and you might find some
debris<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.899> will<00:02:11.140> move<00:02:11.350> in<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.920> middle<00:02:12.130> of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
debris that will move in the middle of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.340 
debris that will move in the middle of
the<00:02:12.220> road<00:02:12.459> but<00:02:12.700> all<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.209> all<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.360> very<00:02:13.510> very<00:02:14.020> fun

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
the road but all in all a very very fun

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.040 
the road but all in all a very very fun
race<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.400> float<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.150> at<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.390> start<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.900> be

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
race and you float in at the start to be

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.960 
race and you float in at the start to be
careful<00:02:17.410> with<00:02:17.530> motorbikes<00:02:17.800> number<00:02:18.640> two<00:02:18.820> is

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
careful with motorbikes number two is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.550 
careful with motorbikes number two is
mount<00:02:19.180> chileo<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.750> was<00:02:19.930> made<00:02:20.080> by<00:02:20.200> one<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.440> my

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
mount chileo this was made by one of my

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.880 
mount chileo this was made by one of my
crew<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.190> read<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.959> one<00:02:23.170> basically<00:02:23.590> just

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
crew I read this one basically just

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.949 
crew I read this one basically just
raises<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.459> up<00:02:24.580> Mount<00:02:24.940> chiliad<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.570> then

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
raises you up Mount chiliad and then

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.260 
raises you up Mount chiliad and then
down<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.590> really<00:02:26.890> dramatic<00:02:27.070> fashion<00:02:27.550> so

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
down in a really dramatic fashion so

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.870 
down in a really dramatic fashion so
it's<00:02:29.050> available<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.770> every<00:02:30.010> type<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.370> classic

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
it's available on every type of classic

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.670 
it's available on every type of classic
car<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.600> don't<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.470> use

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
car so you don't just have to use

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.290 
car so you don't just have to use
off-road<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.250> mean<00:02:33.400> we're<00:02:33.610> using<00:02:33.850> off-road

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
off-road I mean we're using off-road

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.660 
off-road I mean we're using off-road
just<00:02:34.600> because<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.739> seems<00:02:36.070> like<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.280> lot<00:02:36.520> more

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
just because it seems like a lot more

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.240 
just because it seems like a lot more
fun<00:02:36.940> but<00:02:37.480> basically<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.410> goes<00:02:38.590> up<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.920> one

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
fun but basically the it goes up the one

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.440 
fun but basically the it goes up the one
of<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.430> rods<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.970> side<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.360> mountain

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
of the rods on the side of the mountain

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.410 
of the rods on the side of the mountain
so<00:02:40.750> there's<00:02:40.930> lots<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.260> twists<00:02:41.500> lots<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.920> turns

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
so there's lots of twists lots of turns

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.880 
so there's lots of twists lots of turns
the<00:02:43.420> more<00:02:43.600> people<00:02:43.870> on<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.260> more<00:02:44.470> likely

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
the more people on it the more likely

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.850 
the more people on it the more likely
people<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.310> go<00:02:45.459> over<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:46.000> side<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.860> crash

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
people that go over the side and crash

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.130 
people that go over the side and crash
but<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.790> can<00:02:48.940> see<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.390> he<00:02:49.750> can<00:02:49.900> go<00:02:50.020> up

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
but you can see that the he can go up

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.350 
but you can see that the he can go up
whichever<00:02:50.500> route<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.830> want<00:02:51.070> as<00:02:51.970> long<00:02:52.030> as<00:02:52.269> you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
whichever route you want as long as you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.150 
whichever route you want as long as you
go<00:02:52.570> through<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.050> general<00:02:53.500> route<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.860> then<00:02:54.010> at

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
go through the general route and then at

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.040 
go through the general route and then at
the<00:02:54.190> end<00:02:54.370> once<00:02:54.700> you're<00:02:54.820> at<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.940> top<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.840> come

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
the end once you're at the top you come

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.479 
the end once you're at the top you come
around<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.380> back<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.830> know<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.130> huge

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
around the back and you know that huge

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.640 
around the back and you know that huge
job<00:02:57.760> left<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.180> other<00:02:58.300> end<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
job left on the other end that is the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.590 
job left on the other end that is the
way<00:02:59.769> down<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.370> you'll<00:03:00.489> find<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.090> finish<00:03:01.390> line

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
way down and you'll find the finish line

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.509 
way down and you'll find the finish line
is<00:03:01.810> pretty<00:03:02.050> close<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.500> star<00:03:02.769> line<00:03:02.980> so

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
is pretty close to the star line so

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.979 
is pretty close to the star line so
whichever<00:03:04.090> route<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.420> take<00:03:04.690> whether<00:03:04.900> you

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
whichever route you take whether you

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.920 
whichever route you take whether you
take<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.350> left<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.709> right<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.070> middle<00:03:06.930> this

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
take the left to right the middle this

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.740 
take the left to right the middle this
is<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.410> could<00:03:08.590> crash<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.070> can<00:03:09.250> blow<00:03:09.400> up<00:03:09.430> it

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
is it you could crash you can blow up it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.360 
is it you could crash you can blow up it
completely<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.780> ugly<00:03:11.080> random<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:12.220> was

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
completely and ugly random so that was
