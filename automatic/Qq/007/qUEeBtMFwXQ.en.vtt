00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.509 

but<00:04:04.460> this<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.790> actually<00:04:05.000> spring<00:04:05.660> water

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.580 

imagine<00:04:10.359> that<00:04:10.510> pond<00:04:11.079> of<00:04:11.379> spring<00:04:11.709> water

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.759 

and<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.190> can<00:04:16.370> tell<00:04:16.579> it's<00:04:16.730> very<00:04:16.820> clean<00:04:17.769> could

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
and you can tell it's very clean could

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.530 
and you can tell it's very clean could
you<00:04:18.889> see<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.220> plant<00:04:19.579> down<00:04:19.820> there<00:04:20.150> over<00:04:20.269> the

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
you see that plant down there over the

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.460 
you see that plant down there over the
oval-shaped<00:04:20.989> leaves

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
oval-shaped leaves

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.370 
oval-shaped leaves
that's<00:04:24.470> called<00:04:24.740> spongy<00:04:25.310> Tong<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.230> that's<00:04:27.230> an

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
that's called spongy Tong and that's an

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:39.070 
that's called spongy Tong and that's an
indicator<00:04:27.919> of<00:04:28.070> clean<00:04:28.430> water

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.220 

just<00:04:40.080> going<00:04:40.319> to<00:04:40.380> walk<00:04:40.590> further<00:04:40.949> up
