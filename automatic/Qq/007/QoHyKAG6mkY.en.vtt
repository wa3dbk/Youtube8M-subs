00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
dad and and I want to say it's my sister

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.190 
dad and and I want to say it's my sister
but<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> don't<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.939> except<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
but I don't think it is except for the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.270 
but I don't think it is except for the
fact<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:24.110> her<00:01:25.110> being<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.530> sister<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.130> how<00:01:26.220> we

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
fact that her being my sister and how we

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.130 
fact that her being my sister and how we
used<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.880> such<00:01:27.060> awful<00:01:27.570> fights<00:01:27.810> when<00:01:27.990> we

used to get in such awful fights when we

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
used to get in such awful fights when we
were<00:01:28.200> younger<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.770> think<00:01:29.720> that<00:01:31.579> now<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> we're

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.620 
were younger I think that now that we're
such<00:01:33.180> we're<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:33.990> close<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:35.180> think<00:01:36.180> I've<00:01:36.329> learned

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
such we're so close I think I've learned

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
how to control my anger better that was

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
how to control my anger better that was
when<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.280> younger<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.610> mean<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.970> was<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
when I was younger I mean I was just a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
when I was younger I mean I was just a
problem<00:01:46.079> i<00:01:46.170> had<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.680> um<00:01:46.890> i<00:01:47.390> don't<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.450> i

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
problem i had but um i don't know i

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.020 
problem i had but um i don't know i
think<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.350> Sheila<00:01:49.860> my<00:01:50.250> sister<00:01:50.610> I'm<00:01:50.759> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
think with with Sheila my sister I'm I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.540 
think with with Sheila my sister I'm I
think<00:01:51.329> she's<00:01:51.570> impact<00:01:51.990> me<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.229> most<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:53.009> shave

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
think she's impact me the most or shave

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.670 
think she's impact me the most or shave
most<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.510> way<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.660> interact<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.320> people

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
most and the way I interact with people

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.250 
most and the way I interact with people
but<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.730> think<00:01:56.910> overall<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.720> person<00:01:58.080> was

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
but I think overall the person was

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.660 
but I think overall the person was
shaping<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> most<00:01:58.980> would<00:01:59.220> have<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.550> my

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
shaping the most would have to be my

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.170 
shaping the most would have to be my
best<00:01:59.850> friend<00:01:59.970> Haley<00:02:00.450> um<00:02:01.040> I<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.940> sounds

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
significant but it really isn't I like
