a nice tutorial how to set up a trap

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
a nice tutorial how to set up a trap
door<00:01:12.830> his<00:01:13.830> setup<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.540> s<00:01:15.920> compact<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
door his setup is the s compact this

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.230 
door his setup is the s compact this
mine<00:01:17.460> um<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:19.350> only<00:01:19.380> advantage<00:01:19.950> map<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.030> my

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
mine um the only advantage map with my

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.640 
mine um the only advantage map with my
setup<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> uses<00:01:24.170> not<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.380> many

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
setup here is that it uses not as many

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
setup here is that it uses not as many
resources<00:01:25.950> namely<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.119> need<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
resources namely you don't need that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.760 
resources namely you don't need that
many<00:01:27.689> repeat<00:01:28.500> us<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.860> only<00:01:28.970> need<00:01:29.970> four

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
many repeat us you only need four

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.740 
many repeat us you only need four
instead<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.920> eight<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.549> he<00:01:33.270> shows<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.720> his

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
instead of eight which he shows in his

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.260 
instead of eight which he shows in his
tutorial<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.979> guess<00:01:35.220> he<00:01:35.369> uses<00:01:35.549> slightly

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
tutorial but I guess he uses slightly

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.710 
tutorial but I guess he uses slightly
less<00:01:36.450> redstone<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.290> yeah<00:01:37.530> give<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.250> take

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
less redstone so yeah give or take

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.620 
less redstone so yeah give or take
ditson<00:01:39.720> an<00:01:39.869> alternative<00:01:40.650> design<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.630> next

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
ditson an alternative design and next

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
ditson an alternative design and next
step<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.200> we're<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> attempt<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> build

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
step is we're going to attempt to build

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.429 
step is we're going to attempt to build
one<00:01:46.549> ok<00:01:47.549> guys<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.689> had<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> look<00:01:49.229> at

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
one ok guys so now as we had a look at

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
one ok guys so now as we had a look at
the<00:01:49.560> inner<00:01:49.770> workings<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> thing<00:01:50.909> let's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the inner workings of the thing let's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.780 
the inner workings of the thing let's
build<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:53.040> pretty<00:01:53.340> simple<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.649> put

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
build one it's pretty simple just put

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.380 
build one it's pretty simple just put
six<00:01:56.790> sticky<00:01:57.270> pistons<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:59.549> on<00:02:00.149> top

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
six sticky pistons like so and on top

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929 
six sticky pistons like so and on top
you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.899> put<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.320> block<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.950> want<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.369> shove

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
you can put your block you want to shove

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.260 
you can put your block you want to shove
up<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.390> close<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:04.100> trap<00:02:05.100> door<00:02:05.340> width<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
up and close your trap door width on the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:17.650 
up and close your trap door width on the
opposite<00:02:06.659> side<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.619> exactly<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.340> same

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.860 

make<00:02:18.660> sure<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.800> leave<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> two<00:02:20.340> wide<00:02:20.580> gap<00:02:21.000> here

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
make sure to leave a two wide gap here

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.170 
make sure to leave a two wide gap here
in<00:02:22.140> between<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.280> why<00:02:23.459> your<00:02:23.670> channel<00:02:24.150> is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
in between this is why your channel is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.350 
in between this is why your channel is
going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.709> now<00:02:25.709> what<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.069> can<00:02:26.220> do<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.330> can

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
going to go now what you can do you can

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.660 
going to go now what you can do you can
close<00:02:27.900> off<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.290> top<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.370> imagine

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
close off the top so you can imagine

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.809 
close off the top so you can imagine
better<00:02:30.269> where<00:02:30.780> your<00:02:31.160> channel<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.280> everything

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
better where your channel and everything

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.540 
better where your channel and everything
will<00:02:33.000> go<00:02:34.310> drop<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:36.390> white<00:02:37.069> trapdoor<00:02:38.069> set<00:02:38.400> up

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
will go drop to white trapdoor set up

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.710 
will go drop to white trapdoor set up
here<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.849> want<00:02:42.120> use

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
here do it like so if you want use

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.000 
here do it like so if you want use
anything<00:02:43.080> use<00:02:43.530> any<00:02:43.739> material<00:02:44.360> for<00:02:45.360> sure

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
anything use any material for sure

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.930 
anything use any material for sure
alright<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:48.000> now<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.510> basic<00:02:49.019> setup<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.530> done

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
alright so now the basic setup is done

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.759 
alright so now the basic setup is done
now<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.150> time<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.660> wiring<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.380> don't

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
now it's time for the wiring and don't

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.330 
now it's time for the wiring and don't
worry<00:02:52.980> guys<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.549> pretty<00:02:54.269> simple<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.980> place

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
worry guys it's pretty simple just place

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.420 
worry guys it's pretty simple just place
two<00:02:56.640> blocks<00:02:56.880> here<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.319> do<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> same<00:02:58.830> thing<00:02:59.190> on

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
two blocks here and do the same thing on

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.350 
two blocks here and do the same thing on
the<00:02:59.970> opposite<00:03:00.360> side<00:03:01.819> when<00:03:02.819> you're<00:03:02.970> done<00:03:03.180> with

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the opposite side when you're done with

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.490 
the opposite side when you're done with
that<00:03:03.390> it's<00:03:03.870> time<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.230> hook<00:03:04.920> up<00:03:05.130> some<00:03:05.430> repeaters

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
that it's time to hook up some repeaters

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.460 
that it's time to hook up some repeaters
place<00:03:07.500> them<00:03:07.769> facing<00:03:08.340> outward<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.349> put<00:03:10.349> them

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
place them facing outward and put them

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.009 
place them facing outward and put them
to<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.650> first<00:03:11.010> setting<00:03:11.459> do<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.569> on<00:03:12.900> all<00:03:12.959> four

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
to the first setting do that on all four

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.550 
to the first setting do that on all four
positions<00:03:16.019> here<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.640> last<00:03:20.850> one<00:03:21.560> right

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
positions here so in the last one right

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.670 
positions here so in the last one right
here<00:03:23.120> next<00:03:24.120> step<00:03:25.640> block<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.000> four<00:03:27.569> corners

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.210 

last<00:03:31.680> step<00:03:32.160> for<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:33.060> basic<00:03:33.510> wiring<00:03:34.220> throw

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
last step for the basic wiring throw

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.530 
last step for the basic wiring throw
some<00:03:35.430> redstone<00:03:35.670> dust<00:03:36.150> on<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> four<00:03:36.720> corners

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
some redstone dust on the four corners

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.830 
some redstone dust on the four corners
just<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.690> simple<00:03:39.900> s<00:03:40.230> debt<00:03:40.609> now<00:03:41.609> it's<00:03:42.389> time<00:03:42.600> to

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
just a simple s debt now it's time to

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.590 
just a simple s debt now it's time to
wire<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.200> thing<00:03:43.410> together<00:03:44.239> if<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.389> put<00:03:45.569> a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
wire this thing together if you put a

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.349 
wire this thing together if you put a
redstone<00:03:45.870> down<00:03:46.350> like<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.889> one<00:03:47.730> side<00:03:48.030> is

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
redstone down like this one side is

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.250 
redstone down like this one side is
already<00:03:48.900> functioning<00:03:49.319> if<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.250> test<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.850> and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
already functioning if you test it and

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.819 
already functioning if you test it and
there<00:03:52.260> we<00:03:52.380> go<00:03:53.120> blogs<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.359> out<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.930> up<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:57.829> last

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
there we go blogs go out and up so last

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.120 
there we go blogs go out and up so last
step<00:03:59.190> would<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.850> connect<00:04:00.810> both<00:04:01.290> sides<00:04:01.709> to

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
step would be to connect both sides to

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.390 
step would be to connect both sides to
work<00:04:02.310> together<00:04:02.489> one<00:04:03.299> way<00:04:03.859> maybe<00:04:04.859> you<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.160> come

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
work together one way maybe you can come

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.099 
work together one way maybe you can come
up<00:04:05.549> with<00:04:05.700> some<00:04:05.940> more<00:04:06.120> nifty<00:04:06.510> wiring<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.049> I

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
up with some more nifty wiring but I

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.710 
up with some more nifty wiring but I
think<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.680> good<00:04:07.829> way<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.100> just<00:04:08.400> simply<00:04:08.850> do

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
think it's a good way is just simply do

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.789 
think it's a good way is just simply do
a<00:04:09.750> trench<00:04:10.170> around<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.739> outside<00:04:11.280> corner<00:04:11.730> here

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
a trench around the outside corner here

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.539 
a trench around the outside corner here
also<00:04:13.799> don't<00:04:14.130> forget<00:04:14.220> your<00:04:14.790> redstone<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.630> here

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
also don't forget your redstone on here

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.950 
also don't forget your redstone on here
to<00:04:17.549> have<00:04:17.760> some<00:04:18.000> more

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.950 

so<00:04:23.960> some<00:04:24.590> more<00:04:24.770> redstone<00:04:25.660> make<00:04:26.660> sure<00:04:26.690> to

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
so some more redstone make sure to

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.810 
so some more redstone make sure to
connect<00:04:27.560> both<00:04:27.860> sides<00:04:29.290> like<00:04:30.290> so<00:04:30.620> that's<00:04:31.160> even

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
connect both sides like so that's even

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.680 
connect both sides like so that's even
better<00:04:32.030> if<00:04:32.450> you<00:04:32.690> go<00:04:33.220> down<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:35.260> like<00:04:36.260> so<00:04:37.690> it's

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
better if you go down here like so it's

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.380 
better if you go down here like so it's
important<00:04:39.230> for<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.740> placement<00:04:40.730> of<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.150> lever

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
important for the placement of the lever

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.630 
important for the placement of the lever
later<00:04:41.690> on<00:04:42.190> there<00:04:43.190> we<00:04:43.340> go<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:44.390> now<00:04:45.250> yeah<00:04:46.250> we're

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
later on there we go and now yeah we're

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.020 
later on there we go and now yeah we're
done<00:04:46.820> guys<00:04:47.320> Singh<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.350> working<00:04:49.030> functioning

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
done guys Singh is working functioning

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:57.910 
done guys Singh is working functioning
let's<00:04:50.270> test<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:51.580> boom<00:04:53.200> trap<00:04:54.200> door<00:04:54.230> up<00:04:56.920> trap

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
let's test it boom trap door up trap

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.870 
let's test it boom trap door up trap
door<00:04:58.130> down<00:04:58.720> let<00:04:59.720> me<00:04:59.750> quickly<00:05:00.400> turn<00:05:01.400> to

door down let me quickly turn to
daylight<00:05:02.660> last<00:05:03.650> step<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.280> know<00:05:04.400> that's<00:05:04.760> a<00:05:05.630> way

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
daylight last step you know that's a way

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.410 
daylight last step you know that's a way
you<00:05:06.140> can<00:05:06.440> have<00:05:06.740> your<00:05:06.890> levers<00:05:07.310> on<00:05:07.490> top<00:05:07.730> as<00:05:07.970> I<00:05:08.180> did

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
you can have your levers on top as I did

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.020 
you can have your levers on top as I did
if<00:05:09.140> you<00:05:09.290> want<00:05:09.530> to<00:05:09.650> do<00:05:09.800> that<00:05:10.040> make<00:05:10.430> sure<00:05:10.460> to

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
if you want to do that make sure to

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.230 
if you want to do that make sure to
place<00:05:11.660> them<00:05:11.990> on<00:05:12.170> the<00:05:12.230> on<00:05:12.800> top<00:05:13.670> of<00:05:13.910> whether

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
place them on the on top of whether

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.840 
place them on the on top of whether
redstone<00:05:14.990> line<00:05:15.170> goes<00:05:15.410> out<00:05:15.680> here<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.130> you<00:05:16.700> know

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
redstone line goes out here and you know

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.700 
redstone line goes out here and you know
tries<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.300> merge<00:05:17.510> with<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.840> other<00:05:17.990> side<00:05:18.320> if

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
tries to merge with the other side if

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.130 
tries to merge with the other side if
you<00:05:18.920> go<00:05:19.070> the<00:05:19.220> other<00:05:19.250> way<00:05:19.460> around<00:05:19.630> your<00:05:20.630> lever

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
you go the other way around your lever

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.620 
you go the other way around your lever
goes<00:05:21.410> there<00:05:21.710> if<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.310> have<00:05:22.460> it<00:05:22.580> like<00:05:22.790> me<00:05:23.030> you'll

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
goes there if you have it like me you'll

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.600 
goes there if you have it like me you'll
ever<00:05:23.870> goes<00:05:24.110> there<00:05:24.350> if<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:24.950> don't<00:05:25.160> do<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.460> like

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
ever goes there if you don't do it like

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.570 
ever goes there if you don't do it like
that<00:05:25.670> it<00:05:26.150> won't<00:05:26.450> reach<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.650> door<00:05:27.920> won't

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
that it won't reach and the door won't

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.620 
that it won't reach and the door won't
fully<00:05:28.910> closed<00:05:29.360> i<00:05:29.600> will<00:05:29.750> demonstrate<00:05:29.930> that<00:05:30.500> see

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
fully closed i will demonstrate that see

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.880 
fully closed i will demonstrate that see
so<00:05:32.630> you<00:05:32.690> then<00:05:32.990> you<00:05:33.140> would<00:05:33.290> need<00:05:33.440> an<00:05:33.590> additional

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
so you then you would need an additional

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.280 
so you then you would need an additional
repeater<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:35.090> setup<00:05:35.570> would<00:05:35.690> become<00:05:36.080> more

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
repeater and the setup would become more

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.380 
repeater and the setup would become more
complicated<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:37.340> this<00:05:37.550> is<00:05:37.640> a<00:05:37.730> compromise<00:05:38.150> you

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
complicated so this is a compromise you

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.390 
complicated so this is a compromise you
have<00:05:38.480> to<00:05:38.630> do<00:05:38.810> same<00:05:39.410> goes<00:05:39.650> for<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:39.920> other<00:05:40.010> side

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
have to do same goes for the other side

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
have to do same goes for the other side
place<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:41.120> if<00:05:41.270> you<00:05:41.420> want<00:05:41.660> it<00:05:41.720> there<00:05:41.990> on<00:05:42.200> top<00:05:42.500> of

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
place it if you want it there on top of

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.790 
place it if you want it there on top of
the<00:05:44.420> red<00:05:45.080> stone<00:05:45.350> Junction<00:05:45.800> there<00:05:46.250> so<00:05:47.800> see
