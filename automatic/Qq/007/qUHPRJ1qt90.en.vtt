00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 [Music] 

00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.710
 researchers from the University of 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.200
 good airs specifically from the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.019
 faculty of agronomy are advancing in 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.600
 techniques whose objective is to clone 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.180
 animals in extinction 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.180
 in the laboratory of biotechnology 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.460
 animal of the faculty of agronomy 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.670
 work in the cloning of felines in 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.710
 danger of extinction the potential 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.529
 who have these investigations of the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.380
 Argentine scientists seem not to have 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.360
 limits so far we have worked with 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 the domestic cat is to say to be able 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.850
 do something in something that is exotic and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.540
 difficult it is necessary to lay the foundations 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.910
 then we have been 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 performing cloning processes in the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.339
 last couple of years of cats in very shape 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.769
 successful and thanks to the donation of 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.949
 Zoo of Buenos Aires- this we have 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.629
 been creating tigers and girls and now to 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.290
 through an agreement with a group 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.080
 Australian is not donated cells of a 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.610
 African cat that is called the cat 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.979
 rowan that is in danger of extinction 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.650
 and with which we are going to start 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.010
 make this cloned embryos and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.840
 implement them in a short time what 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.210
 we want to show that the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.329
 cloning will serve to preserve 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 species and the most important thing that already today 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.170
 we should be prey 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.300
 of skin cells of all the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 species because that will allow us in 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.220
 a future when genetic diversity 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.990
 will go back to these animals of the past 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.910
 that are going to be even far away are going to 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.680
 be much less relatives because every 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.290
 they are restricted 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.229
 plus the animals and their number is reduced 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.720
 the lawyer looked Moor is a 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.590
 vital researcher in this group of 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.350
 work in the future to a possibility 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.820
 it is an advantage for us to be able 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 get some benefit from this kind of 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.619
 animals thinking a little more selfish 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.660
 more in man but basically it's 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.630
 maintain the balance that nature 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.729
 has preserved for millions of years 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.829
 eventual discover for example by 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.489
 example if there are animals that today 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.610
 in day we investigate your physiology or your 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:16.690
 behavior but in the future to what 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.330
 better can you help us try some 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.580
 disease in the human or find a 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.160
 cure for some disease and in the case 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.690
 of the data for example are important 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.769
 to investigate about Alzheimer's that 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.340
 they also suffer it, so that's 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.340
 an example
