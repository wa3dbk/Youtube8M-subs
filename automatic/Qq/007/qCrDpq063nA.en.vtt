one<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.500> Ripper's<00:01:44.830> I<00:01:44.920> got<00:01:45.070> him<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.250> run<00:01:45.430> to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
one of the Ripper's I got him a run to

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.910 
one of the Ripper's I got him a run to
120<00:01:46.060> first<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.480> all<00:01:46.570> put<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.290> center<00:01:47.620> fitting

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
120 first of all put the center fitting

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.710 
120 first of all put the center fitting
and<00:01:48.160> with<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.670> small<00:01:48.940> slouch<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.390> he's<00:01:49.510> still

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
and with the small slouch and he's still

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.450 
and with the small slouch and he's still
only<00:01:49.840> on<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.080> one-and-a-half<00:01:50.560> meter<00:01:50.920> Sal<00:01:51.160> it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
only on the one-and-a-half meter Sal it

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.580 
only on the one-and-a-half meter Sal it
just<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.300> think<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.570> master<00:01:52.960> foot<00:01:53.080> compared<00:01:53.500> to

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
just I think the master foot compared to

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.170 
just I think the master foot compared to
the<00:01:53.680> center<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.280> have<00:01:54.310> in<00:01:54.550> combination<00:01:55.150> to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
the center and we have in combination to

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.540 
the center and we have in combination to
be<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.420> bit<00:01:55.570> closer<00:01:55.930> together<00:01:56.230> it<00:01:57.040> just<00:01:57.190> allowed

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
be a bit closer together it just allowed

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.400 
be a bit closer together it just allowed
him<00:01:57.760> now<00:01:57.910> -<00:01:58.000> not<00:01:58.270> just<00:01:58.480> sail<00:01:58.690> across<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.080> wind

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
him now - not just sail across the wind

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.320 
him now - not just sail across the wind
certainly<00:02:00.280> not<00:02:00.430> go<00:02:00.580> downwards<00:02:01.000> actually

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
certainly not go downwards actually

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330 
certainly not go downwards actually
sailing<00:02:01.540> upwind<00:02:01.840> with<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.380> little<00:02:02.620> 1/2<00:02:03.100> meter

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
sailing upwind with a little 1/2 meter

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.130 
sailing upwind with a little 1/2 meter
which<00:02:03.550> is<00:02:03.730> quite<00:02:04.270> impressive<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.900> think

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
which is quite impressive and I think

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.450 
which is quite impressive and I think
the<00:02:05.290> him<00:02:05.440> being<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.890> young<00:02:06.040> lad<00:02:06.250> their

the him being a young lad their
attention<00:02:06.910> span<00:02:07.120> is<00:02:07.240> very<00:02:07.270> short<00:02:07.480> it<00:02:08.379> just

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
attention span is very short it just

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.199 
attention span is very short it just

well Nick not only that we have a ripper

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.850 
well Nick not only that we have a ripper
board<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.300> actually<00:03:03.600> also<00:03:03.840> have<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.200> ripper

Rick<00:03:05.340> what<00:03:06.060> are<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.270> main<00:03:06.650> positive<00:03:07.650> aspects

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
Rick what are the main positive aspects

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.070 
Rick what are the main positive aspects
of<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.700> well<00:03:09.240> first<00:03:09.390> we<00:03:09.660> actually<00:03:09.900> do<00:03:09.990> it

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
of this and well first we actually do it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.199 
of this and well first we actually do it
in<00:03:10.140> three<00:03:10.380> sizes<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:11.010> got<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.370> 1<00:03:11.550> 5<00:03:11.820> a

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
in three sizes we got in a 1 5 a

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.600 
in three sizes we got in a 1 5 a
two-five<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:13.140> three-five<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:14.130> comes<00:03:14.400> as<00:03:14.580> a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
two-five and a three-five it comes as a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.520 
two-five and a three-five it comes as a
package<00:03:14.820> all<00:03:15.270> in<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> zip<00:03:15.690> up<00:03:15.870> bag<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.410> get

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
package all in a zip up bag so you get

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.979 
package all in a zip up bag so you get
the<00:03:16.650> sow<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.400> master<00:03:17.940> boom<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.690> master

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
the sow the master boom and the master

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.040 
the sow the master boom and the master
extension<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:20.370> very<00:03:20.850> very<00:03:21.180> light<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.690> mean

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
extension it's very very light I mean

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.350 
extension it's very very light I mean
it's<00:03:22.200> incredibly<00:03:22.680> light<00:03:22.770> largely<00:03:23.700> mono<00:03:24.030> film

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
it's incredibly light largely mono film

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.750 
it's incredibly light largely mono film
so<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.260> doesn't<00:03:25.739> absorb<00:03:25.830> any<00:03:26.190> water<00:03:26.280> once

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
so it doesn't absorb any water once

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.000 
so it doesn't absorb any water once
you've<00:03:26.910> been<00:03:27.030> sailing<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> main

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
you've been sailing with it but the main

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.770 
you've been sailing with it but the main
feature<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.520> what<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> think<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.330> good<00:03:30.570> it's

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
feature is what I think is so good it's

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.600 
feature is what I think is so good it's
got<00:03:30.870> quite<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.170> short<00:03:31.380> mask<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> very<00:03:32.280> long

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
got quite a short mask but a very long

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.060 
got quite a short mask but a very long
boom<00:03:32.880> for<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.239> size<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> South<00:03:33.989> when<00:03:34.950> the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
boom for the size of the South when the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.350 
boom for the size of the South when the
sails<00:03:35.280> are<00:03:35.400> only<00:03:35.580> one<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.880> half<00:03:36.030> meters

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
sails are only one and a half meters

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.060 
sails are only one and a half meters
they<00:03:36.450> obviously<00:03:36.840> very<00:03:37.110> very<00:03:37.320> small<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:37.830> for<00:03:38.040> a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
they obviously very very small so for a

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.920 
they obviously very very small so for a
little<00:03:38.310> kids<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.730> steer<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.180> board<00:03:39.360> lean<00:03:39.780> the
