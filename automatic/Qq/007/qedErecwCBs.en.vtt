00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.940 
couple of ways to doing this and one
would<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.000> glue<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> entire<00:01:45.360> photo<00:01:46.020> onto

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
would be to glue the entire photo onto

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.340 
would be to glue the entire photo onto
the<00:01:47.070> cube<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:48.060> carefully<00:01:48.479> trim<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> with

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the cube and then carefully trim it with

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.319 
the cube and then carefully trim it with
a<00:01:49.409> razor<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.640> careful<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.180> cut

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
a razor but be careful not to cut

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850 
a razor but be careful not to cut
through<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> packing<00:01:52.049> tape<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.590> placed

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
through the packing tape that you placed

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
through the packing tape that you placed
earlier<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.119> other<00:01:54.149> way<00:01:54.450> would<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.659> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
earlier and the other way would be to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.870 
earlier and the other way would be to
cut<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> photo<00:01:55.350> into<00:01:55.590> four<00:01:55.950> squares<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.759> then

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
cut the photo into four squares and then

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.179 
cut the photo into four squares and then
glue<00:01:57.119> each<00:01:57.329> square<00:01:57.899> once<00:01:58.590> you've<00:01:58.770> glued<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
glue each square once you've glued the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.910 
glue each square once you've glued the
six<00:01:59.430> photos<00:01:59.700> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.390> one<00:02:00.630> side<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.500> magic

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
six photos on the one side of your magic

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
six photos on the one side of your magic
photo<00:02:02.130> cube<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:03.180> open<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.570> photo<00:02:03.810> cube<00:02:04.049> up

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
photo cube you open the photo cube up

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.980 
photo cube you open the photo cube up
and<00:02:04.619> glue<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> other<00:02:05.250> six<00:02:05.790> photos<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and glue the other six photos on the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.680 
and glue the other six photos on the
other<00:02:07.170> six<00:02:07.619> sides<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.789> your<00:02:09.090> magic<00:02:09.420> photo

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
other six sides now your magic photo

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.600 
other six sides now your magic photo
cube<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.289> complete<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.370> it's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
cube is complete when it's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.240 
cube is complete when it's
opened<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.510> will<00:02:12.930> reveal<00:02:13.290> six<00:02:13.800> different

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
opened up it will reveal six different

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.640 
opened up it will reveal six different
photos<00:02:14.910> after<00:02:15.600> building<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.290> noticed

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
photos after building this I noticed

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.770 
photos after building this I noticed
it's<00:02:16.830> very<00:02:17.100> important<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.910> those<00:02:18.030> blocks<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
it's very important for those blocks to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.770 
it's very important for those blocks to
be<00:02:18.900> perfectly<00:02:19.530> square<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.490> fit<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:21.030> mine

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
be perfectly square to fit right mine

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.600 
be perfectly square to fit right mine
were<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> little<00:02:22.200> bit<00:02:22.410> off<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.920> tried<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.220> sand

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
were a little bit off so I tried to sand

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
were a little bit off so I tried to sand
them<00:02:23.700> as<00:02:23.850> best<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.150> could

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
them as best I could

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.120 
them as best I could
so<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.140> were<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.590> again<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> would

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
so if I were to do this again I would

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.560 
so if I were to do this again I would
make<00:02:26.280> sure<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> blocks<00:02:26.820> were<00:02:27.030> perfectly

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
make sure the blocks were perfectly

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.720 
make sure the blocks were perfectly
square<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.800> photos<00:02:29.190> would<00:02:29.520> be

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
square and then the photos would be

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.970 
square and then the photos would be
pretty<00:02:30.060> seamless<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.230> that's<00:02:31.410> how<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.560> make<00:02:31.800> a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
pretty seamless so that's how to make a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.700 
pretty seamless so that's how to make a
magic<00:02:32.310> photo<00:02:32.880> cube<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.870> under<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> couple<00:02:34.620> of

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
magic photo cube for under a couple of

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.380 
magic photo cube for under a couple of
bucks<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.160> we'll<00:02:35.580> see<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.790> next<00:02:36.000> time<00:02:36.120> with

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
bucks and we'll see you next time with

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.900 
bucks and we'll see you next time with
another<00:02:36.420> weekend<00:02:37.230> project
