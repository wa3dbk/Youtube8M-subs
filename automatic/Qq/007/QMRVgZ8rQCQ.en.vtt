00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
see with the tork app I'm using the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.699 
see with the tork app I'm using the
design<00:03:59.120> they<00:03:59.269> have<00:03:59.299> here<00:03:59.780> and<00:03:59.959> then<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.620> my

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
design they have here and then on my

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.979 
design they have here and then on my
home<00:04:00.889> screen<00:04:00.919> I<00:04:01.700> think<00:04:02.419> that<00:04:02.630> those<00:04:02.780> aren't

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
home screen I think that those aren't

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.960 
home screen I think that those aren't
widgets<00:04:03.349> those<00:04:03.500> are<00:04:03.620> shortcuts<00:04:04.099> and<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.639> was

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
widgets those are shortcuts and I was

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.430 
widgets those are shortcuts and I was
able<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.239> use<00:04:05.450> nova<00:04:05.810> launcher<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.230> pick

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
able to use nova launcher to pick

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.039 
able to use nova launcher to pick
different<00:04:07.010> skins<00:04:07.310> for<00:04:07.549> those<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.060> that's<00:04:08.840> all

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
different skins for those so that's all

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.059 
different skins for those so that's all
that<00:04:09.200> works<00:04:09.410> no<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.680> other<00:04:09.799> thing<00:04:09.950> that's

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
that works no the other thing that's

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.879 
that works no the other thing that's
cool<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.519> that<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:11.630> does<00:04:11.989> allow<00:04:12.169> Tasker

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
cool is that it does allow Tasker

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.789 
cool is that it does allow Tasker
