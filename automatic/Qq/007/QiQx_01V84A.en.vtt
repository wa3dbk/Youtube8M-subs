00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.970
 I have nothing to do 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.970

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.820
 Today is the motor journalist Takeoka Akira 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.890
 Today I was brushed up more than now 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:34.960
 I would like to introduce Audi a iphone 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:40.480
 It is the top in the line-up of Audi a most part and Audi . 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.110
 As it is a flagship model, it is said that it has already reached the realm of art 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 Because 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.829
 There is a commitment to the design 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.829
 [musics] 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.829
 Hmm 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.920
 Yup 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.470
 Cormorant uhh uhh uhh 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.730

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.120

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.390
 Boo Woo book 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:23.160

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.160
 Cormorants Honn 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.690
 Touuma 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:37.870
 As there is the most unusual front, I would like to introduce you there 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:40.380
 First of all, such a line in Japan enters the bonnet and the sportiness increases. 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:46.700
 Seed and new group 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.700
 The grille and the bumper are also changing the hair design 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:56.210
 Whatever you say, the first Kawada is this headlight 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:02.229
 First of all, the design of the headlights has changed 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:06.870
 And then there's a blinker here, but as these flow outside 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:13.920
 What is adopted in Audi r 1 throws 5 cases 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:16.640
 Being aware of this movement will increase awareness for about a second when viewed from outside 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.090
 This is pretty amazing, isn't it? 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:28.440
 And amazing though we say wow wow from the headlight destination of the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:34.500
 I would like to introduce a little bit here . 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:40.750
 The matrix led headlights, but if it isn't night, it's pretty ugly 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:44.800
 I do not understand, so I would like to explain today at this special venue 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.040
 There are 6 types of bed lights there 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.550
 It is the condition of the future that this is shining 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.640
 This penlight large I have 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.630
 Please think that it is the headlight of the oncoming car 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.740
 We will continue to float from those in living you'll Ah In 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.740
 The presenter is connecting 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.740
 Hmm 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.670
 Hmm 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:11.430
 How say 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:18.780
 Would we can see that has changed led headlight 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:21.959
 I think only where I am, it will be dark and the rest will remain bright 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.590
 Why I can do this? 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:35.910
 And what are we used the leb 25 minutes because the small size 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:38.770
 It is about one billion 966 10 million man 5422 street 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.340
 The headlights with the pattern of 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.310
 I wonder if this is because I can do 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.640
 It's my sister's secret early 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.790
 [musics] 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.219
 Disagreeable 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:56.390
 Human beings are acting on a daily basis using a lot of information coming in from the eyes 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:59.989
 Information coming in from the eyes, especially while driving a car 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:05.450
 This is a huge part of it 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.780
 So pretty but true that I'm the high-beam headlights are said to basic 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.450
 Well town 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.360
 Since the mid-In becomes a nuisance of car running before that kind of opportunity it is also not by I oncoming vehicle 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:20.310
 I think you usually use low beam 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:25.560
 It is even running a highway Okunaka's quickly talk 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.160
 I want to discover the many things or was a line player to was the oncoming vehicle or was something obstacle 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.680
 It was Yayoi 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.800
 If there is something that says this is not dazzling 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.129
 There is no time lag instead of listening 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.900
 [musics] 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:42.979
 You can play a 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:45.590
 Such latest safety equipment that I think to improve too much safety flagship model 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:50.770
 It is corresponded and is gradually 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.770
 I would like to expect that the second half of the cylindrical tube is over 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:05:02.119
