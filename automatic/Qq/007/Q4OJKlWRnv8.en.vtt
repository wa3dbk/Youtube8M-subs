this is difficult I honestly thought
it'll<00:01:15.619> be<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.740> little<00:01:15.860> harder<00:01:16.220> because<00:01:16.280> I've

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
it'll be a little harder because I've

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.770 
it'll be a little harder because I've
struggled<00:01:16.939> a<00:01:17.090> lot<00:01:17.210> more<00:01:17.390> from<00:01:17.539> the<00:01:17.689> other

struggled a lot more from the other

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.090 
struggled a lot more from the other

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
levels despite the failures you will see

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.990
