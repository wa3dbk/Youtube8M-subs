00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.080
 today we disassemble and throw out 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.129
 sweets we got here 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.749
 a huge bag of candy after depth and 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.059
 so we decided to throw it away 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.360
 that we especially do not like because so much 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.090
 sugar, well, absolutely not useful to anyone 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.700
 so here is our big bowl that we 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.460
 We leave it that we have and that we assort 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.840
 that we have definitely thrown out 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.020
 as you see we have half here 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.140
 buckets plucked candy and we'll be still 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.030
 let's not throw me out 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.770
 to condemn that I throw out good because 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.100
 that it is not quite good so much candy 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.660
 nobody needs to get my first 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.880
 by chance because we went to different 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.430
 events and there chocolates gave out 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.500
 it's just as if a part of the tradition we 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.010
 does not mean it is necessary to eat everything and recruit 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.840
 a huge huge amount 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.090
 kilograms and also probably diabetes 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.980
 my kids watch and talk all the time 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.640
 here I still want some candy still want 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.579
 sweetmeat 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.009
 so why eat so many sweets so 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.790
 I asked the guys to choose under 20 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.380
 sweets stuff they liked 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.360
 this is what i will choose which is really better 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:17.330
 there is a small chocolate snickers there but 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.060
 good candy which is everything else 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.790
 is trash and I am today if it children 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.150
 threw in order that they no longer have 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.190
 there was a stimulus 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.729
 beg for candy they will know what 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.380
 I just do not have them here we candy 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.170
 comes across all that air about yourself 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.570
 please soap bubbles 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.990
 here's your ring aug one more 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.659
 shelves 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.970
 I threw out many things some 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.700
 cards or there is some kind of game but I don't 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.570
 I understand half already pulled the line and the whole 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.570
 It became this one here 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:01.950
 This is our flashlight, but we also do not 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.810
 works too see most of it 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.840
 garbage that you just have to take out 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.270
 from home holidays on the nose it is necessary to 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 the house was clean, the whole bag went over 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.320
 everyone scored almost a whole bucket of candy 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.900

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.880

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.970
 such sweets scored that I leave in 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.360
 they are mostly chocolate here 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.280
 we got a bowl for ourselves 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:39.270

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.360
 But from such a faceted bear 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.080
