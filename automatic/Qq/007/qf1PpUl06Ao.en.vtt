00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
really yeah that's awesome that's pretty

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.770 
really yeah that's awesome that's pretty
cool<00:02:08.899> all<00:02:09.080> right<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:10.369> is<00:02:10.550> green<00:02:10.849> right<00:02:11.510> I

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
cool all right so this is green right I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.780 
cool all right so this is green right I
guess<00:02:12.319> that's<00:02:12.530> what<00:02:12.650> they<00:02:12.680> mean<00:02:12.770> by<00:02:12.950> colors<00:02:13.520> of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
guess that's what they mean by colors of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.820 
guess that's what they mean by colors of
the<00:02:13.880> season<00:02:14.030> not<00:02:14.330> actually<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.349> Christmas

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
the season not actually the Christmas

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.880 
the season not actually the Christmas
season<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:16.459> just<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> colors<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.890> which

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
season but just the colors of it which

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.690 
season but just the colors of it which
those<00:02:19.100> go<00:02:19.600> green<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.890> guess<00:02:22.069> this<00:02:22.220> was<00:02:22.430> red

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
those go green and I guess this was red

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.410
