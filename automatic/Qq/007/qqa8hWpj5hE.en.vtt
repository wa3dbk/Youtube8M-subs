but they reach up to 35 feet and here's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.219 
but they reach up to 35 feet and here's
the<00:01:06.420> firing<00:01:06.810> mechanism<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:12.229> since

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the firing mechanism here it is since

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.950 
the firing mechanism here it is since
you<00:01:13.380> load<00:01:13.619> three<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.939> beginning<00:01:15.390> what

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you load three in the beginning what

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.080 
you load three in the beginning what
happens<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.159> more<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.790> hold<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
happens is the more you hold down the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.450 
happens is the more you hold down the
I'm<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.360> gonna<00:01:21.540> say<00:01:21.750> trigger<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.890> thing

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
I'm not gonna say trigger but the thing

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
I'm not gonna say trigger but the thing
that<00:01:23.490> fires<00:01:23.880> them<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:25.080> more<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.500> shoots

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that fires them the more that shoots

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
that fires them the more that shoots
