00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
have five losses that shows you how

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.979 
have five losses that shows you how
close<00:00:53.250> they've<00:00:53.579> played<00:00:53.910> teams<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.360> year<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
close they've played teams this year and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
close they've played teams this year and
how<00:00:55.230> much<00:00:55.620> bad<00:00:55.920> look<00:00:56.219> they've<00:00:56.430> had<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.000> they

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
how much bad look they've had but they

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
how much bad look they've had but they
proved<00:00:57.780> themselves<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> Big<00:00:58.620> Ten<00:00:58.649> title

proved themselves in the Big Ten title

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.709 
proved themselves in the Big Ten title
game<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> think<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.730> are<00:00:59.820> top<00:01:00.000> 25<00:01:00.449> team

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
game I think there are top 25 team

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.970 
game I think there are top 25 team
definitely<00:01:01.079> think<00:01:01.199> they're<00:01:01.289> even<00:01:01.800> higher

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
definitely think they're even higher

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
definitely think they're even higher
than<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.609> mean<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.390> should<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.690> ranked

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
than that I mean they should be ranked

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
than that I mean they should be ranked
and<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.710> them<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.159> ranked<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.610> shows

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and for them not to be ranked this shows

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.609 
and for them not to be ranked this shows
you<00:01:06.000> how<00:01:06.150> people<00:01:06.479> look<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.780> losses<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.439> don't

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.899 
you how people look at losses and don't
even<00:01:07.799> pay<00:01:07.979> too<00:01:08.040> much<00:01:08.220> attention<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.760> them

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.170 
of this game is the quarterback play and
I<00:03:02.100> guess<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.459> say<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.700> deep<00:03:02.850> into<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
I guess you can say the deep into the

right now I think like I said both
defense<00:03:31.769> are<00:03:31.890> still<00:03:32.130> good<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.730> think

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.509 
defense are still good and I think
Stepfan<00:03:34.560> Taylor<00:03:34.590> doesn't<00:03:35.070> win<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.280> game

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
Stepfan Taylor doesn't win this game

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.210 
Stepfan Taylor doesn't win this game
alone<00:03:35.910> with<00:03:36.269> Stanford<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.769> comes<00:03:38.010> down<00:03:38.070> to

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
alone with Stanford but it comes down to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.039 
alone with Stanford but it comes down to
quarterback<00:03:38.549> play<00:03:38.730> which<00:03:39.450> quarterback<00:03:39.750> can

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
quarterback play which quarterback can

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.580 
quarterback play which quarterback can
make<00:03:40.200> plays<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.060> keep<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.150> defense<00:03:42.570> back<00:03:42.870> not

the football I can throw it does it make

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.940 
the football I can throw it does it make
mistakes<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.200> think<00:04:04.380> he's<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.530> better<00:04:04.650> cord

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
mistakes and I think he's a better cord

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.370 
mistakes and I think he's a better cord
i<00:04:05.040> had<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.370> two<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.959> they<00:04:06.959> had<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.260> better

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
i had of the two and they had the better

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.289 
i had of the two and they had the better
look<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.739> front<00:04:07.980> seven<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.609> i<00:04:08.850> think<00:04:08.970> edge

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
look the front seven so i think edge

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.240 
look the front seven so i think edge
goes<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.660> Stanford<00:04:09.920> Wisconsin<00:04:10.920> could<00:04:11.100> come

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
goes to Stanford Wisconsin could come

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.670 
goes to Stanford Wisconsin could come
out<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.430> surprise<00:04:11.760> me<00:04:12.260> depends<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.290> how<00:04:13.410> Curt

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
out and surprise me depends on how Curt

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.400 
out and surprise me depends on how Curt
Phillips<00:04:13.829> plays<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:14.609> how<00:04:15.570> indications<00:04:16.200> going

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
Phillips plays but how indications going

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.590 
Phillips plays but how indications going
to<00:04:16.500> Stanford<00:04:16.979> I<00:04:17.190> think<00:04:17.940> overall<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.570> a

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
to Stanford I think overall have a

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.420 
to Stanford I think overall have a
little<00:04:18.870> bit<00:04:19.019> better<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.380> an<00:04:19.650> edge<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.950> defense

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
little bit better of an edge on defense

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.880 
little bit better of an edge on defense
and<00:04:20.669> better<00:04:20.850> at<00:04:21.060> your<00:04:21.180> deposition<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.140> think

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
and better at your deposition I think

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.520 
and better at your deposition I think
the<00:04:23.039> running<00:04:23.280> back<00:04:23.370> position<00:04:23.400> does<00:04:24.090> go<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.810> in

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
the running back position does go to in

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.680 
the running back position does go to in
favor<00:04:26.099> of<00:04:26.250> Wisconsin<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.240> think<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.539> comes

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
favor of Wisconsin but I think it comes

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.990 
favor of Wisconsin but I think it comes
down<00:04:27.780> to

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
down to

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.600 
down to
we're<00:04:28.120> back<00:04:28.240> play<00:04:28.510> in<00:04:29.260> front<00:04:29.470> seven<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.190> I

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
we're back play in front seven and I

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.730 
we're back play in front seven and I
give<00:04:30.790> Stanford<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.330> wind<00:04:31.510> 27<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.200> 17<00:04:32.470> over

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
give Stanford the wind 27 to 17 over

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.860 
give Stanford the wind 27 to 17 over
