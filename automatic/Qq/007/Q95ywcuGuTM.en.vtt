hey everybody we wanted to show you kind
of<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.500> fun<00:00:07.740> trick<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.340> can<00:00:08.490> do<00:00:08.670> with

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
of a fun trick that you can do with

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.540 
of a fun trick that you can do with
Google<00:00:08.940> book<00:00:09.389> search<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.960> barcode<00:00:10.380> scanner

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
Google book search and a barcode scanner

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.760 
Google book search and a barcode scanner
now<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.730> theory<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.629> could<00:00:12.809> use<00:00:13.020> the<00:00:13.320> camera

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
now in theory you could use the camera

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.920 
now in theory you could use the camera
that's<00:00:13.920> built<00:00:14.010> into<00:00:14.370> your<00:00:14.670> Android<00:00:14.940> g1<00:00:15.570> if<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
that's built into your Android g1 if you

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.240 
that's built into your Android g1 if you
wanted<00:00:16.200> to<00:00:16.379> because<00:00:16.680> there's<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.890> really<00:00:17.130> nice

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
wanted to because there's a really nice

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
wanted to because there's a really nice
barcode<00:00:17.789> functionality<00:00:18.480> built<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.900> there's<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
barcode functionality built in there's a

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.500 
barcode functionality built in there's a
library<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.860> can<00:00:19.980> use<00:00:20.120> so<00:00:21.120> someone<00:00:21.360> could

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
library you can use so someone could

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.260 
library you can use so someone could
write<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.720> 20%<00:00:22.350> project<00:00:22.440> to<00:00:22.770> do<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.040> but<00:00:23.580> today

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
write a 20% project to do this but today

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.120 
write a 20% project to do this but today
what<00:00:24.630> we're<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.020> use<00:00:25.110> is<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.950> actual

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
what we're going to use is an actual

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.130 
what we're going to use is an actual
barcode<00:00:26.850> scanner<00:00:27.150> now<00:00:27.420> these<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.870> that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
barcode scanner now these are not that

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.290 
barcode scanner now these are not that
expensive<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.860> got<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.790> a<00:00:29.850> little<00:00:30.210> under

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.969 
do is take our barcode scanner put it
right<00:01:45.299> up<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:47.090> scan<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.799> hear

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
right up to it and scan and you can hear

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.700 
right up to it and scan and you can hear
the<00:01:50.100> click<00:01:50.219> and<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:51.060> got<00:01:51.210> an<00:01:51.329> ISBN<00:01:51.869> number<00:01:52.109> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the click and we got an ISBN number so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.310 
the click and we got an ISBN number so
now<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.130> click<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.579> import<00:01:53.789> button<00:01:54.320> we'll

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
now if you click the import button we'll

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.620 
now if you click the import button we'll
see<00:01:55.530> whether<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> found<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> correctly<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
see whether it found it correctly and it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899 
see whether it found it correctly and it
did<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.320> turns<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.979> google<00:01:59.369> apps<00:01:59.549> hacks

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
did it turns out that google apps hacks

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
did it turns out that google apps hacks
might<00:02:00.749> have<00:02:00.929> been<00:02:01.079> called<00:02:01.289> Google<00:02:01.590> office

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
might have been called Google office

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.209 
might have been called Google office
hacks<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.520> an<00:02:02.640> earlier<00:02:02.999> life<00:02:03.289> so<00:02:04.289> now<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.799> you

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
hacks in an earlier life so now if you

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859 
hacks in an earlier life so now if you
want<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.490> import<00:02:05.909> more<00:02:06.210> than<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.539> book<00:02:06.689> at

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
want to import more than one book at

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.570 
want to import more than one book at
once<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:07.619> easier<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.399> click

this<00:02:11.520> barcode<00:02:11.940> scanner<00:02:12.210> looks<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.750> like

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
this barcode scanner looks just like

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.080 
this barcode scanner looks just like
you're<00:02:13.260> typing<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.769> keyboard<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:14.879> just

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
you're typing on the keyboard so I just

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.190 
you're typing on the keyboard so I just
scan<00:02:15.269> something<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.050> hit<00:02:16.200> return

you remembered oh one of my code books
one<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.080> my<00:02:56.140> programming<00:02:56.560> books<00:02:56.860> had

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
one of my programming books had

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.410 
one of my programming books had
something<00:02:57.370> about<00:02:57.549> quicksort<00:02:57.940> but<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.239> don't
