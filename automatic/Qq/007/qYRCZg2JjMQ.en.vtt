scrape this off you can scrape each one
individually<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.710> try<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> keep<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.610> much

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

clean<00:00:54.090> color<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.329> what<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.480> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
clean color as you can and what I do is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.450 
clean color as you can and what I do is
I<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> stay<00:00:58.770> wet<00:00:59.010> palette

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
I have a stay wet palette

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.240 
I have a stay wet palette
this<00:00:59.850> one's<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.480> dirty<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.199> now

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
this one's really dirty right now

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
this one's really dirty right now
because<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.430> when<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> mixed<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.719> color

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
because I when I mixed up my color

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
because I when I mixed up my color
charts<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.439> had<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> ton<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.010> paint<00:01:05.369> left<00:01:05.729> over

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and eventually I just mixed all that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.440 
and eventually I just mixed all that
paint<00:01:09.630> together<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:11.580> put<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.240> bottle

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
