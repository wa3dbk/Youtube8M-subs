um this is a great system you know for

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.080 
um this is a great system you know for
being<00:00:54.289> mobile<00:00:54.739> which<00:00:54.920> actually<00:00:55.250> use<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:55.789> as

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
being mobile which actually use this as

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.419 
being mobile which actually use this as
a<00:00:56.199> stationary<00:00:57.199> system<00:00:57.350> too<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:57.949> then<00:00:58.219> I<00:00:58.250> have

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
a stationary system too and then I have

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.560 
a stationary system too and then I have
one<00:00:58.579> more<00:00:58.609> system<00:00:58.910> which<00:00:59.149> is<00:00:59.269> an<00:00:59.359> old<00:00:59.480> compaq

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
one more system which is an old compaq

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.600 
one more system which is an old compaq
serial<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.809> two<00:01:03.350> thousand<00:01:03.829> so<00:01:04.010> that<00:01:04.250> thing<00:01:04.460> I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
serial the two thousand so that thing I

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.000 
serial the two thousand so that thing I
use<00:01:04.760> more<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.300> kick<00:01:05.480> around<00:01:05.630> with<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.230> call<00:01:06.860> my

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
use more to kick around with I call my

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.980 
use more to kick around with I call my
kicker<00:01:07.220> on<00:01:07.340> compaq<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.120> that<00:01:08.600> thing<00:01:08.840> just

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
kicker on compaq so that thing just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.590 
kicker on compaq so that thing just
never<00:01:09.290> dies<00:01:09.500> it's<00:01:09.890> over<00:01:10.100> eight<00:01:10.190> years<00:01:10.340> old<00:01:10.610> so

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
never dies it's over eight years old so

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.660 
never dies it's over eight years old so
I<00:01:11.630> figured<00:01:12.170> I'd<00:01:12.230> pick<00:01:12.650> me<00:01:12.830> up<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:13.010> little<00:01:13.160> laptop

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
I figured I'd pick me up a little laptop

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.910 
I figured I'd pick me up a little laptop
you<00:01:13.910> know<00:01:14.030> I<00:01:14.060> take<00:01:14.510> what<00:01:15.170> we've<00:01:15.320> just<00:01:15.350> encased

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
you know I take what we've just encased

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.160 
you know I take what we've just encased
because<00:01:16.400> I<00:01:16.520> think<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.880> know<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.240> laptop<00:01:17.750> no

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
because I think you know the laptop no

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.620 
because I think you know the laptop no
telling<00:01:18.470> how<00:01:18.560> long<00:01:18.590> it's<00:01:18.830> going<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.010> last<00:01:19.070> but

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
telling how long it's going to last but

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.990 
telling how long it's going to last but
so<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.660> picked<00:01:21.080> this<00:01:21.200> up<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:21.710> then<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:22.400> know<00:01:22.760> I

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
so I picked this up and then you know I

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.900 
so I picked this up and then you know I
wanted<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.390> go<00:01:23.480> over<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:24.430> pussification<00:01:25.430> to

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
wanted to go over the pussification to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.140 
wanted to go over the pussification to
your<00:01:26.060> got<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> nice<00:01:26.420> hard<00:01:26.720> drive<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:29.060> know

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
anything that could compare to the

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.240 
anything that could compare to the
internal<00:06:27.920> components<00:06:28.570> so<00:06:29.570> in<00:06:30.050> really<00:06:31.010> as<00:06:31.100> much

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
internal components so in really as much

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.100 
internal components so in really as much
as<00:06:31.370> i<00:06:31.460> use<00:06:31.640> it<00:06:31.790> i<00:06:31.820> still<00:06:32.030> use<00:06:32.090> more<00:06:32.330> compact<00:06:32.780> and

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
as i use it i still use more compact and

my desktop that when you know or two or

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.630 
my desktop that when you know or two or
three<00:06:36.290> hours<00:06:36.320> as<00:06:36.650> i<00:06:36.740> spent<00:06:36.950> about<00:06:36.980> 10<00:06:37.340> to<00:06:37.430> 12

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
three hours as i spent about 10 to 12

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.850 
three hours as i spent about 10 to 12
hours<00:06:37.760> a<00:06:37.970> day<00:06:38.000> in<00:06:38.120> from<00:06:38.330> the<00:06:38.420> computer<00:06:38.860> it

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
hours a day in from the computer it

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.310 
hours a day in from the computer it
would<00:06:40.130> definitely<00:06:40.280> be<00:06:40.640> tiresome<00:06:41.240> but<00:06:41.480> you

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
would definitely be tiresome but you

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.070 
would definitely be tiresome but you
I<00:06:42.380> think<00:06:43.070> it's<00:06:43.190> doable<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:44.120> I<00:06:44.540> was<00:06:44.690> willing<00:06:44.870> to

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
I think it's doable and I was willing to

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.440

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
part in that part with it so I sat down

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.810 
part in that part with it so I sat down
really<00:06:48.110> thought<00:06:48.320> about<00:06:48.350> it<00:06:48.620> and<00:06:48.950> I<00:06:49.190> just

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
really thought about it and I just

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.230
