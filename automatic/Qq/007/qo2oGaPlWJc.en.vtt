really never considered because I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.630 
really never considered because I
thought<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.390> were<00:00:42.480> all<00:00:42.629> plastic<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.640> upon

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
thought they were all plastic but upon

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.090 
thought they were all plastic but upon
purchasing<00:00:45.329> them<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.590> looking<00:00:47.010> into

purchasing them and kind of looking into

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.500

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
them a little bit further

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.020 
them a little bit further
they're<00:00:49.079> definitely<00:00:49.469> far<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.670> being<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
they're definitely far from this being a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.680 
they're definitely far from this being a
plastic<00:00:51.390> cheap<00:00:52.050> wheel<00:00:52.879> now<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:54.210> bead<00:00:54.449> locks

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
are a kind of through design so they

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
are a kind of through design so they
don't<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> traditional<00:01:00.180> bead<00:01:00.420> lock<00:01:00.660> on

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.760 
another really cool feature is on this
sleeve<00:02:11.700> portion<00:02:12.120> here<00:02:12.390> where<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> mounts

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
sleeve portion here where it mounts

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.360 
sleeve portion here where it mounts
the<00:02:14.040> front<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.750> B<00:02:15.960> block<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.920> will<00:02:17.070> notice

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
the front of the B block you will notice

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.780 
the front of the B block you will notice
these<00:02:17.520> kind<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.290> little<00:02:19.290> spikes<00:02:20.070> right<00:02:20.430> here

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
these kind of little spikes right here

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.880 
these kind of little spikes right here
kind<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.330> all<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:21.720> through<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.680> that's

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
kind of all going through what that's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.800 
kind of all going through what that's
meant<00:02:23.100> for<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.490> when<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> rubber<00:02:24.210> kind<00:02:24.720> of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
meant for is when the rubber kind of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.350 
meant for is when the rubber kind of
goes<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.710> there<00:02:25.890> those<00:02:26.100> spikes<00:02:26.580> grab<00:02:26.970> onto<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
goes in there those spikes grab onto the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.040 
goes in there those spikes grab onto the
rubber<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:29.090> basically<00:02:30.090> making<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.540> not<00:02:30.780> move

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
rubber and basically making it not move

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.040 
rubber and basically making it not move
ever<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.340> those<00:02:32.970> little<00:02:33.090> spikes<00:02:33.480> really<00:02:33.870> grab

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
ever so those little spikes really grab

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.500 
ever so those little spikes really grab
on<00:02:34.230> onto<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> leather<00:02:35.190> onto<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.790> rubber<00:02:36.210> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
on onto the leather onto the rubber and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.690 
on onto the leather onto the rubber and
then<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.200> bead<00:02:37.500> lock<00:02:37.770> kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.100> goes<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.520> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
then this bead lock kind of goes in and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.050 
then this bead lock kind of goes in and
kind<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:38.970> conforms<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.810> rubber<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.580> bead

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
kind of conforms the rubber to that bead

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.010 
kind of conforms the rubber to that bead
lock<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.690> other<00:02:43.440> cool<00:02:43.740> feature<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.520> wheel

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
lock so other cool feature on this wheel

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.330 
lock so other cool feature on this wheel
it's<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> sleeve<00:02:46.620> here<00:02:46.860> you'll<00:02:47.040> notice

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340

have had the axial roxtor B locks

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.320 
have had the axial roxtor B locks
they're<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.480> 2.2<00:03:19.050> s<00:03:19.260> meant<00:03:19.590> for<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.330> axial

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
they're the 2.2 s meant for the axial

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.020 
they're the 2.2 s meant for the axial
Wraiths<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:22.460> kind<00:03:23.460> of<00:03:23.490> what<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.670> found<00:03:23.880> out

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
Wraiths and kind of what I found out

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.360 
Wraiths and kind of what I found out
with<00:03:24.150> those<00:03:24.390> they<00:03:25.020> use<00:03:25.200> very<00:03:25.530> thin<00:03:25.650> screws

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
with those they use very thin screws

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.310 
with those they use very thin screws
where<00:03:27.210> they're<00:03:27.390> using<00:03:27.810> very<00:03:27.960> nice<00:03:28.670> kind<00:03:29.670> of

and they are using twelve holes versus

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.980 
and they are using twelve holes versus
the<00:03:43.320> axial<00:03:44.070> just<00:03:44.730> use<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.180> six<00:03:45.510> holes

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
the axial just use the six holes

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.670 
the axial just use the six holes
now<00:03:46.530> these<00:03:46.710> re<00:03:47.040> completely<00:03:48.680> countersunk

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
now these re completely countersunk

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.160 
now these re completely countersunk
screws<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.490> that<00:03:50.670> there's<00:03:50.850> no<00:03:51.120> nothing<00:03:51.720> kind

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
screws so that there's no nothing kind

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.860 
screws so that there's no nothing kind
of<00:03:52.430> protruding<00:03:53.430> like<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.730> axial<00:03:54.360> ones<00:03:54.540> so

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
of protruding like the axial ones so

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.290 
of protruding like the axial ones so
very<00:03:55.560> nice<00:03:55.860> wheel<00:03:56.250> now<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.880> other<00:03:57.090> thing<00:03:57.270> that

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
very nice wheel now the other thing that

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.240 
very nice wheel now the other thing that
I<00:03:57.480> found<00:03:57.690> with<00:03:57.930> these<00:03:58.050> wheels<00:03:58.350> is<00:03:58.680> they're

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
I found with these wheels is they're

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.390 
I found with these wheels is they're
very<00:03:59.760> very<00:04:00.540> easy<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.170> mount<00:04:01.320> probably<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
very very easy to mount probably the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.540 
very very easy to mount probably the
easiest<00:04:02.880> bead<00:04:03.210> lock<00:04:03.480> I've<00:04:03.720> ever<00:04:04.100> locked<00:04:05.100> on<00:04:05.340> to

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
easiest bead lock I've ever locked on to

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.900 
easiest bead lock I've ever locked on to
a<00:04:05.580> tire<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.560> very<00:04:07.560> nice<00:04:07.800> very<00:04:08.220> happy<00:04:08.730> with

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
a tire so very nice very happy with

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.770 
a tire so very nice very happy with
these<00:04:09.090> wheels<00:04:09.330> so<00:04:09.630> far<00:04:09.930> they<00:04:10.530> seem<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:11.040> be<00:04:11.780> very

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780
