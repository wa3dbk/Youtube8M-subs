00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to ask what's the budget and because

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
to ask what's the budget and because
just<00:00:47.700> thinking<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.030> take<00:00:48.210> them<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> top<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
just thinking we take them to the top so

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
just thinking we take them to the top so
what<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> tend<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.719> all<00:00:51.809> think

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
what I tend to do is first of all think

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.720 
what I tend to do is first of all think
that<00:00:52.140> were<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> portions<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> key<00:00:53.520> car

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that were the portions for the key car

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.080 
that were the portions for the key car
so<00:00:54.300> see<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> four<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.140> portion<00:00:55.500> cake<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.850> then

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so see a four to portion cake and then

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.599 
so see a four to portion cake and then
you've<00:00:57.840> got<00:00:57.989> three<00:00:58.199> options<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:58.890> head<00:00:59.100> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
you've got three options in my head you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.080 
you've got three options in my head you
could<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> flat<00:01:00.750> version<00:01:01.680> 2d<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.850> front

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
could do a flat version 2d of the front

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.539 
could do a flat version 2d of the front
of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> house<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> flat<00:01:04.710> cake<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
of the house so just a flat cake the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280 
of the house so just a flat cake the
windows<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> doors<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> roof<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
windows and the doors and the roof and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.070 
windows and the doors and the roof and
so<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> very<00:01:08.580> flat<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> third

so just a very flat that then the third

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
so just a very flat that then the third
option<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:10.860> call<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> standard

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430

one<00:02:13.390> or<00:02:13.599> all<00:02:14.319> three<00:02:14.379> sound<00:02:14.950> good<00:02:15.160> but<00:02:15.430> probably

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
one or all three sound good but probably

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.550 
one or all three sound good but probably
the<00:02:16.269> middle<00:02:16.569> range<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.959> going<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.379> that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the middle range is going to be in that

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.140 
the middle range is going to be in that
probably<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.519> most<00:02:18.580> people<00:02:18.849> tend

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
probably the one that most people tend

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.089 
probably the one that most people tend
to<00:02:19.300> go<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:19.720> over<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> last<00:02:20.620> 10<00:02:20.860> years<00:02:21.040> that

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
to go for over the last 10 years that

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.160

I've been doing gigs as I tend to stick

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.170 
I've been doing gigs as I tend to stick
to<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.410> middle<00:02:23.560> ground<00:02:23.830> one<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.670> other<00:02:25.000> one

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
to the middle ground one the other one

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.610 
to the middle ground one the other one
the<00:02:25.300> lower<00:02:25.720> place<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.230> don't<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.500> high

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the lower place and I don't the high

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.559 
the lower place and I don't the high
place<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.760> I'm<00:02:27.849> going<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.000> go<00:02:28.090> for<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.330> middle

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
place so I'm going to go for the middle

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.690 
place so I'm going to go for the middle
one<00:02:28.599> so<00:02:28.959> that's<00:02:29.470> that's<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:29.890> really<00:02:30.040> good<00:02:30.250> 2sr

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
one so that's that's a really good 2sr

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.479 
one so that's that's a really good 2sr
