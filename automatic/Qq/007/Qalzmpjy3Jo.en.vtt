five<00:01:06.299> correct<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.470> five<00:01:07.650> apps<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> five

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
five correct up to five apps up to five

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.330 
five correct up to five apps up to five
contacts<00:01:08.939> exactly<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:11.100> brought

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
contacts exactly and then we brought

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.289 
contacts exactly and then we brought
back<00:01:11.600> similar<00:01:12.600> features<00:01:13.549> from<00:01:14.549> galaxy<00:01:15.030> s6

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
back similar features from galaxy s6

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.149 
back similar features from galaxy s6
edge<00:01:16.189> where<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.570> edge<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.040> have

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
edge where see here with edge so we have

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.320 
edge where see here with edge so we have
night<00:01:20.369> clock<00:01:21.409> which<00:01:22.409> set<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.119> can

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
night clock which set up here you can

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
night clock which set up here you can
set<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.990> time<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.409> basically<00:01:28.619> serve<00:01:29.130> as

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
set up time so it can basically serve as

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.300 
set up time so it can basically serve as
your

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
your

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
your
alarm<00:01:32.310> clock<00:01:32.520> bedside<00:01:33.090> clock<00:01:33.240> basically<00:01:33.870> so

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
alarm clock bedside clock basically so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
alarm clock bedside clock basically so
you<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.380> clock<00:01:35.100> here<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> kind<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you have the clock here you can kind of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.930 
you have the clock here you can kind of
wake<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:38.100> brighter<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.670> obviously

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
wake it up to be brighter you obviously

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.770 
wake it up to be brighter you obviously
don't<00:01:39.120> want<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.330> bright<00:01:39.510> when<00:01:39.660> you're

much comfort more comfortable to hold
large<00:02:30.390> screen<00:02:30.690> device<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.320> when<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:31.590> think

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
large screen device and when we think

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.560 
large screen device and when we think
about<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.250> consumer<00:02:32.760> said<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.150> love<00:02:33.300> big

really flat panel that you used to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.479 
really flat panel that you used to
looking<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:03.269> again<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.620> suits<00:03:05.130> itself

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
looking at so again that suits itself

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.280 
looking at so again that suits itself
really<00:03:05.730> well<00:03:05.880> towards<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.570> large<00:03:06.840> screen

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
really well towards that large screen

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.530 
really well towards that large screen
device<00:03:07.620> where<00:03:08.100> people<00:03:08.430> are<00:03:08.519> consuming<00:03:08.850> by

device where people are consuming by

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.690 
device where people are consuming by
nature<00:03:09.870> that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
nature that

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.050 
nature that
a<00:03:10.790> device<00:03:11.420> type<00:03:11.629> a<00:03:11.780> lot<00:03:11.900> more<00:03:12.050> media<00:03:13.060> and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
a device type a lot more media and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.790 
a device type a lot more media and
what's<00:03:14.390> with<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.720> audio<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.560> that's

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
what's with the audio you so that that's

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.920 
what's with the audio you so that that's
an<00:03:16.069> excuse<00:03:16.160> yeah<00:03:16.910> that's<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.330> hand<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:17.720> we<00:03:17.840> have

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
an excuse yeah that's in hand so we have

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.570 
an excuse yeah that's in hand so we have
ultra<00:03:18.200> high<00:03:18.349> quality<00:03:18.800> audio<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.400> so

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
ultra high quality audio and so

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.520 
ultra high quality audio and so
basically<00:03:19.730> what<00:03:20.269> that<00:03:20.300> is<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.930> allows<00:03:21.260> you

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
basically what that is is it allows you

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.750 
basically what that is is it allows you
to<00:03:22.239> from<00:03:23.239> within<00:03:23.920> really<00:03:24.920> any<00:03:25.069> application

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
to from within really any application

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.160 
to from within really any application
but<00:03:25.970> this<00:03:26.090> is<00:03:26.180> an<00:03:26.239> example<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.780> where<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.019> have

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
but this is an example is where you have

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.220 
but this is an example is where you have
the<00:03:27.319> vu<00:03:27.709> h<00:03:27.860> q<00:03:28.730> upscaler<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.840> works<00:03:30.050> with

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
the vu h q upscaler it works with

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.380 
the vu h q upscaler it works with
headphones<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:30.920> so<00:03:31.640> when<00:03:31.849> we<00:03:31.940> plug<00:03:32.150> in<00:03:32.180> some

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
headphones in so when we plug in some

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.530 
headphones in so when we plug in some
headphones<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.360> basically<00:03:35.360> what<00:03:35.510> it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
headphones and so basically what it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.300 
headphones and so basically what it
allow<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.080> do<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.410> take<00:03:36.590> lower<00:03:36.920> bitrate

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
allow you to do is take lower bitrate

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.839 
allow you to do is take lower bitrate
quality<00:03:37.910> digital<00:03:38.810> music<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.860> works<00:03:40.670> really

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
quality digital music so works really

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.520 
quality digital music so works really
well<00:03:40.970> with<00:03:41.269> with<00:03:41.569> streaming<00:03:41.930> services

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
well with with streaming services

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.900 
well with with streaming services
