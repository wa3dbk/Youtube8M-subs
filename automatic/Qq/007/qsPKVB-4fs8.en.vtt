 Hello everyone today I want to compare the sound 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.870
 polyphonic speaker in iphone 6 and 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.120
 iphone 5 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.259
 remember here they go mono that is by 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.259
 one dynamic 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.880
 we will compare on the same 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 compositions 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.660
 but 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.120
 from myself I want to note that the sound iphone 6 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.659
 50 percent louder than the five 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.689
 but a little more 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:03:00.540
 creak whether you say so on fives 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:03.959
 cleaner but hints for bass there 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 six is a plus well and in general more 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.260
 positive impressions cause 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.799
 the dynamics of the six on this thank you wait 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.799
