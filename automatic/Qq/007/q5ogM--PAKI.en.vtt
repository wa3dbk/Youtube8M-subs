but they still make this very similar
model<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.099> get<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.340> with

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
model to this and you can get it with

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.900 
model to this and you can get it with
USB<00:02:09.869> inputs<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.560> stuff<00:02:10.739> now<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> still

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
USB inputs and stuff now this is still

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.930 
USB inputs and stuff now this is still
like<00:02:11.970> old<00:02:12.330> school

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
like old school

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.320 
like old school
mic<00:02:13.360> cable<00:02:13.900> style<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.430> really<00:02:15.910> great

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
mic cable style but it's a really great

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.950 
mic cable style but it's a really great
mic<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.920> fairly<00:02:18.370> cheap<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.090> terms<00:02:19.810> of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
mic and it's fairly cheap in terms of

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.860 
mic and it's fairly cheap in terms of
like<00:02:20.140> recording<00:02:20.800> equipment<00:02:21.130> goes<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.570> would

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
like recording equipment goes so I would

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.180 
like recording equipment goes so I would
definitely<00:02:22.900> recommend<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.650> mic<00:02:23.890> if<00:02:24.040> you're

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
definitely recommend this mic if you're

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.370 
definitely recommend this mic if you're
looking<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.580> get<00:02:24.850> one<00:02:25.000> for<00:02:25.240> vocals<00:02:25.630> actually

looking and get one for vocals actually
it's<00:02:26.470> also<00:02:26.620> really<00:02:26.860> good<00:02:27.040> for<00:02:27.100> recording<00:02:27.700> me

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
it's also really good for recording me

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.000 
it's also really good for recording me
acoustic<00:02:28.000> guitar<00:02:28.480> that's<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.050> do<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.770> just

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
microphone and then you can also get the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.660 
microphone and then you can also get the
USB<00:02:34.630> version<00:02:35.080> if<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.440> want<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.400> at<00:02:36.550> the

high<00:02:38.950> school<00:02:38.980> stereo<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.300> use<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.900> mix

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
high school stereo that I use to mix

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.650 
high school stereo that I use to mix
with<00:02:41.620> let's<00:02:42.580> take<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.820> look<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:43.570> the

Mike<00:03:11.220> really<00:03:12.220> convenient<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.910> would<00:03:13.330> probably

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
Mike really convenient I would probably

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.510 
Mike really convenient I would probably
not<00:03:14.110> particularly<00:03:14.890> recommend<00:03:15.370> these<00:03:15.460> for

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
not particularly recommend these for

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.229 
not particularly recommend these for
like<00:03:15.910> high<00:03:16.180> quality<00:03:16.690> sound<00:03:17.470> or<00:03:17.890> any<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:19.150> that

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
like high quality sound or any of that

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.840 
like high quality sound or any of that
hitex<00:03:19.959> noise<00:03:20.560> cancellation<00:03:21.370> or<00:03:21.520> anything

hitex noise cancellation or anything

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.810 
hitex noise cancellation or anything
like<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.030> they're<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.690> pretty<00:03:22.900> much

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
like that they're just pretty much

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.550 
like that they're just pretty much
basically<00:03:24.820> gaming<00:03:25.600> headphones<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:26.200> i<00:03:26.350> use

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
basically gaming headphones that i use

basically gaming headphones that i use
for<00:03:26.590> mixing<00:03:27.190> sometimes<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.940> guess<00:03:28.480> there's<00:03:28.630> not

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
for mixing sometimes I guess there's not

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.060 
for mixing sometimes I guess there's not
really<00:03:28.870> any<00:03:29.050> point<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.440> showing<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
really any point in showing you the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.699 
really any point in showing you the
actual<00:03:30.280> tower<00:03:30.610> of<00:03:30.850> my<00:03:30.970> pc<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.290> specs<00:03:32.590> for

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
actual tower of my pc but the specs for

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.300 
actual tower of my pc but the specs for
it<00:03:32.950> are<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.760> quad<00:03:34.060> core<00:03:34.390> with<00:03:34.620> 60<00:03:35.620> gigs<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:36.040> ram

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
it are a quad core with 60 gigs of ram

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.870 
it are a quad core with 60 gigs of ram
and<00:03:37.110> i<00:03:38.110> upgraded<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.160> video<00:03:39.400> card<00:03:39.670> to

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
and i upgraded the video card to

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.850 
and i upgraded the video card to
something<00:03:40.209> better<00:03:40.360> mainly<00:03:41.020> for<00:03:41.200> gaming<00:03:41.650> but

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
something better mainly for gaming but

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.560 
something better mainly for gaming but
it's<00:03:42.010> actually<00:03:42.130> also<00:03:42.459> i<00:03:42.610> think<00:03:42.820> good<00:03:43.239> for

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
it's actually also i think good for

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.470 
it's actually also i think good for
video<00:03:43.900> editing<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.670> even<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.760> little<00:03:45.940> bit<00:03:46.060> for

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
video editing and even a little bit for

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.040 
video editing and even a little bit for
