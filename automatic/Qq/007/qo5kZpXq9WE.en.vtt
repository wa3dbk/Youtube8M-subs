but<00:00:38.720> once<00:00:38.990> you<00:00:39.140> sort<00:00:39.410> of<00:00:39.500> immerse<00:00:39.740> yourself<00:00:40.130> in

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
but once you sort of immerse yourself in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.250 
but once you sort of immerse yourself in
it<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:40.430> kind<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.640> see<00:00:40.820> what<00:00:41.000> he<00:00:41.060> does<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:41.540> he

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
it you kind of see what he does and he

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.290 
it you kind of see what he does and he
has<00:00:42.440> a<00:00:42.470> level<00:00:42.800> of<00:00:43.100> detail<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:43.790> I<00:00:43.820> think<00:00:44.090> is

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
has a level of detail that I think is

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.990 
has a level of detail that I think is
not<00:00:45.080> given<00:00:45.710> in<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:46.010> lot<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.220> other<00:00:46.460> stuff<00:00:46.550> now

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
not given in a lot of other stuff now

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.360

the<00:00:47.480> way<00:00:47.630> they<00:00:47.870> do<00:00:47.930> this<00:00:48.260> spaceship<00:00:48.800> combat<00:00:49.100> I

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
the way they do this spaceship combat I

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.860 
the way they do this spaceship combat I
thought<00:00:49.670> was<00:00:49.820> really<00:00:50.000> interesting<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:50.840> know

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
thought was really interesting you know

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.840 
thought was really interesting you know
the<00:00:50.990> idea<00:00:51.560> that<00:00:51.710> these<00:00:51.890> ships<00:00:52.430> are<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:52.640> far

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
the idea that these ships are so far

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.550 
the idea that these ships are so far
apart<00:00:52.970> and<00:00:53.420> they're<00:00:53.930> dealing<00:00:54.200> with<00:00:54.230> inertia

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
apart and they're dealing with inertia

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.460 
apart and they're dealing with inertia
which<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:55.670> don't<00:00:55.790> see<00:00:55.910> in<00:00:56.480> Star<00:00:57.080> Wars<00:00:57.110> or<00:00:57.440> Star

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
Trek at all you know the idea that you

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.420 
Trek at all you know the idea that you
can't<00:00:59.600> just<00:00:59.870> turn<00:01:00.080> a<00:01:00.140> ship<00:01:00.440> on<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.620> dime<00:01:00.890> it's

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
can't just turn a ship on a dime it's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.370

going<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:02.360> know<00:01:02.480> this<00:01:02.690> fast<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.230> these

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
going you know this fast and these

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.990 
going you know this fast and these
things<00:01:03.620> so<00:01:03.830> it's<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.580> same<00:01:04.790> thing<00:01:04.820> that

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
appealed to me with valisar gallaccio is

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.200 
appealed to me with valisar gallaccio is
the<00:01:06.710> idea<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:06.980> they<00:01:07.160> still<00:01:07.460> used<00:01:07.820> for<00:01:08.060> Jack
