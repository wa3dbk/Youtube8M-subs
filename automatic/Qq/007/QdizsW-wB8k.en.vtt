this project my design process and the
robots<00:00:15.570> themselves<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.830> let's<00:00:17.820> start<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300

which if he was a real robot would

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.780 
which if he was a real robot would
definitely<00:00:40.410> support<00:00:40.860> his<00:00:41.070> amazing<00:00:41.640> weight

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
know if you remember that game Simon

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.520 
know if you remember that game Simon
from<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.620> 80s<00:02:39.040> where<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.310> hid<00:02:39.490> all<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.640> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
from the 80s where you hid all of the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.750 
from the 80s where you hid all of the
things<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:41.950> think<00:02:42.250> that's<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.610> was

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
things but I think that's what I was

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.490 
things but I think that's what I was
thinking<00:02:43.090> when<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:43.270> did<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.690> chart<00:02:44.080> that's

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
thinking when I did this chart that's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.040 
thinking when I did this chart that's
what<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.740> looks<00:02:44.920> like<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.130> me<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.360> again<00:02:46.690> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
what it looks like to me and again the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.350 
what it looks like to me and again the
large<00:02:47.290> pieces<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:48.310> greens<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.060> Blues

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
large pieces the greens and the Blues

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.600 
large pieces the greens and the Blues
are<00:02:49.630> knit<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.380> antara<00:02:50.740> and<00:02:51.190> then<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.400> fine

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
are knit in and antara and then the fine

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.940 
are knit in and antara and then the fine
details<00:02:52.030> are<00:02:52.210> done<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.450> duplicate<00:02:52.930> stitch<00:02:53.050> but

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
details are done a duplicate stitch but

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.350 
details are done a duplicate stitch but
the<00:02:54.190> charts<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.640> come<00:02:54.880> with<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.120> pattern

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
the charts that come with this pattern

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.840 
the charts that come with this pattern
are<00:02:55.630> complete<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.590> knitter<00:02:56.800> making<00:02:57.670> these

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
are complete so a knitter making these

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.660 
are complete so a knitter making these
can<00:02:58.240> use<00:02:58.510> whichever<00:02:59.380> methods<00:03:00.070> she<00:03:00.280> finds

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
can use whichever methods she finds

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.120 
can use whichever methods she finds
convenient<00:03:01.270> for<00:03:01.540> all<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.960> details<00:03:02.350> and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
convenient for all of the details and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.410 
convenient for all of the details and
now<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.460> I'm<00:03:03.550> touching<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.000> actually<00:03:04.390> I

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
now that I'm touching it actually I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.450 
now that I'm touching it actually I
think<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.900> our<00:03:05.320> test<00:03:05.710> knitter<00:03:05.890> did<00:03:06.220> the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
think that our test knitter did the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.280 
think that our test knitter did the
green<00:03:06.670> parts<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.150> duplicate<00:03:07.600> stitch<00:03:07.720> as<00:03:08.080> well

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
green parts and duplicate stitch as well

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.660 
green parts and duplicate stitch as well
and<00:03:08.560> as<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.040> can<00:03:09.220> see<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.490> looks<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:10.570> good

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
and as you can see it looks just as good

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.840 
and as you can see it looks just as good
and<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:13.300> last<00:03:13.570> one<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.770> oscillate<00:03:15.520> Rick's

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
and the last one is the oscillate Rick's

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.540 
and the last one is the oscillate Rick's
and<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> first<00:03:17.410> robot<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.490> I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
and this is the first robot that I

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.640 
and this is the first robot that I
designed<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.540> think<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.900> can<00:03:20.080> see<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.320> he

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
designed and I think you can see that he

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.790 
designed and I think you can see that he
actually<00:03:20.830> resembles<00:03:21.580> my<00:03:21.820> ideas<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.660> little<00:03:23.590> bit

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
actually resembles my ideas a little bit

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.290 
actually resembles my ideas a little bit
more<00:03:24.040> closely<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.700> he's<00:03:24.850> kind<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.240> the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
more closely and he's kind of the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.199 
more closely and he's kind of the
traditional<00:03:26.070> if<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.250> could<00:03:27.430> if<00:03:27.610> robust<00:03:27.970> can

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
traditional if you could if robust can

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.290 
traditional if you could if robust can
be<00:03:28.360> said<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.810> be<00:03:28.840> traditional<00:03:29.730> robot<00:03:30.730> he<00:03:31.060> has

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
be said to be traditional robot he has

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.530 
be said to be traditional robot he has
arms<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.020> legs<00:03:32.230> which<00:03:32.590> are<00:03:33.450> kind<00:03:34.450> of

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
arms and legs which are kind of

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.760 
arms and legs which are kind of
matchstick<00:03:35.170> inspired<00:03:37.530> their<00:03:38.530> knit

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
matchstick inspired their knit

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.710 
matchstick inspired their knit
separately<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.670> round<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.240> then<00:03:40.480> his

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
separately in the round and then his

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.140 
separately in the round and then his
body<00:03:40.870> again<00:03:41.290> isn't<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.800> one<00:03:42.010> piece<00:03:42.280> flat<00:03:42.820> so

body again isn't it in one piece flat so

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.880 
body again isn't it in one piece flat so
that<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.420> can<00:03:43.600> work<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.780> intarsia<00:03:44.260> for<00:03:44.740> his

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
that you can work the intarsia for his

that you can work the intarsia for his

worked<00:03:51.190> in<00:03:51.370> duplicate<00:03:51.880> stitch<00:03:52.000> after<00:03:52.959> it's

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
worked in duplicate stitch after it's

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.460 
worked in duplicate stitch after it's
done<00:03:53.610> his<00:03:54.610> face<00:03:54.910> follows<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.900> same<00:03:56.080> method

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
done his face follows the same method

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.199 
done his face follows the same method
some<00:03:56.770> antara<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.400> some<00:03:57.610> duplicate<00:03:58.060> stitch

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
some antara and some duplicate stitch

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.980 
some antara and some duplicate stitch
and<00:03:58.690> then<00:03:58.720> he<00:03:59.470> has<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.620> little<00:03:59.800> antenna<00:04:00.310> which

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
and then he has a little antenna which

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.210 
and then he has a little antenna which
mirrors<00:04:01.990> his<00:04:02.200> arms<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.680> his<00:04:02.830> legs<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:06.040> this

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
mirrors his arms and his legs with this

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.890 
mirrors his arms and his legs with this
pattern<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.850> get<00:04:07.000> instructions<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.750> make

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
pattern you get instructions to make

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.870 
pattern you get instructions to make
each<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.500> three<00:04:08.709> robots<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.489> then

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
each of the three robots and then

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.510 
each of the three robots and then
