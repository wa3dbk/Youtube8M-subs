the guitar spruce wood is used because

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.720 
the guitar spruce wood is used because
of<00:00:42.720> its<00:00:42.900> straight<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.530> uniform<00:00:43.980> grain<00:00:44.280> that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
the head of the guitar the tension on

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.040 
the head of the guitar the tension on
the<00:05:19.310> tuners<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:20.150> neech<00:05:20.330> strength

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.100 

and<00:05:24.139> then<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.919> strings<00:05:25.310> play<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.819> tune<00:05:26.110> and

the wood adds in the good vibrations to

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.150 
the wood adds in the good vibrations to
amplify<00:05:31.069> the<00:05:31.129> sound
