00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.759
 hello today in the technician kitchen we are going to 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.730
 make some ranges in a classical way that 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.680
 they are made on the griddle or grill 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.900
 to give your state a touch on the outside 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.789
 very different from our previous recipe 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.470
 of ranges and we're going to do a review of 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.540
 the ingredients 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.600
 to do our ranges we are going to 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.270
 need 100 grams of rice flour 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.860
 glutinous 100 grams of tofu who 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.260
 they want to use they can look for it more at 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.820
 taste or put coloring but give them 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.580
 the classics do not wear neither color nor 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.990
 sugar what sweetens you is the sauce that 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.280
 it's on the outside that's in this case I'm going 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.040
 to also give options between 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.410
 ingredients sugar 2 tablespoons sauce 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.690
 of soy 2 tablespoons and potato starch 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.260
 or cornstarch 2 tablespoons this is 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.060
 potato and water the necessary here I have the 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.860
 soy sauce that I have put 4 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.650
 tablespoons of water and we will put it 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.000
 everything to boil in the hot pan or in 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.980
 any container that can be put 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 directly in the game to boil 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.500
 and we put him 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.450
 and the sugar 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.469
 everything that mixes well 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.280
 I have here the two tablespoons hydrated 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:34.500
 of potato starch in four tablespoons 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.409
 five as much water as everything is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.649
 that dissolve very well very well in cold 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.649
 moisturize it well 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.680
 we put out the fire 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.700
 and in the mixture that we have of sugar 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.380
 water and soy sauce are 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.670
 already hydrated our potato starch 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.860
 and all this will thicken 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.110
 the piece of tofu that we are going to use to 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.390
 I have this recipe already drained from 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.970
 liquid should be removed as best as possible 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 before and we will work well for 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.860
 make it easier to mix all this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.050
 this food the hard there is your future and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.870
 all making fun either worth 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.750
 for this recipe 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.129
 Hard tofu is better to give priority or 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.489
 use it when you want something to fit you 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.739
 very firm or that does not fall apart and the tofu 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.230
 soft undoes more easily this one 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.519
 it has a more solid texture and the other 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's more the fresh cheese style you have to 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.420
 see it with your own eyes so that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.190
 see the difference 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.190
 we take the glutinous rice flour 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.880
 and we had a great time with our hands 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.270
 so that all the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.270
 ingredients 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.200
 here I have our already uniform dough 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.040
 the two ingredients 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.250
 now let's make little balls 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.010
 then the same uniform size is what 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.049
 as uniform as possible and let's boil 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.140
 so you can see how I know when and 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.100
 how do you know that the mass is ready 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.990
 that is already cooked 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.700
 I'm going to make them a little smaller than 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.810
 this size size is to taste 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.420
 also depending on 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.640
 the skewer available if it is a 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.400
 little pincho the balls are made very 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.650
 Tiny and try to get all 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.050
 as even as possible and we will move on to 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.310
 boil 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:32.770
 here I have water that is already starting to boil 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.250
 in the water we place the mangoes 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.010
 so that they cook inside the water 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.530
 when they are cooked they will go out to the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.750
 surface like floating a little 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.210
 floating and they are going to cool in water 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.720
 very cold or water with ice 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.310
 As you can see, the mangoes are floating 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.680
 means that you are ready to 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.590
 retire in the water 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.340
 have boiled for 5 minutes does not take 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.340
 nothing to be done 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.310
 I have cold water prepared 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.310
 the more day the better 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.490
 and we cool it well as you see it float 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.150
 also in the cold water 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.780
 and let's move on to the pinchitos 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.750
 that come out four skewers of three give two 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.290
 each one following the amounts that you 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.210
 I have given and it was already at the end of the recipe 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.650
 here I already have the last pinchito 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.900
 mango 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.699
 as you see a rather small size 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.860
 the stick is very good to be able 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.020
 catch it easily 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.750
 and let's move on to give it some color 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.230
 on the iron on the iron 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.249
 hot 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:51.080
 we put tango bugs 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:55.330
 to take a color on both sides 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.330
 of the classic way of making the ranges 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.530
 here we have our mango pinchitos 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.050
 that have already taken color on both sides 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.940
 a little bit with that pick up a little bit is already 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.660
 ready to eat you can catch all the 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.660
 color you want 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.980
 Plates in any dish 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.730
 It is very normal to go in pairs 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.730
 pinchitos 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.750
 and can be covered with something that we have 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.320
 seen already in other recipes and we put the 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.190
 link or you can cover it with this sauce 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.630
 sugar with soy sauce 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.630
 and it only remains to try them 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.770
 This way of making banks is very 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.390
 different from the previous one that we did and 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.220
 I hope you like some of the 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.100
 versions or both of hidalgos that 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.530
 we have pitched so far 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.500
 from the bench kitchen we want to wish 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.020
 a happy 2014 here I have this cake that 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.360
 I have prepared by these dates of

 celebrations is not very Christmas but I will give 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.790
