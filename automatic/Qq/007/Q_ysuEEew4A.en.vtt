00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.189
 or not 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.950
 Well here you have the natural feed 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.529
 for hamster in a little bit format 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.200
 smaller that fits precisely 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.650
 to the size of this animal 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.840
 and the composition you see a sample of that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 we have when we open it well then in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.760
 this composition, we can highlight 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.540
 first as the first ingredient the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.050
 Hay hay country is this dry herb that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.430
 As always it is taken from a meadow 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.950
 multifloral that you can also see 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 changing from one bag to another also this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 I'm telling you as a little curiosity 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.559
 because obviously the plants that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.590
 they bloom in one season and in another of the year 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.100
 They are different 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.720
 also you see cereal ears 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.910
 of wheat that we love and we have 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.290
 included whole maybe not many of 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.810
 you will know that the wheat is here 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.110
 inside included and that to unfold it 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.020
 you have to do a little manual work 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.940
 that the hamsters love it and what 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.100
 they have genetically learned then 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.229
 when we peel this spike we can 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.500
 find what they really eat 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.710
 which is the granite of wheat in the background 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.900
 Well well we also include something 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.140
 of apple something coconut we have hibiscus 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.060
 sunflower seeds and a lot of 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.770
 mixed ingredients that make up the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.320
 main diet of hamsters too 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.470
 I have to tell you as well as anecdote that 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.670
 hamsters are insectivores can eat 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 some insect not as main, not as 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.420
 their main diet but yes they 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.729
 you know they live in steppes 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.640
 fundamentally the hamster is an animal 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.490
 that comes from the Russian steppe of this 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.290
 country like great plains that there are in the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.030
 that in summer it is very hot and in the 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.220
 that the winter is very cold and they 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.230
 they normally collect these cereals 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.470
 to eat them in their holes in 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.690
 winter and in spring when they are 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 eating flowers and plants if they find 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.959
 some little bug also eat it and 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.850
 Above all things are going very well for the most 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.480
 small because these little bugs are very 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.069
 rich in protein and make them grow more 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.349
 fast so to speak 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.150
 and natural is precisely called 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.689
 natural because it is a natural product 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.459
 so what it does not have is this type 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:44.920
 of ingredients this is food 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.840
 extruded is a food to which 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.700
 previously he has been made a 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.950
 heat treatment has been subjected to 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.590
 heat and has been subjected to heat 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.900
 basically the cereal the cereal 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.909
 like wheat like corn when it 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.950
 undergoes a heat treatment exploits 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.560
 this you all know when you do 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.439
 popcorn this mechanism is the one that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.090
 used to do that kind of 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.680
 artificial ingredient that is very 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.900
 harmful to the general 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.840
 herbivores because it facilitates 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.359
 digestion and you can think then it is 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.310
 It facilitates better digestion not that 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.260
 facilitates digestion in brains is 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.000
 worse because a natural process jumps them 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.639
 alters the internal ph of the system 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.709
 digestive and involves them some 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.430
 serious complications at the digestive level 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.949
 Therefore, I will tell you that the extrusion 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.750
 is valid for food in people or 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.010
 even for dogs and cats 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.110
 as well 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.390
 but not for herbivorous animals and 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.909
 specifically not for hamsters that 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.430
 they need to take the cen the natural cereal 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.299
 and they would never find in nature 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.340
 a cereal that was extruded 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.870
 but it is a very good idea to put 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.629
 these other things that you see here 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.209
 and some fruit and vegetables on everything 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.640
 that is green leaf is going pretty well 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.920
 varied not in excess because as well 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.930
 you know it's a small animal and if you eat 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.519
 much of one thing they will produce the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.370
 digestive disorders so its 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.010
 main food should be your feed and 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.500
 you can supplement a little with fruit and 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.169
 vegetable and they love this kind of 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.850
 nooks you know that hamsters are 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.510
 very restless is one of my animals 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.070
 favorites do not stop and they like it a lot 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.320
 investigate they do a lot of 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.300
 pipes are going to see that in the cage there 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.090
 They stop hanging there roll like I eat 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.400
 tarzan on all sites and they get 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.250
 Through all the nooks they search 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.720
 they seek in that way the protection and 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.240
 we also have good then some 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.160
 prizes that are edible these 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.650
 awards these tunnels already come with 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.449
 plants that they are going to eat themselves 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.660
 and they will gnaw to wear their teeth 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.669
 and we can supplement them with hay as 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.479
 you see here because they with him with the 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.880
 hay 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.770
 apart from feeding they also make their 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.870
 bed to your nest as I have commented 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.530
 the hamsters dig tunnels and in the 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.300
 winter they spend the winter because half 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.770
 hibernating in a latent state 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.159
 where they move little because a long time ago 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.870
 cold and put pipes in the pipes 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.000
 they put all the forms of seedlings and 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.949
 those plants are worth them as insulation 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.340
 thermal also to make their nest breed 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:23.650
 in the middle of them and good eat them 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.780
 can you can feed on this no 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.139
 and finally I just want 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:33.759
 tell you a good little thing by way of 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.979
 curiosity about the substrate a study 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.740
 that has taken out the association to which 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.550
 I belong to specialist veterinarians 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.349
 in small exotic mammals that says 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.380
 that the substrate this substrate that you see 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:50.139
 here the newspaper paper substrate 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.650
 is the best because it is the least toxic is 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.740
 that we say less components 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.449
 artificial has and compared with 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.110
 substrates that I 'm sure you already know as 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:04.660
 it can be the coconut fiber or 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.370
 serry no or any other then 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.490
 as long as you can even though it's a tad 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.170
 more expensive is not so much the difference 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.610
 compensates for putting substrates based on 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.610
 pressed newspaper
