6<00:03:47.150> years<00:03:47.270> we<00:03:47.510> kept<00:03:47.720> moving<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.140> way<00:03:48.350> we<00:03:48.500> also

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
6 years we kept moving this way we also

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.650 
6 years we kept moving this way we also
have<00:03:48.890> this<00:03:49.280> concept<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:49.850> using<00:03:50.060> shipping

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
have this concept of using shipping

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.420 
have this concept of using shipping
containers<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.650> created<00:03:52.070> these<00:03:52.220> spaces

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
containers you created these spaces

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.800 
containers you created these spaces
first<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.850> all<00:03:52.970> because<00:03:53.240> we<00:03:53.270> realize<00:03:53.600> that

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
first of all because we realize that

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.660 
first of all because we realize that
every<00:03:54.080> network<00:03:54.470> needs<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.890> space<00:03:55.130> just<00:03:55.580> to

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
every network needs the space just to

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.460 
every network needs the space just to
have<00:03:55.760> an<00:03:55.880> online<00:03:56.030> network<00:03:56.360> of<00:03:56.780> people<00:03:56.959> doesn't

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
have an online network of people doesn't

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.910 
have an online network of people doesn't
work<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.190> we<00:03:58.310> create<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.670> spaces<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.920> feature

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
work so we create the spaces to feature

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.130 
work so we create the spaces to feature
contemporary<00:04:01.640> culture<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.390> subculture<00:04:05.140> we
