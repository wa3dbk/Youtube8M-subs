00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hi guys it's Amanda from my pet 1031 and

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.720 
hi guys it's Amanda from my pet 1031 and
today<00:00:03.389> I'm<00:00:03.480> going<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.840> be<00:00:03.959> talking<00:00:04.170> about

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 
today I'm going to be talking about

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.970 
today I'm going to be talking about
harnesses<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.940> collars<00:00:09.050> so<00:00:10.050> collars<00:00:10.500> are<00:00:10.740> bad

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
harnesses and collars so collars are bad

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.999 
harnesses and collars so collars are bad
for<00:00:11.309> rabbits<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:12.230> rabbits<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.530> very

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
for rabbits because rabbits have very

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.670 
for rabbits because rabbits have very
fragile<00:00:14.370> necks<00:00:14.880> if<00:00:15.630> Elsie<00:00:16.049> will<00:00:16.199> come<00:00:16.379> over

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
fragile necks if Elsie will come over

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.530 
fragile necks if Elsie will come over
here

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.170 

you'll<00:00:20.540> see<00:00:20.810> that<00:00:21.170> a<00:00:21.230> rabbit's<00:00:21.710> neck<00:00:22.070> is<00:00:22.310> a<00:00:22.970> lot

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
you'll see that a rabbit's neck is a lot

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.570 
you'll see that a rabbit's neck is a lot
thinner<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:23.810> doesn't<00:00:24.200> have<00:00:24.350> as<00:00:24.590> much<00:00:24.860> support

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
thinner and doesn't have as much support

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.570 
thinner and doesn't have as much support
or<00:00:25.910> meat<00:00:26.779> around<00:00:26.990> it<00:00:27.529> or<00:00:27.740> muscle<00:00:28.220> you<00:00:28.369> could

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
or meat around it or muscle you could

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.370 
or meat around it or muscle you could
say<00:00:28.820> as<00:00:29.029> a<00:00:29.140> cat<00:00:30.140> or<00:00:30.380> a<00:00:30.410> dog's<00:00:30.770> neck<00:00:31.250> does<00:00:31.640> if<00:00:32.380> you

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
say as a cat or a dog's neck does if you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.770 
say as a cat or a dog's neck does if you
need<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:34.100> contain<00:00:34.520> your<00:00:34.760> rabbit<00:00:35.150> so<00:00:35.450> that's

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
need to contain your rabbit so that's

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.729 
need to contain your rabbit so that's
why<00:00:36.050> you're<00:00:36.260> choosing<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.890> collar<00:00:38.590> chances<00:00:39.590> are

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
why you're choosing a collar chances are

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.260 
why you're choosing a collar chances are
you're<00:00:39.860> going<00:00:39.949> to<00:00:40.040> be<00:00:40.160> putting<00:00:40.400> a<00:00:40.610> leash<00:00:40.820> on<00:00:41.030> it

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
you're going to be putting a leash on it

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.740 
you're going to be putting a leash on it
and<00:00:41.420> since<00:00:42.260> rabbits<00:00:42.920> are<00:00:43.070> also<00:00:43.309> prey<00:00:44.090> animals

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
and since rabbits are also prey animals

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.869 
and since rabbits are also prey animals
that<00:00:45.080> means<00:00:45.379> that<00:00:45.559> they<00:00:45.710> spook<00:00:46.100> rather<00:00:46.430> easy

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
that means that they spook rather easy

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.900 
that means that they spook rather easy
so<00:00:47.390> by<00:00:47.690> using<00:00:47.900> a<00:00:48.230> collar<00:00:48.530> if<00:00:48.860> your<00:00:49.489> rabbit

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
so by using a collar if your rabbit

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.350 
so by using a collar if your rabbit
spooks<00:00:50.479> or<00:00:50.989> get<00:00:51.979> scared<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.610> something<00:00:53.089> it

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
spooks or get scared of something it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.500 
spooks or get scared of something it
could<00:00:53.720> potentially<00:00:54.309> like<00:00:55.309> freak<00:00:55.790> out<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.180> run

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
could potentially like freak out and run

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.110 
could potentially like freak out and run
up<00:00:56.659> try<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.019> run<00:00:57.290> away<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.890> by<00:00:58.400> doing<00:00:58.580> that<00:00:58.729> it

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
up try to run away and by doing that it

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.200 
up try to run away and by doing that it
could<00:00:59.479> snap<00:00:59.809> its<00:01:00.050> own<00:01:00.229> neck<00:01:00.559> people<00:01:01.370> also<00:01:01.610> just

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
could snap its own neck people also just

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.600 
could snap its own neck people also just
like<00:01:02.420> randomly<00:01:02.960> put<00:01:03.470> collars<00:01:03.949> on<00:01:04.159> rabbits

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
like randomly put collars on rabbits

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.219 
like randomly put collars on rabbits
sometimes<00:01:05.089> because<00:01:05.570> they<00:01:05.780> think<00:01:06.049> it<00:01:06.200> looks

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
sometimes because they think it looks

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.880 
sometimes because they think it looks
cute<00:01:07.000> but<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:08.180> actuality<00:01:08.750> it's<00:01:09.530> very

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
cute but in actuality it's very

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.280 
cute but in actuality it's very
dangerous<00:01:10.640> because<00:01:10.909> if<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.360> gets<00:01:11.600> snagged<00:01:11.990> on

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
dangerous because if it gets snagged on

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.070 
dangerous because if it gets snagged on
something<00:01:12.890> then<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.460> could<00:01:13.850> also<00:01:14.090> harm<00:01:14.900> the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
something then that could also harm the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.000 
something then that could also harm the
rabbit<00:01:15.440> if<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:17.780> do<00:01:17.990> need<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.229> put<00:01:18.500> your<00:01:18.650> rabbit

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
rabbit if you do need to put your rabbit

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.370 
rabbit if you do need to put your rabbit
on<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.159> leash<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.790> harness<00:01:20.510> is<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.960> much<00:01:21.140> better

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
on a leash a harness is the much better

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.580 
on a leash a harness is the much better
option<00:01:22.040> if<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.640> can't<00:01:22.910> just<00:01:23.150> use<00:01:23.360> an<00:01:23.570> expat<00:01:24.110> I

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
option if you can't just use an expat I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.760 
option if you can't just use an expat I
have<00:01:25.280> three<00:01:25.670> options<00:01:25.880> here

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
have three options here

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.730 
have three options here
and<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.520> one<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:28.119> a<00:01:28.450> lot<00:01:28.810> like<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.110> collar<00:01:29.350> so

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
and this one is a lot like the collar so

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.469 
and this one is a lot like the collar so
I<00:01:29.770> would<00:01:29.950> not<00:01:30.159> recommend<00:01:30.549> using<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.180> kind

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
I would not recommend using this kind

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.070 
I would not recommend using this kind
this<00:01:32.350> kind<00:01:32.649> of<00:01:32.770> harness<00:01:33.549> it<00:01:33.790> happens<00:01:34.390> if<00:01:34.689> you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
this kind of harness it happens if you

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.249 
this kind of harness it happens if you
pull<00:01:35.470> one<00:01:35.920> side<00:01:35.950> then<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.640> other<00:01:36.759> side<00:01:37.259> will

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
pull one side then the other side will

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.920 
pull one side then the other side will
get<00:01:38.409> tighter<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.700> if<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.210> rabbit<00:01:40.509> pulled<00:01:40.780> away

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
get tighter so if a rabbit pulled away

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.260 
get tighter so if a rabbit pulled away
for<00:01:41.350> this<00:01:41.470> kind<00:01:41.829> of<00:01:41.950> harness<00:01:42.189> it<00:01:42.549> too<00:01:42.880> could

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
for this kind of harness it too could

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.330 
for this kind of harness it too could
potentially<00:01:44.020> snap<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.530> rabbits<00:01:44.890> neck<00:01:45.159> or

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
potentially snap the rabbits neck or

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.820 
potentially snap the rabbits neck or
even<00:01:45.700> hurt<00:01:45.880> their<00:01:46.090> back<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.929> therefore<00:01:47.679> these

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
even hurt their back so therefore these

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.679 
even hurt their back so therefore these
are<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.250> two<00:01:48.580> options

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
are the two options

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.480 
are the two options
you<00:01:49.750> really<00:01:50.259> have<00:01:50.530> when<00:01:50.890> considering

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
you really have when considering

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.419 
you really have when considering
harnesses<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:52.720> harness<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.560> more<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.100> vest

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
harnesses this harness is more of a vest

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.399 
harnesses this harness is more of a vest
it<00:01:54.759> goes<00:01:55.030> all<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.330> way<00:01:55.509> around<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.380> just

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
it goes all the way around and it just

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.949 
it goes all the way around and it just
offers<00:01:57.220> overall<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.909> lot<00:01:58.210> more<00:01:58.420> support

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
offers overall a lot more support

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.949 
offers overall a lot more support
whereas<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.130> harness<00:02:00.459> called<00:02:01.149> an<00:02:01.299> H<00:02:01.539> Arnott

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
whereas this harness called an H Arnott

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.190 
whereas this harness called an H Arnott
I<00:02:02.140> believe<00:02:02.440> is<00:02:02.619> just<00:02:03.280> basically<00:02:04.270> four<00:02:04.780> straps

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
I believe is just basically four straps

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.940 
I believe is just basically four straps
connected<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:07.420> harness<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:08.259> seen<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.649> lot

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
connected this harness is seen a lot

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
connected this harness is seen a lot
more<00:02:08.979> commonly<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.410> preferred<00:02:12.069> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660
