 watch how many thumbs up 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 Let's start with the first 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:28.019
 youtuber look let's start at 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
 my very first youtuber I watched 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.149
 really my favorite youtuber and that was 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.010
 ok ok s aww your child and that of the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.260
 fifa videos of the route to face you 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 man really i was transshipment and its just 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.640
 So be a party pass to the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 vision and went with his team and I was 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.050
 really addicted i really do that every time 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 watched every episode I do anyway 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.110
 looked at something from the four times I found 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.110
 just such a super fun thing it did 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.179
 and of course you get it , I think 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.500
 that he no longer does that and people 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.269
 wish you could go back example 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.039
 I think it could really be true 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.750
 and that is why I should 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.260
 I like to make it back again 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.030
 come 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.610
 well then the second youtube lydia look at that 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.289
 is vital shooting and that is a joke 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.759
 you knew forest where he was the one in it 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:15.820
 the will 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.820
 cup final 1018 you hit the field on brenda 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.020
 And yes I thought it was quite a long time 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.970
 He crept in my piece on TV greek 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.130
 about then and there with the world anyway 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.570
 better final but then he had such a gap 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.180
 pulled out with a girl and a 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.640
 Lamborgini that you really like it 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.010
 one and a half million sometimes grew 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.150
 and javid and that look the way i think 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.650
 I really do not know pranks makes m yes 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.630
 I just give Prince a lot of fun 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.400
 to see well I had of course 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.450
 really very okay that's a dutch 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.370
 youtubers tom 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.290
 gwyn's i really liked sam videos so much 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.180
 fat and it and how it is that and just 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 his youtuber style is really super 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.970
 fat but lately he has 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.230
 according to my give videos mega upload and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.360
 never too bad because I miss it 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.100
 videos did because his editing was real 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.720
 just an example for me 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.190
 I really superfine sizes look 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.930
 leave nico natural with following 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.180
 youtuber that is not really a youtuber 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.830
 my music and all channel I 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.149
 actually listen to every song 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.370
 is proximity 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.140
 pandora music something like that with the past and that 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.390
 I also really think it's a sweet chocolate pair 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.860
 songs so if you want to listen to songs 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.720
 from a channel was really to you 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.740
 sundry is not and then we buy according 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.020
 me if you can't use it in you 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.670
 videos what is real and job channel 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.410
 oil to the icon and press with us 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.760
 own group joey and stuff 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.320
 the sky climate look I show I watch 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.570
 I 'm just feeling our group one 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.120
 little does it whatever is often 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.950
 a movie together i just watch as 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.750
 I think every video of everyone leaves 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.430
 of course you said pull action too 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.050
 crawled along a live strings I think 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.000
 sometimes not always before the start of 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.459
 I think I already have socks and his slogs 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.930
 also watch will be sky wars video that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.300
 we really edit it so he will be fun 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.640
 then I would definitely recommend you go 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.290
 after what, then all I can do that 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.670
 is 10 that is therefore also possible in the Netherlands 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.590
 adventurous that makes the study a top 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.910
 10 of all kinds of crazy things I have here 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.100
 for example it is team 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.019
 surprising illuminati facts that 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.580
 special facts about pirates that kind 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.150
 I also think watching channels 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.709
 also 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.110
 yes I also find that interesting 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.890
 to say say 10 serial killers that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.840
 walk around freely 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.280
 I just like to see that and 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.350
 this is interesting a members we do 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.630
 welcome to another new 10 and this 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.380
 are the 10 stupidest suicides 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.790
 late came dutch channels or more 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.680
 Of course I look ever so than 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.750
 games let alone not much more 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.860
 I can do a lot more of dailyshade 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.620
 ddg 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.150
 philosophy of course that she at bab he 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.700
 his videos are also very brilliant 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.110
 I watch of course because viva is really the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.100
 lately i had a lot can you can 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.670
 we don't just fly very fun ourselves 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.620
 of course 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.450
 And then you can also watch very active videos 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.010
 and so I watch daily too 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.140
 watch gamemeneer game and i really can 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.300
 Comment super good food I feel well I 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.880
 very often videos are late I want best 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.440
 kind of a big subject white 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.030
 about him because of course you look a lot 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.090
 join youtube views I'll probably be too 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.740
 sick come in on your channel there 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.990
 is that i think i have for example 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.310
 drew anl that danny palace 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.200
 and i have jim bug targets sometimes 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.040
 I also just looked at us 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.380
 watched games 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.640
 for example all was the channel and watch 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.170
 sometimes on so I think sometimes 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.790
 nice to see how you do that 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.860
 just say the smaller group 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.810
 among the 1000 subscribers and me too 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.940
 nice to have a look in fifa 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.950
 youtuber i really like to look around 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.270
 show so his videos like it 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.070
 will wave ivan times but also has 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.780
 really super nice videos what did 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.190
 he says the latter it really super 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.510
 much later against other videos 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.990
 just go through code or more 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.610
 upload 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.620
 by the way, he was the ones with oil 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.360
 that villa with that ferrari marine video 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.340
 on makes your lots of tidbits 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.900
 he also deals with players of course with 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.240
 I think mud has a little bit 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.470
 Pelle has gone that football 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.030
 a bit done for it is that of 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.500
 all I also look very factually too 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.570
 generally all this time and therefore it 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.070
 Group of times you would be professional 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.480
 get together quite often 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.130
 now i have a little socrative 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.140
 youtubers kinda had the vloggers 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.820
 do you think so and so 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.590
 but what I really what to look 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.020
 Kwebbelkop experiences a lot of gta5videos 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.070
 and gta 5 I often do well for one 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.570
 playstation 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.010
 so i also like to figure that 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.750
 you can just do what he does he does 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.910
 always those races it's always fun 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.680
 is always a little busy litigation 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.450
 always been laughing in his videos and then 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.250
 I like that to see which 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.140
 you combine a little that picked bmx now 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.260
 gio clothing is just that 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.780
 you drink and look no i look too 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.520
 once really girls youtuber say me 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.530
 marije acidveld, for example, understood that 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.070
 is from my studies is when media gave me 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.810
 nearly 10,000 subscribers and me 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.790
 a videos are just go to watch 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.050
 so she just makes nice videos about it 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.880
 yes i don't know how to do it 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.580
 so no beauty channel is not just it 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.960
 I've been standing here so yes I know now 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.640
 look at appoint it is or from 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.680
 vlog like channel but she doesn't 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.970
 really say vlog but I think it's best 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.530
 nice but watch videos and 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.240
 next youtuber i also very much 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.790
 many look smart he makes 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.400
 minecraft animations and oh my god that 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.290
 all so real fat corn oil which is 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.270
 really a conversation if you can make that 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.070
 not mike mike information so super fat 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.450
 look like and i like that a lot 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.980
 exist and afraid of because yes really of 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.050
 that kind of little story's in it 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.540
 minecraft but then animated looks 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.400
 I really want to be able to go that far 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.290
 I don't actually have any in front of me 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.700
 want to say it out of your mouth 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.990
 go find out how to do all those things 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.490
 and my PC can do it too 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.350
 easy on what i really need a lot 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.000
 have a better PC and true smart Kalmar 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.640
 ff those movies of minecraft stories 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.590
 small sketches gets stuck and then fold 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.760
 you also just really completely with you 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.070
 in thoughts, and then we are at the 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.420
 last genre theme say come what 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.920
 for youtubers i look and those are often 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.920
 the intro makers really 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.630
 Yes 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.889
 I think super cool to see and the 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.410
 music is that they used drivers ar 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.030
 your floris intro channel would really be one 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.590
 kind of design channel that i really like 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.540
 that I 'm just going to play those music and stuff 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.220
 just getting the new ideas that 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.810
 coming up with a new intro from real 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.760
 if it becomes possible I do why I have to 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.650
 you always come up with new video ideas 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.450
 new series invent her you must 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.520
 always in succession 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.080
 for everyone who wants intro again and again 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.460
 what to invent and that seems pretty good to me 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.290
 difficult to say but you can of course it 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.340
 usually you just look at me so yes 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.450
 apparently 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.250
 fertilizers and that is why I think it is 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.650
 always nice to be that variation too 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.210
 see and improvements that and those meters 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.340
 or so they call were free witnesses d 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.139
 conducted around center makers 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.729
 yeah get well well i think we have a lot 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.220
 more youtubers what you throw for example 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.750
 a short film of encounter and especially that 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.900
 from youtube is what gives you 5 youtubers 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.820
 the intro makers and the vloggers, so to speak 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.400
 also and yes small countries like 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.870
 your can you go is so well i hope 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.250
 that you are unhappy with this 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.110
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:35.330
