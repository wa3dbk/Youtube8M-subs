ahead and take up the opacity slider to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
ahead and take up the opacity slider to
whatever<00:00:52.590> level<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.910> need<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.360> can

see as I raise the opacity level of the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
see as I raise the opacity level of the
action<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> shadows<00:00:58.890> are<00:00:59.449> getting<00:01:00.449> lighter

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
percent is looking good to me now the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.030 
percent is looking good to me now the
one<00:01:09.000> thing<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.330> don't<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
one thing that I don't like is the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
one thing that I don't like is the
effect<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.030> wood<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.630> doesn't<00:01:12.960> look

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
effect on the wood that doesn't look

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.480 
effect on the wood that doesn't look
natural<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.130> ahead<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
natural so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
natural so I'm going to go ahead and
mask<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.850> off<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> choose<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
mask it off I'm going to choose the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740 
mask it off I'm going to choose the
white<00:01:16.740> layer<00:01:16.979> mask<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.640> make<00:01:18.360> sure<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.689> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
white layer mask and make sure that I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.140 
white layer mask and make sure that I
have<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> brush<00:01:19.229> tool<00:01:19.530> selected<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.850> black

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
have the brush tool selected and a black

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
have the brush tool selected and a black
foreground<00:01:21.840> color<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.619> black<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
foreground color the black is going to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.530 
foreground color the black is going to
conceal<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.030> effect<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:26.390> sometimes<00:01:27.390> I

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
conceal the effect and then sometimes I

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
conceal the effect and then sometimes I
might<00:01:27.750> lower<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> opacity<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> brush<00:01:29.070> but

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
might lower the opacity of the brush but

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.620 
might lower the opacity of the brush but
today<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> keep<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> hundred

brush hardness when I just change it to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.450 
brush hardness when I just change it to
60<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.270> percent<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
60 or so percent and then I'm going to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:12.520 
60 or so percent and then I'm going to
continue<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:56.689> brush<00:01:58.009> off<00:01:59.240> the<00:02:00.240> effect

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.070 

now<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.400> went<00:02:13.730> over<00:02:13.910> onto<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.300> plate<00:02:14.540> area<00:02:14.750> so

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
now I went over onto the plate area so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.360 
now I went over onto the plate area so
I'm<00:02:15.140> just<00:02:15.350> going<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.560> switch<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:16.070> white

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
I'm just going to switch to a white

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.480 
I'm just going to switch to a white
foreground<00:02:16.970> color<00:02:17.620> make<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:18.800> brush<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.070> little

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
foreground color make my brush a little

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.130 
foreground color make my brush a little
bit<00:02:19.760> smaller<00:02:20.800> I'm<00:02:21.800> going<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.070> zoom<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.550> and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
bit smaller I'm going to zoom in and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.850 
bit smaller I'm going to zoom in and
just<00:02:24.140> make<00:02:24.380> sure<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.040> put<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.440> effect

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
just make sure that I put the effect

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.090 
just make sure that I put the effect
back<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.610> plate<00:02:31.850> okay<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.980> looks

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
back on the plate okay so that looks

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.980 
back on the plate okay so that looks
good<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:37.550> what<00:02:37.700> we're<00:02:37.850> doing<00:02:37.880> now<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.780> is

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
good for what we're doing now this is

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.170 
good for what we're doing now this is
lighting<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.980> shadows<00:02:40.060> brighten<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
lighting the shadows brighten the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.990 
lighting the shadows brighten the
shadows<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:43.220> next<00:02:43.459> thing<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.760> want

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
shadows and the next thing that I want

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.470 
shadows and the next thing that I want
to<00:02:44.060> do<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.450> give<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.840> big<00:02:45.050> bright<00:02:45.290> boost<00:02:46.480> we

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
to do is give it a big bright boost we

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.880 
to do is give it a big bright boost we
want<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.690> choose<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.900> one<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.350> press<00:02:48.530> play

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
want to choose that one and press play

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.250 
want to choose that one and press play
and<00:02:49.730> that's<00:02:49.880> going<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.330> make<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:51.200> a

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
and that's going to just make it a

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.870 
and that's going to just make it a
little<00:02:51.350> bit<00:02:51.620> brighter<00:02:51.739> if<00:02:52.070> it's<00:02:52.220> too<00:02:52.430> much<00:02:52.459> for

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
little bit brighter if it's too much for

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.350 
little bit brighter if it's too much for
you<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.060> can<00:02:53.270> lower<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.840> opacity<00:02:53.959> or<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.980> can

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
you you can lower the opacity or you can

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.620 
you you can lower the opacity or you can
raise<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.600> opacity<00:02:56.959> depending<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:59.450> looks

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
raise the opacity depending that looks

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.470 
raise the opacity depending that looks
pretty<00:02:59.870> good<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.200> me<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:01.370> orange<00:03:01.850> looks

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
pretty good to me the orange looks

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.870 
pretty good to me the orange looks
really<00:03:03.140> washed<00:03:03.410> out<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:03.980> I'm<00:03:04.430> going<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.640> just

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
really washed out so I'm going to just

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.680 
really washed out so I'm going to just
play<00:03:05.180> bold<00:03:05.690> color<00:03:05.989> boost<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:08.209> looks<00:03:08.360> good<00:03:08.570> to

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
play bold color boost that looks good to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.240 
play bold color boost that looks good to
me<00:03:08.720> as<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:09.590> again<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:09.980> can<00:03:10.130> adjust

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
me as it is but again you can adjust

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.000 
me as it is but again you can adjust
this<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.030> if<00:03:11.360> it's<00:03:11.510> too<00:03:11.720> bright<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.170> one<00:03:12.440> area

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
this and if it's too bright on one area

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.160 
this and if it's too bright on one area
you<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:13.370> mask<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.730> off<00:03:13.880> just<00:03:14.570> as<00:03:14.720> we<00:03:14.870> did<00:03:15.050> with

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
you can mask it off just as we did with

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.020 
you can mask it off just as we did with
lighten<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> shadows

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
lighten the shadows

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.670 
lighten the shadows
the<00:03:17.299> next<00:03:17.540> thing<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.810> want<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.140> do<00:03:18.350> with

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
the next thing that I want to do with

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.080 
the next thing that I want to do with
this<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:19.100> probably<00:03:19.940> highlight<00:03:20.930> pop<00:03:22.090> press

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
this is probably highlight pop press

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.960 
this is probably highlight pop press
play<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:24.650> can<00:03:24.799> see<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.130> effect<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.640> little

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
play you can see this effect is a little

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.900 
play you can see this effect is a little
bit<00:03:26.090> too<00:03:26.269> much<00:03:26.450> on<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:28.130> area<00:03:28.459> where<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.730> light

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
bit too much on the area where the light

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.840 
bit too much on the area where the light
is<00:03:28.940> coming<00:03:29.420> from<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:31.280> what<00:03:31.370> I'm<00:03:31.459> going<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.610> do

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
is coming from so what I'm going to do

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.140 
is coming from so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:32.500> I'm<00:03:33.500> actually<00:03:33.890> going<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.310> turn<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.670> up<00:03:34.880> a

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
is I'm actually going to turn it up a

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.340 
is I'm actually going to turn it up a
tiny<00:03:35.450> bit<00:03:35.709> focusing<00:03:36.709> on<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.430> area<00:03:38.350> making

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
tiny bit focusing on this area making

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.479 
tiny bit focusing on this area making
sure<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.830> looks<00:03:40.100> right<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:43.250> looks

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
sure that looks right and that looks

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.060 
sure that looks right and that looks
right<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.760> me<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:45.019> does<00:03:45.260> not<00:03:45.290> look<00:03:45.500> right<00:03:45.920> on

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
right to me it does not look right on

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.729 
right to me it does not look right on
this<00:03:46.370> area<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.209> I'm<00:03:47.299> going<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.540> mask<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:48.019> off<00:03:48.170> by

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
this area so I'm going to mask it off by

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.590 
this area so I'm going to mask it off by
choosing<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.310> layer<00:03:49.459> mask<00:03:49.760> making<00:03:50.299> sure<00:03:50.450> my

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
choosing the layer mask making sure my

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.870 
choosing the layer mask making sure my
brush<00:03:50.810> tool<00:03:51.079> is<00:03:51.260> selected<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.980> switching<00:03:52.760> to

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
brush tool is selected and switching to

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.530 
brush tool is selected and switching to
a<00:03:52.910> black<00:03:53.239> foreground<00:03:53.810> color<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:55.120> I'm<00:03:56.120> going

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
a black foreground color and I'm going

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.110 
a black foreground color and I'm going
to<00:03:56.720> make<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.380> brush<00:03:57.590> big<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.670> I'm<00:03:58.910> going<00:03:59.090> to

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
to make the brush big and I'm going to

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.890 
to make the brush big and I'm going to
lower<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.630> hardness<00:04:00.079> back<00:04:00.500> down<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.920> zero<00:04:01.220> and

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
lower the hardness back down to zero and

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.990 
lower the hardness back down to zero and
I'm<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:04.989> going<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:07.100> hit<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.340> side<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
I'm just going to hit the side of the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.420 
I'm just going to hit the side of the
plate<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.590> even<00:04:09.590> things<00:04:09.829> out<00:04:11.890> maybe<00:04:12.890> just

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
plate to even things out maybe just

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.590 
plate to even things out maybe just
right<00:04:13.730> there<00:04:14.000> as<00:04:14.150> well

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
right there as well

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.590 
right there as well
let's<00:04:15.260> just<00:04:15.470> take<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.739> look<00:04:15.950> at<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:17.150> before

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
let's just take a look at that so before

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.469 
let's just take a look at that so before
in<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.890> after<00:04:20.560> it's<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:21.650> little<00:04:21.859> bit<00:04:21.979> brighter

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
in the after it's a little bit brighter

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.000 
in the after it's a little bit brighter
okay<00:04:23.479> so<00:04:23.539> this<00:04:24.110> image<00:04:24.349> is<00:04:24.530> looking<00:04:24.830> pretty

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
okay so this image is looking pretty

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.409 
okay so this image is looking pretty
good<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.430> me

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
good to me

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.510 
good to me
but<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:27.080> have<00:04:27.470> one<00:04:27.740> more<00:04:27.890> thing<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.280> show<00:04:28.340> you

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
but I have one more thing to show you

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.880 
but I have one more thing to show you
and<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.030> is<00:04:29.360> under<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.780> creative<00:04:30.349> section

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
and that is under the creative section

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.730 
and that is under the creative section
it's<00:04:31.430> called<00:04:31.520> orange<00:04:32.000> boost<00:04:32.440> by<00:04:33.440> choosing

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
it's called orange boost by choosing

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.920 
it's called orange boost by choosing
this<00:04:34.010> action<00:04:34.430> it's<00:04:34.669> going<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.300> give<00:04:35.720> you<00:04:35.900> a

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
this action it's going to give you a

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.040 
this action it's going to give you a
much<00:04:36.289> richer<00:04:36.710> orange<00:04:37.580> color<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.750> we're<00:04:38.960> going

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
much richer orange color so we're going

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.990 
much richer orange color so we're going
to<00:04:39.110> choose<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.979> press<00:04:40.250> play<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.940> you

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
to choose that and press play and you

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.350 
to choose that and press play and you
can<00:04:41.450> see<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:43.310> color<00:04:43.610> of<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.910> orange<00:04:44.240> is

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
can see the color of the orange is

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.460 
can see the color of the orange is
changed<00:04:44.900> from<00:04:45.080> really<00:04:45.440> bland<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:47.260> really<00:04:48.260> rich

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
changed from really bland to really rich

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.650 
changed from really bland to really rich
this<00:04:49.430> isn't<00:04:49.789> going<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:49.970> affect<00:04:50.060> any<00:04:50.450> of<00:04:50.570> the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
this isn't going to affect any of the

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.450 
this isn't going to affect any of the
other<00:04:50.840> colors<00:04:51.110> in<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.500> image<00:04:51.530> except<00:04:52.190> for<00:04:52.400> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
other colors in the image except for the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.680 
other colors in the image except for the
oranges<00:04:53.000> it's<00:04:53.479> an<00:04:53.630> isolated<00:04:54.190> effect<00:04:55.539> so<00:04:56.539> it's

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
oranges it's an isolated effect so it's

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.650 
oranges it's an isolated effect so it's
really<00:04:56.930> easy<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.470> use<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:58.039> if<00:04:58.580> you<00:04:59.120> find<00:04:59.479> that

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
really easy to use and if you find that

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.210 
really easy to use and if you find that
it's<00:04:59.870> not<00:05:00.110> quite<00:05:00.410> enough<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:00.890> can<00:05:01.010> always

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
it's not quite enough you can always

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.339 
it's not quite enough you can always
duplicate<00:05:02.000> this<00:05:02.750> layer<00:05:03.520> by<00:05:04.520> right<00:05:05.349> clicking

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
duplicate this layer by right clicking

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.790 
duplicate this layer by right clicking
and<00:05:06.680> choose<00:05:07.250> duplicate<00:05:07.940> layer<00:05:08.620> it'll<00:05:09.620> double

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
and choose duplicate layer it'll double

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.409 
and choose duplicate layer it'll double
the<00:05:10.070> effect<00:05:10.430> if<00:05:10.669> that's<00:05:10.970> what<00:05:11.150> you're<00:05:11.300> after

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
the effect if that's what you're after

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.990 
the effect if that's what you're after
that<00:05:11.720> looks<00:05:11.840> like<00:05:11.990> a<00:05:12.200> little<00:05:12.500> bit<00:05:12.620> too<00:05:12.800> much<00:05:13.000> to

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
that looks like a little bit too much to

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.020 
that looks like a little bit too much to
me<00:05:14.180> but<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.840> can<00:05:15.050> lower<00:05:15.349> it<00:05:15.590> bring<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.550> back<00:05:16.700> up<00:05:16.880> a

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
me but I can lower it bring it back up a

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.390 
me but I can lower it bring it back up a
little<00:05:17.289> okay<00:05:18.289> that's<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:18.710> let's<00:05:18.919> check<00:05:19.220> the

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
little okay that's it let's check the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.630 
little okay that's it let's check the
before<00:05:19.729> the<00:05:19.880> after<00:05:20.680> that's<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.830> before<00:05:22.039> and

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
before the after that's the before and

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.110 
before the after that's the before and
that's<00:05:23.539> the<00:05:23.720> after<00:05:23.840> and<00:05:24.520> actually<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.880> me<00:05:26.000> it

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
that's the after and actually to me it

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.120 
that's the after and actually to me it
looks<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.570> little<00:05:26.900> bit<00:05:27.140> too<00:05:27.380> orange<00:05:27.860> so<00:05:28.010> I'll

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
looks a little bit too orange so I'll

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.279 
looks a little bit too orange so I'll
probably<00:05:28.370> take<00:05:28.760> that<00:05:29.000> layer<00:05:29.210> off<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:30.050> that's

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
probably take that layer off and that's

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.040 
probably take that layer off and that's
the<00:05:30.470> before<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:31.070> that's<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.460> after<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:33.020> can
