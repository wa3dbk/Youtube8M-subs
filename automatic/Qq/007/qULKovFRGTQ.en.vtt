00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.469
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.769
 find you for a new video 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.010
 so it's going to be a video about 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.330
 elf products 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.820
 because in fact I had the opportunity 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.530
 thanks to the site October 10,2 to test 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.580
 elf products but actually I got 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.660
 says that at the same time I had for you 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 do a little review on all 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.990
 jay products because actually I'm 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.980
 a big fan of this brand and the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.900
 I wanted a little bit 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.789
 show all that I have and tell you 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.289
 my opinion on these products so everything 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.399
 first i'm going to show you what oct 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:44.190
 lima so send in fact he sent me 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:46.500
 So seven aces and futures are here and my 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.410
 show off a liner if their so if I have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.050
 well understood actually a year ago you 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.489
 kiffez anti-dark circles base and that's it 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.100
 does it serve to keep the pranks 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.340
 and a base in fact I tried them and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 actually it was a bit of a flop 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.369
 because I find that the first time 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.750
 so the kind of concealer I find 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.180
 that he's not covering enough so me 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.610
 it does not suit me and then the base - 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.260
 for me I do not find it super useful I 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.630
 located on the lower eyelids balm 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 it works much better than that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.310
 so on that it was a little bit a 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 flop which I do not recommend next 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.340
 so they sent me some shade to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.420
 mineral eyelids we stalled one that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.610
 was blue like that the duck that my faith 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.759
 I thought it was super nice I liked a lot 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.460
 the color was really petty finally 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.750
 I really like the color and it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:54.390
 also sent me a fed up we play the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:57.240
 show this one like that but in fact I 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.650
 try them and I do not like the clae 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.780
 whether eye shadows 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.430
 mineral because I find that suddenly 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.110
 it's a bit complicated to use 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.530
 at the end of time to be everywhere the matter 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.630
 she is really volatile and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.970
 I do not recommend it either 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.920
 I'm not too ugly but they have me 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.069
 also sent to a brush so it's this 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:22.989
 brush there is the smash bros 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:25.239
 that's it I tried it too 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.760
 not bad but I find it a pity that 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.620
 the stoves is as short in fact 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.360
 because suddenly we can not really 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.010
 work the lighthouses so it's a 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.739
 little pity they did the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.390
 poles also common so that one good I 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.950
 do not really recommend and insult you 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.230
 a last product that sent me there 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.040
 sent me this palette the theme 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.959
 corrective powder and this one by 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.850
 against that was really a shot of 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.280
 heart I loved so in fact this 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.300
 palette it looks like this 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.670
 so in fact you have the little mirror 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.780
 and so you have four lighthouses because 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.730
 that when the hand like that I got 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.880
 what is that thing for nothing and 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.040
 everything is in fact when you mix the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.019
 everything and you put on your face 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.430
 well it's really great because it 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.590
 removes imperfections end it's 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.570
 really a super super powder hours 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.209
 and so I recommend it so you so 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.700
 it'll go to my student products because 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.130
 that I still have a lot so everything 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.170
 first talk about brush so there 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.730
 has 3 kg of elf that I love 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.090
 really a lot is there first of all 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.130
 the Maltese ls on board and two pins 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.290
 this one makes me I know it I'm 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.900
 serve as a mixer brush because it 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.030
 is conical and I really like 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.459
 really really much this brush and 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.519
 in the same studio range I have the mlf 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.750
 mineral powder pin this one is him 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.420
 I actually use it pretty much for 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.640
 all for the blush for the foundation 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.709
 in powder and what I really like 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.299
 a lot in his brushes is that they 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.450
 do not lose their weight at all 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.220
 I had brushes sephora nocibe 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.739
 all this every time I wash them and 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.630
 finally they lose their hair all that you 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.340
 there I wash them with shampoo to lodge 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.950
 let dry end it's been years I 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.780
 have them his brushes there and he 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.340
 it's been a long time that lasts and he 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.510
 there are no hairs that leave so 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.010
 really it's really brushes of 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.379
 quality this I recommend them 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.050
 really then the last one 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.209
 brush that I have this one actually 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.250
 I had it with a kit it is 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.669
 leave it's the anti kit 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.780
 imperfections of elf and in fact I 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.490
 do not use for the same thing 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.810
 this one I use rather like for the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.160
 eyeshadows actually because I 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.660
 find that precisely the hairs are 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.440
 long enough that he is very very well what 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.870
 brush for that and against this one 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.940
 I use with his brush instead 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.830
 because I find that the little brush 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.440
 it's not practical enough that I use 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.630
 with this big brush and me this powder 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.669
 mineral is really my favorite 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.800
 she is really but she is really 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.770
 too well in addition this range the ccl 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.750
 especially for the fne and so ben 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.850
 it lets the skin breathe and where end 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.930
 this one I really thought it really 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.410
 really this mineral powder 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.169
 she is very well taken 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.440
 then so speaking of a I have not 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.360
 bad of poor also elf so there for 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.300
 that I love that I put all the time and 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:16.260
 everything is the clarified flf precedes 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.419
 powered powder among me so I 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.130
 hear you see there is in that 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.229
 I like it is that it is a fund of 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.520
 dyed but powdered you see I have 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.160
 almost later I'm there all the time 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.020
 and two actually there is a little sponge 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.729
 and in fact you just have to then to 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.169
 take your material and put it on 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.460
 your skin there you have perfection and 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.570
 what is not bad is that suddenly we 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.520
 does not need meters of foundation 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.080
 and in front of where there is no infection 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.560
 because for example me I do not have any 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.560
 your cheeks will do it without me 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.910
 it's not just the corner of the nose here and the 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.870
 amount that I have buttons so the 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.160
 In fact, I think it's 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.960
 really a very good alternative 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.090
 what this range also is made for 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.099
 acne so blow me bah it adds me 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.660
 no buttons and I finally pray wants 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.340
 not do without it so that I have the 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.950
 strongly recommend to really go 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.690
 very very well this powder by cons 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.190
 I also ordered a powder for 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.870
 the colors summer hated this one and I had 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.280
 been a little disappointed because the color me 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.330
 not suitable for breastfeeding too dark 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.370
 so it's a bit of my fault 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.249
 if you have fair skin like me 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.449
 you really recommend it 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:16.449
 because it is really too deep 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:20.109
 it is then 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:22.899
 so this is the alcover stick of 

00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:24.999
 hull fc this little stick there I have the 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:26.979
 light beige color and I find it 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:31.479
 suits me perfectly I use a 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:33.639
 eyelid concealer and 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.529
 correcting stick it's really very 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.149
 very well and so this one I you the 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.679
 strongly advises especially that in addition to it 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:40.589
 is also done for the key so this is 

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:42.369
 top 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:43.809
 then other products that 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:47.079
 I love so at elf 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:49.389
 it's small sponges so small and 

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:52.389
 eat without really really good but 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:55.509
 in fact it is there I had them and and of 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.949
 blow I can reuse them very 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:01.269
 long effects are really very very 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:03.819
 well then a parent of imperfections 

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:05.169
 in there is a product against that 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:09.669
 I did not like a flop 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:11.169
 it's the students if you're scared that's it 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.359
 did at first I found it well because 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:14.469
 that ben he finally dry me the buttons 

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:16.149
 all because it was the basic one 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:17.919
 of titles ea end is this range not 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:19.749
 poorly natural the formula is all it was 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.889
 not very expensive then I realized 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:22.449
 actually after a while my 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.799
 skin got used it makes me nothing 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:27.209
 so suddenly now I feel a 

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:30.219
 a little flop so I do not recommend it 

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:32.529
 then bluff from elf 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:35.139
 so me it's the candid color 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:38.229
 choral and I find that blush but 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.879
 it is beautiful I find you and 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.519
 prompted the latest products and letters 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.919
 it's one of their lipsticks so 

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:47.199
 that's what I'm telling you no nonsense 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:49.179
 the fleury fuchsia so it's this one to 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:50.229
 fashion and that's the one I wear 

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:52.029
 currently and I like them a lot 

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.199
 because it's really natural and 

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:55.269
 so this one I recommend it to you 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:57.849
 he is really too much too much 

00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:58.689
 so that's so it was a title seen on
