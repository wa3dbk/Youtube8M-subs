maintenance<00:00:07.670> discussion<00:00:08.420> on<00:00:08.570> a<00:00:08.600> vent<00:00:08.990> chain

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
maintenance discussion on a vent chain

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.040 
maintenance discussion on a vent chain
how<00:00:10.340> it<00:00:10.490> happens<00:00:10.820> how<00:00:11.120> to<00:00:11.180> recognize<00:00:11.690> when<00:00:11.719> it

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
how it happens how to recognize when it

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.740 
how it happens how to recognize when it
happens<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:12.770> what<00:00:13.430> to<00:00:13.550> do<00:00:13.670> if<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:14.030> does<00:00:14.210> happen

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
happens and what to do if it does happen

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.589 
happens and what to do if it does happen
so<00:00:15.380> last<00:00:15.980> week<00:00:16.100> on<00:00:16.369> a<00:00:16.400> ride<00:00:16.640> I<00:00:16.670> drop<00:00:17.150> a<00:00:17.180> chain

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
so last week on a ride I drop a chain

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.320 
so last week on a ride I drop a chain
and<00:00:18.430> it<00:00:19.430> was<00:00:19.550> only<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:19.820> second<00:00:20.180> time<00:00:20.270> I've

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
and it was only the second time I've

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.320 
and it was only the second time I've
ever<00:00:20.480> dropped<00:00:20.900> a<00:00:21.020> chain<00:00:21.289> on<00:00:21.500> my<00:00:21.860> narrow<00:00:22.250> wide<00:00:22.550> 1

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
ever dropped a chain on my narrow wide 1

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.080 
ever dropped a chain on my narrow wide 1
by<00:00:23.510> 10<00:00:23.810> setup<00:00:24.230> on<00:00:24.350> my<00:00:24.380> mountain<00:00:24.770> bike<00:00:24.850> so<00:00:25.850> put

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
by 10 setup on my mountain bike so put

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.779 
by 10 setup on my mountain bike so put
the<00:00:26.150> chain<00:00:26.360> back<00:00:26.570> on<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.320> started<00:00:28.160> riding<00:00:28.580> and

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
the chain back on and started riding and

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.570 
the chain back on and started riding and
the<00:00:29.690> bike<00:00:29.900> was<00:00:29.930> it<00:00:30.440> was<00:00:30.980> almost<00:00:31.130> like<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:31.430> was

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
the bike was it was almost like it was

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.910 
the bike was it was almost like it was
trying<00:00:31.760> to<00:00:31.910> go<00:00:32.510> and<00:00:33.379> so<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.770> way<00:00:33.890> that

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
trying to go and so the way that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.369 
trying to go and so the way that
you<00:00:34.160> can<00:00:34.280> recognize<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:35.090> it'll<00:00:35.420> you'll<00:00:35.780> it's

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
you can recognize this it'll you'll it's

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.200 
you can recognize this it'll you'll it's
kind<00:00:36.620> of<00:00:36.710> cyclical<00:00:37.130> so<00:00:37.280> it'll<00:00:37.430> be<00:00:37.550> smooth<00:00:37.880> and

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
kind of cyclical so it'll be smooth and

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.569 
kind of cyclical so it'll be smooth and
then<00:00:38.390> it'll<00:00:38.540> kind<00:00:38.989> of<00:00:39.079> skip<00:00:39.590> it'll<00:00:40.190> be<00:00:40.309> smooth

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
then it'll kind of skip it'll be smooth

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.729 
then it'll kind of skip it'll be smooth
and<00:00:40.850> it'll<00:00:41.059> skip<00:00:41.329> kind<00:00:41.630> of<00:00:41.720> in<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.260> back<00:00:42.440> cog

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
and it'll skip kind of in the back cog

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.170 
and it'll skip kind of in the back cog
like<00:00:43.010> it's<00:00:43.190> trying<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.460> jump<00:00:43.670> out<00:00:43.820> of<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:43.940> COG

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
like it's trying to jump out of the COG

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.060 
like it's trying to jump out of the COG
so<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:45.020> know<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.230> first<00:00:45.440> thing<00:00:45.590> I<00:00:45.710> did<00:00:45.920> was

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
so you know the first thing I did was

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.920 
so you know the first thing I did was
just<00:00:46.460> make<00:00:46.700> sure<00:00:47.090> my<00:00:47.239> rear<00:00:47.420> derailleur<00:00:47.750> was

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
just make sure my rear derailleur was

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.229 
just make sure my rear derailleur was
adjusted<00:00:48.380> properly<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.040> kind<00:00:50.000> of<00:00:50.030> pulled

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
adjusted properly and kind of pulled

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.910 
adjusted properly and kind of pulled
over<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.600> make<00:00:50.690> sure<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:50.930> cable<00:00:51.290> was<00:00:51.500> was

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
over and make sure the cable was was

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.950 
over and make sure the cable was was
right<00:00:52.489> he<00:00:52.760> was<00:00:52.850> shifting<00:00:53.300> good<00:00:53.540> up<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:53.840> down

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
right he was shifting good up and down

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.229 
right he was shifting good up and down
kept<00:00:54.950> pedaling<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.520> it<00:00:55.640> kept<00:00:55.850> making<00:00:56.120> that

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
kept pedaling and it kept making that

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.240 
kept pedaling and it kept making that
noise<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.450> then<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:56.989> finally<00:00:57.379> occurred<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:58.129> me

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
noise and then it finally occurred to me

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.150 
noise and then it finally occurred to me
what<00:00:58.460> probably<00:00:58.820> happened<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.930> it's<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:01.039> have

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
what probably happened and it's you have

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.590 
what probably happened and it's you have
to<00:01:01.309> get<00:01:01.430> off<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.700> bike<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.030> look<00:01:02.180> at<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:02.480> you

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
to get off the bike and look at it you

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.790 
to get off the bike and look at it you
can't<00:01:02.780> just<00:01:02.960> look<00:01:03.079> down<00:01:03.289> at<00:01:03.410> your<00:01:03.500> chain

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
can't just look down at your chain

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.380 
can't just look down at your chain
because<00:01:04.129> if<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:04.399> is<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> whole<00:01:04.850> chain<00:01:05.180> on<00:01:05.330> a

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
because if this is a whole chain on a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.469 
because if this is a whole chain on a
bike<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.869> it's<00:01:06.170> kind<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.350> difficult<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.830> spot

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
bike and it's kind of difficult to spot

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.270 
bike and it's kind of difficult to spot
and<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.690> can<00:01:08.840> see<00:01:09.050> it<00:01:09.170> right<00:01:09.350> there<00:01:09.380> just

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
and so you can see it right there just

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.020 
and so you can see it right there just
how<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.850> link<00:01:11.090> is<00:01:11.240> bent<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.369> so<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.700> looked<00:01:13.940> at

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
how that link is bent and so I looked at

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.359 
how that link is bent and so I looked at
the<00:01:14.090> change<00:01:14.330> sure<00:01:14.539> enough<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.899> was<00:01:15.020> bent<00:01:15.369> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
the change sure enough it was bent and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.520 
the change sure enough it was bent and
so<00:01:16.580> what<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:17.240> have<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.420> do<00:01:17.660> when<00:01:17.929> that<00:01:18.020> happens

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
so what you have to do when that happens

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.980 
so what you have to do when that happens
is<00:01:19.720> you<00:01:20.720> have<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:21.080> pull<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.560> pin<00:01:21.950> out<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:23.240> you

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
is you have to pull that pin out and you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.359 
is you have to pull that pin out and you
have<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.229> have<00:01:24.319> a<00:01:24.380> chain<00:01:24.619> tool<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.099> that's<00:01:25.220> why

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
have to have a chain tool so that's why

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.919 
have to have a chain tool so that's why
it's<00:01:25.520> really<00:01:25.670> good<00:01:25.789> to<00:01:26.060> carry<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.330> chain<00:01:26.630> tool

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
it's really good to carry a chain tool

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.809 
it's really good to carry a chain tool
when<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:27.619> ride<00:01:27.800> because<00:01:28.069> you<00:01:28.429> never<00:01:28.580> know

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
when you ride because you never know

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.999 
when you ride because you never know
when<00:01:29.060> something<00:01:29.270> like<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.539> can<00:01:29.869> happen<00:01:30.009> and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
when something like that can happen and

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.370 
when something like that can happen and
so<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.789> have<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:32.000> take<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.209> whole<00:01:32.479> link<00:01:32.869> out<00:01:33.080> so

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
so you have to take a whole link out so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.699 
so you have to take a whole link out so
a<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.890> wide<00:01:34.459> and<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.450> narrow<00:01:35.660> that's<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.110> 1<00:01:36.500> hole

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
a a wide and a narrow that's a 1 hole

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.010 
a a wide and a narrow that's a 1 hole
link<00:01:37.069> right<00:01:37.429> there<00:01:37.459> and<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.750> obviously

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
link right there and so you obviously

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.410 
link right there and so you obviously
have<00:01:39.349> to<00:01:39.440> take<00:01:39.590> out<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.860> bent<00:01:40.069> portion<00:01:40.520> when

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
have to take out the bent portion when

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.059 
have to take out the bent portion when
you<00:01:41.509> do<00:01:41.630> this<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.080> trail<00:01:42.319> you<00:01:42.349> got<00:01:42.709> to<00:01:42.860> make

you do this on the trail you got to make
real<00:01:43.849> sure<00:01:43.880> that<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.899> don't<00:01:45.170> back<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.830> pin

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
real sure that you don't back the pin

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.440 
real sure that you don't back the pin
out<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.520> part<00:01:46.789> that's<00:01:46.970> staying<00:01:47.209> on<00:01:47.360> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
out on the part that's staying on the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.419 
out on the part that's staying on the
bike<00:01:47.599> the<00:01:47.810> pin<00:01:48.050> this<00:01:48.200> thing<00:01:48.440> on<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.950> on<00:01:49.340> the

chain that's gonna stay on the bike and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.139 
chain that's gonna stay on the bike and
you<00:01:51.200> got<00:01:51.319> to<00:01:51.440> make<00:01:51.619> sure<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.550> don't<00:01:52.729> back<00:01:52.940> that

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
you got to make sure you don't back that

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.639 
you got to make sure you don't back that
out<00:01:53.330> all<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.599> way<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:53.929> falls<00:01:54.200> out<00:01:54.440> of<00:01:54.530> that

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
out all the way and it falls out of that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.859 
out all the way and it falls out of that
link<00:01:54.890> because<00:01:55.819> you<00:01:56.209> want<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.420> be<00:01:56.509> able<00:01:56.599> to<00:01:56.720> put

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
link because you want to be able to put

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.469 
link because you want to be able to put
the<00:01:56.959> chain<00:01:57.200> back<00:01:57.229> together<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.209> be<00:01:59.209> able<00:01:59.300> to

the chain back together and be able to
push<00:01:59.720> that<00:01:59.899> pin<00:02:00.080> in<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:00.349> that<00:02:00.470> pin<00:02:00.709> falls<00:02:01.039> out

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
push that pin in it that pin falls out

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.650 
push that pin in it that pin falls out
you're<00:02:01.700> pretty<00:02:01.940> much<00:02:02.090> out<00:02:02.330> of<00:02:02.390> luck<00:02:02.599> when

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
you're pretty much out of luck when

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.449 
you're pretty much out of luck when
you're<00:02:02.929> out<00:02:03.020> on<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.200> trail<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.679> then<00:02:04.340> you

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
you're out on the trail and then you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.160 
you're out on the trail and then you
would<00:02:04.550> have<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.789> try<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.030> do<00:02:05.270> another<00:02:05.599> link<00:02:05.929> and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
would have to try to do another link and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.839 
would have to try to do another link and
then<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.950> chain<00:02:07.190> starting<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.580> get<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.700> little

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
then the chain starting to get a little

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.050 
then the chain starting to get a little
bit<00:02:07.940> too<00:02:08.119> short<00:02:08.149> at<00:02:08.599> that<00:02:08.780> point<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.130> again

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
bit too short at that point and so again

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.729 
bit too short at that point and so again
you<00:02:11.540> know<00:02:11.660> make<00:02:11.810> sure<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:11.959> carry<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.380> chain

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
you know make sure you carry a chain

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.570 
you know make sure you carry a chain
tool<00:02:13.069> another<00:02:14.110> important<00:02:15.110> thing<00:02:15.349> is<00:02:15.409> to

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
tool another important thing is to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.370 
tool another important thing is to
just<00:02:16.850> know<00:02:17.210> how<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.420> do<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.170> that's<00:02:18.290> why

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
just know how to do this and that's why

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.320 
just know how to do this and that's why
I<00:02:18.410> always<00:02:18.830> recommend<00:02:18.980> doing<00:02:19.430> some<00:02:19.730> basic<00:02:19.940> bite

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
I always recommend doing some basic bite

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.230 
I always recommend doing some basic bite
your<00:02:21.140> own<00:02:21.170> bike<00:02:21.410> maintenance<00:02:21.620> at<00:02:21.950> home<00:02:22.240> so

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
your own bike maintenance at home so

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.330 
your own bike maintenance at home so
that<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.810> know<00:02:23.960> how<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.170> do<00:02:24.350> this<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.800> whenever

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
that you know how to do this so whenever

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.120 
that you know how to do this so whenever
it<00:02:25.460> comes<00:02:25.580> time<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.880> change<00:02:26.270> your<00:02:26.390> chain<00:02:26.980> do<00:02:27.980> it

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
it comes time to change your chain do it

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.280 
it comes time to change your chain do it
yourself<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.690> how<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.930> do<00:02:30.140> that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
yourself so that you know how to do that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.320 
yourself so that you know how to do that
you<00:02:30.530> know<00:02:30.650> how<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.920> get<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.280> pen<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.790> wear<00:02:31.910> you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
you know how to get that pen to wear you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.060 
you know how to get that pen to wear you
know<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.660> backs<00:02:32.900> out<00:02:33.170> just<00:02:33.620> far<00:02:33.860> enough

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
know just backs out just far enough

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.130 
know just backs out just far enough
where<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> chain<00:02:34.580> will<00:02:34.730> come<00:02:34.880> apart<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.390> and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
where the chain will come apart and and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.110 
where the chain will come apart and and
but<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.650> stays<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.310> link<00:02:37.520> now<00:02:37.850> usually

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
but it stays in that link now usually

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.570 
but it stays in that link now usually
this<00:02:38.540> happens<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.530> when<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.130> happened<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.460> me

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
this happens like when it happened to me

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.050 
this happens like when it happened to me
is<00:02:40.700> when<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:40.880> drop<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.600> change<00:02:42.730> I've<00:02:43.730> had<00:02:43.940> this

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
is when you drop a change I've had this

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.450 
is when you drop a change I've had this
happen<00:02:44.240> twice<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.990> both<00:02:45.290> times<00:02:45.650> when<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.130> drop

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
happen twice in both times when I drop

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.150 
happen twice in both times when I drop
the<00:02:46.610> chain<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.480> if<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.900> ever<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.380> drop<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.770> chain

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the chain so if you ever do drop a chain

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.980 
the chain so if you ever do drop a chain
or<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.520> think<00:02:49.880> it's<00:02:50.060> dropped<00:02:50.390> make<00:02:50.690> sure<00:02:50.840> you

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
or you think it's dropped make sure you

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.840 
or you think it's dropped make sure you
stop<00:02:51.470> pedaling<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.010> look<00:02:52.190> down<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.580> see<00:02:52.760> if

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
stop pedaling and look down and see if

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.850 
stop pedaling and look down and see if
it's<00:02:53.000> off<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.330> chain<00:02:53.510> ring<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.840> if<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.709> is

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
it's off the chain ring and if it is

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.710 
it's off the chain ring and if it is
stop<00:02:55.190> pedaling<00:02:55.610> immediately<00:02:56.270> they'll<00:02:56.480> try<00:02:56.660> to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
stop pedaling immediately they'll try to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.960 
stop pedaling immediately they'll try to
pedal<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.500> didn't<00:02:57.740> know<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.070> was<00:02:58.220> off<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.640> started

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
pedal I didn't know it was off I started

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.020 
pedal I didn't know it was off I started
pedaling<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.600> then<00:03:00.440> realized<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:01.459> was<00:03:01.610> off<00:03:01.790> so

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
pedaling and then realized it was off so

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.600 
pedaling and then realized it was off so
somehow<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.540> got<00:03:02.690> bent<00:03:03.350> when<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.709> did<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.070> so

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
somehow it got bent when I did that so

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.740 
somehow it got bent when I did that so
