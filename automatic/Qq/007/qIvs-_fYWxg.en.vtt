00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.699

 to make our moms feel 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.360
 very spoiled this May 10 we go 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.879
 to make them a delicious breakfast that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.760
 besides everything is very nutritious and low 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.000
 in fat this Monday a fried egg 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.739
 and vegetables that the truth is that it is very 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 easy to make and also super 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.360
 super rich can combine it with a 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.730
 orange juice maybe or with some 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.570
 drink preference mom and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.450
 very simple 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.690
 let's see how it's done and right now we're going 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.970
 to need salt chives onion garlic 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.890
 eggs, peppers and olive oil 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.110
 also a muffin tray a 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.240
 pan and a mold let's start 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.369
 Chopping our peppers in squares 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.680
 very small this projection 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.050
 depending on how much pepper or how much 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.729
 vegetable hills you can get creative and 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.009
 You can also add another type of 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.990
 vegetables that you like now we are going to 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.270
 split a little onion to give 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.440
 taste and we're also going to put a 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.440
 little chive 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.490
 finally and to season we are going to take 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.039
 a clove of garlic and we're just going to cut 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.439
 a thin sheet first let's put 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.329
 the vegetables in the frying pan sautÃ© and 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.640
 then the garlic clove so that it does not 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.250
 burn 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 let's open all our eggs in 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.280
 this case I use 6 and I reached for 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.250
 8 servings and we're going to beat them too 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.190
 with a little salt we will use 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.250
 a little juice of a lemon and also 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.410
 milk to make them more creamy we are going to 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.810
 beat all this very well and then the 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.390
 We will place in our mold 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.890
 moving previously greased with a 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.890
 napkin and olive oil 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.439
 now we are going to add 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.900
 one of our molds a small 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.930
 portion of vegetables and we will see that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.760
 they explode and well distributed we are going to 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.689
 bake for 25 minutes at 175 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.689
 degrees and ready 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.140
 Well, I was there, video, I hope that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.000
 they really liked the truth is 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.459
 which I think so is quite simple 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.930
 do anything else you have to have things and 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.060
 Well, if you are very young, ask for the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.340
 supervision of an adult that can be 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.829
 your dad or maybe an older brother who 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.659
 help you do this then it takes you 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.359

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.769
