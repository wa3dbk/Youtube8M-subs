00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
really like is that cabling will have

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
really like is that cabling will have
differing<00:00:46.079> styles<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.680> course<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.160> not

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

Ayatollah<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> thing<00:01:08.790> about<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.210> ditto

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
Ayatollah now the thing about this ditto

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.100 
Ayatollah now the thing about this ditto
is<00:01:10.159> who<00:01:11.159> gets<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> meet<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.450> top<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
is who gets to meet on top of the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.530 
is who gets to meet on top of the
hierarchy<00:01:13.260> k<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.040> gets<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> spike<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.970> lot<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
hierarchy k and gets the spike a lot of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.570 
hierarchy k and gets the spike a lot of
the<00:01:15.630> time<00:01:15.810> yeah<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> say<00:01:17.220> DK

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the time yeah I have about to say DK

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
the time yeah I have about to say DK
seems<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.060> he<00:01:18.180> does<00:01:18.390> really<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.930> against

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
seems like he does really good against

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.850 
seems like he does really good against
DK<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.920> he's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> net<00:01:20.490> advantage<00:01:21.860> tables

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
DK when he's a net advantage tables

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
DK when he's a net advantage tables
punches<00:01:23.250> down<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:23.820> means<00:01:24.030> he<00:01:24.180> doesn't<00:01:24.450> have

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
punches down which means he doesn't have

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
punches down which means he doesn't have
the<00:01:24.659> same<00:01:24.869> landing<00:01:25.380> security<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> till<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the same landing security but it till is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.429 
the same landing security but it till is
not<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.299> applying<00:01:27.570> any<00:01:27.780> pressure<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.380> I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
not really applying any pressure and I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.840 
not really applying any pressure and I
think<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.799> pretty<00:01:28.950> much<00:01:29.159> was<00:01:29.340> costing<00:01:29.729> him

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
think that's pretty much was costing him

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.060 
think that's pretty much was costing him
the<00:01:30.060> central<00:01:30.780> bar<00:01:30.960> Cable<00:01:31.290> has<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> pretty

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the central bar Cable has a pretty

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.880 
the central bar Cable has a pretty
sizable<00:01:32.820> lead<00:01:32.939> even<00:01:33.869> though<00:01:33.990> DK<00:01:34.259> killed<00:01:34.619> early

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
sizable lead even though DK killed early

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.640 
sizable lead even though DK killed early
DK<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> heavy<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.850> early<00:01:36.630> against<00:01:37.049> DK<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.409> not

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
DK is heavy so early against DK is not

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.020 
DK is heavy so early against DK is not
the<00:01:37.799> same<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.100> early<00:01:38.400> against<00:01:38.640> say<00:01:38.790> Meta

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the same as early against say Meta

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.340 
the same as early against say Meta

take risks like that so like I mean of

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.090 
take risks like that so like I mean of
course<00:02:53.960> if<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.260> let<00:02:54.410> us<00:02:54.530> like<00:02:54.680> its<00:02:54.860> formidable

it occurring is just so low and you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.550 
it occurring is just so low and you
there's<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.400> many<00:03:01.550> more<00:03:01.910> things<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.900> can

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
there's so many more things that you can

for<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.520> punch<00:03:10.700> there

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
for the punch there

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.640 
for the punch there
I<00:03:11.150> think<00:03:11.600> cable<00:03:11.870> just<00:03:12.020> needs<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.290> start<00:03:12.470> using

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
I think cable just needs to start using

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.500 
I think cable just needs to start using
some<00:03:12.740> more<00:03:12.980> standard<00:03:13.310> throws<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.820> be<00:03:13.910> honest<00:03:14.210> I

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
some more standard throws to be honest I

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.350 
some more standard throws to be honest I
just<00:03:15.200> get<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.680> up<00:03:15.800> throw<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.100> there<00:03:16.360> yeah
