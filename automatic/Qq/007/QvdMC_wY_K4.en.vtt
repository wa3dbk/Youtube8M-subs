00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.233
 This is a small plate on a fan 

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:19.800
 Painted by Lian Kai in the first part of the thirteenth century. Today they are installed as an album in an album 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.266
 Imagine a poet's tour in the swamps, 

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:29.000
 Across the river there is a small dam, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.667
 And some drawn lines to a distant peak. 

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:42.867
 It is a very light and very empty assortment. The theme of the painting is controversial, 

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:49.667
 But the method of treatment is very exceptional. Many of the paintings in that period used many empty spaces, 

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:56.000
 But if you look at it well, you'll find a line in the middle of the formation. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 There is actually a huge rock behind him. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.567
 I think there is a metaphor for it, 

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.734
 Reflects the psychological weight 

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:14.000
 Go down it. This type of modulation is related 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.567
 In many cases 

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:28.333
 An important judicial minister devoted himself to the nation and to the ruler, but because of a rumor that was denied 

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:33.667
 He drowned himself in the river to prove his loyalty. 

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.667
 Lian Kai used this rock 

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:37.533
 The huge dangling 

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:42.767
 Above to express his poetic state. 

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:46.233
 Lian Kay may have felt connected to the old poet. 

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:53.367
 Lian was a court painter briefly, but something happened. 

00:01:53.367 --> 00:02:00.634
 He went to live in a Buddhist temple, and was drawn there in the framework of Buddhist thought 

00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:06.334
 The deceptive nature of phenomena. It exploits the deceptive nature 

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:12.667
 For what can be seen on the surface, 

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:16.500
 And that the truth may be behind the clouds, behind the fog.
