there

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.939 
there
although<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> internals<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.529> been<00:00:19.650> totally

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
although the internals have been totally

2-inch diameter 24 inch insert from a
cherry<00:00:26.369> bomb<00:00:26.550> muffler<00:00:27.140> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> stuff

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
cherry bomb muffler this is the stuff

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.580 
cherry bomb muffler this is the stuff
that<00:00:28.619> comes<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> stock<00:00:29.460> exhaust<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:30.590> little

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590

that comes in the stock exhaust a little
job<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:32.040> right<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.489> my<00:00:32.610> hand<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
job you do right here in my hand it's a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.090 
job you do right here in my hand it's a
catalytic<00:00:33.510> converter<00:00:33.890> everything<00:00:34.890> kind<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
catalytic converter everything kind of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.810 
catalytic converter everything kind of
flows<00:00:35.340> through<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.750> flow<00:00:36.750> through<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.170> end

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
flows through that flow through this end

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.160 
flows through that flow through this end
flows<00:00:38.820> into<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.510> chamber<00:00:39.930> right

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
flows into this little chamber right

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.600 
flows into this little chamber right
here<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.600> chamber<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:44.219> how<00:00:44.430> well

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
here and in the chamber I know how well

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.090 
here and in the chamber I know how well
we<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.860> but<00:00:47.149> in<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.690> chamber

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
we can see in there but in that chamber

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.560 
we can see in there but in that chamber
you'll<00:00:50.100> see<00:00:52.309> where<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> stop<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.910> stops<00:00:54.210> about

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you'll see where the stop it stops about

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.750 
you'll see where the stop it stops about
halfway<00:00:54.989> through<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.680> goes<00:00:56.280> through<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:56.610> inch

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
halfway through and goes through an inch

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360 
halfway through and goes through an inch
and<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> half<00:00:57.000> diameter<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> has<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and a half diameter and then it has to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.770 
and a half diameter and then it has to
come<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.699> has<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> reverse<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:00.539> back

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
come in has to reverse and go back

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.540 
come in has to reverse and go back
through<00:01:01.020> another<00:01:01.289> inch<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> half<00:01:01.920> actually

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
through another inch and a half actually

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.899 
through another inch and a half actually
inch<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.149> 3/8<00:01:03.510> diameter<00:01:03.809> tube<00:01:04.729> exiting<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
inch and 3/8 diameter tube exiting the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.929 
inch and 3/8 diameter tube exiting the
tailpiece<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.860> somewhat<00:01:08.340> restrictive

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
tailpiece then so somewhat restrictive

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.219 
tailpiece then so somewhat restrictive
and<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> course<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.659> know<00:01:09.689> how<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.020> sounds

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and of course we all know how it sounds

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.270 
and of course we all know how it sounds
to<00:01:11.060> install<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.560> insert<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.070> cut

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to install this insert in here we cut

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
to install this insert in here we cut
this<00:01:14.400> thing<00:01:14.580> apart<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.409> back

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
this thing apart here here in the back

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.020 
this thing apart here here in the back
in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> back<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:18.680> we<00:01:19.680> modify<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.850> can

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
in the back we we modify it so we can

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
in the back we we modify it so we can
change<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.840> packing<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> actually<00:01:22.830> take

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
change the packing we can actually take

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.760 
change the packing we can actually take
those<00:01:23.100> three<00:01:23.369> screws<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.380> which<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.560> see
