00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
a few months ago I posted a video about

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.490 
a few months ago I posted a video about
my<00:00:02.850> attempts<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.330> add<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.570> card<00:00:03.899> reader<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.230> my

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
my attempts to add a card reader to my

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.829 
my attempts to add a card reader to my
vending<00:00:04.890> machine<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.460> system<00:00:06.359> worked<00:00:06.600> but

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
vending machine the system worked but

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.990 
vending machine the system worked but
the<00:00:06.990> interface<00:00:07.230> was<00:00:07.649> kind<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.010> kludgy<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.849> had

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
the interface was kind of kludgy you had

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.240 
the interface was kind of kludgy you had
to<00:00:09.120> first<00:00:09.360> scan<00:00:09.870> your<00:00:10.050> card<00:00:10.290> then<00:00:10.950> push<00:00:11.219> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250

in<00:00:18.600> order<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.930> buy<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.980> was<00:00:20.100> sold

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
in order to buy it and if it was sold

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.570 
in order to buy it and if it was sold
out<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.850> were<00:00:20.970> screwed<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> I've<00:00:23.189> changed

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
out you were screwed so I've changed

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.800 
out you were screwed so I've changed
that<00:00:23.939> allow<00:00:24.689> me<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.990> introduce<00:00:25.170> pop<00:00:26.039> card<00:00:26.340> to

and no sale is made to accomplish this

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
and no sale is made to accomplish this
feat<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.530> needed<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.340> interface<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.150> lot

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
feat I needed to interface with a lot

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780 
feat I needed to interface with a lot
more<00:01:21.659> parts<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> machine<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.400> cheapest

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
more parts of the machine the cheapest

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.990 
more parts of the machine the cheapest
way<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> add<00:01:24.360> 27<00:01:24.960> new<00:01:25.590> inputs<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.250> outputs<00:01:26.790> was

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
way to add 27 new inputs and outputs was

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.810 
way to add 27 new inputs and outputs was
to<00:01:27.180> switch<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.720> an<00:01:27.840> Arduino<00:01:28.350> mega<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:29.009> lot

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to switch to an Arduino mega a lot

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
to switch to an Arduino mega a lot
easier<00:01:30.240> than<00:01:30.420> using<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.869> bunch<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.259> shift

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
easier than using a bunch of shift

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.550 
easier than using a bunch of shift
registers<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> multiplexers<00:01:33.409> okay

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
registers and multiplexers okay

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.460 
registers and multiplexers okay
so<00:01:34.770> first<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.850> Arduino<00:01:36.329> inserts<00:01:36.840> itself<00:01:37.200> in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so first the Arduino inserts itself in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.620 
so first the Arduino inserts itself in
between<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.189> actual<00:01:38.670> buttons<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> front

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
between the actual buttons on the front

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.109 
between the actual buttons on the front
and<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.320> vendor<00:01:40.729> when<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.820> press<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and the vendor when you press a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.480 
and the vendor when you press a
selection<00:01:42.600> button<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.439> Arduino<00:01:43.890> knows<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
selection button the Arduino knows and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.480 
selection button the Arduino knows and
in<00:01:45.030> normal<00:01:45.360> cases<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.990> closes<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> relay<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
in normal cases it closes a relay and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.719 
in normal cases it closes a relay and
passes<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.090> signal<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> machine

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
passes that signal on to the machine

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.149 
passes that signal on to the machine
however<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.930> scanned<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> card<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
however if you have scanned a card the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
however if you have scanned a card the
Arduino<00:01:53.700> takes<00:01:54.030> over<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> buttons<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.470> is

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
Arduino takes over the buttons this is

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.590 
Arduino takes over the buttons this is
how<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> knows<00:01:56.130> which<00:01:56.610> selection<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.329> want

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
how it knows which selection you want

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.319 
how it knows which selection you want
once<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> selection<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.909> money<00:02:00.119> is

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
once you make a selection the money is
