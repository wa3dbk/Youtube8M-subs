00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:16.119
 server further we go network game 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:21.010
 sitting account is offline and we write any 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:30.480
 nick here let's say such nickname 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:32.890
 there we go here this way north and 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.370
 sure we need to sign up 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.480
 issue 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:45.570
 all we register are registered 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:45.570
 and then we write this command 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.750
 the team will be under the video 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.120
 team b and friend of your nickname and let's say 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.280
 initial amount per 100,000 and we transfer 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:09.040
 100,000 seconds so dear friends 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.130
 I apologize here we write the team write play 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.090
 nickname of his friend and the amount that we 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.010
 want to translate 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.090
 since the initial amount here is 100 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.270
 thousand so we bring that all 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.540
 transfer here we got the money we 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.690
 This is seen as a confirmation further. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.690
 You can certainly still a lot through different 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.370
 accounts through this 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.500
 write on register and through another 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.510
 write a register go through another 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.130
 account and so transfer but of course 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.110
 I will not do that because it is very 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.760
 a lot of time so tyschu on register 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.300
 disconnect we go again lock on 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.220
 sinning 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.700
 look for of land mines and push default 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:59.560
 turn on our nickname which was so 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:04.080
 we go further into the game and here we are in the game and 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.150
 She will write an hour closer he writes 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.370
 enter password 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.860
 register enter the password well 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.010
 register with everyone and here in the game and 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:21.670
 now our friend on the list 100 thousand 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.910
 Here it is received 200,000 since and there I 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:30.910
 I am looking for listed to set foot 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:33.130
 Here is such a way further what I tell you 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.940
 promised to show that it is not 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.760
 a series of servers with one registration go out 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.260
 From the game, I did not write that, notice I 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.070
 did not write on register 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.690
 go by another account well there is not 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:54.990
 I know this 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.200
 lol 1 2 3 2 1 so we go out and 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:04.210
 connect 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:06.040
 and look he writes the register we enter and he 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.460
 writes you exceeded the maximum number 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.410
 registrations 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.720
 here we try what he do there 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.930
 move made he writes or 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.010
 register come back home with us 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.260
 throw on spawn 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:26.830
 and we ca n't move here 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.470
 little worm ok now let's move on 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.630
 again in my account it will be 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.700
 quickly because the main admin server 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.090
 asked me to promote him a little 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.600
 strength 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.270
 so we look and we went to 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.660
 server we are already trained in a server 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:49.830
 very good big anonymous 1500 slots 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.350
 good administration is very kind and this 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.120
 as if here is one part of the best self 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:00.870
 I think that the shop is still there 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:04.560
 Here is such a part of warp pvp oh right now they will not kill 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:09.240
 so here he is further here and more sun 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.880
 what changes this here so this here 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.830
 part this here this is mine now is not about 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.610
 ship ask me bad haul 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.700
 textures 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.360
 there is a very big bear he is very 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:25.020
 beautiful on now once again on spam 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.230

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.620
 I want to show you this New Year's Eve 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.620
 Christmas tree 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.660
 so she in my opinion is on that side 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:49.080
 on the new white 0 and a server as we will not see 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:52.800
 skim much Finns from the cartoon almost 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.100
 read here finally got to the tree 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.920
 here it is so much exactly there 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.130
 the plates were and the plates sat down exactly in 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.880
 it equivalent at night here goes 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.710
 big deal when di us replenishment 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:14.250

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:18.870
