think it's called kill denied it's a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.689 
think it's called kill denied it's a
pretty<00:00:57.350> cool<00:00:57.530> game<00:00:57.710> mode<00:00:57.920> encourages<00:00:58.519> a<00:00:58.550> lot

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
pretty cool game mode encourages a lot

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.849 
pretty cool game mode encourages a lot
of<00:00:58.820> teamwork<00:00:59.000> because<00:00:59.449> if<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.989> run<00:01:00.379> as<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.559> team

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
of teamwork because if you run as a team

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.680 
of teamwork because if you run as a team
then<00:01:01.430> when<00:01:01.609> you<00:01:01.699> die<00:01:01.850> your<00:01:02.120> teammate<00:01:02.390> can<00:01:02.539> pick

up your gear dog tag and if you travel
as<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> team<00:01:04.820> then<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.059> can<00:01:05.180> pick<00:01:05.300> up<00:01:05.449> enemy<00:01:05.750> dog

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
as a team then you can pick up enemy dog

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.900 
as a team then you can pick up enemy dog
tags<00:01:06.170> sitting<00:01:06.890> in<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.100> back<00:01:07.280> camping<00:01:07.700> with<00:01:07.820> an

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
tags sitting in the back camping with an

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.910 
tags sitting in the back camping with an
m16<00:01:08.210> is<00:01:08.630> not<00:01:08.840> an<00:01:09.080> effective<00:01:09.320> way<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.590> play<00:01:09.800> this

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
m16 is not an effective way to play this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.020 
m16 is not an effective way to play this
game<00:01:10.100> type<00:01:10.340> because<00:01:10.520> you'll<00:01:10.640> never<00:01:10.670> pick<00:01:11.000> up

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
game type because you'll never pick up

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.760 
game type because you'll never pick up
dog<00:01:11.299> tags<00:01:11.570> all<00:01:11.750> you'll<00:01:11.900> do<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:12.049> get<00:01:12.290> kills<00:01:12.530> and

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
dog tags all you'll do is get kills and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.700 
dog tags all you'll do is get kills and
play<00:01:13.250> like<00:01:13.400> a<00:01:13.460> jackass<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.630> I'm<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.560> that's

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
play like a jackass so I'm so that's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.380 
play like a jackass so I'm so that's
Kill<00:01:15.920> Confirmed<00:01:15.950> it's<00:01:16.520> pretty<00:01:16.759> neat<00:01:16.939> one

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
Kill Confirmed it's pretty neat one

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.609 
Kill Confirmed it's pretty neat one
thing<00:01:17.540> I<00:01:17.600> didn't<00:01:17.900> like<00:01:17.930> about<00:01:18.049> kill<00:01:18.439> confirmed

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
thing I didn't like about kill confirmed

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.289 
thing I didn't like about kill confirmed
was<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.040> step<00:01:19.280> backwards<00:01:19.759> that<00:01:19.880> infinity

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
was the step backwards that infinity

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.420 
was the step backwards that infinity
ward<00:01:20.509> has<00:01:20.659> taken<00:01:21.110> with<00:01:21.560> their<00:01:21.799> leader<00:01:22.040> boards

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
ward has taken with their leader boards

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.580 
ward has taken with their leader boards
so<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.880> know<00:01:23.270> when<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:23.479> play<00:01:23.659> domination<00:01:24.200> it

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
so you know when you play domination it
