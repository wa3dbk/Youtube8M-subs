00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.070
 condition and is everything ok 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.770
 [music] 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:11.170
 so first there is such a booklet 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:14.160

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.050
 Chinese documentation 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.570
 further here we have the phone itself 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:27.550
 [music] 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:31.690
 several sachets oh my friends are 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.440

 32 gigabytes completely new and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.690
 he looks just a cosmic sensation 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.470
 do not convey how it looks color space 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.510
 gray you are just a space and immediately say that 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.370
 I had an iphone before this iphone 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.320
 4s I used a few 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.769
 months and screen size difference 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.700
 Of course it feels strong enough 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.680
 now let's see what we have 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.840

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.330

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.620
 such any accessories 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.320
 probably very few people need and anyway 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.390
 let's start now for inspection 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.980

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.959

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.470
 we connect charging and we include 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.450

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.510

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.250

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.830
