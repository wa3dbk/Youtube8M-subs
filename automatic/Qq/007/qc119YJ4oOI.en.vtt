00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.630
 good to all I am pose and good here you 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.880
 I bring a video for the smc forum and 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.770
 well this video is going to consist of a 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.650
 small tutorial on how to change the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.720
 multi man song is worth now you will see 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.730
 which is very simple of many people already 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.230
 will know how to do it but good several people 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.419
 they asked me how it was done and 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.460
 encouraged to do the video then we are going to 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.239
 enter the folder of good we are going to 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.239
 enter a multi bad 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.060
 and now you will see that the typical 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.430
 song in this forever 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.220
 the one that we're going to want to remove that much 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.220
 scratch us here as you see is loading 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.020
 and now you hear 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 good once we're in the multi 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.390
 man let's go to file manager 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.770
 once we are here 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.560
 to close this we're going to go to ps3 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.890
 root 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.940
 of zero hd 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.470
 in the lower case and without that voucher and here 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.530
 we will enter the multi man folder 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.520
 the s80 608 once we're here 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.020
 we enter usb dir and here we will have the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.330
 soft a good point that we have to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.369
 change worth this is the file that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.800
 we will replace and we will put our 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.960
 song 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.540
 well once we know where it is 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.980
 the file that we have to change 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.420
 we will come to the pc and connect a 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.790
 pendrive 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 here as you see I have the song that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.950
 I'm going to put a value, this is what 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.140
 we will have to do is rename the aso 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.680
 a point well here as you see we are going to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.039
 put what is on the console are in 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.710
 capitals or a point well and as you see 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.409
 if this happens to you that you still have 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.670
 in an mp3 file is that simply to 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.439
 I change the name of the of has not 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.000
 change the format if you change the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.100
 you can now change it to pendrive 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 but good in case this happens to you 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.040
 that stays in an mp3 file yet 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.920
 what we will do is come to the team 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.090
 and organize folder options and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.640
 search and we will come here to see 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.750
 and here where it puts hide extensions of 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.220
 file for known file types 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.420
 we will remove it and we will give 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.849
 accept once this is done 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.380
 we will close here and as you can see, the 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.780
 point 93 here at the end 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.780
 then we delete the mp3 point 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.139
 and now we pass to point file and we 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.359
 will say that by changing the extension of the 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.659
 file name the file can 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.370
 be unusable we give to yes and 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.049
 As you can see, it's already in a good point file 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.719
 then what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.730
 copy it let's come to our 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.730
 pendrive and we will paste 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.060
 this as I say can also be done 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.500
 from the filet and there but good for 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.180
 that is not going so we're going to do it from 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.379
 here of a pendrive that will be much 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.610
 easier once this is done 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.360
 we will take the pendrive and connect it 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.360
 to the play 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.420
 there it is connected 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.090
 it therefore we're here 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.390
 here as you see detected call will have 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.750
 this post and is the file are a 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.330
 good point 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.090
 we will copy it we will go back again 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:53.080
 right from the start 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:57.120
 I like 800 608 here it is 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.120
 yield and we will stick 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.450
 we give everything to you and you have already stuck it 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.690
 now what we will do as you see is followed 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.350
 listening to the song 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.130
 we will place it to be well 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.200
 it will be out of the multi man 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.720
 and we 'll go back in and now you'll see that 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.550
 the song is already then once 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.410
 Once this is done , we will 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:26.210
 always the song that we have put it 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.210
 whenever we enter we'll have this one 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.790
 we go back to the last 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.840
 and now you will see that the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.840
 song that I have put 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.870
 there you have it and well nothing else I hope 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.130
 that you liked this tutorial that you 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.130
 has served and until next time 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.750
