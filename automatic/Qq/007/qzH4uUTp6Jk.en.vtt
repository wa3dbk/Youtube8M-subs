00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.520
 I remember when I was little we 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.530
 we gather in this field to play soccer and 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.719
 once they gave me a ball so very very 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.150
 strong and I remember the voice of my 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.670
 sister telling me aranza get up 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.209
 Get up 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.209
 Y 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:37.340
 the field of unity with fear is for 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.150
 me a home because here we have created a 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.910
 family we are sister companions and 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.910
 as I told you a family 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.490
 one of the things that happened to me a lot is 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.130
 that when I'm about to take the 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.150
 ball 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.000
 comes a fresh air that makes me 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.630
 I'm sorry until the bones feel a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.130
 incredible emotion and I say here I am I have 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.590
 to get the ball and we have to give 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.620
 everything to win and achieve our 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.620
 objective 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.680
 Y 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.570
 the dressing room is very spacious the same 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.300
 number of players heats the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.880
 dressing room 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.010
 it is also a space that we do 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.040
 as a temple is our temple the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.380
 dressing room because it's the place where all 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.600
 we arrive with all of our with our 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.330
 emotions with our fears with 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.670
 our party projections and what 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.630
 we make one because at that time all 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.200
 So we started to dress undress 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.440
 Lend me in the cream or lend me this 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.530
 and I comb your hair there are times when you need 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.500
 be alone alone completely because 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.690
 know that in the past game to the best 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.520
 It was not so well and this is basic 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.370
 that does not go very well and you 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.590
 position is fundamental and to me always 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:33.130
 I like to stay sitting trying to 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.140
 put my mind in white 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.960
 the court is located next to the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.940
 peripheral and sometimes between the noise of 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.460
 the people the noise of the cars of the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.450
 street of your compaÃ±eras creates a 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.450
 murmur that distracts you 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.150
 they stop being moms they stop being 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.370
 students stop being doctors leave 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.560
 of being daughters of a family and some mothers 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.660
 and wives change the chip or 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.070
 automatically to stop being what 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.070
 are to be warriors 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.400
 but missing only a few minutes you know 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.400
 that you must concentrate 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.940
 what are those little seconds where 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.270
 you must plant your feet in the grass and your 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.270
 hands 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.790
 when I get down the tunnel before 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.670
 go out on the court I feel that cold that I 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.530
 walk I do not know how the bones and listen 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.810
 the cries of the public and that's when 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.810
 then you wrap yourself in the plays 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.500
 then we climb the stairs of 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.860
 concrete that lead you to the gravel to the 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.320
 gravel that is where they run from and is 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.480
 our border because you get to the lawn 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.710
 and that 's when we all are 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.710
 one and we are panthers 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.049
 when they go out to play 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.379
 and then I handed the ball to me 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.530
 partner or he threw it and she starts to 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.969
 Running is like an explosion of energy 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.030
 that energy that is flowing that goes 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:23.050
 flowing until when it crosses the line 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:27.210
 of annotation and it explodes and then it's a 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.210
 shock to me is a happiness shock 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.140
 I feel a pain a pain that is difficult 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.310
 to describe because it may sound a bit 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.920
 masochist but it's a pain 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.790
 it's a pain that I like is a pain 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.790
 battle 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.230
 I feel like I 'm burning from the pastor I feel 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.040
 like bones sometimes I get 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.040
 desacomodan 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.970
 but in the end I feel strong I feel 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.970
 strong because because I get up again 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.030
 I feel very tired but I can no longer 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.670
 sleep I'm already in my bed circling 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.670
 and thinking and coming back to 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.590
 travel in the game and being there not 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.160
 because what you feel is that need 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:32.140
 of returning here to the court to return to 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.140
 play and get back in the battle
