00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.880
 or wool very good beds gibran speaks 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.880
 me with a new theory this time 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.119
 we will talk about the power of the hero of 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.119
 the marina the legendary marin monkey of 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.150
 kart the grandfather of the protagonist has 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.849
 had great battles as achievements but 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.550
 no doubt the level of his power is very 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.939
 elevated one of the most powerful of the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.640
 it was from roger even in his old age he had a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.460
 great role in marine ford without more than 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.700
 add let's start with the power level 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.640
 from the legendary hero to my point of view 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.790
 this character is one of the strongest 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.760
 from all over the world from one piece to one 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.670
 only reason was promoted to the position of 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.550
 admiral without having a devil fruit 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.920
 that's something out of the ordinary I'll give you 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.190
 an example we know that the trio of 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.530
 admirals was very powerful capable of 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.290
 face white beard but 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.350
 let's remove the devil's fruits and the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.799
 things would change quite an example 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.799
 without your fruit versus white beard other 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.960
 out the result but garc without fruit 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.869
 the devil has such great power 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.149
 to be selected for this position 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.990
 Admirals have a power 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:31.740
 destructive huge therefore cart also 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.170
 you have it, let's take zeta as a reference 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.899
 this is an admiral who did not have 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.320
 fruit no doubt its power and its speed 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.140
 they were incredible to face it here 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.050
 sharon and enormous speed despite 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.259
 fight with such a heavy weapon and have the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.750
 disadvantage of old age ill health and all 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.979
 the navy against him caused great 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.340
 havoc 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.250
 that is the brutal power of Admiral Z 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.580
 but then how should the power of 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.220
 a marin to be considered a hero and 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.979
 even more be considered a marin 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.410
 legendary let me explain it to you with 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.049
 detail below we are of 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.019
 agreement that old age decreases quite 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.860
 the power of a character then 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.930
 let's compare a little 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.140
 when lucy fought against don jingyao 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.510
 old man the last shock was a giant 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.240
 Checked armor check piston 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.570
 from above with a light and after 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.900
 times kit battled to win him now 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.920
 ungar against don jingyao young his power 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.280
 100% defeated him by taking away a part 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.830
 of his power this is something incredible because 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.050
 It means that the blows are gard 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.500
 much more powerful than the giant 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.500
 piston of light and in third gear and not 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.959
 I exaggerate with much more powerful 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.959
 when don jingyao was falling to 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.500
 ring destroyed it completely and only 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.739
 fell slowly multiplies that power with 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.709
 much more power a young jingyao gift 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.860
 and strong besides being coated with 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.040
 check of the king's armor and check and still 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.820
 well it would not be enough can be what 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.430
 slowed down and destroyed literally now 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.350
 We know roughly an approximate 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.540
 power of his fists but 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.990
 back then he still did not exploit his 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.510
 maximum power that was just the beginning of 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.540
 the great battles he fought alive 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.210
 the confrontations against roger against 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.460
 reilly and against white beard were the 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.700
 reasons why it imposes such 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.090
 respect let's first analyze your way of 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.340
 fight we know it's not very smart 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.370
 his strong is the hand-to-hand battle 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.400
 long range uses cannonballs 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.280
 but in battle it does not present problems 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.070
 His speed and his great command of 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.340
 hacking are enough to corner 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.890
 to his rivals thanks to kobe we know the 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.130
 more detailed fighting style of cart 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.410
 then fight based on rock and txiki one 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.680
 of the most terrible fighting styles 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.440
 the one piece being the carp apprentice 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.320
 we can know that it is he who taught him 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.440
 when kobe awoke the hack and from 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.530
 observation at the Skype aysa level and 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.200
 was sent with gar to perfect it 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.510
 this tells us to gar 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.450
 this kind of hacking pretty well 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.030
 besides the hack and armor but in what 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.670
 staff I have many suspicions that 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.430
 dominates the hack and the conqueror according to 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.040
 what I have seen in one piece we have 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.860
 given to understand that the hack and the king were 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.780
 inherit is transmitted the will by the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.570
 line of blood those that are 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.610
 unhappy with what I say I invite you to 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.310
 see the chapter where the office uses 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.950
 king hacking in marine ford and pongan 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.500
 attention to what they say I will not give them for 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.740
 sitting that car has this kind of 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.790
 check but you see, you dragon have 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.400
 check of the king 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.980
 lutfi also has it come from the 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.430
 same line of blood you decide 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.340
 something that supports my theory is that roger and 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.010
 They fought constantly for 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.970
 face the greatest exponent of check 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.890
 of the king would have to have a will 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.410
 incredibly strong to support a 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.680
 melee battle against roger 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.800
 even white beard respected the power of 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.169
 Garpe the strongest man in the world 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.039
 the greatest exponent of here in the world 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.990
 they had respect for the enormous power to get 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:46.379
 being at the level of the great rivals 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.650
 of his era for this and more has earned the 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:52.379
 title of legendary marin despite his 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.789
 old age still has a position of 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.729
 respect in the marina 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:00.300
 even sengoku stopped him when aquino 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.930
 killed six for me the words of gard 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.330
 if they had weight of not having stopped 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.719
 I would have destroyed a beard here 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.599
 sick white and too badly hurt him 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:15.509
 gave a beating garp only with old age 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:18.840
 I would have enough to defeat him in 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:21.389
 that moment I do not say that easily but 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.909
 it would be a battle worth seeing in 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:27.000
 summary has a strength well above 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.520
 of the others based on rock or 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.639
 txiki enhancing its strength and its 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.550
 speed possesses two of the three types of 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:38.310
 check at a fairly high level what 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.960
 staff I lean because maybe I have 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.930
 here from the king 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.470
 Its power is incredible and it does not hurt 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.729
 he is a monk and without a doubt his will 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.340
 It is your biggest weapon 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:52.590
 thank you very much for watching this video and for 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.169
 your time subscribe if you want to listen 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.449
 a couple of my crazy theories I upload videos 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:01.220
 very often thank you very much for your time 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:01.220
