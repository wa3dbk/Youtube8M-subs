 you are perfect 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.230
 this was belatedly sonyâ€™s response to release

 maximum accuracy 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.289
 play them on screen

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.950
 control is really larger 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.400
 more impressive than winter 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.850
 he better goes round in hand 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.320

 ps button which includes consoles 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.870
 brings up the system menu 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.150
 to avoid accidental clicks 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.500
 placed in the middle of the handle 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.830
 an additional button 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.490
 recessed into the body and the select key locations 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700
 placed on the sides of the control

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.090
 about four hours 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.870
 the top of the controller is made in the form 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.780
 soft touch plastic spheres 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.550
 which may be dedicated with all

 rainbow colors 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.220
 with its help we deliver on the base

 set camera seam shanghai 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.050
 considering controller movement 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.000
 space 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.800
 and it would be nice if the engineers 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.570
 provided an opportunity 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.120
 dimming this sphere 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.180
 she blinded eyes openly 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.080
 GDP shame 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.550
 how good but after the nomination 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.550
 sony engineers talk about 100 percent 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.490
 precision 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.460
 we are comparing the possibilities of mus 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.800
 mid andrey controllers let's just say 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.490
 at times more accurately can not 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.729
 the device almost having no delays and very 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.750
 well shield moving only in 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.510
 plane 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.760
 my position 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.090
 that is, the movement of control as early or 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.960
 under it is true to ensure 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.930
 problem-free work could you need 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.710
 take care of someone 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.369
 evenly equipped 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.300
 the chamber was sewage 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.190
 the length of the televisions and the players themselves stand 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.759
 at least one and a half meters away

 Jack 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.760
 library of games for us is not too 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.769
 large and consists mainly of 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.980
 simple entertainment 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.799
 of projects 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.599
 I propose to adopt the interfax motto 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.969
 participate in various television shows 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.499
 the themes of the latter vary from 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.389
 culinary show before performing on 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.539
 dance floor 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.319
 regardless of the program you 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.309
 will be asked to perform certain 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.149
 motion controllers and 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.939
 more precisely you will do it the more 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.149
 points will turn out 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.139
 sport champions is 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.389
 Analogue the most popular all sport dzd only 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:47.819
 with a seemingly modified set of igor 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.239
 beautiful graphics 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.490
 among disciplines 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.040
 table tennis volleyball shooting out 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.479
 onion throwing disc but and so on 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.529
 they themselves will be interesting to many 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.089
 Gladiator fights 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.979
 accurately reading motion which 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.629
 provides mup creates a very 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.209
 reliably the release of this duel 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.409
 herd party 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.439
 Typically accommodating party days 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.029
 cross it even add nothing 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.409
 ministers in the style kill as much as possible we 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.939
 went off in the midst of punks or draw 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.479
 all kinds of things before time runs out 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.589
 albeit fun and annoying very 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:21.439
 quickly 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.859
 there was this essentially a public game 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.809
 from different elements he proposes to build 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.389
 tower of a given height or as high as possible 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.779
 bread break up the finished designs 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.459
 by the way there was very well demonstrating 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.449
 how accurate is the sensation of manipulation 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.889
 with virtual items this 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.629
 project a certain angle to the new 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:39.499
 level 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.219
 and therefore will be resolved 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.279
 these are variations of the famous tamagochi 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.449
 virtual animal which you can become 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.949
 mom 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.119
 feed playing with him provide no 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:49.739
 doing different tricks 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:50.999
 support by usb controller 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.450
 of course do will direct more 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.319
 diverse interesting 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.169
 but still hardly stand your 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.629
 child and that and the poet is designed precisely for 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.300
 children 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.719
 program for a long time 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.779
 she is too monotonous 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:04.799
 rail shooter for a joke 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:05.829
 one of the most attractive 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.769
 projects for playstation them for the moment 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.809
 Samara camera will not stand the scenery 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:12.529
 of the movie, and only do what 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.279
 shoot pop-ups from all 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.669
 sides of villains and treacherous bandits 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.340
 just but fun 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.759
 each is free puzzle which 2 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.110
 At first there were such a set to complete 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.279
 air figure 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.709
 but as soon as you push the button 

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:26.849
 controller 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.879
 this whole construction starts to drop 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.840
 wall plans of the team of Eugene 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.520
 who was fancifully 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.080
 architectural form 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.090
 I understand you should hold the little man 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.430
 videocontrol acts move wrong 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.349
 so the hero got to the exit 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:41.430
 and how are you 2 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.110
 interesting and unusual project 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.379
 but using ufu it is contrived 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.919
 this game can easily do without him 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.310
 sony also says that the husband can be with 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.430
 ease of use and in 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.809
 some projects for ford audience 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:54.610
 eg 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.099
 this money is in 5 or Thames 2 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.149
 but it is of course usually marketing 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.990
 cunning 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.389
 homes designed primarily on 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.870
 simple family entertainment 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.110
 tv company 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.990
 vsts 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.000
 if you already have after 6 3 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.690
 say state of mind drain you can 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.990
 apply to the screens of distant friends from now on 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.290
 and relatives
