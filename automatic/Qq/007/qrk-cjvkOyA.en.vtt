midnight<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:11.509> up<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:12.719> night<00:00:13.670> this<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.420> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
midnight and up all night this one is a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.420 
midnight and up all night this one is a
little<00:00:15.780> hard<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.199> hear<00:00:16.310> mainly<00:00:17.310> because

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
little hard to hear mainly because

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.029 
little hard to hear mainly because
there's<00:00:17.699> piano<00:00:17.970> playing<00:00:18.560> different<00:00:19.560> parts<00:00:19.830> as

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
there's piano playing different parts as

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.830 
there's piano playing different parts as
the<00:00:20.279> guitar<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:20.789> they<00:00:20.910> sound<00:00:21.240> pretty<00:00:21.480> similar

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the guitar but they sound pretty similar

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.500 
the guitar but they sound pretty similar
at<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> same<00:00:22.320> time<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.880> may<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.269> little

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
at the same time so this may be a little

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.200 
at the same time so this may be a little
off<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.260> from<00:00:25.769> what<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.099> tell<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.000> how

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
off but from what I can tell this is how

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:42.400 
off but from what I can tell this is how
it

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.080 

and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.980> repeat<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.610> few<00:00:44.730> times

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and then you just repeat it a few times

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
and then you just repeat it a few times
and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.350> pretty<00:00:46.500> much<00:00:46.589> just<00:00:46.710> playing

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and then you pretty much just playing

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.610 
and then you pretty much just playing
the<00:00:47.550> chorus<00:00:47.879> part<00:00:48.089> two<00:00:48.329> hearts<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:48.989> gone<00:00:49.199> it's

the chorus part two hearts all gone it's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:06.170 
the chorus part two hearts all gone it's
really<00:00:49.949> slow<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.460> sounds<00:00:50.699> like

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.540 

I'll<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> give<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.860> better<00:01:08.130> idea<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
I'll kind of give you a better idea of

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.460 
I'll kind of give you a better idea of
how<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.120> first<00:01:09.360> part<00:01:09.720> since<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.320> won't

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.190 
how to do that first part since I won't
have<00:01:10.620> tabs<00:01:10.800> up<00:01:10.979> right<00:01:11.250> away<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:12.750> start<00:01:12.840> with

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
have tabs up right away you start with

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.580 
have tabs up right away you start with
an<00:01:13.320> open<00:01:13.619> egg<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> goes<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.020> ten<00:01:16.320> on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590

an open egg and then it goes to a ten on
the<00:01:16.710> D<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:21.259> then<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.410> goes<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:23.280> pretty

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.660 
on the egg back to the ten on a day and
then<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.460> moved<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> seven<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.039> and<00:01:41.039> go

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
then I moved to a seven on the a and go

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.249 
then I moved to a seven on the a and go
back<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.000> town<00:01:42.300> on<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> D<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:42.930> again

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
back to that town on the D so again

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:56.000 
back to that town on the D so again
slower<00:01:43.950> it'll<00:01:44.190> sound<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.870 

after<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.040> couple<00:01:57.430> times

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
after a couple times

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.570 
after a couple times
it'll<00:01:58.119> when<00:01:58.600> you're<00:01:58.720> doing<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.020> part<00:01:59.580> you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
it'll when you're doing this part you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.430 
it'll when you're doing this part you
actually<00:02:00.729> slide<00:02:01.210> up<00:02:01.390> from<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.600> 10<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.020> 12

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
actually slide up from the 10 to the 12

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.410 
actually slide up from the 10 to the 12
I<00:02:02.560> think<00:02:02.770> it's<00:02:02.890> every<00:02:03.250> other<00:02:03.430> time<00:02:03.820> you're

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
I think it's every other time you're

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.749 
I think it's every other time you're
going<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.020> doing<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.409> part<00:02:05.680> so<00:02:06.190> just<00:02:06.460> listen

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
going and doing that part so just listen

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.010 
going and doing that part so just listen
for<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.150> you<00:02:07.210> can<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.540> can<00:02:07.570> definitely

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
for that and you can you can definitely

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.430 
for that and you can you can definitely
hear<00:02:08.200> when<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.470> happens<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.720> then<00:02:10.720> sometimes

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
hear when it happens and then sometimes

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.430 
hear when it happens and then sometimes
it<00:02:11.620> sounds<00:02:11.800> like<00:02:12.630> instead<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.690> doubling<00:02:14.110> up<00:02:14.260> on

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
it sounds like instead of doubling up on

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.100 
it sounds like instead of doubling up on
the<00:02:15.100> 12<00:02:15.430> or<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.880> 10<00:02:16.090> when<00:02:16.720> you're<00:02:16.840> doing<00:02:17.020> this

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
the 12 or the 10 when you're doing this

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.550 
the 12 or the 10 when you're doing this
part<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.790> kind<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.060> sounds<00:02:19.270> like<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:23.350> mean

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
part it kind of sounds like so I mean

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.259 
part it kind of sounds like so I mean
I'm<00:02:23.920> pretty<00:02:24.190> sure<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.489> changes<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:25.030> little<00:02:25.150> bit

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
I'm pretty sure it changes a little bit

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.970 
I'm pretty sure it changes a little bit
through<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.600> song<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:26.709> kind<00:02:26.920> of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
through the song and it just kind of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.910 
through the song and it just kind of
goes<00:02:27.610> back<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.060> forth<00:02:28.269> but<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.600> can't<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.380> too

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
goes back and forth but I can't be too
