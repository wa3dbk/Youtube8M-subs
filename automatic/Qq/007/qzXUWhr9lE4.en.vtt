00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 or the bright people today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.040
 what were my favorites of the month of 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.080
 April because the month is over and the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.750
 truth is that for me it went flying 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.210
 it was very fast my first favorite of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.420
 this month was the movie of spider man 2 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.189
 that just came out at the movies and I the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.039
 I went to see with my brother because he 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.699
 like those superhero movies I 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.949
 loved the movie I understood everything 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 they really liked the effects because 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.660
 there are some scenes that really are 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.950
 very terrific the effects are as very 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.840
 well done the plot I liked last two 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.010
 hours and a half and the truth is that I do not 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.010
 I felt so much time 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.989
 m 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.200
 anyway 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.920
 just like the state 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.810
 before allows 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.770
 the one that I went to see the opening day was 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.860
 the fever people that movie seriously 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.360
 I really recommend them to me 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.020
 they really like the books of 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.000
 divergent the saga of divergent 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.210
 so 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.830
 I wanted to go see the movie because when 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.780
 you read a book you're always curious 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.300
 about seeing what the movie is about or 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.800
 about how it's going to be like that I went to 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.150
 see with my friends 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.350
 I want to see her again I like everything 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.830
 obviously the whole movie is not 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.119
 attached to the book but I feel that the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.119
 they adapted quite well enough 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.280
 116 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.039
 and I had already read the books of 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.530
 divergent but they were not mine or me 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.540
 a friend lent them then when I saw 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.500
 the movie I wanted to reread the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.020
 books like to realize in what 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.620
 aspects of the different to the movie 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.830
 Then I bought the book 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.049
 although I've read it, I'm still excited 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.930
 to know what will happen even if he already knows 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.849
 what will happen then I have been 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 reading the divergent book in this 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:43.400
 month another favorite this month was this 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.599
 something like that tupac makeup 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 I really like inside looks something like 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:55.320

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.280
 and comes out has his brochita to apply 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.280
