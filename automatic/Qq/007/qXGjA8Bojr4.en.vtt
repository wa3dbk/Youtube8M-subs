00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.809
 it is even desirable to get it Roly

 can not cause serious harm 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.860
 imitation complements the list of weapons that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.600
 can be stored at the Belarusian house without 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.469

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.449
 stun guns

 gas cartridges and pneumatics and water 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.590
 in ordinary language, these are guns for shooting too 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.149
 a little traumatic everything else without 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.800
 special permits 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.719

 begins the rifled food ends 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 quite often honestly say even very 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.700
 feelings you can not visa basically 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.590
 buyers in such stores are hunters with 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.210
 by experience they constitute the backbone of the owners 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.220
 officially registered weapons in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.990

 is a certificate of right to hunt 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.930

 organizations must be medical 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.159
 Help and photography is also a formality 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750
 video cards but the fact that you have everything 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.700
 necessary documents does not mean at all 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.200
 that permission is automatically issued by yours 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 applications are considered by the internal authority 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.640
 affairs within one month from the date of his 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.270
 acquire weapons are not eligible 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.039
 minor citizens have

 mental illness and criminal record 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.530
 even those who will not get permission 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.750
 brought to the administrative 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.759

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.500
 drunk driving for drinking 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 alcohol in a public place 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.969
 even the appearance of a drunk on the street already 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.649
 reason for refusal no right to arms 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.479
 one who cannot provide it 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.700
 safety and in persons without a certain 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.900
 residence until this year weapons 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.519
 forbidden even because those who 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.959
 have drawn up protocols for smoking in 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.030
 wrong place but after making 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.069
 changes to the law smokers can 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.260
 arm today Belarusians registered in 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.819

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.680
 thousand three hundred and fifty gun owners 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.190
 that's about one percent 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.079
 population 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.090
 illegal liquidation operations 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.220
 weapons systematically carried out by the police 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.660
 I hand over the trunks and voluntarily this year 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.880
 the citizens themselves passed 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.799
 one and a half thousand units I was also on 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.599

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.519
 times spoke in our mifit less than a month 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.950
 back when in america 20 year old adam 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.510
 lanza shot six adults and 20 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.010
 children school sandy hook issues 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.900
 use and storage of weapons was 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.750
 dedicated to one of the releases of the program 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.950
 Theme of the day 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.230
 years have somehow changed 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.540
 there were surges wap payback occurred 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.280
 change in the proportion of weapons say 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.480
 if you take 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.819
 civilian weapons that number 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.280
 gas weapons are steadily decreasing in 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.450
 citizens at the same time increases 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.700
 amount let's say 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.530
 hunting carbines in the whole amount 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.109
 weapons over the past 10 years 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.810
 but by a few dozen dozens idea 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.970
 thousands of both owners and weapons 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.069
 decreased corresponding amount 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.230
 the stores have become much smaller that is 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.970
 if there were about 50 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.900
 Republic now 20 20 stores 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.329

 legally subject to different so 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.359
 say requirements these requirements are not 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.130
 so difficult who will understand this 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.540
 document for those who want to take a chance and 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.950
 leave the weapon undone 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.019
 prescribed responsibility for 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.090
 illegal carrying of cold steel whether 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.700
 then the blade is more than 9 centimeters long 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.919

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.930
 and if caught again you can be 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.669
 behind bars for three months 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.470
 Belarus to share the indicator

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.390
 half a joule registration is not necessary a 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.190
 here 's the use 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.870

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.110
 gas weapons circulation is facing the same 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.970
 punishment but it is necessary 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.260
 get permission and register 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.540
 police the toughest punishment 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.920
 Naturally for firearms for 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.230

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.169
 imprisonment 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.090
 if you recall the tragic gunshot 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.100
 stories in Belarus resonant total 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.020
 several one of them occurred at the beginning 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.970
 last year in the Chita district spring 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.919
 the huntsman shot his rifle at his wife and 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.990
 the man's little daughter had no problems 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.860
 with the law he didnâ€™t drink his gun 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.900
 due to debts 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.400
 Here are the motives of the Minsk shooter who was 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.030
 patrolman and wounded another 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.700
 policeman 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.480
 yet to be established it's been 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.669
 angle two pistols one such factor 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.220
 one as they say when he shot where 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.290
 that you were not here at all a show nonsense 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.970

 This nonsense people really yet 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.890
 it is better to wait for the conclusions of the investigation though 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.690
 it is already clear that if we say goodbye 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.340
 voluntarily with a weapon someone does not want 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.050
 no even the toughest law 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.030
 prevent tragedy can not 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.800
 not without reason Belarus almost constantly 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.460
 The operation of arsenals is carried out only in 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.500
 Last year 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.000
