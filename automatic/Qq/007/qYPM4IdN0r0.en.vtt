00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
that it ended in one one yeah I think

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.150 
that it ended in one one yeah I think
you<00:00:33.380> know<00:00:35.290> in<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.470> moment<00:00:36.530> it<00:00:37.040> was

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
you know in that moment it was

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.100 
you know in that moment it was
disappointing<00:00:37.820> because<00:00:38.000> obviously<00:00:38.540> it<00:00:38.990> was

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
disappointing because obviously it was

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.680 
disappointing because obviously it was
like<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.470> 92nd<00:00:40.130> minute<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.520> know<00:00:40.670> but<00:00:41.660> I

like the 92nd minute you know but I

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.040 
like the 92nd minute you know but I
think<00:00:41.990> you<00:00:42.110> know<00:00:42.200> if<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:43.510> three<00:00:44.510> four<00:00:44.840> weeks

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
think you know if you three four weeks

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.650

people<00:00:48.020> would<00:00:48.200> have<00:00:48.580> would<00:00:49.580> have<00:00:49.610> took<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
people would have would have took the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000 
people would have would have took the
point<00:00:50.210> but<00:00:50.450> obviously<00:00:50.810> you<00:00:51.530> know<00:00:51.650> it's<00:00:51.890> all

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
point but obviously you know it's all

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
think that game we we lost concentration

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.800 
think that game we we lost concentration
into<00:01:12.110> moments<00:01:12.620> where<00:01:12.800> they<00:01:12.920> are<00:01:13.720> where<00:01:14.720> they

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
into moments where they are where they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.330 
into moments where they are where they
capitalized<00:01:15.380> on<00:01:15.530> our<00:01:15.710> on<00:01:15.890> our<00:01:15.920> loss<00:01:16.190> of

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
capitalized on our on our loss of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.620 
capitalized on our on our loss of
concentration<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.150> then<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:20.090> was<00:01:20.330> playing<00:01:20.510> a

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
concentration and then it was playing a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.649 
concentration and then it was playing a
lot<00:01:20.780> of<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:22.090> counter-attack<00:01:23.090> football<00:01:23.600> you

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
lot of a counter-attack football you

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.110 
lot of a counter-attack football you
know<00:01:24.040> we<00:01:25.040> did<00:01:25.190> well<00:01:25.370> to<00:01:25.520> come<00:01:25.550> back<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:26.060> you

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
know we did well to come back but you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.240 
know we did well to come back but you
know<00:01:26.360> we<00:01:26.870> I<00:01:27.110> think<00:01:27.200> class<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.710> holding<00:01:28.070> like

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
know we I think class is holding like

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.340 
know we I think class is holding like
the<00:01:28.430> loss<00:01:28.640> kick<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.840> game<00:01:29.870> you<00:01:30.200> know<00:01:30.320> what

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the loss kick of the game you know what

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.440 
the loss kick of the game you know what
I<00:01:30.500> mean<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:30.890> was<00:01:31.040> no<00:01:31.580> time<00:01:31.790> left<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:32.150> try<00:01:32.330> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
I mean so it was no time left to try and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.240 
I mean so it was no time left to try and
grab<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.750> winner<00:01:32.900> but<00:01:33.110> you<00:01:33.200> know<00:01:33.350> there<00:01:34.159> were

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
grab the winner but you know there were

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.010 
grab the winner but you know there were
teammates<00:01:34.490> on<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.820> mission<00:01:35.210> they<00:01:35.450> day<00:01:35.690> they've

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
teammates on a mission they day they've

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.480 
teammates on a mission they day they've
made<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:37.810> how<00:01:38.810> can<00:01:38.990> I<00:01:39.049> say<00:01:39.229> that<00:01:39.440> they've<00:01:40.250> made

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
made it how can I say that they've made

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.850 
made it how can I say that they've made
it<00:01:40.930> black<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.140> white<00:01:42.260> that<00:01:42.440> they<00:01:42.530> want<00:01:42.740> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
it black and white that they want the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.640 
it black and white that they want the
third<00:01:43.040> spot<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.659> so<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.110> game<00:01:45.290> of<00:01:45.320> two

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
third spot and so it's a game of two

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.859 
third spot and so it's a game of two
teams<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:45.979> are<00:01:46.130> up<00:01:46.310> for<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.210> position<00:01:47.390> and
