wee-wee<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:48.099> know<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.120> was<00:05:49.270> uh<00:05:49.300> i<00:05:49.719> think<00:05:50.229> it<00:05:50.440> was

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
wee-wee to know it was uh i think it was

go<00:05:50.860> we<00:05:51.340> wipe<00:05:51.610> or<00:05:51.909> weaker<00:05:52.539> wipe<00:05:52.719> to<00:05:53.229> go<00:05:53.590> wipe

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
go we wipe or weaker wipe to go wipe

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.100

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
again because i realized that which is

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.620 
again because i realized that which is
wasn't<00:05:56.710> my<00:05:56.830> thing<00:05:56.860> for<00:05:57.669> I<00:05:57.880> think<00:05:57.940> I<00:05:58.240> for<00:05:58.570> a

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
wasn't my thing for I think I for a

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.959 
wasn't my thing for I think I for a
while<00:05:58.780> actually<00:05:59.050> went<00:05:59.409> so<00:05:59.560> good<00:05:59.710> so<00:05:59.949> I<00:06:00.130> i

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
while actually went so good so I i

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.149 
while actually went so good so I i
deployed<00:06:01.389> to<00:06:01.509> jump<00:06:01.750> so<00:06:01.960> really<00:06:02.590> nice<00:06:02.830> the

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
deployed to jump so really nice the

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.589 
deployed to jump so really nice the
bbqing<00:06:03.550> actually<00:06:03.849> didn't<00:06:04.150> go<00:06:04.210> in<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.360> middle
