one is we were doing some research and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.920 
one is we were doing some research and
we<00:03:04.030> learned<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.360> some<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.720> indigenous

people<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.560> work<00:03:05.740> with<00:03:05.770> in<00:03:06.160> Vietnam<00:03:06.550> that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
people that work with in Vietnam that

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.220 
people that work with in Vietnam that

there did actually use bow and arrow
during<00:03:12.280> their<00:03:12.400> missions<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.030> great

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
during their missions it's a great

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.610 
during their missions it's a great
stealth<00:03:13.540> weapon<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.020> if<00:03:14.080> you're<00:03:14.200> effective

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
stealth weapon and if you're effective

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.230 
stealth weapon and if you're effective
with<00:03:14.770> it<00:03:14.920> obviously<00:03:15.280> read<00:03:15.550> ibly<00:03:15.730> lethal<00:03:16.090> and

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
with it obviously read ibly lethal and

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.320 
with it obviously read ibly lethal and
you<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:16.780> go<00:03:16.870> undetected<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.610> we<00:03:18.940> learned<00:03:19.150> we

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
you can go undetected so we learned we

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.170 
you can go undetected so we learned we
learned<00:03:19.360> about<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.110> then<00:03:20.650> we<00:03:20.800> also

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
learned about that and then we also

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.480 
learned about that and then we also
heard<00:03:22.180> from<00:03:22.320> Major<00:03:23.320> John<00:03:23.500> plaster<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.340> there
