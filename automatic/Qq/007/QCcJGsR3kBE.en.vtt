 is the contact person the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.290
 that does not mean effort strikes high 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.890
 that the most important of course 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.160

 especially the tour while sharpening me 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.170
 now only because of that, I was above 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.220

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.360
 I was almost a week on the road 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.120
 and that's just nice 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.519
 there are we have triangles 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 tractors because by that more 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.160
 weight of then my trailer special 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.540
 construction so on deep bed widener was on 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.319
 five meters and can therefore special 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.410
 good shape 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.890
 seven feet deep bed and can stand 26 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.890
 to load 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.210
 my name is david hansen i am with 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.110
 fairer important for the disposition of 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.240
 vehicles and the entrepreneur 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.340
 responsible we have at the 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.560
 own photo about telematics systems 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.230
 which every driver can do among them 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.170
 and so we can always seconds 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.240
 Check exactly where the vehicle is 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.400
 the vehicle is still moving this kilometer 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.860
 to explore this driving experience 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.780
 still available and so on 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.770
 So my name is fast but I am 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.200
 under disposition and one tasks are 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.940
 the monitoring of the trucks so the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.730
 biggest the biggest benefits for the 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.230
 driver is said that one time 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.810
 certain regularity of the series 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.400
 arrive yes that will make it the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.769
 driver 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.750
 also calculated overwhelmed it is for 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.510
 the distributor of advantage that one 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.239
 you can not say right the driver 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.340
 to use realistically means that nice 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.689
 we the driver in the bus but that with 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.299
 the driver apart from the 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.689
 can drain and can say everything 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.730
 clear 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.610
 I can drive 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.190
 claim previous and everything 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.120
 In addition, yes I say that 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.610
 customer not too 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.810
 So the first fit federal for weight 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.700
 usually does not get 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.700
 discussed but simply vehicle velvet 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.950
 driver and that must of course tipptopp 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.930
 really ask the first one out first 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.549
 simple decisive and we lay down 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.400
 simply worth the fact that the vehicles 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.769
 are maintained that the driver started 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.239
 have well-groomed appearance so our 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:19.160
 goal of the principle that we 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.930
 if we have new employees in the new 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.889
 want to work together with employees 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.979
 that we are from the beginning 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.629
 clarify that we were afraid that ours 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.180
 Company actually has interest 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:32.379
 his mother 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.150
 finally from the country too long as possible 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.150
 would be committed in our company 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.860
 can 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.220
 At the ball of thought these specialists 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.020
 because its requires, I must continue to 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.960
 continue to invest in the deep 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.680
 are going to stop more fair and 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.160
 and must also 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.810
 new ones are learning there again 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.280
 to provide challenges and it goes 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.620
 actually a reason arjen if you look 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.460
 then also possible here if feels comfortable 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.860
