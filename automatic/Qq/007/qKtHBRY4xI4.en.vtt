00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello girls I'm coming back for a 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.519
 little video to tell you about a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.519
 straightener that I got on the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.040
 professional r website i would put you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.900
 well in info bar 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 so for all you tell me 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.890
 I had the rimington so I threw 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.090
 I could not show you you have 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.310
 bought 3 4 years ago a little more 50 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.150
 euros I had it then I 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.410
 had been thinking for six months 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.760
 take the ghd straightener and me like you 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 know when I was in the south of the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.000
 France I was going to blue dragonflies and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.309
 I had seen that they had released the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.989
 coriolis so isabelle these two he is 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.379
 waiting for the c3 who still have not 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.120
 by the way and that tempted me because 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.079
 that it was titanium plates 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.690
 so I absolutely wanted the coriolis 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.379
 and by inquiring is all about 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 internet the coriolis edge hd summer 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.960
 compared to other andy lily so for 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.020
 the one who knows what they saw 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.880
 to talk about it on facebook is the one 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.430
 which shy'm uses in one of his clips I 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.960
 do not know which one do not ask me so 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.060
 here I read a hundred opinions on 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.830
 one over the other 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.470
 it's very very very close to coriolis 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.840
 so this case the titanium plates 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.369
 so I thought why not so 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 on the professional air site it is 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.990
 for sale at the base at 180 euros 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.430
 and there it is promo for 110 euros and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.189
 you pay it you can pay it in 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.229
 many times in three times I believe 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.270
 so I show you all this 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.829
 the box is like this so I have 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.280
 taken the 13 offenses structure there are some 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.619
 many 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.329
 there are the plates are tourmaline 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.939
 etc me I absolutely wanted titanium 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.399
 So here so this one which is to 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.270
 the base has so as I told you 180 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.659
 euros 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.950
 so we had the little notice so the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.310
 box is flawless with regard to 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.710
 halls and loving and in addition to that so 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.090
 that's the only negative point 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.190
 I'm going to talk about it now like that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.330
 will be done is that it is sold but 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.599
 without protective pouch 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.690
 so that is to say that I have kept 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:19.230
 my old protection pouch of 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.360
 ring tons that's how it's hop 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.160
 even if it 's not cold yet I 'll 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.170
 in it cools inside it's 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.870
 super convenient 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.239
 so now I show you the beast 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.360
 she 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.630
 it's like this so well it's okay when 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.010
 even finally it is so well do 2 way 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.489
 do one and a half mom we'll say 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.910
 so go like these trade militia 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.209
 macha a professional that was in 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.319
 the carton took care of eating it from 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.400
 little ones in loop I did not put the 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.019
 first time I used it and then 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.160
 after I have friends because good at 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.200
 Plate level is hot so 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.900
 when we get our hands on this high school 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.590
 i will show up if i get to nice and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.910
 Ben was hot finger so after I 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.940
 am saying ah well also wants 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.630
 of his means so I put them back 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.340
 and as there is no problem so 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.790
 here we wanted to eat like that and at 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.549
 the less you do not feel hot 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.750
 then then the commander and he turns 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.660
 here is 360 Â° nickel it's a super far 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.450
 cord that is three meters long 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.889
 so compare for example me my dream 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.540
 so was redon was a lot more 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.120
 little really practical thing that's like 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.930
 you can see three meters of yarn 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.910
 so that's a pretty positive point 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.280
 then you have a little button here 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.910
 so hop you go down and his 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.900
 workers plates 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.730
 so you see it's good plates 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.380
 relatively thin but very long so 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.720
 the smoothing effect quite quickly 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.380
 then compared to for example at gh2 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.350
 or the buttons are inside 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.250
 the sound I say no nonsense so the up 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.980
 I close 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:11.800
 here are the buttons are on the side 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:14.310
 so you see own of more at least I 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.310
 go the branch
