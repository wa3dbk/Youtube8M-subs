so<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.340> number<00:03:51.730> ones<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:53.019> have<00:03:53.140> not<00:03:53.349> got<00:03:53.590> a

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
so the number ones that have not got a

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.900 
so the number ones that have not got a
key<00:03:54.340> fell

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.670 

in<00:03:59.070> twist<00:04:00.070> beautiful<00:04:01.060> little<00:04:01.240> K<00:04:01.480> will<00:04:02.350> harm

broom

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.390 

so<00:04:16.900> while<00:04:17.139> we're<00:04:17.320> on<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.560> subject<00:04:17.590> left

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
so while we're on the subject left

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.530

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.240 

and<00:04:40.160> basically<00:04:40.400> offer<00:04:41.320> like<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.500> size<00:04:42.800> of<00:04:43.130> the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
and basically offer like the size of the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.410 
and basically offer like the size of the
kayoppe<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.280> keyword

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
kayoppe to the keyword

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.950 
kayoppe to the keyword
so<00:04:48.990> if<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.140> does<00:04:49.260> not<00:04:49.440> fit

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
so if it does not fit

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:59.210 
so if it does not fit
it's<00:04:51.530> not<00:04:51.740> good<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.100> open<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.419> walk

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.400 

let's<00:04:59.700> go<00:04:59.850> that<00:05:00.060> will<00:05:00.210> open<00:05:00.420> nicely

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.010 

let's<00:05:05.830> try<00:05:06.130> another<00:05:06.340> one

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
let's try another one

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.970 
let's try another one
it's<00:05:09.020> far<00:05:09.770> too<00:05:09.800> big

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.140 

for<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.610> keyword<00:05:14.440> so<00:05:15.440> that's<00:05:15.650> not<00:05:15.860> gonna<00:05:16.150> go

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
for the keyword so that's not gonna go

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.580 
for the keyword so that's not gonna go
in<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:17.570> basically<00:05:17.780> what<00:05:18.140> you're<00:05:18.230> doing<00:05:18.260> is

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
in so basically what you're doing is

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.500 
in so basically what you're doing is
looking<00:05:19.070> at<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.460> size<00:05:20.920> comparison

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.740 

and<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:27.080> sort<00:05:27.260> of<00:05:27.290> jiggle<00:05:27.680> around<00:05:28.570> pop<00:05:29.570> the

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
and just sort of jiggle around pop the

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.330 
and just sort of jiggle around pop the
lock

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
lock

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.990 
lock
see<00:05:31.340> that's<00:05:31.520> not<00:05:31.730> war<00:05:32.090> but<00:05:32.330> this<00:05:33.230> is<00:05:33.940> sort<00:05:34.940> of

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
see that's not war but this is sort of

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.340 
see that's not war but this is sort of
eighteen<00:05:35.540> hundreds<00:05:36.050> it's<00:05:36.680> a<00:05:36.800> secure<00:05:38.350> pancake

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
eighteen hundreds it's a secure pancake

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.620 
eighteen hundreds it's a secure pancake
warded<00:05:40.190> lock

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
warded lock

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.510 
warded lock
that<00:05:43.200> is<00:05:43.350> obviously<00:05:43.740> too<00:05:44.610> small<00:05:46.250> as<00:05:47.250> you<00:05:47.370> can

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
that is obviously too small as you can

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.520 
that is obviously too small as you can
see<00:05:47.700> from<00:05:47.880> the<00:05:48.150> keyword<00:05:50.750> so<00:05:51.750> what<00:05:52.110> I<00:05:52.140> do<00:05:52.290> is

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
see from the keyword so what I do is

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.960 
see from the keyword so what I do is
basically<00:05:52.710> off<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.310> mop

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.890 

so<00:06:09.430> after<00:06:10.430> these<00:06:10.550> have<00:06:10.790> been<00:06:10.940> dusted<00:06:11.389> off<00:06:11.570> I'm
