00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello welcome in your role 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.160
 is the recipe of the day and the pie 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.800
 chocolate 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.799
 this recipe is for 6 people for 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.800
 the dough we need 200 g of flour 90 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.170
 g of butter 1 egg 40 g of sugar and one 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
 pinch of salt for the filling there we 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.970
 you need 200 g of dark chocolate 20 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.350
 centilitres of liquid cream 810 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.090
 liters of milk and an egg 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.760
 I start by putting the oven to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.320
 preheated to 180 Â° and during that time 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.759
 I will prepare the dough 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.140
 so for that I'm going to do that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.190
 directly on which we work so 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.920
 I put the flour on the work plan 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.070
 and I'm going to mix him the sugar and the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.070
 salt 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.000
 I dig a well and I'm going to pour 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.860
 the beaten egg I 'm going to amalgamate it 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.860
 slightly before incorporating the butter 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.560
 so here we get a texture a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.700
 little sandy that we went went to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.740
 bottom of a mold 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.430
 so I cut out a parchment paper 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.810
 to put his normal level on paper 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.220
 round a little on the edges it's for 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.259
 help us unravel the pie while 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.030
 time is going to put the dough in 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.440
 the mold is well supported to make it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.580
 a parish loam this is the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.720
 the ideal is to take a mold to 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.340
 pie about 26 cm in diameter I 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.659
 now put a parchment paper through 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.310
 on top and a weight to cook it to 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.990
 white so I have beans that I 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.710
 canned ready for cooking 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.509
 amazes me 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.360
 let's go for 15 minutes of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.160
 baking the dough is cooking 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.190
 it's time to prepare the garnish 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.770
 chocolate so we will put the cream 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.210
 and the milk to heat in a saucepan 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.950
 I'm going to h and chocolate me it's already 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.580
 almost melted given the temperature that makes 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.740
 the kitchen 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.850
 once the chocolate is chopped I 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.020
 put it in a salad bowl 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.880
 so I'm going to grove home at this 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.170
 he already has ultra soft but if your 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.840
 chocolate and radio thesis to it 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.280
 would buy raffin see you take 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.740
 altogether chocolate pistols or 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.270
 nuggets years when cream and milk 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.080
 are boiling I'm just going to them 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.080
 pour over the chocolate 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.050
 I wait a minute before euros but 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.360
 I am preparing the pie at 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.730
 chocolate but in reality all along 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.980
 the video there was already a pie at 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.480
 chocolate ready on the screen and she 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.330
 was present in the video 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.069

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.120

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.450

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.020

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.599
 that is, I will add the egg 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.709
 in the chocolate mixture before the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.709
 pour on the part 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.420
