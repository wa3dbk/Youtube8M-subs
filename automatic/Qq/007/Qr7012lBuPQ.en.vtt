00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
want to take the clean endless string

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
want to take the clean endless string
and<00:00:43.170> slip<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> through<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.040> these<00:00:44.190> little

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and slip it through one of these little

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.510 
and slip it through one of these little
holes<00:00:44.700> right<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.950> there's<00:00:46.950> strings<00:00:47.160> pretty

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
holes right here there's strings pretty

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.310 
holes right here there's strings pretty
thick<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.050> kind<00:00:49.260> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
thick so it's going to be kind of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.729 
thick so it's going to be kind of
difficult<00:00:50.149> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> find<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> room<00:00:51.809> alright

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
difficult going to find the room alright

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.970 
difficult going to find the room alright
so<00:00:52.949> once<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.579> could<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.890> see<00:00:55.890> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
so once it's in you could see you see it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
so once it's in you could see you see it
slipping<00:00:56.340> through<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> take

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
slipping through you just want to take

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
slipping through you just want to take
just<00:00:57.930> let<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.890> loose<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> second<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.940> now

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
just let this loose for a second and now

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.119 
just let this loose for a second and now
grab<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> other<00:01:01.379> industry<00:01:03.589> like<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.799> get

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
grab the other industry like this get

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
grab the other industry like this get
them<00:01:05.220> even<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.659> they're<00:01:06.869> they're

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
them even so you know they're they're

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.140 
them even so you know they're they're
both<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.979> same<00:01:08.010> length<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.580> each<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.880> so

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
both the same length on each side so

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.929 
both the same length on each side so
grab<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.110> hold<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.740> hold<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.490> two

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
grab it hold it hold it in the two

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.310 
grab it hold it hold it in the two
strings<00:01:12.210> together<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.930> pull<00:01:13.170> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
strings together and then just pull this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.560 
strings together and then just pull this
all<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.710> down<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> middle<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
all the way down to the middle like so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.649 
all the way down to the middle like so
so<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.590> even<00:01:16.770> ends<00:01:17.299> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.420> see

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
so now you have to even ends you can see

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539 
so now you have to even ends you can see
on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> top<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> head<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> little

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
on the top of the head there's a little

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
on the top of the head there's a little
arrow<00:01:20.729> which<00:01:21.030> shows<00:01:21.360> which<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.080> need<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
arrow which shows which way you need a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.710 
arrow which shows which way you need a
rapid<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> stick<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.420> finger

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
rapid so just kind of stick your finger

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.380 
rapid so just kind of stick your finger
in<00:01:24.840> between<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.470> strings<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.150> just<00:01:27.150> wrap

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
in between the two strings and just wrap

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.420 
in between the two strings and just wrap
it<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.140> direction<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.860> which<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> shows<00:01:29.280> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it the direction and which it shows you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.940 
it the direction and which it shows you
to<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:31.020> don't<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> wrap<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.619> too<00:01:31.740> tight

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
to you don't want to wrap it too tight

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
to you don't want to wrap it too tight
because<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.460> string<00:01:32.820> will<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.030> locked<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.450> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
because the string will get locked up in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.940 
because the string will get locked up in
itself<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.170> won't<00:01:34.320> come<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:38.990> alright<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
itself and it won't come out alright so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.520 
itself and it won't come out alright so
once<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.880> all<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.270> wrapped<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
once it's a it's all the way wrapped and
