getting stuck in the high position that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.010 
getting stuck in the high position that
would<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.789> good<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.030> over<00:00:45.239> fire<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:45.870> wood

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
stove but one of the issues this has is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.420 
stove but one of the issues this has is
there's<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.989> sliding<00:00:49.320> mechanism<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
there's a sliding mechanism in there and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400 
there's a sliding mechanism in there and
I'm<00:00:50.520> gonna<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.660> depth<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> little<00:00:51.989> bit<00:00:52.230> more

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
I'm gonna go and depth a little bit more

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
I'm gonna go and depth a little bit more
to<00:00:52.590> show<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> properly<00:00:53.840> maintain

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
to show you how to properly maintain

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.080

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
this but when you try to pull that over

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.459 
this but when you try to pull that over
sometimes<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> gets<00:00:57.809> stuck<00:00:58.020> right<00:00:58.230> there

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
sometimes it gets stuck right there

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.810 
sometimes it gets stuck right there
and<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.039> pull<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.309> all<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.430> might<00:00:59.579> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
over to the high position but every go

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
over to the high position but every go
back<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.509> low<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> same<00:01:19.650> thing<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.369> order

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
to get to go to high heat at the tap it
every<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.619> no<00:01:22.770> good<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.400> let's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
every time and that's no good so let's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
every time and that's no good so let's
go<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> next<00:01:24.540> step<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.170> I'll<00:01:25.409> show<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.680> how

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
to properly maintain this so it works

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.080 
to properly maintain this so it works
smoothly<00:01:30.380> check<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:31.650> all<00:01:32.579> right<00:01:32.759> I've<00:01:32.939> got

alright and put it back together I'm

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.500 
alright and put it back together I'm
gonna<00:04:16.340> shut<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.669> camera<00:04:16.970> off<00:04:17.000> spray<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.330> little

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
gonna shut the camera off spray a little

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.990 
gonna shut the camera off spray a little
bit<00:04:17.660> more<00:04:18.190> but<00:04:19.190> you<00:04:19.220> get<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.549> gist<00:04:19.789> of

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
bit more but you get the gist of

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.630 
bit more but you get the gist of
how<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.720> lubricate<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.530> with<00:04:22.800> graphite<00:04:23.280> all

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
how to lubricate that with graphite all

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.130 
how to lubricate that with graphite all
right<00:04:23.880> well<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.090> think<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.420> want<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.600> mention<00:04:24.930> is

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
right well I think I want to mention is

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.920 
right well I think I want to mention is
I<00:04:25.770> move<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.250> all<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.550> way<00:04:26.700> over<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.690> left

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
I move that all the way over to the left

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.070 
I move that all the way over to the left
and<00:04:28.260> then<00:04:28.710> sprayed<00:04:29.040> it<00:04:29.190> again<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.900> can<00:04:31.020> do

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
and then sprayed it again and I can do

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.900 
and then sprayed it again and I can do
it<00:04:31.200> all<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.950> way<00:04:32.070> over<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.430> right

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
it all the way over to the right

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.910 
it all the way over to the right
spray<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:33.270> again<00:04:33.510> so<00:04:34.320> you<00:04:34.380> kind<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.680> hit<00:04:34.800> all

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
spray it again so you kind of hit all

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.320 
spray it again so you kind of hit all
the<00:04:35.250> positions<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:35.940> then<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.150> put<00:04:36.300> that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
the positions and then you put that

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.640 
the positions and then you put that
cover<00:04:36.570> plate<00:04:36.840> back<00:04:37.020> on<00:04:37.880> okay<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.570> put<00:04:39.840> this

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
cover plate back on okay so I put this

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.400 
cover plate back on okay so I put this
back<00:04:40.920> on<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.550> thin<00:04:41.820> metal<00:04:42.150> plate<00:04:42.450> then<00:04:43.260> this

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
back on that thin metal plate then this

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.280 
back on that thin metal plate then this
heavier<00:04:43.740> cast-iron<00:04:44.340> cover<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.690> two<00:04:45.870> bolts<00:04:46.110> I

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
heavier cast-iron cover the two bolts I

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.620 
heavier cast-iron cover the two bolts I
got<00:04:46.440> them<00:04:46.560> nice<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.770> snug<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.580> never<00:04:48.270> like<00:04:48.480> to

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
got them nice and snug I never like to

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.510 
got them nice and snug I never like to
really<00:04:48.840> refine<00:04:49.320> I'm<00:04:49.500> just<00:04:49.710> afraid<00:04:50.130> like<00:04:50.370> if

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
really refine I'm just afraid like if

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.010 
really refine I'm just afraid like if
you<00:04:50.580> really<00:04:50.910> do<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.600> could<00:04:51.750> crack

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
you really do that you could crack

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.250 
you really do that you could crack
something<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:53.510> parts<00:04:54.510> of<00:04:54.630> this<00:04:54.750> aren't<00:04:54.960> cheap

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
something and parts of this aren't cheap

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.740 
something and parts of this aren't cheap
so<00:04:55.590> I<00:04:55.860> say<00:04:56.040> just<00:04:56.220> get<00:04:56.370> nice<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.760> snug<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.240> one

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
so I say just get nice and snug and one

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.810 
so I say just get nice and snug and one
thing<00:04:58.020> that<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.260> forgot<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.620> mention<00:04:58.740> maybe<00:04:59.730> I

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
thing that I forgot to mention maybe I

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.740 
thing that I forgot to mention maybe I
did<00:04:59.970> mention<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.270> but<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.419> don't<00:05:00.480> think<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.690> did

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
did mention it but I don't think I did

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.140 
did mention it but I don't think I did
is<00:05:01.050> if<00:05:01.950> you<00:05:02.040> can<00:05:02.220> read<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.900> says<00:05:03.960> for

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
is if you can read this it says for

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.620 
is if you can read this it says for
extreme<00:05:06.770> temperatures<00:05:07.910> so<00:05:08.910> that's<00:05:09.150> the

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
extreme temperatures so that's the

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.430 
extreme temperatures so that's the
reason<00:05:09.960> you<00:05:10.050> use<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.620> is<00:05:11.870> this<00:05:12.870> gets<00:05:13.200> very

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
reason you use this is this gets very

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.130 
reason you use this is this gets very
hot<00:05:13.680> inside<00:05:13.890> here<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:14.720> want<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:15.780> graphite

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
hot inside here and you want a graphite

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.659 
hot inside here and you want a graphite
that's<00:05:16.350> going<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.530> hold<00:05:16.740> up<00:05:16.890> for<00:05:17.130> a<00:05:17.190> long<00:05:17.370> time

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
that's going to hold up for a long time

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.180 
that's going to hold up for a long time
for<00:05:18.090> long<00:05:18.270> haul<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:18.830> all<00:05:19.830> right<00:05:19.919> let's<00:05:20.130> check

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
for long haul and all right let's check

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.780 
for long haul and all right let's check
this<00:05:20.400> out<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.730> see<00:05:20.760> how<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.270> level<00:05:21.600> slides<00:05:22.790> all

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
this out to see how the level slides all

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.620 
this out to see how the level slides all
right<00:05:25.250> nice<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.490> smooth<00:05:26.729> you<00:05:27.000> don't<00:05:27.180> feel

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
right nice and smooth you don't feel

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.880 
right nice and smooth you don't feel
like<00:05:27.660> catching<00:05:28.140> at<00:05:28.470> all

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
like catching at all

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.790 
like catching at all
so<00:05:29.370> anyways<00:05:29.640> I'm<00:05:30.570> not<00:05:30.720> sure<00:05:30.930> if<00:05:31.260> this<00:05:31.560> will

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
so anyways I'm not sure if this will

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.710 
so anyways I'm not sure if this will
pertain<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.310> other<00:05:32.669> wood<00:05:32.910> stoves<00:05:33.180> but<00:05:33.450> on<00:05:33.600> the

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
pertain to other wood stoves but on the

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.750 
pertain to other wood stoves but on the
