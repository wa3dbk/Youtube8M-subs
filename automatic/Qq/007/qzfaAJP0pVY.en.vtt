going<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.930> start<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.410> cramp<00:02:06.250> up<00:02:06.520> exactly<00:02:07.300> and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
going to start to cramp up exactly and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.369 
going to start to cramp up exactly and
my<00:02:08.080> gosh<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:08.950> gonna<00:02:09.340> hurt<00:02:09.670> okay<00:02:10.660> almost

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
my gosh is that gonna hurt okay almost

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.929 
my gosh is that gonna hurt okay almost
more<00:02:11.590> than<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.800> paper<00:02:12.099> cut<00:02:12.459> yeah<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:14.260> bad<00:02:14.939> so

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
more than a paper cut yeah that bad so

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.970 
more than a paper cut yeah that bad so
you<00:02:16.359> want<00:02:16.629> to<00:02:16.750> make<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.140> point<00:02:17.409> to<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
you want to make it a point to a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.309 
you want to make it a point to a
hack<00:02:18.129> this<00:02:18.340> potential<00:02:19.000> problem<00:02:19.540> before<00:02:20.019> the

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
hack this potential problem before the
