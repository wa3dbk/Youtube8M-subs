00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
worth of this one versus only on this

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.330 
worth of this one versus only on this
one<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.720> do<00:02:12.960> get<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.440> 16<00:02:13.710> gigabyte<00:02:13.890> RAM<00:02:14.160> but

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
one you do get the 16 gigabyte RAM but

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.910 
one you do get the 16 gigabyte RAM but
here<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.760> put<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.350> 128<00:02:16.350> gigabyte<00:02:16.740> SD

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
here you can put in a 128 gigabyte SD

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.900 
here you can put in a 128 gigabyte SD

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
megapixel camera and that you do get

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.680 
megapixel camera and that you do get
inside<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.620> word<00:02:38.580> focused<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.060> camera<00:02:39.420> and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
inside of the word focused a camera and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:51.440 
inside of the word focused a camera and
let's<00:02:40.230> do<00:02:40.410> get<00:02:40.590> inside<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.770> z2<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:50.180> mean<00:02:51.180> you

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
let's do get inside of the z2 I mean you

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.449 
let's do get inside of the z2 I mean you
definitely<00:02:51.990> will<00:02:52.350> notice<00:02:52.620> such<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> hardcore

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
definitely will notice such a hardcore

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.880 
definitely will notice such a hardcore
difference<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.450> one<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.840> also<00:02:54.959> record<00:02:55.530> in

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
difference this one can also record in

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.050 
difference this one can also record in
4k<00:02:56.340> video<00:02:57.000> which<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.110> also<00:02:58.320> pretty<00:02:58.680> intense

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
4k video which is also pretty intense

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.350 
4k video which is also pretty intense
and<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:01.110> mean<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.320> look<00:03:01.740> at<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.890> frame<00:03:02.100> rates

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
and I mean you look at the frame rates

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.320 
and I mean you look at the frame rates
2160p<00:03:03.360> at<00:03:03.630> 60<00:03:04.080> frames<00:03:04.170> per<00:03:04.350> second<00:03:04.890> at<00:03:05.880> 1080p

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
at 60 frames per second yeah 21 seems to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.030 
at 60 frames per second yeah 21 seems to
be<00:03:09.209> at<00:03:09.300> 30<00:03:09.720> frames<00:03:09.900> per<00:03:10.050> second<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.380> mean<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:10.860> I

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
be at 30 frames per second I mean if I

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.250 
be at 30 frames per second I mean if I
said<00:03:11.280> no<00:03:11.970> correct<00:03:12.720> there<00:03:12.870> perhaps

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
said no correct there perhaps

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.710 
said no correct there perhaps
and<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.860> one<00:03:14.010> has<00:03:14.130> Snapdragon<00:03:14.580> 801<00:03:15.239> which<00:03:15.540> is

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and this one has Snapdragon 801 which is

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.970 
and this one has Snapdragon 801 which is
the<00:03:15.840> latest<00:03:17.209> chipset<00:03:18.209> here<00:03:18.900> from<00:03:19.170> like<00:03:19.470> um<00:03:19.950> I

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the latest chipset here from like um I

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.780 
the latest chipset here from like um I
guess<00:03:20.870> runs<00:03:21.870> super<00:03:22.380> super<00:03:22.890> smooth<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.760> can

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
guess runs super super smooth you can

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.850 
guess runs super super smooth you can
also<00:03:24.030> see<00:03:24.150> I'm<00:03:24.269> running<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:25.100> Nova<00:03:26.100> Nova<00:03:26.720> Nova

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
also see I'm running the Nova Nova Nova

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.940 
also see I'm running the Nova Nova Nova
Launcher<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:30.120> then<00:03:30.330> we<00:03:30.450> do<00:03:30.570> have<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
Launcher and then we do have a

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.170 
Launcher and then we do have a
Snapdragon<00:03:31.950> 800<00:03:32.489> here<00:03:32.670> which<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> little

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
Snapdragon 800 here which is a little

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.180 
Snapdragon 800 here which is a little
bit<00:03:33.269> older<00:03:33.570> same<00:03:33.870> as<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.140> Galaxy<00:03:34.470> Note<00:03:34.590> 3<00:03:34.769> and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
bit older same as the Galaxy Note 3 and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.850 
bit older same as the Galaxy Note 3 and
it<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.610> nice<00:03:35.730> pair<00:03:35.880> z1<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:37.050> which<00:03:37.290> was<00:03:37.530> this

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
it is so nice pair z1 and which was this

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.270 
it is so nice pair z1 and which was this
one<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.190> successor<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.320> it's<00:03:40.320> also<00:03:40.500> runs<00:03:40.800> very

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
one is successor to it's also runs very

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.229 
one is successor to it's also runs very
well<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:42.300> both<00:03:42.660> have<00:03:43.050> 2.3<00:03:43.530> year<00:03:43.890> Hertz<00:03:44.130> clock

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
well and both have 2.3 year Hertz clock

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.050 
well and both have 2.3 year Hertz clock
I<00:03:45.269> don't<00:03:45.870> 330<00:03:46.530> GPU<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.580> game<00:03:47.760> experience

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
I don't 330 GPU so the game experience

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.850 
I don't 330 GPU so the game experience
should<00:03:48.330> be<00:03:48.390> pretty<00:03:48.630> similar<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.500> then<00:03:49.709> we

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
should be pretty similar but then we

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.100 
should be pretty similar but then we
have<00:03:50.070> some<00:03:50.400> things<00:03:50.640> here<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.450> fluid<00:03:51.750> running

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
have some things here the fluid running

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.050 
have some things here the fluid running
here<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.650> get<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.010> three<00:03:53.459> thousand<00:03:53.970> two

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
here I get the three thousand two

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.449 
here I get the three thousand two
hundred<00:03:54.090> million<00:03:54.450> battery<00:03:55.040> which<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.070> pretty

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
hundred million battery which is pretty

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.979
