00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.100 

some<00:00:09.910> technology<00:00:10.540> that<00:00:10.720> we<00:00:10.810> have<00:00:10.960> is<00:00:11.080> called

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
some technology that we have is called

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.370 
some technology that we have is called
speed<00:00:11.620> safe<00:00:11.950> and<00:00:12.280> speed<00:00:13.270> safe<00:00:13.570> again<00:00:13.930> is<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
speed safe and speed safe again is a

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.480 
speed safe and speed safe again is a
torsion<00:00:17.380> bar<00:00:17.410> technology<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:21.130> way<00:00:21.279> that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
torsion bar technology the way that

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.250 
torsion bar technology the way that
speed<00:00:22.029> safe<00:00:22.240> works<00:00:22.540> you<00:00:22.720> can<00:00:22.869> see<00:00:22.900> there's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
speed safe works you can see there's

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.800 
speed safe works you can see there's
just<00:00:23.350> piano<00:00:23.830> wire<00:00:24.130> within<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.090> handle<00:00:25.450> itself

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
just piano wire within the handle itself

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.320 
just piano wire within the handle itself
and<00:00:26.200> it<00:00:26.710> kind<00:00:26.920> of<00:00:27.010> contracts<00:00:27.670> as<00:00:27.850> you<00:00:28.030> close

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
and it kind of contracts as you close

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.980 
and it kind of contracts as you close
the<00:00:28.720> blade<00:00:30.450> when<00:00:31.450> you're<00:00:31.570> ready<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:31.900> actually

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
the blade when you're ready to actually

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.840 
the blade when you're ready to actually
open<00:00:32.529> it<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:32.770> just<00:00:32.830> use<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.370> thumb<00:00:33.580> stud

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
open it you just use the thumb stud

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.330 
open it you just use the thumb stud
itself<00:00:34.270> and<00:00:35.050> it<00:00:35.170> does<00:00:35.199> assist<00:00:35.770> the<00:00:35.920> knife<00:00:36.129> in

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
itself and it does assist the knife in

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.330 
itself and it does assist the knife in
actually<00:00:36.760> opening<00:00:37.090> up<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.620> it's<00:00:38.800> not<00:00:38.980> an<00:00:39.160> auto

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
actually opening up but it's not an auto

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.540 
actually opening up but it's not an auto
so<00:00:39.790> it's<00:00:40.330> not<00:00:40.510> an<00:00:40.660> auto<00:00:40.809> no<00:00:41.260> there's<00:00:41.950> a<00:00:42.010> bias<00:00:42.250> to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
so it's not an auto no there's a bias to

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.510 
so it's not an auto no there's a bias to
close<00:00:42.820> which<00:00:43.180> keeps<00:00:43.810> it<00:00:43.960> legal<00:00:44.520> basically

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
close which keeps it legal basically

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.940 
close which keeps it legal basically
everywhere<00:00:45.940> you<00:00:46.840> can<00:00:47.020> see<00:00:47.050> speed<00:00:47.470> saving<00:00:47.860> a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
everywhere you can see speed saving a

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.560 
everywhere you can see speed saving a
whole<00:00:48.220> bunch<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.670> different<00:00:49.000> patterns<00:00:49.180> from

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
whole bunch of different patterns from

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.170 
whole bunch of different patterns from
us<00:00:49.780> some<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:50.950> speed<00:00:51.190> safe<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.670> based<00:00:51.910> on

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
us some of the speed safe is based on

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.290 
us some of the speed safe is based on
just<00:00:52.480> using<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.989> thumb<00:00:53.200> stud<00:00:53.530> itself<00:00:54.300> and

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
just using the thumb stud itself and

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.660 
just using the thumb stud itself and
makes<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:55.989> makes<00:00:56.590> it<00:00:56.800> really<00:00:56.980> easy<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.430> open

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
makes it makes it really easy to open

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.490 
makes it makes it really easy to open
and<00:00:57.940> close<00:00:58.030> if<00:00:58.420> you're<00:00:58.600> if<00:00:58.840> your<00:00:58.989> hands<00:00:59.290> are

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
and close if you're if your hands are

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.680 
and close if you're if your hands are
busy<00:00:59.680> if<00:01:00.219> your<00:01:00.460> left<00:01:00.700> hand<00:01:00.910> is<00:01:01.059> busy<00:01:01.390> or<00:01:01.510> your

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
busy if your left hand is busy or your

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.330 
busy if your left hand is busy or your
right<00:01:01.809> hand<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.170> busy<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.890> need<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.070> knife

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
right hand is busy and you need a knife

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.760 
right hand is busy and you need a knife
you<00:01:03.910> can<00:01:04.059> pull<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.360> out<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.629> your<00:01:04.690> pocket<00:01:04.930> pull

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
you can pull it out of your pocket pull

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.130 
you can pull it out of your pocket pull
the<00:01:05.890> knife<00:01:06.040> open<00:01:06.520> make<00:01:06.880> your<00:01:07.060> cut<00:01:07.300> and<00:01:07.509> put<00:01:08.050> it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
the knife open make your cut and put it

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.520 
the knife open make your cut and put it
back<00:01:08.259> into<00:01:08.560> your<00:01:08.619> pocket<00:01:08.830> which<00:01:09.250> would<00:01:09.490> be<00:01:09.670> so

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
back into your pocket which would be so

the helpfulness with the assisted
opening<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.729> good<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.150> you'll<00:01:16.299> see<00:01:16.510> it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
opening is really good and you'll see it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.210 
opening is really good and you'll see it
like<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.960> said<00:01:17.020> in<00:01:17.409> a<00:01:17.500> bunch<00:01:18.040> of<00:01:18.130> different

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
like I said in a bunch of different

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.960 
like I said in a bunch of different
patterns<00:01:18.850> from<00:01:19.659> full-size<00:01:20.170> knives<00:01:20.760> like<00:01:21.760> that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
patterns from full-size knives like that

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.510 
patterns from full-size knives like that
that<00:01:22.540> pan<00:01:22.810> Tobler<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.229> just<00:01:23.590> showed<00:01:23.799> you<00:01:23.830> down

it's<00:01:38.590> speed<00:01:38.950> safe<00:01:39.189> technology

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
it's speed safe technology

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.310 
it's speed safe technology
I<00:01:40.180> can't<00:01:40.450> imagine<00:01:40.540> somebody<00:01:41.020> pulling<00:01:41.200> that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
I can't imagine somebody pulling that

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.480 
I can't imagine somebody pulling that
out<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.530> their<00:01:41.619> pocket<00:01:41.890> without<00:01:42.100> getting<00:01:42.340> some

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
out of their pocket without getting some

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.749 
out of their pocket without getting some
common<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.509> yeah<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.770> does<00:01:44.950> get<00:01:45.130> comments<00:01:45.369> I

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
common it yeah it does get comments I

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.910 
common it yeah it does get comments I
mean<00:01:45.939> that<00:01:46.299> is<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.509> know<00:01:46.630> if<00:01:47.290> you<00:01:47.409> do<00:01:47.560> want<00:01:47.799> to
