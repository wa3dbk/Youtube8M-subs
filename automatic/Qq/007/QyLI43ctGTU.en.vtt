00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.990
 special theme it's about the rider 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
 rally because of such a rally need the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.590
 Participants a route with the horse

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.190
 We accompanied the participants with 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.320
 riddled and, of course, too 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.029
 mitgefiebert 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.980
 organize away from tournament courts 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.199
 some riding clubs like to be popular 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.260
 Reiter also let the riding club 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.420
 horse and friends from mosbach sound 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850

 humorous and motivated rider for the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.989

 planned rally route zugpferd 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.530
 to compete 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.840
 So it will be so that the rider is twelve 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.730
 kilometer distance rides on the way or 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.649
 four stops to cope where 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.899
 to fulfill different tasks 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.280
 are for us it was always so that he 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.719
 also between the stopps still one 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.390
 get a small task 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.180
 Before you have to solve in puzzles and in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.460
 Connection to master a course 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 solving the crossword puzzle is the one 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.990
 first task it for each two 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.130
 team is to be solved 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.890
 who collect as many points as possible 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.500
 So you have to have a horse 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.120
 is going to give everything 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.250
 every rider rallye offers again and again 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.660
 new challenges and is 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.060
 individually designed 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.530
 We always come up with a motto 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.860
 like this year for example wild wild 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.660
 You do not have to look for it on the west side 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 are built on our stopps 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.520
 the tasks are all so somewhere 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.020
 a bit too western and there must 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.790
 you just have to think about the tasks 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.560
 You have to look too 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.410
 that somehow with time 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.810
 that will not be too long 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.310
 and above all, something very important 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.979
 are the helpers that you get in the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.610
 apron because otherwise roma no rallye 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.070
 do 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.560
 Volunteers are waiting for you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.660
 explain stopps to the individual teams 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.030
 The riders were the ones to do them 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.509
 and record the results before it 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.460
 goes on no matter whether tournament rider or 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.570
 freetime rider whether beginner or 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.090
 experienced rider 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.220
 every participant has fun 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.170
 everyone can participate actually the on 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.120
 So you should not be able to sit on the horse 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.290
 to be too small but I guess so 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.120
 78 years 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.269
 best, of course, accompanied by a 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.769
 adult is perfect but participate 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.230
 anyone can really extending around tracks 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.420
 to old sick people from pony to big 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.510
 So it actually drives 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.640
 gets cold what can not participate 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.830

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.110

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.580
 be complemented on the way song texts 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.580
 sung against extra points 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.780
 we continue in joyful anticipation of the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.810

 with horseshoe throwing and archery 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.030
 the riders had to do this on the way 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.980
 and make your own bow 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.739

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.450

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.060
 the preparation for such an event 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.060

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.760

 something can happen very quickly and 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.990
 the organizer has no small one 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.030
