 Grow baby welcomes you and today I will share you; teaches the child to buy to understand 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.740
 the money's value. 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:34.140
 Teaching the child the value of money through strategies of daily life, is to teach 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.220
 complex concepts, is to eradicate unpleasant moments, is to take it to understand the 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.180
 monetary value and above all you get rid of situations as conflicting as; buy me, 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.160
 Buy me, buy me. 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 Having or not having the money is not a situation that must necessarily compensate all 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 wishes of the child regarding the shopping aspect. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.330
 If you begin to understand that this monetary notion, you begin to conform to standards, 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:16.240
 you start to discipline yourself, you start to take responsibility from a small small monetary value 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.140
 up to a monetary value that grows as the child grows. 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.420
 You just need to be willing to generate strategies in your little one, be consistent 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.860
 and above all be very firm when it comes to giving money to the child. 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.509
 For these strategies start buying the child: a box, a purse, a bag 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.980
 or an outlet to initiate the little one to conceive the monetary notion. 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.970
 If you usually give the child his allowance, his Sunday or whatever his country is called, it is very 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.210
 important that this money be evenly distributed for the rest of the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.319
 week or whether during the week, you are assigning x amount of money for 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.030
 your personal expenses or to buy when they leave as a family. 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:23.069
 And the fundamental strategy is to put part of that money in that box, in that little bag 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.069
 or in that alcancia. 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:32.069
 As long as you put some coins in this box or some bills in your wallet, 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:40.060
 the child will become responsible for their purchases, it is as simple as going shopping 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.099
 with the child, when they go out as a family or when they visit or when they go to the stationery, 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.799
 if the child has here his money will sabra and discover by the same so that it reaches him. 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:03:09.560
 The main strategy is for the child to become familiar with the different amounts 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.360
 that you are placing in that bag or in that purse and very important is that each act 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.386
 that you have or you show up to go out where you know that the child is going to ask you to buy 

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:23.200
 the child should carry his purse, because this allows him to face the situation, make 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.290
 his own purchases, and make his own purchases confronts the little one to know quantities, 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.250
 confronts the little one to make decisions, confronts him to discover if he reached him or not 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:47.319

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.200
