00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.390 

I<00:00:09.650> mixed<00:00:10.650> up<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.950> blue<00:00:11.370> brown<00:00:11.870> gray<00:00:12.870> color<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I mixed up a blue brown gray color the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.430 
I mixed up a blue brown gray color the
main<00:00:14.639> thing<00:00:14.940> here<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.389> not<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:15.870> much<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.199> color

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
main thing here is not so much the color

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.250 
main thing here is not so much the color
but<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.160> value<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.539> important<00:00:19.050> that

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
but the value it's really important that

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.529 
but the value it's really important that
you<00:00:19.410> make<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.740> tops<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.220> these<00:00:20.340> trees<00:00:20.400> as<00:00:21.150> dark

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you make the tops of these trees as dark

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
you make the tops of these trees as dark
as<00:00:21.720> possible<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:22.380> they<00:00:22.710> come<00:00:22.920> down<00:00:23.130> into<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
as possible as they come down into the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.630 
as possible as they come down into the
scene<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.600> middle<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.740> scene<00:00:26.010> we

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
scene in the middle of the scene we

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
scene in the middle of the scene we
could<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:26.939> lift<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.949> some<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
could actually lift out some of the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
could actually lift out some of the
color<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.240> could<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.630> simply<00:00:31.080> by

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
color and we could do that simply by

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.940 
color and we could do that simply by
rolling<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.189> paper<00:00:32.399> towel<00:00:32.759> along<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.800> we'll

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
rolling a paper towel along and we'll

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.100 
rolling a paper towel along and we'll
see<00:00:35.219> why<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.670> want<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> lighten<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.540> later<00:00:36.989> on

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
see why we want to lighten that later on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.850 
see why we want to lighten that later on
and<00:00:38.010> we'll<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.120> few<00:00:39.300> more<00:00:39.360> trees<00:00:39.899> doing

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and we'll put in a few more trees doing

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.090 
and we'll put in a few more trees doing
the<00:00:40.980> same<00:00:41.360> thing<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.590> trees<00:00:43.800> come<00:00:44.070> down

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the same thing as the trees come down

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.900 
the same thing as the trees come down
they<00:00:44.640> reach<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.600> spot<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> snow<00:00:46.910> cover

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
they reach some spot in the snow cover

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.930 
they reach some spot in the snow cover
that<00:00:48.480> starts<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> define<00:00:49.530> an<00:00:49.770> edge<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.430> snow<00:00:52.940> up

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that starts to define an edge of snow up

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.840 
that starts to define an edge of snow up
at<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> top<00:00:54.510> while<00:00:55.079> I'm<00:00:55.379> adding<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.370> this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
at the top while I'm adding in this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.729 
at the top while I'm adding in this
color<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.480> branches<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.050> could<00:00:58.199> also<00:00:58.379> use<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
color for branches I could also use a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.100 
color for branches I could also use a
second<00:00:59.309> brush<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.750> smaller<00:01:01.410> twigs<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
second brush to put in smaller twigs and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.520 
second brush to put in smaller twigs and
limbs<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> same<00:01:06.530> darkness

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
limbs so that I have the same darkness

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.000 
limbs so that I have the same darkness
and<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.010> same<00:01:08.250> value<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.510> two<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.869> them

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
and the same value in the two of them

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
and the same value in the two of them
there's<00:01:11.010> no<00:01:11.159> rush<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.490> take<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
there's no rush here take your time to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
there's no rush here take your time to
put<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:12.930> trees<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.490> detail

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
put these trees in with as much detail

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.890 
put these trees in with as much detail
as<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.240> wish

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
as you wish

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.160 
as you wish
try<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:16.979> give<00:01:17.130> each<00:01:17.340> tree<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.119> sense<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
try and give each tree a sense of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.649 
try and give each tree a sense of
character<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.009> its<00:01:20.189> shape<00:01:20.490> try<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> make

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
character and its shape try not to make

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.230 
character and its shape try not to make
them<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.110> same<00:01:22.640> try<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.090> them

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
them all the same try not to have them

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
them all the same try not to have them
all<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.450> same<00:01:24.930> spacing<00:01:25.759> okay<00:01:28.369> now<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> next

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
all the same spacing okay now the next

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.060 
all the same spacing okay now the next
stage<00:01:30.150> will<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.810> paint<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> dark<00:01:31.710> trees

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
stage will be to paint in the dark trees

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.690 
stage will be to paint in the dark trees
in<00:01:32.460> behind<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.860> should<00:01:34.860> point<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.369> there

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
in behind I should point out that there

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.090 
in behind I should point out that there
are<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.210> couple<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.049> large<00:01:37.350> trees<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
are a couple of large trees in the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.140 
are a couple of large trees in the
foreground<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.200> side<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
foreground here one on this side and a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
foreground here one on this side and a
couple<00:01:42.540> over<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.110> side<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> want<00:01:44.130> so

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
couple over on this side that I want so

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.380 
couple over on this side that I want so
one<00:01:44.610> again<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:46.740> I'll<00:01:47.159> put<00:01:47.399> those<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.820> after<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
one again but I'll put those in after I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
one again but I'll put those in after I
painted<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> darker<00:01:49.560> trees<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
painted the darker trees in the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.310 
painted the darker trees in the
background<00:01:50.670> I'll<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.540> paint<00:01:51.810> around<00:01:52.079> them

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
background I'll just paint around them

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.770 
background I'll just paint around them
sort<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.180> save<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:54.600> I've

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
sort of just as so as to save them I've

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
sort of just as so as to save them I've
mixed<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.470> dark<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.130> dark<00:01:56.700> green<00:01:57.090> using

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
trees and that dark color will serve me

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.589 
trees and that dark color will serve me
very<00:02:05.790> well<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:07.039> my<00:02:08.450> suggestion<00:02:09.450> of

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
very well for my suggestion of

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.040 
very well for my suggestion of
evergreens

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
evergreens

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.010 
evergreens
vally<00:02:12.050> here<00:02:12.910> now<00:02:13.910> where<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.210> come<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> small

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
vally here now where I come to a small

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.990 
vally here now where I come to a small
branch<00:02:15.320> like<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.370> much<00:02:16.580> simpler<00:02:16.910> just

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
branch like that it's much simpler just

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.110 
branch like that it's much simpler just
to<00:02:17.240> paint<00:02:17.900> over<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:22.000> like<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:24.400> keep<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.640> going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
to paint over it like so I keep on going

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.750 
to paint over it like so I keep on going
and<00:02:26.420> then<00:02:27.380> when<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.770> gets<00:02:27.950> down<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.520> damp

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
and then when that gets down to the damp

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.380 
and then when that gets down to the damp
stage

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
stage

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.410 
stage
simply<00:02:29.990> take<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> palette<00:02:30.980> knife<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.610> scrape

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
simply take a palette knife and scrape

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.500 
simply take a palette knife and scrape
the<00:02:32.450> balloon<00:02:32.840> back<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.380> again<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:34.610> whole<00:02:34.820> idea

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
the balloon back in again the whole idea

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.380 
the balloon back in again the whole idea
here<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.200> move<00:02:36.380> as<00:02:36.620> quickly<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.250> possible

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
here is to move as quickly as possible

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.420 
here is to move as quickly as possible
not<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.420> get<00:02:38.720> hung<00:02:38.930> up<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.800> whole<00:02:40.130> lot<00:02:40.400> of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
not to get hung up on a whole lot of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.780 
not to get hung up on a whole lot of
details<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.270> notice<00:02:41.870> those<00:02:42.050> tree<00:02:42.290> trunks

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
details you notice those tree trunks

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.280 
details you notice those tree trunks
that<00:02:43.790> were<00:02:43.910> dark<00:02:44.210> before<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.810> notice<00:02:45.110> how

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
that were dark before it notice how

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.560 
that were dark before it notice how
they're<00:02:45.800> all<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.190> sudden<00:02:46.520> much<00:02:47.240> lighter

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
they're all of a sudden much lighter

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.810 
they're all of a sudden much lighter
this<00:02:48.230> dark<00:02:48.560> paint<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.010> I'm<00:02:49.100> putting<00:02:49.310> on<00:02:49.550> now

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
this dark paint that I'm putting on now

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.770 
this dark paint that I'm putting on now
that<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.840> defining<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.520> shape<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:53.060> evergreens

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
that is defining the shape of evergreens

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.470 
that is defining the shape of evergreens
and<00:02:54.080> behind<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:55.010> also<00:02:55.640> making<00:02:56.000> them<00:02:56.180> look<00:02:56.420> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
and behind is also making them look a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.620 
and behind is also making them look a
lot<00:02:56.720> later<00:02:56.960> I<00:02:57.430> miss<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:58.640> about<00:02:58.970> dry<00:02:59.300> enough

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
lot later I miss just about dry enough

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.480 
lot later I miss just about dry enough
to<00:03:00.640> scrape<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.910> limb<00:03:02.150> back<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:04.130> any<00:03:04.370> other

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
to scrape that limb back and any other

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:15.880 
to scrape that limb back and any other
said<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:04.850> want<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.270> put<00:03:05.390> in<00:03:07.300> at<00:03:08.300> this<00:03:08.480> stage

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.790 

I'm<00:03:16.460> going<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.880> continue<00:03:17.360> these<00:03:17.540> across<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
I'm going to continue these across the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.640 
I'm going to continue these across the
surface<00:03:19.340> here<00:03:19.610> because<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.200> what<00:03:21.440> is

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
surface here because this is what is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.949 
surface here because this is what is
defining<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.810> top<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:25.420> ski<00:03:26.420> trail<00:03:26.690> once

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
defining the top of the ski trail once

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.340 
defining the top of the ski trail once
it<00:03:27.110> comes<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.800> top<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.310> mound<00:03:28.580> and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
it comes to the top of the mound and

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.120 
it comes to the top of the mound and
then<00:03:30.350> disappears<00:03:31.040> on<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.430> other<00:03:31.550> side<00:03:33.130> it's

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
then disappears on the other side it's

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.790 
then disappears on the other side it's
the<00:03:34.280> darkness<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.940> these<00:03:35.120> trees<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:36.680> are

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
the darkness of these trees that are

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.890 
the darkness of these trees that are
doing<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:39.110> dark<00:03:39.500> area<00:03:39.860> has<00:03:40.900> defined

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
doing it so this dark area has defined

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.850 
doing it so this dark area has defined
the<00:03:42.260> top<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.860> snow<00:03:43.190> as<00:03:43.900> well<00:03:44.900> as<00:03:45.200> the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
the top of the snow as well as the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.060 
the top of the snow as well as the
deciduous<00:03:46.790> trees<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.540> are<00:03:48.410> growing<00:03:48.590> out<00:03:48.890> of

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
deciduous trees that are growing out of

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.190 
deciduous trees that are growing out of
it
