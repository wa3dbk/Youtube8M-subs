00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.790
 quick 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.859
 quick 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.460
 3 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 p 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 language 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.210
 this is my first poll 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.390
 four regions are also the target 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.970
 christelle monier for precisely i'm sure the german club motto 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.700
 Swiss 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.680
 so percent I do not think that legal assembly 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.110
 volleyball demoustier cartridges and just like that 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.880
 % and for now it's the first video and I was in europe 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.050
 currencies and if I finally find it I hope 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.290
 so that for the field to relocate so 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.540
 I will cause 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 for the knowledge 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820
 yes no it's well known 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.550
 steve sambatra double tournament 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.289
 so 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.809
 my economic room I do not think the recoverable 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.129
 So here is second year 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.309
 in the voice is too no longer a bike ride 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.099
 but who are these risks really is not bad 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.599
 % and platinum I think the colleges it's going to give something 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.459
 good 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.480
 and for 100 m some 10 cents of 10 897 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.639
 here I am super happy 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.439
 here's the third part other than I thought it was mission impossible 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.950
 but it's a stable currency and no longer a history textbook 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.430
 are they set off against lies and when we see the day on the 11th 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.479
 too much but good 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.329
 these are the instructions 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.799
 so that's great 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.350
 a third year super happy 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.999
 as to the world 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:58.439
 the end of the day and so 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.859
 then they have three state monnier 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.779
 in europe the mayor of aurillac so on the video is shown only the 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.769
 lead 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.079
 so that's it's a choice I made 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.339
 Iaaf three weeks when I received my comeback players 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.829
 the objects found dead but we felt the Napoleon 3% of the money 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.829
 so that's going to attend on it if the fia for the video will not be 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.079
 searched too much if you enjoyed only top quality of my laptop so 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.220
 what a terrible work of art 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.879
 the lack of innovation so the 10% or 20% 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.359
 Thursday at the next worst but it's like at home it's always nice 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.479
 no more 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:38.339
 the world
