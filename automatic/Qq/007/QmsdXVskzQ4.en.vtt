stereotypical<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.360> think<00:02:27.570> that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
stereotypical because I think that

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.960 
stereotypical because I think that

everyone has yet but I just thought like

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.670 
everyone has yet but I just thought like
if<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.270> don't<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:30.570> an<00:02:30.690> 45<00:02:30.900> or<00:02:31.410> if<00:02:31.530> you're

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
if you don't have an 45 or if you're

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.910 
if you don't have an 45 or if you're
getting<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.490> save<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.930> know<00:02:34.080> or<00:02:34.380> if
