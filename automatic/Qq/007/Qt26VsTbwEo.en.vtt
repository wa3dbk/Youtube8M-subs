00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
why were the few elements are those

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.270 
why were the few elements are those
those<00:00:56.629> no<00:00:56.899> sessions<00:00:57.379> it's<00:00:57.800> no<00:00:57.949> component

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
those no sessions it's no component

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.669 
those no sessions it's no component
comprised<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:59.059> three<00:00:59.809> events<00:01:00.109> or<00:01:00.469> three

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
comprised of three events or three

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.399 
comprised of three events or three
disciplines<00:01:01.100> there<00:01:01.609> was<00:01:01.729> a<00:01:01.760> speed<00:01:02.749> component

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
disciplines there was a speed component

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.860 
disciplines there was a speed component
a<00:01:03.620> technical<00:01:04.220> component<00:01:04.880> Mimi's<00:01:05.120> Lola's<00:01:05.570> yes

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
a technical component Mimi's Lola's yes

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.620 
a technical component Mimi's Lola's yes
and<00:01:06.140> then<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.040> kids<00:01:07.340> component<00:01:07.910> in<00:01:08.030> gs<00:01:08.420> and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
and then it kids component in gs and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.870 
and then it kids component in gs and
slalom<00:01:08.870> as<00:01:09.140> well<00:01:09.460> so<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:10.490> think<00:01:10.610> there<00:01:10.850> was

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
slalom as well so I think there was

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.670 
slalom as well so I think there was
something<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:11.390> safety<00:01:11.840> with<00:01:12.020> Darren<00:01:12.380> adding

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
something on safety with Darren adding

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.220 
something on safety with Darren adding
very<00:01:13.250> very<00:01:13.880> much<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:14.300> we<00:01:14.510> thought<00:01:14.960> we're<00:01:15.200> a

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
very very much so we thought we're a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.740 
very very much so we thought we're a
good<00:01:15.860> safety<00:01:16.190> program<00:01:16.760> or<00:01:16.970> safety<00:01:17.180> component

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
good safety program or safety component

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.440 
good safety program or safety component
of<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.960> excellent<00:01:18.410> on<00:01:18.680> hill<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.090> gives<00:01:20.240> a

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
of the excellent on hill so it gives a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.960 
of the excellent on hill so it gives a
more<00:01:21.140> three<00:01:21.650> dimensional<00:01:21.680> approach<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.880> it

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
more three dimensional approach to it

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.030 
more three dimensional approach to it
rather<00:01:23.150> than<00:01:23.300> just<00:01:23.510> indoors<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.620> obviously

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
rather than just indoors and obviously

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.130 
rather than just indoors and obviously
that<00:01:25.100> will<00:01:25.370> count<00:01:25.790> for<00:01:25.880> risk<00:01:26.270> management<00:01:26.360> and

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
that will count for risk management and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.020 
that will count for risk management and
the<00:01:27.170> credits<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.800> education<00:01:28.310> now<00:01:28.460> how<00:01:28.880> about
