late father as a racing company that's
all<00:04:09.500> they<00:04:09.650> did<00:04:09.830> then<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:10.310> then<00:04:10.940> as<00:04:11.270> as<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:12.020> grew

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
all they did then and then as as it grew

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.590 
all they did then and then as as it grew
through<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.680> 80s<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.250> 90s<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.420> so

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
through the 80s and the 90s and and so

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.840 
through the 80s and the 90s and and so
on<00:04:14.630> it<00:04:14.960> kind<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.290> got<00:04:15.470> into<00:04:15.740> other<00:04:15.950> areas<00:04:16.459> and

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
on it kind of got into other areas and

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.820 
on it kind of got into other areas and
maybe<00:04:17.299> we<00:04:17.510> let<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.810> racing<00:04:18.170> go<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.350> little<00:04:18.709> bit

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
maybe we let the racing go a little bit
