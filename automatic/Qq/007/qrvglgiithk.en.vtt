00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
those things that are critical such as

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.270 
those things that are critical such as
thunderstorms<00:02:35.439> the<00:02:36.439> next<00:02:36.739> element<00:02:37.159> is

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
thunderstorms the next element is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.280 
thunderstorms the next element is
temperature<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.269> they'll<00:02:38.659> give<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.989> range

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
temperature and they'll give you a range

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.379 
temperature and they'll give you a range
of<00:02:39.439> temperatures<00:02:40.010> for<00:02:40.040> your<00:02:40.489> particular<00:02:41.090> fire

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
of temperatures for your particular fire

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.839 
of temperatures for your particular fire
weather<00:02:41.599> area<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.290> they'll<00:02:42.920> oftentimes<00:02:43.340> give

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
weather area and they'll oftentimes give

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.910 
weather area and they'll oftentimes give
you<00:02:43.969> a<00:02:44.000> trend<00:02:44.540> whether<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.409> going<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.590> be<00:02:45.680> 5

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
you a trend whether it's going to be 5

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.429 
you a trend whether it's going to be 5
degrees<00:02:46.310> warmer<00:02:46.879> or<00:02:47.000> 5<00:02:47.180> degrees<00:02:47.480> cooler<00:02:47.750> and

degrees warmer or 5 degrees cooler and

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.970 
degrees warmer or 5 degrees cooler and
so<00:02:48.709> on<00:02:48.919> the<00:02:49.819> next<00:02:50.150> one<00:02:50.329> is<00:02:50.659> humidity<00:02:51.139> they'll

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
so on the next one is humidity they'll

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.170 
so on the next one is humidity they'll
give<00:02:52.129> you<00:02:52.220> again<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.639> range<00:02:52.909> of<00:02:53.120> humidity

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
give you again a range of humidity

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.559 
give you again a range of humidity
values<00:02:53.799> along<00:02:54.799> with<00:02:54.859> the<00:02:55.099> trend<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.730> after

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
values along with the trend and after

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.839 
values along with the trend and after
that<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.230> wind<00:02:57.470> with<00:02:58.189> the<00:02:58.220> winds<00:02:58.669> you'll

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
to the ground so again what I'd be

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.749 
to the ground so again what I'd be
listening<00:03:51.590> for<00:03:51.769> there<00:03:51.979> is<00:03:52.220> if<00:03:52.430> there's<00:03:52.609> a

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:52.759 
listening for there is if there's a

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.390 
listening for there is if there's a

Haines of five or six moderate or high
those<00:03:56.239> are<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:56.479> times<00:03:56.750> I'd<00:03:56.989> be<00:03:57.109> really

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
those are the times I'd be really

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.830 
those are the times I'd be really
concerned<00:03:57.680> about<00:03:57.799> if<00:03:58.400> it's<00:03:58.669> a<00:03:58.790> two<00:03:59.060> three<00:03:59.750> or

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
concerned about if it's a two three or

typically<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.199> afternoons<00:04:51.800> it'll<00:04:52.160> be

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
typically in the afternoons it'll be

quite<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.389> bit<00:04:59.690> they<00:05:00.169> might<00:05:00.349> just<00:05:00.530> be<00:05:00.620> a<00:05:00.710> few

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
quite a bit they might just be a few

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.680 
quite a bit they might just be a few
hundred<00:05:01.159> feet<00:05:01.340> that's<00:05:02.090> important<00:05:02.599> because

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
hundred feet that's important because

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.860 
hundred feet that's important because
the<00:05:03.500> higher<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.430> mixing<00:05:04.789> height<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.569> greater

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
the higher the mixing height the greater

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.760 
the higher the mixing height the greater
the<00:05:06.050> instability<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.840> so<00:05:09.110> with<00:05:09.349> that<00:05:09.560> you're

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
the instability and so with that you're

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.200 
the instability and so with that you're
gonna<00:05:09.860> probably<00:05:10.280> see<00:05:10.400> more<00:05:10.550> fire<00:05:10.940> activity

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
gonna probably see more fire activity

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.870 
gonna probably see more fire activity
fire<00:05:11.840> behavior<00:05:12.319> with<00:05:13.009> the<00:05:13.190> greater<00:05:13.400> mixing

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880

heights<00:05:14.319> transport<00:05:15.319> winds<00:05:15.470> are<00:05:15.650> important

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
heights transport winds are important

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.559 
heights transport winds are important
because<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.970> want<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.240> know<00:05:17.360> where<00:05:17.539> that

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
because you want to know where that

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.089 
because you want to know where that
smokes<00:05:18.199> going<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:18.530> be<00:05:18.620> going

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
smokes going to be going

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.450 
smokes going to be going
so<00:05:19.430> that'll<00:05:19.789> the<00:05:20.060> average<00:05:20.690> winds<00:05:21.500> within<00:05:22.159> that

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
so that'll the average winds within that

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.339 
so that'll the average winds within that
mixed<00:05:22.880> layer<00:05:23.150> as<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.960> whether<00:05:24.110> they're<00:05:24.259> gonna

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
mixed layer as to whether they're gonna

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:25.930 
mixed layer as to whether they're gonna
be<00:05:24.470> coming<00:05:24.680> out<00:05:24.800> of<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:24.979> south<00:05:25.250> or<00:05:25.520> north<00:05:25.550> and

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
be coming out of the south or north and

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.760 
be coming out of the south or north and
they'll<00:05:26.330> give<00:05:26.479> you<00:05:26.599> a<00:05:26.630> wind<00:05:26.870> speed<00:05:27.169> there<00:05:27.409> so

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
they'll give you a wind speed there so

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.460 
they'll give you a wind speed there so
if<00:05:28.039> you<00:05:28.430> have<00:05:28.550> high<00:05:28.849> mixing<00:05:29.330> heights<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.930> high

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
if you have high mixing heights and high

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.290 
if you have high mixing heights and high
transport<00:05:31.099> winds<00:05:31.340> you're<00:05:31.819> gonna<00:05:31.909> have<00:05:32.120> pretty

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
transport winds you're gonna have pretty

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.629 
transport winds you're gonna have pretty
