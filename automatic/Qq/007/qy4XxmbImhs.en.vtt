pass and attempt to refined that nether
portal<00:01:43.950> which<00:01:45.439> took<00:01:46.439> me<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.070> good<00:01:47.130> while<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
portal which took me a good while to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.800 
portal which took me a good while to
locate<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> first<00:01:48.540> place<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:50.509> now<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.720> I

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
locate in the first place but now that I

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.469 
locate in the first place but now that I
know<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.409> exists<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.670> generally<00:01:54.090> in

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
know that it exists and is generally in

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.010 
know that it exists and is generally in
this<00:01:54.720> direction<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.619> feel<00:01:55.920> emboldened<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:57.020> push

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
this direction I feel emboldened to push

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.660 
this direction I feel emboldened to push
forward

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
forward

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.960 
forward
and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.759> might<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.880> gone

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
and I think I actually might have gone

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.210 
and I think I actually might have gone
around<00:02:03.180> further<00:02:03.630> hugging<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.290> wall<00:02:04.950> back

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
around further hugging that wall back

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.029 
around further hugging that wall back
here<00:02:05.580> oh<00:02:05.970> good<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> shelf<00:02:07.110> from<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.530> monsters

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
here oh good a shelf from which monsters

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.180 
here oh good a shelf from which monsters

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
may fall up onto me I think I actually

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.430 
may fall up onto me I think I actually
went<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.849> way<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.840> first<00:02:13.140> time

hoping to light up enough of this that

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.300 
hoping to light up enough of this that
less<00:03:47.930> creatures<00:03:48.380> might<00:03:48.560> attack<00:03:48.890> me<00:03:48.920> in<00:03:49.130> the

less creatures might attack me in the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.040 
less creatures might attack me in the
future<00:03:49.459> because<00:03:50.120> eventually<00:03:50.510> I'm<00:03:50.810> gonna<00:03:50.900> have

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
future because eventually I'm gonna have

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.229 
future because eventually I'm gonna have
to<00:03:51.140> build<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.380> rail<00:03:51.590> line<00:03:51.830> through<00:03:52.130> here<00:03:52.430> if<00:03:52.580> the

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
to build a rail line through here if the

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.850 
to build a rail line through here if the
nether<00:03:53.420> takes<00:03:53.660> anywhere<00:03:54.020> near<00:03:54.290> as<00:03:54.440> long<00:03:54.590> as<00:03:54.739> it

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
nether takes anywhere near as long as it

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.229 
nether takes anywhere near as long as it
did<00:03:54.980> in<00:03:55.010> legendary<00:03:55.580> that's<00:03:55.850> going<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.090> be<00:03:56.209> a

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
did in legendary that's going to be a

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.900 
did in legendary that's going to be a
non-negotiable<00:03:57.940> sort<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.060> proposition<00:04:00.910> yeah

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
non-negotiable sort of proposition yeah

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.850 
non-negotiable sort of proposition yeah
that's<00:04:02.120> right<00:04:02.360> be<00:04:03.110> hit<00:04:03.290> in<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.410> face<00:04:03.620> with<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
that's right be hit in the face with a

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.350 
that's right be hit in the face with a
sword<00:04:04.190> several<00:04:04.580> times<00:04:04.820> see<00:04:05.750> how<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:05.930> like<00:04:06.140> it

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
sword several times see how you like it

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.840 
sword several times see how you like it
not<00:04:08.360> that<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.660> do<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.110> me<00:04:09.260> but<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:10.730> know

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
not that you do that to me but you know

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.890 
not that you do that to me but you know
I<00:04:10.880> just<00:04:11.000> think<00:04:11.209> it's<00:04:11.390> interesting<00:04:11.540> to

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
I just think it's interesting to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.720 
I just think it's interesting to
experiment<00:04:12.440> sometimes<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:13.040> should<00:04:13.310> see<00:04:13.580> how

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
experiment sometimes you should see how

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.830 
experiment sometimes you should see how
you<00:04:13.790> like<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:17.829> it's<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:19.100> horizon<00:04:20.030> broadening

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
you like it it's a horizon broadening

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.860 
you like it it's a horizon broadening
experience<00:04:21.910> okay<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:22.970> we<00:04:23.150> got<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.419> dark<00:04:23.660> pit

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
experience okay so we got that dark pit

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.210 
experience okay so we got that dark pit
there<00:04:24.080> that<00:04:24.410> I'm<00:04:24.500> not<00:04:24.650> going<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:24.890> do<00:04:24.979> anything

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
there that I'm not going to do anything

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.360 
there that I'm not going to do anything
about<00:04:26.169> we<00:04:27.169> got<00:04:27.320> that<00:04:27.350> pillar<00:04:27.830> there<00:04:28.070> which

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
about we got that pillar there which

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.070 
about we got that pillar there which
does<00:04:28.640> not<00:04:28.790> have<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.180> ladder<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.660> remember

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
does not have the ladder that I remember

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.559 
does not have the ladder that I remember
building<00:04:30.470> from<00:04:30.770> last<00:04:31.010> time

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:44.749 

oh<00:04:41.449> good<00:04:42.449> we<00:04:42.659> have<00:04:42.839> skeletons<00:04:43.439> down<00:04:43.830> there<00:04:44.129> and

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
oh good we have skeletons down there and

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.600 
oh good we have skeletons down there and
I'm<00:04:45.149> already<00:04:45.360> running<00:04:45.869> low<00:04:46.169> on<00:04:46.199> torches<00:04:49.610> well

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
I'm already running low on torches well

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.219 
I'm already running low on torches well
I'm<00:04:50.909> thinking<00:04:50.939> that<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.449> might<00:04:51.569> have<00:04:51.869> found<00:04:51.899> a

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
I'm thinking that I might have found a

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.249 
I'm thinking that I might have found a
different<00:04:52.469> area<00:04:53.129> now<00:04:53.399> than<00:04:54.029> the<00:04:54.240> one<00:04:54.270> which<00:04:54.899> I

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
different area now than the one which I

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.839 
different area now than the one which I
died<00:04:55.589> which<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:56.909> bad<00:04:57.389> because<00:04:57.419> I<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:59.610> place

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
died which is bad because I this place

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.269 
died which is bad because I this place
is<00:05:00.059> massive<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:00.809> I<00:05:01.259> don't<00:05:01.439> necessarily<00:05:02.099> need

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:02.279 
is massive and I don't necessarily need

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.029 
is massive and I don't necessarily need
to<00:05:02.339> go<00:05:02.580> anywhere<00:05:02.819> new<00:05:03.179> in<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.509> oh<00:05:03.800> good<00:05:04.800> there's

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
to go anywhere new in it oh good there's

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.629 
to go anywhere new in it oh good there's
