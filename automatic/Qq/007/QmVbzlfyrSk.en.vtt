thing<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.329> got<00:00:45.510> me<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> little<00:00:45.899> bit

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
thing that kind of got me a little bit

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.709 
thing that kind of got me a little bit
is<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.680> angle<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.309> how<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> angle<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.329> was

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
is the angle of how to angle it so I was

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
is the angle of how to angle it so I was
trying<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> work<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
trying to work that a little bit but it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
trying to work that a little bit but it
did<00:00:50.760> illuminate<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> table<00:00:51.930> fine<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
did illuminate on the table fine and I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.049 
did illuminate on the table fine and I
thought<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.280> fun<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.699> me<00:00:53.850> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059

I<00:01:10.020> did<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> review<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.310> another<00:01:11.610> video

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
I did a review on this in another video

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.000 
I did a review on this in another video
I'll<00:01:12.150> put<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> link<00:01:12.659> below<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.710> video

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
I'll put the link below for that video

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.760 
I'll put the link below for that video
but<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.880> works<00:01:15.299> great<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> has<00:01:16.560> been

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
but this works great and it has been

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
but this works great and it has been
working<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> years<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.790> me<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
working over the years for me but it is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.020 
working over the years for me but it is
bulkier<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:20.159> initial<00:01:20.310> thought<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.820> well

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
bulkier so my initial thought was well

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
bulkier so my initial thought was well
the<00:01:21.360> projection<00:01:21.869> will<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.080> great<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> take

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the projection will be great to take

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
the projection will be great to take
on-the-go<00:01:23.070> especially<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> business<00:01:23.939> traveler

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
on-the-go especially a business traveler

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
on-the-go especially a business traveler
could<00:01:24.450> throw<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.869> their<00:01:24.990> work<00:01:25.170> bag<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
could throw it in their work bag and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.590 
could throw it in their work bag and
throw<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.310> their<00:01:26.400> purse<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
throw it in their purse and have a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
throw it in their purse and have a
keyboard<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.250> about<00:01:29.460> about

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
keyboard on the go this is about about

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
keyboard on the go this is about about
the<00:01:29.970> best<00:01:30.210> positioning<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.049> could<00:01:31.439> get

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the best positioning that I could get

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.999 
the best positioning that I could get
for<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.820> comfort<00:01:33.119> level<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
for my comfort level with it so it's a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
for my comfort level with it so it's a
little<00:01:35.340> uncomfortable<00:01:35.820> typing<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.750> things

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
little uncomfortable typing and things

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.480 
little uncomfortable typing and things
with<00:01:37.110> me<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> does<00:01:37.950> make<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
with me because it does make a lot of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.179 
with me because it does make a lot of
errors<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.030> things<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.590> comes

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
errors and things like that but it comes

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.920 
errors and things like that but it comes
with<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.400> user<00:01:41.670> guide<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.270> comes<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> US

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
with a user guide it comes with a US

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
with a user guide it comes with a US
plug<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.189> use<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
plug but you don't have to use that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.899 
plug but you don't have to use that
along<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.490> actual<00:01:47.490> projection

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
along with the actual projection

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.870 
along with the actual projection
keyboard<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> very

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
keyboard and so it really is a very

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.240 
keyboard and so it really is a very
compact<00:01:51.390> packaging<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.100> was

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
compact packaging so you know that was

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.370 
compact packaging so you know that was
neat<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.030> I'm<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.570> saying<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
neat about it and I'm not saying that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.679 
neat about it and I'm not saying that
this<00:01:55.590> wasn't<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.579> not<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:57.090> product<00:01:57.360> but

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
this wasn't it's not a good product but

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.770 
this wasn't it's not a good product but
for<00:01:57.719> me<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.350> uses<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.310> 149<00:02:00.060> dollars<00:02:00.390> it's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
for me and my uses for 149 dollars it's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.530 
for me and my uses for 149 dollars it's
a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.649> pricey<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.149> works<00:02:03.329> with

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
a little pricey and so it works with

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.560 
a little pricey and so it works with
Android<00:02:03.780> Windows<00:02:04.380> iOS<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.490> Blackberry<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
Android Windows iOS and Blackberry and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
Android Windows iOS and Blackberry and
the<00:02:07.200> thing<00:02:07.380> my<00:02:07.560> husband<00:02:08.009> said<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.489> he<00:02:08.640> was

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the thing my husband said and he was

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.940 
the thing my husband said and he was
like<00:02:08.849> after<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.330> were<00:02:10.200> playing<00:02:10.530> around<00:02:10.679> with

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
like after we were playing around with

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.350 
like after we were playing around with
it<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.310> he<00:02:11.459> said<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.910> price<00:02:12.120> he

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
it you know he said for the price he

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.270 
it you know he said for the price he
really<00:02:12.569> didn't<00:02:12.780> feel<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
really didn't feel that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.309 
really didn't feel that
was<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.730> know<00:02:13.850> kind<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.209> worth<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.720> price<00:02:14.959> and

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
was you know kind of worth the price and

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.570 
was you know kind of worth the price and
I<00:02:15.380> thought<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.770> same<00:02:15.950> thing<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.250> thought<00:02:16.430> that

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
I thought the same thing I thought that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.850 
I thought the same thing I thought that
you<00:02:16.670> know<00:02:16.790> for<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.930> capabilities<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.620> you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
you know for the capabilities that you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.460 
you know for the capabilities that you
have<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:19.700> what<00:02:19.940> we<00:02:20.569> typically<00:02:20.959> would<00:02:21.170> use

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
have and for what we typically would use

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.830 
have and for what we typically would use
it<00:02:21.620> for<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:22.220> doesn't<00:02:22.819> work<00:02:22.940> well<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.480> see<00:02:23.690> how

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
it for it doesn't work well you see how

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.620 
it for it doesn't work well you see how
far<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.170> have<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.410> keep<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.830> from<00:02:25.130> me<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.640> you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
use it in front of me so that was kind

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.340 
use it in front of me so that was kind
of<00:02:30.590> an<00:02:30.709> issue<00:02:30.860> there<00:02:31.220> but<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.420> fun<00:02:32.900> kind

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
of an issue there but it is a fun kind

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.710 
of an issue there but it is a fun kind
of<00:02:33.410> gadget<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.520> even<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:35.090> know<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.390> kind<00:02:35.630> of

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
of gadget to even you know just kind of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.990 
of gadget to even you know just kind of
check<00:02:35.930> out<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.280> know<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.430> think<00:02:37.580> for<00:02:37.910> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
check out but you know I think for the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.960 
check out but you know I think for the
price<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.600> don't<00:02:39.140> think<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:40.760> would<00:02:40.940> have

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
price I don't think that we would have

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.400 
price I don't think that we would have
made<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.360> purchase<00:02:41.600> if<00:02:41.870> we<00:02:41.989> would<00:02:42.140> have<00:02:42.200> read

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
made this purchase if we would have read

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.930 
made this purchase if we would have read
read<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.830> reviews<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.370> things<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:43.700> that

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
read the reviews and things like that

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.390 
read the reviews and things like that
before<00:02:44.120> but<00:02:44.810> again<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.709> my<00:02:45.830> husband<00:02:46.100> said<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
before but again like my husband said it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.979 
before but again like my husband said it
was<00:02:46.489> just<00:02:46.700> something<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.060> when<00:02:47.540> he<00:02:47.630> saw<00:02:47.840> it

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
was just something that when he saw it

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.570 
was just something that when he saw it
it<00:02:48.080> intrigued<00:02:48.470> him<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.980> he<00:02:49.220> thought<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.430> he

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
it intrigued him and he thought that he

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.060 
it intrigued him and he thought that he
would<00:02:50.390> like<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.019> I<00:02:51.170> did<00:02:51.590> too<00:02:51.860> when<00:02:52.040> I

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
would like it and I did too when I

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.800 
would like it and I did too when I
opened<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.370> Box<00:02:52.550> sounds<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:52.880> wow<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:53.630> when

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
opened the Box sounds like wow but when

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.530 
opened the Box sounds like wow but when
both<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.200> us<00:02:54.380> got<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.709> playing<00:02:54.920> with<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.190> like

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
we don't know so we definitely wanted to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.430 
we don't know so we definitely wanted to
pass<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.790> along<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.480> because<00:02:59.840> if<00:03:00.230> you're
