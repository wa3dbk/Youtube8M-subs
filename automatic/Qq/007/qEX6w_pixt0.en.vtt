00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.660
 very good kids that better than elton 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.080
 jhon to present a weapon of origin 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.350
 English with his great success made in england 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.480
 made in england and I'm talking very 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.860
 short because we are at eleven o'clock and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.360
 half my brother is sleeping I have 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.800
 I've been watching etcetera I have to double 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.080
 three videos because well you know that 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.989
 I'm going on vacation you saw it in my 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.210
 previous video thank you very much 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.610
 if you have seen it and that if not then 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.080
 which guests want to go good we are going to 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.910
 start in principle let's say this 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.800
 weapon is certainly very interesting since 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.449
 that has suffered in its history huge 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.930
 transformations because its version 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.519
 original was basically a potato 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.110
 basically it was more effective as a club 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.659
 that as a weapon according to the information that 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.339
 I have been able to obtain is that what defines 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.750
 at least to his second version both in 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.670
 the reality as in the game is the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.560
 precision which we will pay with its low 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.270
 cadence of course but before the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.310
 technical aspects let's the interesting 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.080
 we go to history as always 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.460
 You will have the story on screen 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.260
 perhaps you lose you want to follow her 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.740
 etc 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.530
 ls a 80 in English means small arms 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 for the night in haiti or for 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.780
 1980 and then forgive me a very 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.760
 subliminal is that small arms look like 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.490
 say short arms but good 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 to 80 is an assault rifle type hit of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.260
 caliber 5.56 x 45 NATO designed and 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:45.510
 produced until 1988 by royal small and 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.530
 to invoice and in anfield uk in 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.450
 1988 production of the weapon was 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.540
 transferred to the weapons factory 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.160
 royal urns of nottingham leicester land 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.260
 6 systems missiles in ballot boxes in 2000 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.420
 confided to heckler koch or like noses 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.580
 followed as they say I have been told of 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.200
 ezeiza if the task of improving this rifle 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.150
 the changes occurred mainly in 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.130
 the improvement of alarm capabilities and 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.050
 sociability including manager of 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.570
 pre-engineered manual recharging system 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.190
 Modified shifter handle 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.320
 assembly and exhaust gas 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.870
 redesigned what resulted in a very 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.820
 substantial improvement of the kick produced 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.070
 in the operation of the rifle in burst mode 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.530
 where the alarm maneuverability and higher 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.920
 stability down you have the first 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.860
 image in 85 to 1 and in the second the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.590
 85 to 2 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.100
 and we go to the next source section 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.810
 on the ground assault rifle 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.650
 bullet speed 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.380
 940 meters second cadence from 610 to 775 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.650
 rounds per minute length of 785 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.570
 mm bullet type 5.56 x 45 of the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.280
 N otan as we just ccoo let's see now 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.070
 what would your statistics be in more than 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.080
 thousand three cadence of 650 rounds per 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.450
 minute forgiveness fast recharge time 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.300
 of 280 seconds and slow three seconds 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.700
 reach of 900 meters recoil 0.2 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.190
 up 0 with 28 towards both 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.380
 sides hip game is two points 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.540
 bullet speed 600 meters second and 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.630
 his model of damage is that of the 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.390
 assault rifles with this caliber of 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.420
 25% of the year the 8 meters and 18.4 for 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.760
 the 50 meters basically what we have 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.680
 between hands is the typical bulb of 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.390
 battlefield 3 hip fire more 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.340
 precise recharge slower and one 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.230
 bullet velocity very high being the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.920
 last one of the fastest in the game 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.230
 but the biggest one of him to a 3 with 670 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.400
 meters second today we are analyzing 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.590
 by the way another weapon 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.269
 tlf but this time is one of the two that 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 we could unlock with back to 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.980
 karkand completing the Russian mission 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.049
 Professional consisting of 100 deaths 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.959
 with assault rifle 20 deaths with the 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.090
 throws hanging pepo and win 5 rounds of 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.829
 patrol fish by the way to the lord of 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.900
 dais that puts name to missions 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.400
 a congratulations because I do not understand 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.459
 what does professional Russian have with this 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.200
 but well it does not matter what else leaves the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.299
 last requirement is quite difficult 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.250
 for the theme that you apart from winning 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.409
 the rounds find the server that is 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.810
 what keeps this weapon far from being 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.190
 most common in the online I believe the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.930
 I leave in the description a server 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.060
 seven patrols and they are a bit 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.130
 full and helped a little I put my 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.889
 granite of sand we went to the section of 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.389
 accessories and secondary as always 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.370
 I'm going to give two combinations in arms 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.169
 we have in both forgiveness we have a 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.000
 accessory in common the heavy cannon 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.190
 because we always have it because 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.110
 because this weapon is undoubtedly oriented 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.580
 to precision any weapon that 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.960
 we need precision with her 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.690
 we will have to put that there is a heavy 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.820
 because it will make us more precise and 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.949
 they will keep our damage for more 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.479
 distance after we have both 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.190
 combinations one would be only with the 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.139
 heavy cannon and without any additional accessories 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.110
 another would be with the heavy barrel and with the 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.449
 type Prune because I saw that in this 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.830
 Weapon we can not access the hanging rail 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.830
 and because he bipod 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.280
 simply if we need it, it serves us 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.830
 and if not then is there better than on 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.780
 missing, not then, let's move on 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.070
 to high schools as secondary or the 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.540
 method of selection is not entirely 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.850
 effective since we have a weapon 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.590
 slow but it has a standard damage 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.970
 so we can use the one we want or 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.640
 has not been recommending that you take a 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.430
 secondary school can be lage 18 a 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.530
 93 me in this case I'm using the root 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.210
 but there's no reason to use it 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.970
 I know you are a fan of the network like 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.730
 me to look the reflex lion side lope 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.620
 every 34 the reflex will let us aim 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.290
 much better since it has the little dot 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.820
 red we do not have the cross of the cobra side 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.920
 it has an increase and a half what we 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.150
 allows you to see better in the distance and 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.970
 of three with four obviously has 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.160
 increases but we will only use it in 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.960
 conquest because for example between cto 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.920
 in assault we can meet with 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.080
 situations 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.550
 short range then this looks 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.320
 we will have to move the mouse a lot more 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.330
 to face our enemies to 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.740
 short range in short a weapon 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.270
 dedicated to precision always with 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.950
 heavy cannon and with the sight that gives us the 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.420
 It also wins us the advantage over 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.700
 shoot from the hip because it's a 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.110
 bullpen so I'm leaving 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.850
 comments on the next what do you want 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.200
 that you analyze and comment if I can not 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.430
 answer also watch terior video 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.320
 since there explained the problem 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.060
 I have now that I say goodbye to you 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.170
 thanks for being there and asking you 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.180
 that if you liked the video it has 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.680
 learned something etcetera votes the video 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.130
 to be able to reach more people until the 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.130
 next guide
