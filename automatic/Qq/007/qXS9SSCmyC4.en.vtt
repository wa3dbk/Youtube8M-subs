squeal shim on each brake pad so we

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
squeal shim on each brake pad so we
notice<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.810> had<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.170> missing<00:01:25.590> parts

we<00:01:32.820> did<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:34.549> we<00:01:35.549> what<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> slide

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
we did is we what they think the slide

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
we did is we what they think the slide
pins<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> lubricate<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> slide<00:01:37.799> pins

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
pins out to lubricate the slide pins

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
pins out to lubricate the slide pins
these<00:01:39.090> pins<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.450> supposed<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.840> very<00:01:39.960> easily

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
these pins I supposed to be very easily

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.830 
these pins I supposed to be very easily
movable<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:42.000> found<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> very<00:01:42.540> difficult

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
movable and we found it very difficult

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.219 
movable and we found it very difficult
to<00:01:43.799> pull<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> pin<00:01:44.970> took<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.659> great<00:01:45.899> amount<00:01:46.110> of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
to pull this pin took a great amount of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.950 
to pull this pin took a great amount of
force<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.619> pull<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.950> pin<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.780> once<00:01:48.780> i've

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
force to pull this pin out once i've

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.679 
force to pull this pin out once i've
removed<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> pin<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.210> found<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.390> rubber

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
removed the pin I found this rubber

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.960 
removed the pin I found this rubber
bushing<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.520> factory<00:01:53.939> calls<00:01:54.210> it

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
starting to build up on top of it so we

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.150 
starting to build up on top of it so we
clean<00:03:35.150> all<00:03:35.300> this<00:03:35.510> rust<00:03:35.840> off<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.380> then<00:03:37.040> we're

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
clean all this rust off and then we're

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160

vehicle apart and out and we've a look

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.880 
vehicle apart and out and we've a look
at<00:03:51.800> things<00:03:52.010> we've<00:03:52.550> ordered<00:03:52.850> our<00:03:52.970> new<00:03:53.120> parts<00:03:53.890> so

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
at things we've ordered our new parts so

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.320 
at things we've ordered our new parts so
as<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.130> know<00:03:55.250> by<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.400> diagram<00:03:55.790> we<00:03:55.940> were<00:03:56.060> missing

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
as you know by a diagram we were missing

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.990 
as you know by a diagram we were missing
some<00:03:56.510> parts<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.860> now<00:04:00.980> we<00:04:01.040> have<00:04:01.280> two<00:04:01.550> Toyota

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
some parts so now we have two Toyota

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.480 
some parts so now we have two Toyota
factory<00:04:02.270> rotors<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.050> car<00:04:03.230> came<00:04:03.470> with<00:04:03.530> we

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
factory rotors that the car came with we

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.270 
factory rotors that the car came with we
have<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.760> total<00:04:04.970> factory<00:04:05.450> brake<00:04:05.660> pads<00:04:06.280> which

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
have the total factory brake pads which

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.470 
have the total factory brake pads which
it<00:04:07.430> looks<00:04:07.520> like<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.820> only<00:04:07.940> thing<00:04:08.000> they<00:04:08.209> did<00:04:08.390> on

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
it looks like the only thing they did on

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.090
