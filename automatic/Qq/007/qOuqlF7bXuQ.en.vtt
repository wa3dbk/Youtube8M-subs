squad<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:56.880> all<00:01:57.030> had<00:01:57.240> nine<00:01:57.509> cam<00:01:57.840> imagine

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
squad have they all had nine cam imagine

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.200 
squad have they all had nine cam imagine
even<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.530> had<00:01:58.680> six<00:01:59.040> seven<00:01:59.369> chem<00:01:59.579> even<00:02:00.119> in

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
even they had six seven chem even in

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.639 
even they had six seven chem even in
defense<00:02:00.540> even<00:02:00.689> though<00:02:00.930> their<00:02:01.140> stats<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
defense even though their stats and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.810 
defense even though their stats and
defense<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.070> good<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.490> they're<00:02:02.610> so

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
defense on good but they're so

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.399 
defense on good but they're so
overpowered<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.780> probably<00:02:04.170> would<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.350> just

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
overpowered it probably would have just

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.280 
overpowered it probably would have just
taken<00:02:04.770> everyone<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.719> would<00:02:07.020> most

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
taken everyone on it this would most

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.380 
taken everyone on it this would most
probably<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.369> most<00:02:08.520> deadliest<00:02:08.970> team<00:02:09.179> ever

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
