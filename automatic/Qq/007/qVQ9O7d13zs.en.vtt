00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 before starting the video I want to advise 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.759
 you Anton's channel here every day 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.410
 new clips come out and these clips 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.870
 really a lot of atmospheric 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.719
 dives full of positive are waiting for you by 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.429
 link in the description channel author cheerful 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 sociable guy so what's on the channel 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.930
 great friendly atmosphere ok people 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.090
 my name is bender we keep looking 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 on mod and art minecraft and today 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.590
 we have painting but before that we would like 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.119
 apologize for the last episode 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.460
 which was dedicated to the first half 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.460
 this fashion namely every sculpture i 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.010
 did not tell about the key special key 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 which are crafted as follows with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.600
 using this key you can 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.290
 turn over the sculptures and see how 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.510
 it works 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.219
 from here such here are unsightly inscriptions 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 which is like something here 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.890
 written in Arabic literally for 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.879
 few seconds we get the inscription on 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.609
 Russian 1 2 3 four more is necessary only 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.390
 neatly do it all let's do 5 and here 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.060
 already six and it turns out 7 boom Valya put 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.619
 Like you understood in general yes it is the key with 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.890
 by which you can turn these 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.229
 sculptures in different ways if you press 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 right-click on the side of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.509
 sculptures then she will turn 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.150
 just as if the circle is shorter by 90 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 degrees and if you click on it while 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.380
 from above it will turn already 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.960
 in such a way around shorter 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.329
 she will turn around you and that too 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 cool enough so what can you do with it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.680
 experiment in general here is 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.750
 here's the key I can not exactly describe how he 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.549
 it works because sometimes I myself 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.740
 it seems that he somehow strangely works 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.600
 already if you want to try it yourself 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.850
 Come and download this mod in general, I 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.710
 I think the principle I have shown everything now 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.759
 go to the pictures it is them we 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.680
 today we will draw 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.329
 I have a full set of tools already 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.549
 I will teach you them today 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.299
 let's use a little bit clear 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.560
 here is the ground while you put the likes there I 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.259
 sit here ground so that we have 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.110
 we will hang the place right on the ground 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.390
 our pictures will not be able to draw so 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.060
 first you need to craft 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.760
 the picture that's actually not even 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.380
 picture rather a canvas let's call it that 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.540
 on which you will draw 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.030
 it is crafted as follows just from 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.850
 wool a lot of wool 6 pieces get 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.340
 one canvas next you will have to 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.130
 to craft well, it is not necessary to craft 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.050
 right away both brushes but at least one 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.920
 will need to craft and brushes schedule 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.960
 in the following way 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.480
 big crafting like this 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.640
 understand 3 wool here stick and one 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.370
 red pen dye small 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.240
 crafted a little cheaper days 3 wool 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.730
 single wool 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.130
 further bucket but it will also be desirable 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.840
 to craft him and he has no way 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.530
 crafting here I am seriously talking to you now 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.360
 nothing can be crafted like his 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.550
 get apparently from creative mode I him 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.550
 only from there took yes I was wrong for another hour 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.760
 zafeil little bit well and kraft palette 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.730
 as follows from oak boards 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.460
 ordinary tool I talked about 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.440
 in the last series of special jigsaw 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.030
 I believe I called him and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.920
 bucket turns out and really can not 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.200
 to make this turn 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.420
 okay let's hang our canvas and 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.880
 he looks like this look 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.600
 on top of us there are colors that we can 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.330
 paint 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.400
 to start drawing them we have to 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.740
 our palette add this color choose 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.110
 for example red and we have a red palette 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.780
 now we take a brush and draw 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.820
 right here right here for example yes what 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.280
 I don’t know for example, let's draw 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.840
 just the red line here is the red line 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.960
 red to 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.910
 Similarly , let's choose another one 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.100
 some light and try too 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.260
 draw something and the funniest 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.420
 that you can even paint over these upper ones 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.160
 colors but I honestly never 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.560
 I understand if we paint the top colors 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.540
 how to take the colors in the palette apparently 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.940
 craft another canvas and watch it 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.620
 exactly the chips on which we take the colors in 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.020
 for example, our palette 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.930
 purple yes and then we can draw 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.209
 already this with the help of brushes there is a big 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.160
 the brush she paints straight at once a lot 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.500
 spaces there is a little tassel and 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.440
 she paints a little space but you 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.990
 understand what it is all for a picture I 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.650
 I think look this baby stroller is 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.229
 baby no I don't know what it is 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.090
 came out in general yes actually here 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.800
 such a thing friends that is you can 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.110
 really something even draw 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.960
 cool but the cool thing is that if you don’t 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.490
 grabs a single canvas just take it 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.039
 let's break it now by the way 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.690
 It breaks it looks as though you are well 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.180
 understood as if lagoda 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.340
 funny by the way pictures then you can 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.740
 choose to drag give friends everything 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.600
 anything to do with them here they are super 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.850
 flat under them you can hang anywhere 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.520
 but if you do not have enough space just 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.289
 take and make up large apartments 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.260
 flat picture yourself big 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.970
 make up and then take and pick 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.669
 let's choose some color but i don't 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.100
 I know the light to begin with let's just 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.220
 choose white and paint it completely 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.770
 this is all this obstet i broke the picture 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.050
 so neatly here I want this for giving 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.630
 and why me she breaks down and I because 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.160
 break allah ma whether not actually 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.960
 I press that button first 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.180
 paint over all these palettes here if 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.190
 you really don't need them and then 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.320
 already draw here on such a large canvas 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.669
 and the funny thing is that later if you 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.010
 drew such as some here 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.289
 pixel art you can safely take 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.030
 build it later too 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.060
 cool because you will immediately 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.460
 sample and it will be quite convenient in 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.380
 in general, that's such a friend, I finished 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.380
 just review if you liked it 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.450
 like under this video 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.590
 well and with you was bender all good luck i 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.430
 continue to draw 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.430
 bye everyone
