alright guys this is my new calling at
the<00:00:05.339> rock<00:00:05.549> star<00:00:05.850> body<00:00:06.089> this<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.390> my<00:00:06.540> next<00:00:07.049> 10<00:00:07.379> SC

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
the rock star body this is my next 10 SC

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.940 
the rock star body this is my next 10 SC
from<00:00:08.099> ofna<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.480> went<00:00:10.110> ahead<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.410> picked<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
from ofna and went ahead and picked up a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.030 
from ofna and went ahead and picked up a
proline<00:00:11.730> raptor<00:00:12.509> body<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.889> actually

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
proline raptor body and this is actually

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.810 
proline raptor body and this is actually
for<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.460> jamming<00:00:15.170> scrt<00:00:16.170> truck<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.580> does

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
for the jamming scrt truck but it does

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
for the jamming scrt truck but it does
fit<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.060> next<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.779> course<00:00:19.020> because<00:00:19.529> they're

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
fit the next of course because they're

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.820 
fit the next of course because they're
almost<00:00:19.830> identical<00:00:21.260> had<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:24.830> custom

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
almost identical had to just custom

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.880 
almost identical had to just custom
drill<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.930> body<00:00:28.199> holes<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.740> it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
drill the on the body holes in it

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.740 
drill the on the body holes in it
because<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.279> am<00:00:29.519> running<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> carbon<00:00:30.420> fiber

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
because I am running the carbon fiber

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.440 
because I am running the carbon fiber
shock<00:00:31.529> towers<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.759> body<00:00:32.969> mounts<00:00:33.360> are

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
shock towers so the body mounts are

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.420 
shock towers so the body mounts are
actually<00:00:33.840> set<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.290> little<00:00:34.680> bit<00:00:34.770> more<00:00:34.920> inward

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
actually set a little bit more inward

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.479 
actually set a little bit more inward
than<00:00:36.200> if<00:00:37.200> you're<00:00:37.800> running<00:00:37.980> either<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
than if you're running either the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.160 
than if you're running either the
aluminum<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.329> plastic<00:00:39.899> shock<00:00:40.500> towers

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
aluminum or the plastic shock towers

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.930 
aluminum or the plastic shock towers
overall<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.379> body<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.129> pretty<00:00:44.550> easy<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
overall the body was pretty easy to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.440 
overall the body was pretty easy to
paint<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.420> actually<00:00:45.950> copied<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.730> paint

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
paint I actually copied on the paint

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.959 
paint I actually copied on the paint

on<00:00:51.530> this<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:53.570> as<00:00:54.570> close<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.230> could<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
on this is as close as I could get it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
on this is as close as I could get it
with<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.550> very<00:00:57.449> meager<00:00:57.840> painting<00:00:58.500> skills<00:00:58.820> but

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
with my very meager painting skills but

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.810 
with my very meager painting skills but
just<00:01:00.059> did<00:01:00.210> black<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> white<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.789> stole<00:01:02.789> a

to<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> give<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.850> hint<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.990> kind

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

to kind of give the hint as to what kind
of<00:01:13.350> truck<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.369> track<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.049> other

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
of truck it is on the track and other

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
of truck it is on the track and other
than<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.560> good<00:01:16.920> looking<00:01:17.189> body<00:01:17.930> I'm

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
than that pretty good looking body I'm

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
than that pretty good looking body I'm
definitely<00:01:19.380> afford<00:01:19.860> fan<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.820> worked<00:01:21.390> out

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
definitely afford fan so this worked out

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.969 
definitely afford fan so this worked out
pretty<00:01:21.659> good<00:01:23.450> that's<00:01:24.450> basically<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.470> ended

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
pretty good that's basically it I ended

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.240 
pretty good that's basically it I ended
up<00:01:26.070> mounting<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:27.380> little<00:01:28.380> number<00:01:28.650> signs<00:01:28.890> here

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
up mounting the little number signs here

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.460 
up mounting the little number signs here
they<00:01:29.909> did<00:01:30.090> come<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> went<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
they did come with one that went all the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
they did come with one that went all the
way<00:01:31.500> back<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> separate<00:01:33.240> sign<00:01:33.420> back

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
way back and it was a separate sign back

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
way back and it was a separate sign back
here<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.920> felt<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.430> going

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
here and I just felt that that was going

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.950 
here and I just felt that that was going
to<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.180> dinged<00:01:36.450> around<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
to get you know dinged around on the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.649 
to get you know dinged around on the
track<00:01:37.229> especially<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.860> flip<00:01:38.070> over<00:01:38.369> so

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
track especially if you flip over so

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.140 
track especially if you flip over so
that's<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.869> did<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.140> now<00:01:40.880> overall<00:01:41.880> good

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that's all I did for now overall good

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.539 
that's all I did for now overall good
looking<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.689> body<00:01:43.590> hopefully<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> rear<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
looking a body hopefully the rear of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.280 
looking a body hopefully the rear of
this<00:01:44.880> thing<00:01:45.119> will<00:01:45.299> hold<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.200> bit

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
this thing will hold up a little bit

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.920 
this thing will hold up a little bit
better<00:01:46.409> than<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.520> stock<00:01:48.000> body<00:01:48.299> stalked<00:01:48.780> by

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
better than the stock body stalked by

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.630 
better than the stock body stalked by
these<00:01:49.079> very<00:01:49.170> flimsy<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.009> has<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> little<00:01:50.460> bit

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
these very flimsy this has a little bit

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
these very flimsy this has a little bit
more<00:01:52.430> rigidity<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.689> plastic<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
more rigidity to the the plastic and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.630 
more rigidity to the the plastic and
also<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.280> bit<00:01:56.460> thicker

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
also it's just a little bit thicker

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.209 
also it's just a little bit thicker
plastic<00:01:56.969> now<00:01:57.390> from<00:01:57.689> proline<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.380> other<00:01:59.100> than

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
plastic now from proline so other than

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.209 
plastic now from proline so other than
that<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> my<00:01:59.820> update<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:01.439> was

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that that is my update for now and I was

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.670 
that that is my update for now and I was
actually<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.670> track<00:02:02.990> with<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> truck<00:02:04.439> and

actually on the track with the truck and
one<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.430> my<00:02:05.520> Mudder<00:02:06.110> wires<00:02:07.110> had<00:02:07.469> came

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
one of my Mudder wires had came
