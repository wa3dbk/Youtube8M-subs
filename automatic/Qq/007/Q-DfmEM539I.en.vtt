00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
one of the four answers or five answers

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.630 
one of the four answers or five answers
or<00:05:25.210> choose<00:05:26.080> all<00:05:26.260> that<00:05:26.410> apply<00:05:26.740> in<00:05:27.310> your

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
multiple choice questions below so you

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.740 
multiple choice questions below so you
need<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.460> be<00:05:30.610> making<00:05:30.790> sure<00:05:31.120> you're<00:05:31.270> taking<00:05:31.630> out

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
need to be making sure you're taking out

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.640 
need to be making sure you're taking out
those<00:05:31.960> key<00:05:32.380> words<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:33.669> applying<00:05:34.660> it<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.620> what

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
those key words and applying it to what

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.520 
those key words and applying it to what
answer<00:05:36.310> that<00:05:36.460> fits<00:05:36.640> best<00:05:37.000> in<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:38.020> key<00:05:38.229> below

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
answer that fits best in the key below

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.580 
answer that fits best in the key below
so<00:05:39.220> that's<00:05:39.340> why<00:05:39.550> rule<00:05:39.820> number<00:05:39.940> three<00:05:40.270> I<00:05:40.590> talked
