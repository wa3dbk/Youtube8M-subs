00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.840
 what's up the whole youtube band this 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.779
 sub happy is like you already know the 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.559
 Today , January 28 , Apple launched the 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.950
 ios 6.1 for the public and good this 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.599
 this new update 6.1 is very 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.489
 important to us that we use 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.339
 Syria for all of us who are in the 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:22.989
 world of joe drake since the hackers 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.890
 they had said they were just waiting 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:28.539
 the year of 6.1 to get them out of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.479
 joe drake antender for all 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.789
 devices that support that ios and 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:36.030
 good in this video I would like to emphasize 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.890
 some very important points that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.260
 we should know before performing the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.539
 jailbreak and before restoring our 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.809
 ios devices 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.050
 6.1 and good one of the very points 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.870
 important that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.180
 so they're going to be asking is what 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 devices will be compatible with this 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.290
 jailbreak and the devices that will be 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.210
 compatible with this ios jailbreak 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:06.840
 6.1 will be iphone 3gs iphone 4 iphone 4s 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.540
 iphone 5 and patache fifth generation there 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.610
 patache 4th generation ipad second 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 ipad generation third generation 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.149
 ipad fourth generation and obviously the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.759
 iPad mini and this will also be 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.640
 'breaks' will serve for the apple tv in a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.390
 generation this jailbreak would serve us 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 for the third generation apple tv and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.420
 good another one of the very important things 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.500
 is what to do before restoring this 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.420
 to your device at ios 6.1 point what 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.850
 first thing you have to do is create 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.369
 a backup and that backup 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.140
 it's by means of itunes they must connect 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.899
 your device me here I am in my 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.880
 iphone 4 times connected my device 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.490
 to my computer and after doing that 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.470
 they open itunes and they are going to press here 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.530
 where anna backup or copy of 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.899
 security now and there are two options that 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.509
 you can create your backup in your 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.140
 computer or via icloud this is 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.549
 so that you can save your 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.739
 photographs applications contacts 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.630
 videos songs movies all the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.209
 information they have on their device 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.920
 so that after restoring nothing else 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.990
 this 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.459
 and they go back to this backup and 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.640
 all that information will remain 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.050
 there after returning the basil 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.630
 forgiveness and another to another point very 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.780
 important is that you update by 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.569
 mean of itunes do not update through 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.380
 of track or is this means do not use 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.019
 through general adjustments and adjustments to 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.480
 software update and here is checking by 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:54.910
 updates do not update in this way anymore 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.280
 that you already know that before there is a 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.489
 future they give great to said device 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.200
 let's say that the ios 6.1 point one comes in 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.299
 the future and then there is no tie breack 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.459
 again but the hacker is in 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.160
 a way to be downgrade if you 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.769
 updated via ota will not be able to be 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.200
 a downgrade if you updated by 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.170
 means of wifi what they have to do 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.520
 you and it's go to itunes 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.900
 and where it says check 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.450
 to page there they will check the last 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.340
 version and then press in time out 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.220
 but simply to update or pressing 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.430
 where it says update or restore iphone 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.280
 after doing that now yes they are going to 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.390
 be able to perform the jailbreak when it comes out 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.640
 and more toner had said that the jailbreak 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.850

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.400
