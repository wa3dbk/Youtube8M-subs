00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.849
 so proceed to the video review of hours with 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.670
 hidden camera with a mirrored design 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:29.010
 comes in such a box inside 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:31.859
 instructions themselves watch under yusb to charge 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.180
 and to reset the data to the computer that is 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.180
 video or audio recording 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.530
 let the clock remote control 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:51.110
 video and audio recording features for 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:55.949
 and charging from the network 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.690
 so the clock itself is now us 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.800
 the element on the device above the film 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.030
 shipping is present therefore 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.430
 as if unclear when removing the film 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:14.220
 the surface will be completely transparent 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:17.369
 well reflects any objects now she 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.549
 how muddy that is watch shows on 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.400
 display outside their current time current 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.110
 date and ambient temperature 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:34.030
 the date is not exposed of course there is here 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.800
 back the clock by the control buttons 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.520
 there is a date and time setting 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:46.060
 Mode of operation if the standards 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:50.850
 alarm clock battery cover 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:59.290
 two 1850 batteries are installed 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:05.860
 capacity of 2400 milliamps and so on 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:08.550
 the most interesting is the slot for micro 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.550
 sd memory cards 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.660
 camcorder mode switch 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.209
 that is, turn off and mini jack 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:25.080
 usb to connect the computer either for 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:36.209
 charging micro sd memory card 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:36.209
 get up to click 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.190
 switch the lever to the on position 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.430
 that is, the stone itself the camera is not at all 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.519
 you can see absolutely no receiver for the remote 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.819
 remote control ie 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.069
 the surface is completely mirror now 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:07.400
 the film again repeated anything from any 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:10.150
 the film will be all transparently controlled with 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.150
 using the remote 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.069
 that is, the inclusion button itself 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.290
 cameras 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:33.140
 in addition to what is included in the clock itself 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:37.090
 It is included even in court, that is, when 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.090
 Turning it on is not visible 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.030
 climb behind the mirror surface 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.030
 the light is such that I slightly wine 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:52.700
 bluish ie camera in mode 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.620
 expectations and then already press that is 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.489
 what mode do you need either constant 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.910
 record or enable recording 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.319
 such movement or skill 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.250
 of course function 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:11.590
 it's just an audio recording and make 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.090
 photos that is when you click on 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:22.010
 let's start the recording activation mode by 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:23.870
 I donâ€™t know the light movement 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.750
 visible not visible on camera visible slightly 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:33.430
 will select starts blinking that is and how 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:36.860
 only the camera appears motion he 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:41.180
 blinks 3 times and goes out that is given 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.120
 moment is recorded by the movement then 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.979
 There is a recording mode such that when 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.550
 the motion board the camera starts 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:54.260
 record that is the range of determination 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.000
 movement 6 meters after the end 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.800
 appearance of motion in the frame 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.940
 the camera records 10 seconds and 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:06.370
 dubbed 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.370
 so there are batteries 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:21.260
 i.e. camera about this standby 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:24.919
 batteries enough for video on 24 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.380
 hours but faster memory card will end 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:31.490
 for 32 gigabytes let's say a whole 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:35.360
 maximum battery charge therefore 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:39.620
 batteries a certain battery charge 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:43.010
 i.e. full charge for 8 hours 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.169
 happens before the battery connects 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:51.200
 either charger or 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:52.389
 even the computer is simply that there are such 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.419
 here is the watch 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:59.950
 even here they will click on top 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.950
 English is true current time 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.450
 also say that they have a very good 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:12.040
 viewing angle of 160 degrees i.e. 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:14.290
 allows you to cover most 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.180
 room even there with any installation in 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.510
 Any place there is a study room and not 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.510
 I know
