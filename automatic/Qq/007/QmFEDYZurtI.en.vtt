00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
 one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.090
 ok guys followed by fire tricks online 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.090
 today we are going to learn the next trick 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.150
 although we will do it for this trick 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.650
 the next 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.090
 to see what we are going to do in many 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.890
 steps that we do in other tricks of 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.630
 street game but in the game there 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.370
 a lot of triangulation and many 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.230
 same or similar tricks are not 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.970
 similar but good everyone can 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.770
 use in every situation then 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.680
 you have to practice you all and 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.210
 Apply it to the right situation 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.739
 then what we are going to do is step 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.199
 the ball with the sole of the dominant foot 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.210
 and now let's drag it back 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.770
 and we are going to hit a little hop putting the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 dominant foot forward like this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.180
 we control back and what we are going to do 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.290
 next is to drag the ball in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 parallel that we drag and without stepping with 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.880
 the dominant let's hit a jump 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.860
 back and step on the ball 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.570
 then all together these steps are like this 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.340
 we drag we jump without stepping we give 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.860
 we jump back and fix the silver with the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.310
 dominant we repeat the addition so that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.310
 achieve better 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.740
 because once we have it there 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.270
 Then we go to the last step which 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.770
 I have to do now is to drag 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.320
 balls on the right so that it is 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.210
 how we started initially and at the same time 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.830
 let's hit a little jump like that 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.500
 to stabilize the leg and body 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.550
 and once we have it there just 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.550
 we do the routine again 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.610
 although I hope you liked the 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.290

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.380
 tricks 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.000
 now 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.819
