video we're playing in first-person and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you're watching me fight through the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
first stage in order to reach the taurus

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.910 
first stage in order to reach the taurus
demon<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.090> playing<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.560> actually

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
demon and playing like this was actually

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.070 
demon and playing like this was actually
a<00:00:22.949> lot<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> fun<00:00:23.250> obviously<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:24.630> perfect

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
a lot of fun obviously it's not perfect

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080 
a lot of fun obviously it's not perfect
there<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.740> camera<00:00:26.099> bugs<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.609> it's

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
there are some camera bugs but it's

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.390 
there are some camera bugs but it's
definitely<00:00:27.779> functional<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.380> you'll<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
definitely functional as you'll see I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
definitely functional as you'll see I
don't<00:00:29.519> have<00:00:29.849> too<00:00:30.119> much<00:00:30.269> trouble<00:00:30.539> making<00:00:31.019> my

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
don't have too much trouble making my

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.959 
don't have too much trouble making my
way<00:00:31.289> through<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.650> stage<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> best

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
way through the stage one of the best

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.610 
way through the stage one of the best
things<00:00:33.210> I've<00:00:33.420> actually<00:00:33.600> done<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.200> pick<00:00:34.500> up

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
things I've actually done is pick up

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.229 
things I've actually done is pick up
this<00:00:34.800> spear<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.700> was<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> good<00:00:36.090> choice

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this spear and this was a good choice

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.280 
this spear and this was a good choice
for<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.540> few<00:00:36.750> reasons

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
for a few reasons

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
for a few reasons
one<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.070> highly<00:00:38.460> visible<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.910> first-person

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
one it's highly visible in first-person

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.930 
one it's highly visible in first-person
and<00:00:39.719> two<00:00:40.379> rolling<00:00:40.980> actually<00:00:41.370> messes<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and two rolling actually messes with the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.610 
and two rolling actually messes with the
camera<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.510> tend<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> use<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.290> shield<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
camera so you tend to use your shield a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
camera so you tend to use your shield a
lot<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.640> any<00:00:44.760> situation<00:00:45.300> where<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.450> use

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
lot and in any situation where you use

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
lot and in any situation where you use
your<00:00:45.660> shield<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.230> spear<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.770> naturally

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
your shield the spear is just naturally

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
your shield the spear is just naturally
a<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:47.430> choice<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.690> what's<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.289> playing

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
a good choice so what's it like playing

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
a good choice so what's it like playing
in<00:00:50.010> first-person<00:00:50.340> well<00:00:51.180> you'll<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.629> some

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
in first-person well you'll get some

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.630 
in first-person well you'll get some
idea<00:00:52.170> as<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.500> watch<00:00:52.680> these<00:00:52.890> gameplay<00:00:53.309> clips

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
idea as you watch these gameplay clips

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
idea as you watch these gameplay clips
but<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.600> had<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.870> describe<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> someone

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
but if I had to describe it to someone

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.180 
but if I had to describe it to someone
else<00:00:55.949> basically<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.870> Skyrim<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.620> with

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
else basically it's like Skyrim but with

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
else basically it's like Skyrim but with
gameplay<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.210> combat<00:01:00.570> works<00:01:00.840> surprisingly

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
gameplay the combat works surprisingly

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
gameplay the combat works surprisingly
well<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.219> I'd<00:01:02.460> only<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.969> recommend<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
well but I'd only really recommend it to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
well but I'd only really recommend it to
an<00:01:03.719> experienced<00:01:04.199> player<00:01:04.470> who<00:01:04.739> knows<00:01:04.979> weapon

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
an experienced player who knows weapon

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.080 
an experienced player who knows weapon
movesets

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
movesets

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850 
movesets
enemy<00:01:06.360> patterns<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> someone<00:01:07.619> who<00:01:07.710> has<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
enemy patterns and someone who has a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
enemy patterns and someone who has a
really<00:01:08.040> good<00:01:08.310> grasp<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> controls<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
really good grasp of the controls and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
really good grasp of the controls and
the<00:01:09.630> reason<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.350> say<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.430> not

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the reason I say this is that it's not

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
the reason I say this is that it's not
perfect<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.600> camera<00:01:12.900> has<00:01:13.049> trouble<00:01:13.350> adjusting

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
perfect the camera has trouble adjusting

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.740 
perfect the camera has trouble adjusting
sometimes<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> know<00:01:14.880> exactly<00:01:15.060> how<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
sometimes and if you know exactly how to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.510 
sometimes and if you know exactly how to
move<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.200> character<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> game<00:01:16.979> then

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
move your character in the game then

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
move your character in the game then
you'll<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.820> much<00:01:18.030> better<00:01:18.060> time<00:01:18.330> but

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you'll have a much better time but

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.719 
you'll have a much better time but
generally<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.860> works<00:01:20.100> well<00:01:20.310> enough<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
generally this works well enough that I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.740 
generally this works well enough that I
reckon<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.119> could<00:01:21.240> do<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.600> good

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
reckon you could do a really good

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.230 
reckon you could do a really good
playthrough<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
playthrough with it I really like it the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
playthrough with it I really like it the
most<00:01:24.360> important<00:01:24.810> thing<00:01:24.960> by<00:01:25.110> far<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
most important thing by far is that it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.170 
most important thing by far is that it
actually<00:01:26.220> puts<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> shoes<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> your

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
actually puts you in the shoes of your

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.859 
actually puts you in the shoes of your
character

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
character

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
towards a character playing with this

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.389 
towards a character playing with this
limited<00:01:45.030> view<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.479> means<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:46.020> more

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
limited view just means that you're more

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.679 
limited view just means that you're more
surprised<00:01:47.399> by<00:01:47.670> things<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.360> makes<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
surprised by things and it makes the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.139 
surprised by things and it makes the
action<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.079> bit<00:01:49.229> more<00:01:49.409> visceral<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.220> guess<00:01:50.520> you

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
action a bit more visceral I guess you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
action a bit more visceral I guess you
feel<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.479> though<00:01:51.630> you're<00:01:51.780> playing<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
feel as though you're playing as the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.069 
feel as though you're playing as the
character<00:01:53.159> much<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.720> guess<00:01:54.899> playing

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
character much more and I guess playing

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.230 
character much more and I guess playing
as<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.740> character<00:01:56.219> extends<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.000> all

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
as the character extends to all

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.510 
as the character extends to all
first-person<00:01:58.079> games<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.560> mean<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.159> affects

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
first-person games I mean this affects

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.639 
first-person games I mean this affects
more<00:01:59.790> than<00:01:59.820> just<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.270> combat<00:02:00.600> Dark<00:02:01.259> Souls<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
more than just the combat Dark Souls is

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.380 
more than just the combat Dark Souls is
a<00:02:01.680> game<00:02:01.920> where<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.640> experience<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
a game where you really experience the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.760 
a game where you really experience the
world<00:02:03.570> around<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
world around you and I think that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.950 
world around you and I think that
meeting<00:02:05.100> NPCs<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> experiencing<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.810> world

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
meeting NPCs and experiencing the world

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.930 
meeting NPCs and experiencing the world
around<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.439> fits<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.250> well<00:02:08.399> with<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.700> souls

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
around you fits so well with the souls

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
around you fits so well with the souls
game<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.569> definitely<00:02:09.720> wouldn't<00:02:10.140> mind<00:02:10.349> from

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
game and I definitely wouldn't mind from

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.710 
game and I definitely wouldn't mind from
developing<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.280> first

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
developing a first

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.170 
developing a first
an<00:02:11.870> RPG<00:02:12.200> similar<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.100> remember<00:02:13.940> that

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
an RPG similar to this remember that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.730 
an RPG similar to this remember that
some<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.540> first<00:02:14.720> games<00:02:15.020> from<00:02:15.290> made<00:02:15.530> were

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
some of the first games from made were

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.500 
some of the first games from made were
Kingsfield<00:02:16.250> games<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.790> those<00:02:17.030> were<00:02:17.210> in<00:02:17.240> first

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
Kingsfield games and those were in first

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.810 
Kingsfield games and those were in first

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
with souls gameplay and that would be so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.160 
with souls gameplay and that would be so
good<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.300> many<00:02:23.300> people<00:02:23.600> will<00:02:23.720> click<00:02:23.990> this

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
focused on the best stories first like

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.600 
focused on the best stories first like
Artorias<00:03:38.690> siegmeyer<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.620> sisters<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.100> chaos

those<00:03:41.120> were<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.390> three<00:03:41.600> most<00:03:41.959> emotional

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
those were the three most emotional

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.560 
those were the three most emotional
stories<00:03:42.950> in<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.160> game<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.730> naturally<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.299> did

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
stories in the game so naturally I did

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.390 
stories in the game so naturally I did
them<00:03:44.660> first<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.590> problem<00:03:45.799> with<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.370> that

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
them first the problem with that is that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.190 
them first the problem with that is that
now<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.910> my<00:03:46.940> video<00:03:47.269> quality<00:03:47.510> has<00:03:47.750> improved

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
now that my video quality has improved

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.410 
now that my video quality has improved
the<00:03:48.799> three<00:03:49.070> best<00:03:49.310> stories<00:03:49.700> were<00:03:49.850> done<00:03:50.060> when<00:03:50.360> I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
the three best stories were done when I

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.690 
the three best stories were done when I
just<00:03:50.780> wasn't<00:03:51.140> really<00:03:51.320> experienced<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.670> I

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
just wasn't really experienced so I

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.520 
just wasn't really experienced so I
think<00:03:52.820> I'll<00:03:53.150> redo<00:03:53.450> those<00:03:53.630> videos<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.260> won't

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
think I'll redo those videos I won't

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.350 
think I'll redo those videos I won't
delete<00:03:54.769> them<00:03:54.980> but<00:03:55.310> I'll<00:03:55.489> remake<00:03:55.790> them<00:03:56.180> with

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
delete them but I'll remake them with

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.600 
delete them but I'll remake them with
new<00:03:56.540> footage<00:03:56.900> better<00:03:57.380> narration<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.160> just
