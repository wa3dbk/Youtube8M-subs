00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.560 

so<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.380> Corky<00:00:34.829> down<00:00:35.040> don't<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.820> TBT<00:00:36.390> can

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
so with Corky down don't think TBT can

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.740 
so with Corky down don't think TBT can
do<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.050> play<00:00:37.559> defensive<00:00:38.270> because<00:00:39.270> they

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
do is just play defensive because they

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.459 
do is just play defensive because they
can't<00:00:39.960> push<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.440> four<00:00:41.160> verses<00:00:41.460> five<00:00:42.469> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
can't push for four verses five so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.590 
can't push for four verses five so
that's<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.010> bad<00:00:44.280> play<00:00:44.489> by<00:00:44.670> Corky<00:00:45.059> because<00:00:45.390> he

go to waste so they have to push right
because<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:09.000> reason<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.390> bearing

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
because that's one reason to get bearing

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.240 
because that's one reason to get bearing
because<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.020> gives<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.350> little<00:02:10.560> edge<00:02:10.830> x

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
because it gives you that little edge x

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.150 
because it gives you that little edge x
AP<00:02:11.630> extra<00:02:12.630> attack<00:02:12.870> damage<00:02:13.050> or<00:02:13.470> whatnot<00:02:13.680> what

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
AP extra attack damage or whatnot what

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.840 
AP extra attack damage or whatnot what
does<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.459> give<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.880> gives<00:02:16.340> increase<00:02:17.340> health

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
does it give it gives increase health

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.729 
does it give it gives increase health
and<00:02:18.180> mana<00:02:18.239> regeneration<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:19.170> joys<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
and mana regeneration and joys and

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.479 
and mana regeneration and joys and
creates<00:02:20.190> attack<00:02:20.550> damage<00:02:20.670> ability<00:02:21.090> power<00:02:21.209> so

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
creates attack damage ability power so

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.430 
creates attack damage ability power so
bearable<00:02:23.489> we<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.989> push<00:02:25.170> or

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
bearable we have it you have to push or

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.860 
bearable we have it you have to push or
else<00:02:26.180> you're<00:02:27.180> putting<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> waste<00:02:27.660> if

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
else you're putting it to waste if

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.539 
else you're putting it to waste if
you're<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> opposite<00:02:29.130> end<00:02:29.250> where<00:02:29.489> you

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
you're on the opposite end where you

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.890 
you're on the opposite end where you
don't<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.790> Baron<00:02:30.030> buff<00:02:30.120> all<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.360> other<00:02:30.660> team

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
don't have Baron buff all the other team

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.160 
don't have Baron buff all the other team
does<00:02:31.080> I'll<00:02:31.290> play<00:02:32.190> defensive<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:33.170> with

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
does I'll play defensive because with

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.900 
does I'll play defensive because with
the<00:02:34.319> Baron<00:02:34.560> buff<00:02:34.680> they<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.370> push<00:02:35.580> right

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the Baron buff they have to push right

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.270 
the Baron buff they have to push right
so<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:37.140> expect<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.560> push<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.799> have<00:02:37.920> very<00:02:38.040> most

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
so just expect a push and have very most

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.680 
so just expect a push and have very most
that's<00:02:38.459> why<00:02:38.549> doing<00:02:38.850> sticking<00:02:39.420> together

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
that's why doing sticking together

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.520 
that's why doing sticking together
things<00:02:40.990> I<00:02:41.260> too<00:02:42.250> much<00:02:42.400> best<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.760> hopes<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
things I too much best and hopes and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.810 
things I too much best and hopes and

really<00:02:49.510> low<00:02:49.630> it's<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:50.710> a<00:02:50.830> bunch<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.490> stuff<00:02:51.790> so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
really low it's just a bunch of stuff so

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.030 
really low it's just a bunch of stuff so
you<00:02:52.030> flash<00:02:52.240> it<00:02:52.270> he<00:02:52.990> jumps<00:02:53.350> over<00:02:53.620> slats<00:02:53.890> good

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040
