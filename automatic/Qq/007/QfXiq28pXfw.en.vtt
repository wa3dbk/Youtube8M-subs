00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.910
 with different nuances of culture 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.450
 japanese 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.410
 I heard him playing the charango and 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.410
 now the ocarina continues 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.160
 because it is an ocarina yes because they are 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.850
 federer now mario starts from this or 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.279
 karina would not then show that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.680
 ocarina was using but that is a 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.280
 ocarina ocarina describes the 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.100
 it's an ocarina that looks like a 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.539
 seed 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.000
 if it's ocarina and there are two styles of 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.980
 Italian and Andean this Karim edition 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.219
 Andean but good Japanese you can also 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.769
 it's like a flute if it's a flute in 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:56.820
 bone shape of mamey could I say 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:01:00.799
 although it has mamey it 's mexico that I have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.799
 that explain another way for people 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.460
 which has four perforations of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 different sizes I guess with that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.610
 Given is notorious, he will be very happy 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.610
 he wants busy he assured he knows everything 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 but of course you do not remember a scene that 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.320
 They pass wind sounds 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.270
 that is the beginning of this ocarina 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.869
 birth very beautiful movie where 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.619
 is the ocarina or canine is can be of 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.770
 world not but everyone passed that 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:51.069
 creation scheme let's say seed 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.980
 ate little bird not by chance opened 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.890
 nail 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.040
 as I can tell if Pinhole Pinhole 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.710
 and there they go wind and it sounds naturally 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.300
 then they take out of that seed look at voice 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.000
 of this is I am day and was born charity is 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:14.360
 the birth the center of the world yes 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.360
 then it sounds like that why 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.950
 Wow 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.830
 then it's very pentatonic not the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:57.810
 tone guide on purpose but 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:00.160
 It is so affectionate sound with full of no 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.440
 put together or there accompaniment of 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.770
 sweet naturalization in addition but I think 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.900
 we were not wanting more 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.700
 I say after the ocarina and then all 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.260
 the trouble of loading it because it's huge 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.260
 in mixed music disc 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.430
