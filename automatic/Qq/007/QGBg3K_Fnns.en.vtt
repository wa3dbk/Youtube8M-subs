fiendish universe hello everybody this
is<00:00:08.050> a<00:00:08.230> registered<00:00:08.620> tutorial<00:00:09.459> on<00:00:09.639> cool

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
is a registered tutorial on cool

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.419 
is a registered tutorial on cool
flip-flops<00:00:10.870> and<00:00:11.110> I've<00:00:11.499> got<00:00:11.679> an<00:00:11.769> example<00:00:12.219> here

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
flip-flops and I've got an example here

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.720 
flip-flops and I've got an example here
this<00:00:12.789> is<00:00:12.879> kind<00:00:13.120> of<00:00:13.209> what<00:00:13.330> it<00:00:13.450> looks<00:00:13.629> like<00:00:13.870> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
this is kind of what it looks like a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.490 
this is kind of what it looks like a
relatively<00:00:15.730> complex<00:00:16.330> but<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:16.840> overall<00:00:17.260> idea

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
relatively complex but the overall idea

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.340 
relatively complex but the overall idea
is<00:00:18.010> simple<00:00:18.520> it's<00:00:18.790> basically<00:00:19.300> you<00:00:20.080> could<00:00:20.170> say

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
is simple it's basically you could say

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.470 
is simple it's basically you could say
it<00:00:20.470> acts<00:00:20.650> like<00:00:20.770> a<00:00:20.890> Levite<00:00:21.400> Allah<00:00:21.940> will<00:00:22.300> say<00:00:22.450> a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
it acts like a Levite Allah will say a

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.470 
it acts like a Levite Allah will say a
lubra<00:00:23.020> good<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.400> if<00:00:24.670> you've<00:00:24.790> got<00:00:24.940> a<00:00:24.970> button<00:00:25.360> and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
lubra good so if you've got a button and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.980 
lubra good so if you've got a button and
you<00:00:26.140> press<00:00:26.170> it<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:28.000> wired<00:00:28.210> to<00:00:28.360> that<00:00:28.480> door<00:00:28.690> and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
you press it it's wired to that door and

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.170 
you press it it's wired to that door and
basically<00:00:29.590> toggles<00:00:30.100> on<00:00:30.280> and<00:00:30.460> off<00:00:30.580> using<00:00:30.970> a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
basically toggles on and off using a

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.220 
basically toggles on and off using a
button<00:00:31.480> so<00:00:32.020> every<00:00:32.259> time<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.590> input<00:00:32.920> changes

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
button so every time the input changes

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.099 
button so every time the input changes
so<00:00:35.230> yeah<00:00:35.800> every<00:00:36.070> time<00:00:36.249> the<00:00:36.370> input<00:00:36.789> is<00:00:37.120> turned

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
so yeah every time the input is turned

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.759 
so yeah every time the input is turned
on<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.579> now<00:00:39.670> when<00:00:39.820> it<00:00:39.940> turns<00:00:40.329> off<00:00:40.769> because

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
on so now when it turns off because

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.649 
on so now when it turns off because
otherwise<00:00:41.980> it<00:00:42.249> will<00:00:42.370> toggle<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:43.030> us<00:00:43.149> but<00:00:43.420> when

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
otherwise it will toggle to us but when

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.069 
otherwise it will toggle to us but when
the<00:00:43.780> input<00:00:43.929> turns<00:00:44.289> on<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:45.129> output<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:46.480> toggle

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
the input turns on the output top toggle

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.660 
the input turns on the output top toggle
so<00:00:47.289> it'll<00:00:47.440> if<00:00:47.679> it's<00:00:47.859> aren't<00:00:48.069> turns<00:00:48.249> off<00:00:48.429> its

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
so it'll if it's aren't turns off its

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.790 
so it'll if it's aren't turns off its
officers<00:00:49.089> on<00:00:49.300> it's<00:00:49.719> the<00:00:49.899> base<00:00:50.109> of<00:00:50.350> all<00:00:50.469> binary

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
officers on it's the base of all binary

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.939 
officers on it's the base of all binary
counters<00:00:51.429> which<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.879> what<00:00:52.239> I<00:00:52.269> used<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:52.749> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
counters which is what I used in the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.189 
counters which is what I used in the
india<00:00:54.030> Redstone's<00:00:55.030> seven<00:00:55.539> segment<00:00:55.870> display

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
india Redstone's seven segment display

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.410 
india Redstone's seven segment display
counter<00:00:56.469> which<00:00:57.159> is<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.519> little<00:00:58.089> link<00:00:58.210> at<00:00:58.390> the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
counter which is a little link at the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.680 
counter which is a little link at the
top<00:00:58.510> right

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.249 

yes<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.710> shared<00:01:04.710> before

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
yes so as you can see shared before

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.160 
yes so as you can see shared before
every<00:01:07.259> time<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.369> every<00:01:08.880> time<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.119> press<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
every time so every time you press it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.680 
every time so every time you press it
turns<00:01:10.650> off<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.670> could<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
turns off you could have it so that

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.539 
turns off you could have it so that
there's<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.680> button<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> each<00:01:14.040> side<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
there's a button on each side of the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
there's a button on each side of the
door<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.940> can<00:01:15.090> wire<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> same<00:01:15.960> thing

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
door and you can wire up the same thing

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.930 
door and you can wire up the same thing
it<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.470> still<00:01:16.740> work<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.250> button<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.909> each

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
it would still work so button on each

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.670 
it would still work so button on each
side<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> wall<00:01:18.899> but<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> door<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
side of like a wall but the door and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
side of like a wall but the door and
when<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.580> press<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:22.170> bit

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
when you press it so it's a little bit

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.310 
when you press it so it's a little bit
like<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> lever<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.070> works<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.369> both<00:01:23.399> sides

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
like a lever but it works on both sides

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.600 
like a lever but it works on both sides
like<00:01:25.320> corresponds<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> each<00:01:26.070> other<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> little

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
like corresponds to each other a little

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
like corresponds to each other a little
bit<00:01:26.759> difficult<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.149> explain<00:01:27.479> I'll<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.930> honest

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
bit difficult to explain I'll be honest

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
bit difficult to explain I'll be honest
with<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:29.039> I'm<00:01:29.159> building<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
with you when I'm building this I use a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
with you when I'm building this I use a
schematic<00:01:30.600> every<00:01:30.840> single<00:01:31.080> time<00:01:31.259> obviously

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
schematic every single time obviously

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.050 
schematic every single time obviously
that<00:01:31.979> wrong<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.610> killed<00:01:32.940> a<00:01:33.090> pig<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.700> reason<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
that wrong you killed a pig the reason I

that wrong you killed a pig the reason I
use<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.350> still<00:01:37.679> I<00:01:37.890> mean<00:01:38.159> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
is quite frankly off minecraft wiki

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.020 
is quite frankly off minecraft wiki
because<00:02:02.760> it<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.690> dramatic<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.710> quite<00:02:05.280> nice<00:02:05.670> i

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
because it it's dramatic so quite nice i

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
because it it's dramatic so quite nice i
like<00:02:06.330> them<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.410> you<00:02:07.530> could<00:02:07.680> try<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
like them it's like you could try and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
like them it's like you could try and
follow<00:02:08.160> my<00:02:08.429> lead<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.149> i'm<00:02:09.270> doing<00:02:09.539> here

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
follow my lead as to what i'm doing here

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.570 
follow my lead as to what i'm doing here
but<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> probably<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.440> fast<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.070> this<00:02:11.220> anyway

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
but I probably just fast for this anyway

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.150 
but I probably just fast for this anyway
so<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.140> trouble<00:02:13.410> reading<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.950> there

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
so if you have trouble reading it there

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.760 
so if you have trouble reading it there
is<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> legend<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:16.440> pretty<00:02:16.860> self-explanatory

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
is a legend it's pretty self-explanatory

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.900 
is a legend it's pretty self-explanatory
it<00:02:19.770> takes<00:02:20.310> up<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.810> eighth<00:02:21.810> by<00:02:22.080> seven<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
it takes up a eighth by seven this is a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.949 
it takes up a eighth by seven this is a
by<00:02:24.090> seven<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> glasses<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.959> by<00:02:25.140> seven<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.340> need

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
by seven the glasses a by seven you need

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.010 
by seven the glasses a by seven you need
18<00:02:27.959> blocks<00:02:28.470> will<00:02:29.130> discern<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.670> 18<00:02:30.300> blocks<00:02:30.570> 25

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
18 blocks will discern a 18 blocks 25

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.440 
18 blocks will discern a 18 blocks 25
redstone<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:32.610> believe<00:02:33.180> ten<00:02:33.780> torches<00:02:35.450> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
redstone and I believe ten torches so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.020 
redstone and I believe ten torches so
this<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.780> fair<00:02:37.080> bit<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.940> normally<00:02:38.940> if

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
this is a fair bit but like normally if

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.850 
this is a fair bit but like normally if
you<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.510> you're<00:02:39.660> making<00:02:40.020> like<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> actual

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
you if you're making like a actual

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.620 
you if you're making like a actual
binary<00:02:41.070> counter<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.780> have<00:02:43.140> enough<00:02:43.590> so

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
binary counter you have enough so

00:02:45.630 --> 00:03:03.980 
binary counter you have enough so
going<00:02:46.470> too<00:02:46.970> fast<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.270> this<00:02:48.420> now

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.130 

okay<00:03:04.950> see<00:03:05.610> this<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.000> rack<00:03:06.210> possibly<00:03:06.930> made<00:03:07.110> a

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
okay see this is a rack possibly made a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.520 
okay see this is a rack possibly made a
mistake<00:03:07.500> sorry<00:03:07.800> if<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:09.230> one<00:03:10.230> such<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
mistake sorry if I have one such a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.309 
mistake sorry if I have one such a
button

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.819 

just<00:03:15.030> bring<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:16.749> you've<00:03:17.200> got<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.650> is

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
just bring this is so you've got this is

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.140 
just bring this is so you've got this is
where<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.040> input<00:03:18.219> comes<00:03:18.519> onto<00:03:18.700> onto<00:03:18.939> this

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
where the input comes onto onto this

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.410 
where the input comes onto onto this
torch<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:20.370> over<00:03:21.370> here<00:03:21.639> on<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.819> opposite<00:03:22.150> side

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
torch and over here on the opposite side

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.880 
torch and over here on the opposite side
this<00:03:22.659> is<00:03:23.469> where

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
this is where

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.210 
this is where
the<00:03:24.980> output<00:03:26.020> comes<00:03:27.020> and<00:03:27.290> do<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.770> need<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.100> use

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the output comes and do you need to use

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.100 
the output comes and do you need to use
it<00:03:28.370> from<00:03:28.460> the<00:03:28.610> center<00:03:28.970> because<00:03:29.810> if<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:29.990> do

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
it from the center because if you do

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.670 
it from the center because if you do
this<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:30.590> won't<00:03:30.890> go<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.490> that<00:03:31.670> block<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.680> so

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
this it won't go to that block and so

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.170 
this it won't go to that block and so
you<00:03:33.740> bring<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.310> around<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.880> just<00:03:35.060> so

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
you bring this around this is just so

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.610 
you bring this around this is just so
you<00:03:35.240> can<00:03:35.330> see<00:03:35.390> if<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.690> works<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:36.230> don't<00:03:36.440> know<00:03:36.530> if

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
you can see if it works I don't know if

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.510 
you can see if it works I don't know if
we're<00:03:36.740> going<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:36.920> reach<00:03:37.069> all<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.310> way<00:03:37.340> we'll

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
we're going to reach all the way we'll

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.250 
we're going to reach all the way we'll
see<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.300> so<00:03:39.170> changes<00:03:39.970> changes<00:03:40.970> changes

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
see and so changes changes changes

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.370 
see and so changes changes changes
changes<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:44.330> be<00:03:44.360> honest<00:03:44.570> aviance<00:03:44.930> once

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
changes I to be honest aviance once

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.699 
changes I to be honest aviance once
again<00:03:46.120> I'm<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.480> can't<00:03:47.780> quite<00:03:48.110> work<00:03:48.260> out<00:03:48.470> how

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
again I'm that can't quite work out how

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.530 
again I'm that can't quite work out how
every<00:03:49.160> component<00:03:49.490> works<00:03:49.820> like<00:03:50.090> with<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.390> and

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
every component works like with the and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.960 
every component works like with the and
gain<00:03:50.780> hall<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.230> xor<00:03:51.800> gate<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.100> all<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.370> all

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
gain hall and xor gate and all that all

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.970 
gain hall and xor gate and all that all
those<00:03:53.120> things<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.420> can<00:03:53.570> actually<00:03:53.690> like<00:03:54.500> imagine

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
those things I can actually like imagine

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.220 
those things I can actually like imagine
how<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.340> works<00:03:55.580> but<00:03:55.880> for<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.420> little<00:03:57.020> bit

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
how it works but for this a little bit

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.720 
how it works but for this a little bit
too<00:03:57.350> complicated<00:03:57.680> for<00:03:57.890> me<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.250> understand

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
too complicated for me to understand

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.070 
too complicated for me to understand
what<00:03:58.880> I've<00:03:58.970> definitely<00:03:59.150> used<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.930> and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
what I've definitely used it and

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.860 
what I've definitely used it and
understand<00:04:00.709> its<00:04:01.280> work<00:04:01.580> like<00:04:01.880> how<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.300> works<00:04:02.570> oh

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
understand its work like how it works oh

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.199 
understand its work like how it works oh
sure<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.320> say<00:04:03.560> like<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:04.010> know<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.430> little<00:04:05.120> bit

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
sure I say like you know a little bit

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.040 
sure I say like you know a little bit
hard<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.480> describe<00:04:05.890> what<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.100> does<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:08.050> which

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
hard to describe what it does and which

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.979 
hard to describe what it does and which
is<00:04:09.230> as<00:04:09.800> you<00:04:10.370> seen<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.910> this<00:04:11.180> might<00:04:11.510> lead<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.959> a
