coconut<00:01:46.950> water<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.939> juice<00:01:48.299> inside<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
coconut water so the juice inside the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.590 
coconut water so the juice inside the
coconut<00:01:49.549> in<00:01:50.549> within<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.210> meat<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.540> the

coconut in within the meat of the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
coconut in within the meat of the
coconut<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.229> identical<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.250> human<00:01:53.610> blood

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
coconut is identical to human blood

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.789 
coconut is identical to human blood
plasma<00:01:54.149> which<00:01:54.930> tells<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> right<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.649> it's

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
plasma which tells you right there it's

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.880 
plasma which tells you right there it's
a<00:01:55.860> very<00:01:55.890> healing<00:01:56.450> food<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> eat<00:01:57.810> by<00:01:58.649> weight

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
a very healing food to eat by weight

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
a very healing food to eat by weight
coconut<00:01:59.430> oil<00:01:59.640> actually<00:02:00.060> has<00:02:00.210> less<00:02:00.420> fat<00:02:00.750> than

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
coconut oil actually has less fat than

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.139 
coconut oil actually has less fat than
any<00:02:01.259> other<00:02:01.530> fat<00:02:01.860> source<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.520> provides<00:02:02.790> more

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
any other fat source and provides more

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.569 
any other fat source and provides more
energy<00:02:03.630> more<00:02:03.960> quickly<00:02:04.320> than<00:02:04.740> any<00:02:04.920> other<00:02:05.219> fat

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
energy more quickly than any other fat

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.429 
energy more quickly than any other fat
so<00:02:06.180> coconut<00:02:06.570> oil<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.810> past<00:02:07.020> has<00:02:07.170> gotten<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
so coconut oil in the past has gotten a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.169 
so coconut oil in the past has gotten a
really<00:02:07.619> bad<00:02:07.799> rap<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.789> falls<00:02:09.030> into

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
really bad rap because it falls into

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.270 
really bad rap because it falls into
that<00:02:09.330> saturated<00:02:09.780> fat<00:02:09.899> category<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.099> I'm<00:02:11.160> gonna

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
that saturated fat category so I'm gonna

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.580 
that saturated fat category so I'm gonna
dispel<00:02:11.700> some<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.030> those<00:02:12.120> myths<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.629> today

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
dispel some of those myths for you today

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.170 
dispel some of those myths for you today
saturated<00:02:14.590> fat<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:15.190> not<00:02:15.430> apples<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.880> apples

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
saturated fat it's not apples to apples

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.330 
saturated fat it's not apples to apples
so<00:02:16.300> animal<00:02:16.900> saturated<00:02:17.380> fat<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.770> not<00:02:18.040> good<00:02:18.310> for

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
so animal saturated fat is not good for

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.520 
so animal saturated fat is not good for
you<00:02:18.610> whereas<00:02:18.880> plant-based<00:02:19.420> saturated<00:02:20.110> fat<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
you whereas plant-based saturated fat is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.020 
you whereas plant-based saturated fat is
and<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:20.830> has<00:02:21.040> all<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.580> with<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.820> amount

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and that has all to do with the amount

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.180 
and that has all to do with the amount
of<00:02:22.210> chains<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.750> has<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.320> fatty<00:02:23.530> acids<00:02:23.980> an

animal fat is long-chain fatty acids

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.290 
animal fat is long-chain fatty acids

medium chain fatty acids your body
responds<00:02:33.820> very<00:02:33.880> differently<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.840> these<00:02:34.960> two

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
responds very differently to these two

types<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.650> chains<00:02:36.540> now<00:02:37.540> one<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.050> most

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
types of chains now one of the most

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.350 
types of chains now one of the most
important<00:02:39.100> features<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.550> coconut<00:02:39.940> oil<00:02:40.030> and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
important features of coconut oil and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.330 
important features of coconut oil and
the<00:02:40.540> medium<00:02:40.840> chain<00:02:41.080> fatty<00:02:41.110> acids<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:41.980> has<00:02:42.160> in

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
the medium chain fatty acids it has in

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.940 
the medium chain fatty acids it has in
it<00:02:42.490> is<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:43.060> 50%<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.050> those<00:02:44.140> chains<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.800> what

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
it is that 50% of those chains is what

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.820 
it is that 50% of those chains is what
we<00:02:45.040> call<00:02:45.250> lauric<00:02:45.580> acid<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.660> only<00:02:47.110> other<00:02:47.350> thing

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
we call lauric acid the only other thing

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.920 
we call lauric acid the only other thing
on<00:02:48.070> this<00:02:48.310> planet<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:48.940> has<00:02:49.090> lauric<00:02:49.390> acid<00:02:49.510> is

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
on this planet that has lauric acid is

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.970 
on this planet that has lauric acid is
human<00:02:50.350> breast<00:02:50.590> milk

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
human breast milk

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.960 
human breast milk
now<00:02:51.250> lauric<00:02:51.580> acid<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:53.140> an<00:02:53.740> antiviral<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:54.730> it's

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
now lauric acid is an antiviral so it's

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.360 
now lauric acid is an antiviral so it's
that's<00:02:55.690> what<00:02:55.959> makes<00:02:56.140> coconut<00:02:56.680> oil<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:57.070> very

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
that's what makes coconut oil a very

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.310 
that's what makes coconut oil a very
great<00:02:57.640> thing<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:57.970> use<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.390> any<00:02:58.690> kind<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:58.990> fungus

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
great thing to use on any kind of fungus
