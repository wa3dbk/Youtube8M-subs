let's<00:03:15.609> try<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.879> get<00:03:16.030> some<00:03:16.209> napalm<00:03:18.630> all<00:03:19.630> these

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
let's try to get some napalm all these

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.720 
let's try to get some napalm all these
do<00:03:20.200> different<00:03:20.560> effect<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.069> environment<00:03:21.190> in

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
do different effect the environment in

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.300 
do different effect the environment in
some<00:03:22.000> way<00:03:22.209> so<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:23.200> does<00:03:23.470> get<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.739> lot<00:03:23.919> of<00:03:23.980> fun

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
some way so it does get a lot of fun

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.159 
some way so it does get a lot of fun
kind<00:03:24.579> of<00:03:24.609> strategizing<00:03:25.060> figure<00:03:25.780> out<00:03:25.930> what

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
kind of strategizing figure out what

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.509 
kind of strategizing figure out what
time<00:03:26.440> combination<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.040> weapons<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.489> need

time combination of weapons you need

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.150 
time combination of weapons you need
Here<00:03:28.419> I<00:03:28.480> am<00:03:28.540> at<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> very<00:03:28.989> top<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.530> find<00:03:29.919> it's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
Here I am at the very top I find it's

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.159 
Here I am at the very top I find it's
best<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.639> be<00:03:30.790> on<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.030> top<00:03:31.299> rather<00:03:31.870> than<00:03:31.989> be<00:03:32.079> on

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
best to be on the top rather than be on

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.229 
best to be on the top rather than be on
the<00:03:32.260> bottom<00:03:32.380> but<00:03:32.680> again<00:03:32.919> it's<00:03:33.069> very<00:03:33.160> random<00:03:33.790> as

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the bottom but again it's very random as

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.479 
the bottom but again it's very random as
far<00:03:34.510> as<00:03:34.630> where<00:03:34.959> your<00:03:35.109> place<00:03:35.319> in<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.620> game<00:03:35.829> I'm

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489

two enemies left to the green in the

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.449 
two enemies left to the green in the
purple<00:04:17.720> tank<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.650> see<00:04:18.859> what<00:04:18.979> they<00:04:19.099> decide<00:04:19.400> to

the<00:04:21.769> green<00:04:21.949> tank<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:23.690> still<00:04:23.870> think<00:04:23.900> he's

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
the green tank and you still think he's

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.560
