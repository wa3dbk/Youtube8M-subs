blower<00:01:35.159> part<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.270> whack<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
blower part all out of whack then just

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.580 
blower part all out of whack then just
wrap<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.220> other<00:01:38.250> end<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.840> did<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.350> bend

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
wrap the other end then you did not bend

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.670 
wrap the other end then you did not bend
around<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.520> knitting<00:01:41.850> needle<00:01:42.180> above<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.409> mean

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
around the knitting needle above I mean

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440 
around the knitting needle above I mean
around<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> wire<00:01:44.159> about<00:01:44.700> 4<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.270> 5<00:01:45.329> times

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
around the wire about 4 or 5 times

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.380 
around the wire about 4 or 5 times
that's<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.110> gonna<00:01:46.290> give<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.009> nice<00:01:47.850> base

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that's just gonna give you a nice base

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
that's just gonna give you a nice base
to<00:01:48.420> start<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> course<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.369> so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
to start on and of course I do this so

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.999 
to start on and of course I do this so
much<00:01:50.640> neater<00:01:50.850> when<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.270> making<00:01:51.329> video<00:01:52.009> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
much neater when I'm not making video so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.160 
much neater when I'm not making video so
there<00:01:53.220> we've<00:01:53.399> got<00:01:53.430> our<00:01:53.880> loop<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> we've<00:01:55.020> got

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
there we've got our loop and we've got

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840 
there we've got our loop and we've got
it<00:01:55.259> wrapped<00:01:55.409> around<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.680> few<00:01:55.770> times<00:01:55.829> now<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it wrapped around a few times now the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.420 
it wrapped around a few times now the
straight<00:01:57.240> piece<00:01:57.619> here<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> part<00:01:59.280> we

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
straight piece here which is the part we

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.920 
straight piece here which is the part we
wrapped<00:01:59.640> around<00:01:59.820> we're<00:02:00.360> going<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> slide<00:02:00.750> on

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
wrapped around we're going to slide on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.230 
wrapped around we're going to slide on
some<00:02:01.110> beads<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:02.310> using<00:02:02.490> acrylic<00:02:02.670> beads

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
some beads and I'm using acrylic beads

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.859 
some beads and I'm using acrylic beads
because<00:02:04.430> they're<00:02:05.430> lighter<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.270> they're

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
because they're lighter and they're

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.249 
because they're lighter and they're

going to there they're not gonna weigh

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.980 
going to there they're not gonna weigh

just a little novelty so I'm not you
know<00:02:20.190> gonna<00:02:20.490> put<00:02:20.780> really<00:02:21.780> expensive<00:02:22.170> beads<00:02:22.530> on

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
know gonna put really expensive beads on

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.930 
know gonna put really expensive beads on
it<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.400> then<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.910> thread<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.390> beads<00:02:24.420> on

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
it and then just thread your beads on

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.100 
it and then just thread your beads on
you<00:02:26.940> could<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.210> pattern<00:02:27.630> or<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.780> could<00:02:27.960> just

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
you could do a pattern or you could just

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.630 
you could do a pattern or you could just
use<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.290> bunch<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.560> random<00:02:28.890> leftovers<00:02:29.430> it

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
use a bunch of random leftovers it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.710 
use a bunch of random leftovers it
doesn't<00:02:29.940> matter<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.240> gonna<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.510> pretty

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
doesn't matter it's gonna be pretty

doesn't matter it's gonna be pretty
anyway<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.530> look<00:02:31.680> at<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.060> these<00:02:33.060> really<00:02:33.390> big

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
anyway you look at it these really big

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.890 
anyway you look at it these really big
beads<00:02:33.930> are<00:02:34.350> from<00:02:35.150> they're<00:02:36.150> called<00:02:36.360> urban<00:02:36.720> ice

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900

by Jesse James and I got them at
Joanne's<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.420> smaller<00:02:39.690> ones<00:02:39.960> are<00:02:40.080> from<00:02:40.170> Fire

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
Joanne's the smaller ones are from Fire

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.550 
Joanne's the smaller ones are from Fire
Mountain<00:02:40.530> Gems<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:43.410> them<00:02:43.530> because

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
Mountain Gems and I like them because

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.050 
Mountain Gems and I like them because
they<00:02:43.800> look<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.160> pretty<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.820> they're<00:02:44.940> also

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
they look really pretty but they're also

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.640 
they look really pretty but they're also
very<00:02:45.180> inexpensive<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:45.990> you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.320> use<00:02:46.470> them<00:02:46.620> for

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
very inexpensive so you can use them for

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.940 
very inexpensive so you can use them for
projects<00:02:47.100> like<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.430> now<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.950> length

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
not on the video camera I'm gonna make a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.230 
not on the video camera I'm gonna make a
bend<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.950> wire<00:02:59.070> about<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.520> quarter<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.150> an

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
bend in the wire about a quarter of an

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.260 
bend in the wire about a quarter of an
inch<00:03:00.390> above<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.410> last<00:03:01.620> bead<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.550> then<00:03:03.060> I'm

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
inch above that last bead and then I'm

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.300 
inch above that last bead and then I'm
gonna<00:03:03.390> use<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.660> round<00:03:04.170> thingy<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> jump

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
gonna use a round thingy this is a jump

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.590 
gonna use a round thingy this is a jump
ring<00:03:05.400> maker<00:03:05.640> but<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.030> use<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> pencil<00:03:06.360> if

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
ring maker but you can use a pencil if

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.360 
ring maker but you can use a pencil if
you<00:03:06.660> don't<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:06.930> one<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.080> these<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.770> I'm<00:03:08.190> just

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you don't have one of these and I'm just

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.490 
you don't have one of these and I'm just
gonna<00:03:08.460> wrap<00:03:08.820> my<00:03:09.090> wire<00:03:09.510> around<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.080> largest

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
gonna wrap my wire around the largest

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.870 
gonna wrap my wire around the largest
part<00:03:10.710> of<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.340> going<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
part of that and this is going to be the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.720 
part of that and this is going to be the
handle<00:03:12.530> all<00:03:13.530> right<00:03:13.740> so<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:14.550> we

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
handle all right so it's just like we

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
design and it's also kind of pretty then

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.539 
design and it's also kind of pretty then
I<00:04:18.660> get<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.140> top<00:04:19.350> like<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.220> put<00:04:20.370> another

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
I get to the top like I put another

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.190 
I get to the top like I put another
little<00:04:20.790> loop<00:04:20.970> on<00:04:21.150> there<00:04:21.299> now<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:22.020> like

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
little loop on there now this is like

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.120 
little loop on there now this is like
you're<00:04:22.410> going<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.590> end<00:04:22.740> up<00:04:22.830> with<00:04:22.950> different

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
you're going to end up with different

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.050 
you're going to end up with different
amounts<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:24.860> wire<00:04:25.860> on<00:04:26.280> you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
amounts of wire on you

beads you use and how long you cut your

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.320 
beads you use and how long you cut your

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
wire so just be creative it doesn't have

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.640 
wire so just be creative it doesn't have
to<00:04:33.450> end<00:04:33.480> in<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.840> same<00:04:33.990> place<00:04:34.260> if<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:34.560> have
