00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.309
 very well we are going to make a paste of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 Italian sausage but that's turkey 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.770
 so it does not have that much fat and they're 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.720
 of the normal new actions that the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.320
 I cut in small and that's what they call 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.890
 spicy are the pre- things 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 now we're going to already I 'm going to last as long as 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.780
 we left in the pot did not put 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.730
 a lot of oil 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.129
 Now let's skip what are the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.240
 vegetables we are using provoked my 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:48.260
 cut this one 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:50.030
 pumpkin and we are using the cut 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.880
 you good to the vegetables that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.940
 you want always the most vegetables 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.370
 the most nutritious that is going to be also the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.050
 let's put spinach but once 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.120
 this has been skipped so now what 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.180
 that we are going to proceed to do is to 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.030
 saute the vegetables and right now I tell you 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.100
 how is it 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.430
 and we are also here boiling the water 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.820
 to make our pasta and I like two 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.960
 guys because then because of this I 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.799
 is little and there is the arroyito and this 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.799
 it's from this time but always the 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.159
 point is how nutritious would be pasta 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.750
 integral always always always too 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.530
 let's use spinach 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.539
 let's use spinach and let's do 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.100
 the tomato for the sauce so it makes 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.440
 some of the throw that we are going to grind 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.800
 this with water but it says let's do it 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.640
 I tell them how it is 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.210
 very well we are feeling what they are 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.840
 three times only that is March the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.730
 broccoli and a pumpkin and that we are 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.280
 doing separate apart from why do you 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.950
 I'm going to do because because the green bean is a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.770
 little bit harder than that, that did not stop 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.530
 so well known but simply that is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.630
 at a hundred and I editing you I've put 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.120
 sanz and pepper or anything like that because 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.490
 because I want to look at how much is going to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.130
 give this because this is coming 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.680
 flavored with Italian spices 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.560
 then first to last he wants you 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.740
 put necessary if 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.570
 necessary we are doing this and already 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.100
 then we will proceed to skip all 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.480
 the eyes 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.970
 because it happened already they knew the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.760
 vegetable a recommendation has to 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.650
 be on high fire look at you are good at 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.730
 the highest so why 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.260
 then yes, but if we look in the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.310
 area highly nothing 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.590
 and another thing you do not know are you 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.890
 using the fungus are not salt 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.780
 because salt water makes man 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.640
 water is needed and we do not want that 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.040
 be like a shake with the base that 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.959
 we want them to be like that so it would be a 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.359
 good recommendation not to use salt 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.359
 until the end when the fungus is used 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.700
 I have very well as team 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.160
 vegetables with sausage sauce 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.950
 now let's smile what's going to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.390
 be the sauce that is the tomato I had 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.740
 said that liquefied but I do not want that 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.440
 be our milestones more or less 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.100
 so we're going to put the casserole 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.770
 that oil that looks no oil 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.730
 then that is the same one that we are going to 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.730
 use 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.690
 then from here we must apply a garlic 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:57.420
 and I'm going to throw some herbs, do not salt 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.420
 Italian personal herbs more 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.799
 now in the post the garlic is there and 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.209
 now let's put the herbs 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.209
 Italian that has 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.720
 various types of thyme 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.140
 several types of 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.990
 then we put the amount that 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.789
 you like it and we are going to move it 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.949
 and when we want it to be like a 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.070
 patita so we want to be on fire 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.070
 shortly now it is no longer 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.770
 in this high fire that breaks down a 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.930
 little bit and right now he taught them how 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.439
 it would remain while the water is already 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.439
 boiling the pasta 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.439
 shake 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.520
 a city 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.190
 because now 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.720
 I have put it because how is it going to be 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.640
 base of the chalice is and we're going to put 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.360
 a little water with this I'm 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.360
 using to 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.649
 to cook 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:11.869
 Well, he also likes spinach 

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:14.539
 so there are a few notes and then 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:16.039
 let's go there then let the water boil 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.049
 is going to build a little bit because 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.089
 we want a lime paste doubt then 

00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:21.559
 this one looks not so much water like that 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.150
 that we are going to boil and that is going to 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:27.630
 consume right now 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:31.080
 very well then well we stay the pasta 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:34.230
 with the vegetables the tomato if they can 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.470
 look here and broth because there is not with the 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:41.420
 true little bit no no no so much then 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.420
 Now we're going to serve and we're going to 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.610
 to eat but then this dish is 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.610
 food have a great 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.130
 higher in several vitamins because then 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:01.280
 we have the wheat of the pasta we have the 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.280
 turkey meat protein we have 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:08.460
 the vitamins of provo coli by far the 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.530
 garlic tomato squash then 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.169
 so our team is this so 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.509
 I hope that they try and they fix it is very 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.900
 simple to do good to have a 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.900
 advantage
