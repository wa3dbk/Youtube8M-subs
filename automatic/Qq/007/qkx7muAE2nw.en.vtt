00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
at ninety percent accuracy by default

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.670 
at ninety percent accuracy by default
right<00:03:00.060> where<00:03:00.239> 90%<00:03:00.510> sure<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.170> we're<00:03:01.290> accurate

were<00:03:19.980> looking<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.280> say<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.180> within<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
were looking to say so within the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.180 
were looking to say so within the
application<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:22.410> there<00:03:22.530> any<00:03:22.650> way<00:03:22.859> that<00:03:22.890> it's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
application is there any way that it's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.229 
application is there any way that it's
going<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.370> make<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.549> easier<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.090> don't

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
we have we have a feature called

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.440 
we have we have a feature called
