method feeder and it's kind of the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.599 
method feeder and it's kind of the
middle<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.660> day<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.140> boats<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.160> dried<00:00:23.400> up

yeah so what actually going to do is
fish<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> method<00:00:29.519> feeder<00:00:29.699> tight<00:00:30.179> against

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
fish the method feeder tight against

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.920 
fish the method feeder tight against
that<00:00:30.929> Bank<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.700> I<00:00:32.700> needed<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.090> reposition<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
I've got my method feeder ready and I'm

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
I've got my method feeder ready and I'm
going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.360> cast<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.719> over<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.290> spot<00:00:43.620> one

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
going to cast it over to that spot one

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
going to cast it over to that spot one
thing<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.059> key<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> Fisher

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
thing that's really key when you Fisher
the<00:00:46.350> method<00:00:46.649> feeder<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.129> accuracy<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.390> there's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the method feeder is accuracy so there's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
the method feeder is accuracy so there's
two<00:00:48.690> things<00:00:48.870> you've<00:00:49.079> got<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.129> want<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
two things you've got to do you want to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.819 
two things you've got to do you want to
line<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.420> far<00:00:51.719> bank<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.680> you're

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
line up with the far bank so you're

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
line up with the far bank so you're
constantly<00:00:53.039> dropping<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.730> feed<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
constantly dropping the feed you in the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
constantly dropping the feed you in the
same<00:00:54.449> place<00:00:54.660> yeah<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:55.710> I've<00:00:56.039> used<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
same place yeah but also I've used a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
same place yeah but also I've used a
line<00:00:56.610> clip<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.690> fix<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> distance<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.739> I'm

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
line clip to fix the distance that I'm

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.639 
line clip to fix the distance that I'm
casting<00:00:59.160> right<00:01:00.059> okay<00:01:00.629> yeah<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
casting right okay yeah so it's going to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.219 
casting right okay yeah so it's going to
keep<00:01:01.859> dropping<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.430> same<00:01:02.699> place<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> I'm

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
keep dropping in the same place so I'm

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.479 
keep dropping in the same place so I'm
going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> line<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> tree<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
going to line up with that tree on the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.480 
going to line up with that tree on the
far<00:01:05.760> bank<00:01:06.380> say<00:01:07.380> my<00:01:07.590> overhead<00:01:07.950> casters<00:01:08.340> with

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
far bank say my overhead casters with

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.880 
far bank say my overhead casters with
the<00:01:08.610> float<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.960> we've<00:01:10.140> got<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> feeder<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the float and we've got the feeder just

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.030 
the float and we've got the feeder just
into<00:01:11.159> position<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:12.260> near<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> far<00:01:13.530> bank<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.530 
into position there near the far bank I
noticed<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> kick<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> rod<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.360> there

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and feather the feeder down into

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.710 
and feather the feeder down into
position<00:01:22.439> because<00:01:22.710> obviously<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.479> lines

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
position because obviously the lines

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
just let the feeder hit the bottom I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.030 
just let the feeder hit the bottom I
felt<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.450> down<00:01:39.630> hit<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.900> bottom<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> I've<00:01:40.860> put

building up the peg in the same way as

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.730 
building up the peg in the same way as
we<00:02:12.780> did<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.260> Wagler

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
we did with the Wagler

we did with the Wagler
loose<00:02:14.550> feeding<00:02:15.090> we're<00:02:15.690> not<00:02:15.810> using<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.230> massive

method<00:02:16.980> feeder<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.700> casting<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.180> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
method feeder and just casting in and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.270 
method feeder and just casting in and
leaving<00:02:18.570> we'll<00:02:19.290> probably<00:02:19.440> cast<00:02:19.830> out<00:02:20.070> and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
leaving we'll probably cast out and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.850 
leaving we'll probably cast out and
leave<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.670> for<00:02:20.900> maximum<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.050> five<00:02:22.260> minutes<00:02:22.680> and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
leave it for maximum of five minutes and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.840 
leave it for maximum of five minutes and
then<00:02:23.040> repeat<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.490> process<00:02:23.520> okay<00:02:25.790> now<00:02:26.790> you

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
then repeat the process okay now you

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.880 
then repeat the process okay now you
will<00:02:27.120> see<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:27.960> little<00:02:28.140> tops<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
will see that you get little tops and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.040 
will see that you get little tops and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
Jags and pulls on the tip did you see

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.930 
Jags and pulls on the tip did you see
that<00:02:31.230> there<00:02:31.380> yeah<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.250> that's<00:02:32.400> obviously<00:02:32.580> a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
that there yeah and that's obviously a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.230 
that there yeah and that's obviously a
fish<00:02:33.210> activity<00:02:33.420> around<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> area<00:02:35.120> don't<00:02:36.120> do

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
fish activity around the area don't do

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.820 
fish activity around the area don't do
anything<00:02:36.480> about<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.870> you're<00:02:37.230> waiting<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
anything about it you're waiting for a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.820 
anything about it you're waiting for a
very<00:02:38.190> very<00:02:38.430> positive<00:02:38.750> bite<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:40.260> fact<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> rod

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
very very positive bite in fact the rod

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.830 
very very positive bite in fact the rod
or<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.220> most<00:02:42.000> probably<00:02:42.270> get<00:02:42.450> pulled<00:02:42.720> around

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
or just most probably get pulled around

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.310 
or just most probably get pulled around
okay<00:02:43.560> no<00:02:44.250> striking<00:02:44.670> involved<00:02:45.360> remember<00:02:46.200> the

okay no striking involved remember the
Fisher's<00:02:46.620> hooked<00:02:46.800> itself<00:02:47.160> let's<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:47.760> pick

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
Fisher's hooked itself let's just pick

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.000 
Fisher's hooked itself let's just pick
the<00:02:48.150> road<00:02:48.330> up<00:02:48.570> keep<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.380> low<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.860> then

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
the road up keep it low and then

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.790 
the road up keep it low and then
gradually<00:02:50.460> start<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.790> play<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.210> fish<00:02:54.470> but<00:02:55.470> ok

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
gradually start to play the fish but ok

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.650 
gradually start to play the fish but ok
and<00:02:56.010> let's<00:02:56.040> get<00:02:56.340> another<00:02:56.520> feeder<00:02:57.240> full<00:02:57.510> out

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and let's get another feeder full out

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.000 
and let's get another feeder full out
there<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:59.340> once<00:02:59.550> again<00:03:00.470> open<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> bail<00:03:01.740> arm

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
there so once again open the bail arm

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.710 
there so once again open the bail arm
yea<00:03:02.750> noise<00:03:03.750> smooth<00:03:04.320> cast<00:03:05.270> over<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> spot

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
yea noise smooth cast over to the spot

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.050 
yea noise smooth cast over to the spot
stop<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.740> just<00:03:07.770> drop<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.580> into<00:03:08.790> position

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
stop it and just drop it into position

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.990 
stop it and just drop it into position
look<00:03:09.570> okay<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.320> as<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.740> said<00:03:10.800> before<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.820> road

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
look okay and as I said before the road

rest is there I'll engage the bail arm

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.130 
rest is there I'll engage the bail arm
and<00:03:14.850> all<00:03:14.970> I've<00:03:15.090> got<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.270> do<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.690> put<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.900> rudd

and all I've got to do is put the rudd

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.350 
and all I've got to do is put the rudd
down<00:03:16.350> on<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.650> rod<00:03:16.800> rest<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.730> we're<00:03:17.880> fishing<00:03:18.240> I

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
down on the rod rest and we're fishing I

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.070 
down on the rod rest and we're fishing I
don't<00:03:18.630> do<00:03:18.750> anything<00:03:18.990> yeah<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.780> now<00:03:24.900> we're

unmissable here well like I told you
that's<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.640> key<00:03:30.290> advantage<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.410> using<00:03:31.590> a

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
that's the key advantage of using a

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.640 
that's the key advantage of using a
method<00:03:32.100> feeder<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.880> fish<00:03:33.090> hooks<00:03:33.300> itself<00:03:33.750> so

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
method feeder the fish hooks itself so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.350 
method feeder the fish hooks itself so
you<00:03:34.710> will<00:03:35.010> get<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.340> indications<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.150> nuts

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
you will get the indications and nuts

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.670 
you will get the indications and nuts
and<00:03:36.480> taps<00:03:36.720> I've<00:03:36.900> talked<00:03:37.080> about<00:03:37.350> but<00:03:37.470> when<00:03:37.590> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
and taps I've talked about but when you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.250 
and taps I've talked about but when you
get<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.860> bite<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.340> will<00:03:38.430> be<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.580> very<00:03:38.790> positive

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
get a bite it will be a very positive

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.080 
get a bite it will be a very positive
affair<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.830> that's<00:03:41.100> if<00:03:41.460> you<00:03:41.640> weren't<00:03:41.820> here

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
affair if that's if you weren't here

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.450 
affair if that's if you weren't here
you'd<00:03:42.690> probably<00:03:42.960> pull<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.380> rod<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.710> whatever

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
you'd probably pull the rod in whatever

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.310 
you'd probably pull the rod in whatever
you<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.850> don't<00:03:45.120> leave<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.480> rod<00:03:45.630> under<00:03:45.930> 10<00:03:46.140> this

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
you do don't leave the rod under 10 this

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.030 
you do don't leave the rod under 10 this
because<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:47.160> likely<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.490> lose<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.790> lot

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.040 

that's<00:03:54.040> what<00:03:54.250> made<00:03:56.459> there<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.520> go<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:58.050> really

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
that's what made there you go and really

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.170 
that's what made there you go and really
good<00:03:59.410> boy<00:03:59.560> wasn't<00:03:59.800> it<00:03:59.980> yeah<00:04:00.190> fantastic<00:04:01.000> mate

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
good boy wasn't it yeah fantastic mate

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.360 
good boy wasn't it yeah fantastic mate
but<00:04:02.080> it<00:04:02.140> doesn't<00:04:02.410> feel<00:04:02.500> like<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.709> massive<00:04:02.980> fish

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
but it doesn't feel like a massive fish

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.790 
but it doesn't feel like a massive fish
but<00:04:03.670> as<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.810> can<00:04:04.930> see<00:04:05.140> I'm<00:04:05.230> keeping<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.650> rod

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
but as you can see I'm keeping the rod

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.820 
but as you can see I'm keeping the rod
low<00:04:06.069> yep<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.230> that<00:04:08.230> you'll<00:04:08.380> find<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.709> the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
low yep and that you'll find that the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.020 
low yep and that you'll find that the
fish<00:04:09.040> don't<00:04:09.280> fight<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.670> hard<00:04:09.910> okay<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:13.000> just

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
fish don't fight is hard okay and just

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.479 
fish don't fight is hard okay and just
keep<00:04:13.510> reeling<00:04:14.140> keep<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.830> bending<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.310> rod

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
keep reeling keep that bending the rod

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:28.510 
keep reeling keep that bending the rod
and<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:18.489> everything<00:04:18.609> nice<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.090> smoothly

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.610 

so<00:04:29.090> I'm<00:04:29.150> going<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.360> change<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.169> angle<00:04:30.410> on<00:04:30.500> the

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
so I'm going to change the angle on the

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:39.210 
so I'm going to change the angle on the
fish<00:04:31.180> with<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.270> side<00:04:32.509> strain

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.760 

and<00:04:40.220> as<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:40.490> starts<00:04:40.820> to<00:04:40.880> come<00:04:41.120> closer<00:04:41.390> in<00:04:44.770> start

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
and as it starts to come closer in start

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.740 
and as it starts to come closer in start
to<00:04:45.890> give<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.190> bit<00:04:46.340> more<00:04:46.370> pressure<00:04:46.700> but<00:04:47.570> as

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
to give it a bit more pressure but as

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.210 
to give it a bit more pressure but as
you<00:04:47.960> can<00:04:48.080> see<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.590> just<00:04:48.800> took<00:04:48.890> off<00:04:49.070> again

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
you can see and that just took off again

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.490 
you can see and that just took off again
so<00:04:49.580> just<00:04:49.610> let<00:04:49.910> it<00:04:50.060> go<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.900> just<00:04:51.140> don't<00:04:51.320> want<00:04:51.470> to

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
so just let it go you just don't want to

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.130 
so just let it go you just don't want to
be<00:04:51.620> rushing<00:04:51.980> it<00:04:52.070> I<00:04:52.100> mean<00:04:52.870> clownfish<00:04:53.870> is<00:04:54.050> the

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
be rushing it I mean clownfish is the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.630 
be rushing it I mean clownfish is the
best<00:04:54.350> part<00:04:54.590> of<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.770> whole<00:04:54.890> thing<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.430> can't
