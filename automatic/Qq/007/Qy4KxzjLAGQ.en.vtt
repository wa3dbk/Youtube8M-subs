00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.060
 you see behind us but josemi 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:37.399
 behind josemi to see the head by 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.399
 under 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.000
 you have to look back and when 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.070
 you see that we are approaching accelerate and it is not 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.070
 easier to accelerate from behind no no no 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.260
 my mother 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:10.950

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.009
 now 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
 we go 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:53.979
 and you are more than me 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.490
 this iron bridge from the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.200
 airport but on the side but if 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:06.090
 we went up with him 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.090
 charge twice if many Latinos come 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:14.430
 up I'll put to fall and 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.430
 once we do not smoke it too 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.959
 we can climb 5 or 6 bikes and have it and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.360
 spare parts side we follow 56 bikes 20 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.390
 trucks on the bridge as measured one meter 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.610
 we only put it in piles in a serious way 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.190
 until you can not put more things 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.209
 catch one by one and upload 20 trucks 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.209
 within the serving 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.600
 came on a motorcycle I mean I can not 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.440
 pull so it's the kilometer river that 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.440
 has where the road is 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:06.330
 I do not 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:06.330
 when it's close to below 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.430
 so he's going to bring me a motorcycle to see 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.380
 there is enough space to drive a motorbike 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.380
 Oostia, how are you? 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.270

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.270
 will emit the perfect bastard uncle 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.670

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.300

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.280

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.970
