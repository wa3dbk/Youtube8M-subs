00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
so as you're rolling I just start

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.559 
so as you're rolling I just start
opening<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.129> my<00:02:08.250> shoulders<00:02:08.640> start<00:02:09.300> turning

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
like you're gonna do 180 and then I let

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.729 
like you're gonna do 180 and then I let
my<00:02:11.760> front<00:02:12.000> toes<00:02:12.209> fall<00:02:13.019> off<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:13.530> soon<00:02:13.560> as

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
my front toes fall off and as soon as

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.449 
my front toes fall off and as soon as
they<00:02:13.860> fall<00:02:14.010> off<00:02:15.890> causes<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> board<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.280> turn

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
they fall off causes the board to turn

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.699 
they fall off causes the board to turn

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
and so it's all pretty much one motion

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.250 
and so it's all pretty much one motion
you're<00:02:19.920> gonna<00:02:20.010> roll<00:02:20.250> your<00:02:20.519> front<00:02:21.480> foot<00:02:21.660> slides

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
