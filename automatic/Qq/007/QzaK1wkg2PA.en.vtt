an<00:00:41.430> abnormally<00:00:42.120> high<00:00:42.149> percentage<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.019> the<00:00:43.680> CPU

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
an abnormally high percentage of the CPU

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.430

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.170 
of course next up corrected an issue
where<00:03:25.319> certain<00:03:25.950> characters<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.790> windows

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
where certain characters in the windows

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.030 
where certain characters in the windows
usernames<00:03:27.870> would<00:03:28.079> cause<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.500> launcher<00:03:28.919> to

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
usernames would cause the launcher to

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.750 
usernames would cause the launcher to
fail<00:03:29.280> or<00:03:29.879> other<00:03:30.120> undesired<00:03:31.019> game<00:03:31.349> behavior<00:03:32.010> so

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
fail or other undesired game behavior so

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.610 
fail or other undesired game behavior so
this<00:03:33.180> was<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.329> pretty<00:03:33.599> round<00:03:33.930> bug<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.560> I

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
this was a pretty round bug and I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.670 
this was a pretty round bug and I
actually<00:03:34.739> know<00:03:35.069> pretty<00:03:35.549> few<00:03:36.299> good<00:03:36.930> youtubers

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
actually know pretty few good youtubers

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.470 
actually know pretty few good youtubers
that<00:03:37.709> actually<00:03:38.099> have<00:03:38.219> this<00:03:38.340> problem<00:03:39.000> so

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that actually have this problem so

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.479 
that actually have this problem so
basically<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.109> use<00:03:40.319> some<00:03:40.620> odd<00:03:40.859> characters

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
basically if you use some odd characters

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.949 
basically if you use some odd characters
I<00:03:41.700> think<00:03:41.879> like<00:03:42.000> under<00:03:42.359> schools<00:03:42.629> or<00:03:42.780> things

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
I think like under schools or things

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.289 
I think like under schools or things
like<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.219> basically<00:03:44.219> calls<00:03:44.669> your<00:03:44.819> launcher

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
like that basically calls your launcher

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.610 
like that basically calls your launcher
they're<00:03:45.480> crashing<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.139> wouldn't<00:03:46.349> be<00:03:46.439> able<00:03:46.500> to

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
they're crashing you wouldn't be able to

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.059 
they're crashing you wouldn't be able to
load<00:03:46.769> into<00:03:46.979> the<00:03:47.069> game<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.720> at<00:03:48.720> first<00:03:49.169> it<00:03:49.919> was<00:03:50.010> a

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
load into the game and at first it was a

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.559 
load into the game and at first it was a
real<00:03:50.250> problem<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.849> you<00:03:51.120> can<00:03:51.269> really<00:03:51.449> do

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
real problem and you can really do

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.080 
real problem and you can really do
anything<00:03:51.750> about<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.079> so<00:03:52.229> yeah<00:03:53.220> they<00:03:53.639> fix<00:03:53.909> that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
anything about it so yeah they fix that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.460 
anything about it so yeah they fix that
now<00:03:54.239> which<00:03:54.419> is<00:03:54.540> really<00:03:54.569> cool<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.019> was<00:03:55.229> a<00:03:55.260> big

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
now which is really cool that was a big

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.930 
now which is really cool that was a big
issue<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:56.069> I<00:03:56.099> think<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.400> lot<00:03:56.579> of<00:03:56.609> people<00:03:56.849> were

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
issue that I think a lot of people were

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.059 
issue that I think a lot of people were
expecting<00:03:57.299> them<00:03:57.419> to<00:03:57.449> fix<00:03:57.840> next<00:03:58.530> up<00:03:58.650> fixed<00:03:58.979> an

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
expecting them to fix next up fixed an

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.559 
expecting them to fix next up fixed an
issue<00:03:59.220> where<00:03:59.519> players<00:03:59.760> with<00:04:00.030> one<00:04:00.239> garage

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
issue where players with one garage

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.539 
issue where players with one garage
would<00:04:00.689> not<00:04:00.930> be<00:04:01.079> able<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.349> replace<00:04:01.769> an<00:04:02.010> existing

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
would not be able to replace an existing

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.179 
would not be able to replace an existing
vehicle<00:04:02.790> if<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.780> garage<00:04:04.049> was<00:04:04.229> full<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
vehicle if the garage was full and the

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.469 
vehicle if the garage was full and the
new<00:04:05.340> vehicle<00:04:05.729> was<00:04:05.849> purchased<00:04:06.239> from<00:04:06.299> an

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
new vehicle was purchased from an

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.390 
new vehicle was purchased from an
in-game<00:04:06.810> website<00:04:07.260> so<00:04:07.590> that's<00:04:07.739> cool<00:04:08.010> now<00:04:08.340> it

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400
