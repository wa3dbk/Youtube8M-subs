ok<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.069> tutorial<00:00:05.640> for<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:07.760> cannon<00:00:08.930> who

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
ok this is the tutorial for a cannon who

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:18.620 
ok this is the tutorial for a cannon who
required<00:00:10.410> add-ons<00:00:11.160> are<00:00:13.789> PHX<00:00:14.789> free<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:17.600> why<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
required add-ons are PHX free and why a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.589 
required add-ons are PHX free and why a
more<00:00:18.990> than<00:00:19.199> i'd<00:00:19.320> recommend<00:00:19.830> smart<00:00:20.369> world<00:00:20.640> the

more than i'd recommend smart world the

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.329 
more than i'd recommend smart world the
first<00:00:21.900> thing<00:00:22.259> you<00:00:22.410> need<00:00:22.640> is<00:00:24.589> this<00:00:25.589> thing<00:00:25.890> which

first thing you need is this thing which

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.569 
first thing you need is this thing which
is<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:27.060> small<00:00:27.300> cannon<00:00:28.259> clip<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:29.279> search<00:00:29.550> for

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
is a small cannon clip just search for

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.490 
is a small cannon clip just search for
Canon<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:31.199> called<00:00:31.439> small<00:00:31.740> cannon<00:00:32.040> clip

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
Canon and it's called small cannon clip

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.709 
Canon and it's called small cannon clip
so<00:00:34.500> freeze<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.610> press<00:00:36.030> E<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.690> shift<00:00:37.879> to<00:00:38.879> rotate

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so freeze it press E and shift to rotate

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.360 
so freeze it press E and shift to rotate
it<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.289> a<00:00:40.890> certain<00:00:42.079> angle<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:45.320> make<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.530> força

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
it to a certain angle and make a força

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.090 
it to a certain angle and make a força
and<00:00:47.989> a<00:00:50.930> ranger<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.410> spawn<00:00:52.649> them<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and a ranger just spawn them to the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.569 
and a ranger just spawn them to the
ground<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.899> Ranger<00:00:58.440> should<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:59.340> should

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
ground and the Ranger should they should

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.779 
ground and the Ranger should they should
both<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.300> range<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.859> 150<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.519> whereabouts

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
both have a range of 150 or whereabouts

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.509 
both have a range of 150 or whereabouts
and<00:01:03.379> however<00:01:04.379> force<00:01:04.739> should<00:01:04.980> have<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.220> really

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and however force should have a really

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.810 
and however force should have a really
big<00:01:05.730> force<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:10.190> align<00:01:11.190> them<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.670> may

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
big force and so just align them so may

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.150 
big force and so just align them so may
look<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.230> range<00:01:13.620> is<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
look like that but the range is at the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.600 
look like that but the range is at the
bottom<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.490> forces<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> top<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:22.200> then

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
bottom of forces at the top and then

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.770 
bottom of forces at the top and then
just<00:01:23.610> wire<00:01:23.910> them<00:01:24.150> up

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.480 

you<00:01:28.350> can't<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> wire<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:31.100> some<00:01:32.100> reason

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
you can't see the wire but some reason

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.990 
you can't see the wire but some reason
however<00:01:35.490> there's<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.720> wire<00:01:39.710> ok<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
however there's a wire ok so this if you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.380 
however there's a wire ok so this if you
drop<00:01:42.270> something<00:01:42.509> down<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.259> chute<00:01:43.640> then<00:01:44.640> it'll

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
drop something down the chute then it'll

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.060 
drop something down the chute then it'll
get<00:01:45.750> shot<00:01:46.080> out<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.560> end<00:01:47.420> very<00:01:48.420> quickly<00:01:49.070> now

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
get shot out to the end very quickly now

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.859 
get shot out to the end very quickly now
you<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.330> weld<00:01:51.690> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
you just have to but you have to weld it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
you just have to but you have to weld it
together<00:01:52.590> first<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> doesn't<00:01:53.580> fall<00:01:53.729> apart

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
together first so it doesn't fall apart

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.539 
together first so it doesn't fall apart
and<00:01:54.409> are<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> smart<00:01:55.920> well<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.430> because

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and are you smart well for that because

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.400 
and are you smart well for that because
it's<00:01:56.729> easiest<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:02.869> well<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.050> can<00:02:04.229> put

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
it's easiest and well you can put

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.430 
it's easiest and well you can put
anything<00:02:04.710> inside<00:02:05.070> where<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.289> recommend<00:02:07.289> a

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
anything inside where I recommend a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.259 
anything inside where I recommend a
cannonball<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.280> search<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.489> Canon<00:02:08.970> again

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
cannonball just search for Canon again

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.720 
cannonball just search for Canon again
it's<00:02:09.959> small<00:02:10.140> cannon<00:02:10.679> ball<00:02:12.050> but<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.730> snowball

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
it's small cannon ball but a snowball

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.680 
it's small cannon ball but a snowball
snow<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.269> head<00:02:15.510> from<00:02:15.720> counter-strike<00:02:16.560> works

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
snow my head from counter-strike works

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.420 
snow my head from counter-strike works
so<00:02:18.690> that's<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.380> could<00:02:19.590> be<00:02:19.739> quite<00:02:20.100> funny

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.920 

where's<00:02:23.430> your<00:02:23.730> there's<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:25.069> cannonball

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.569 

just<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.099> snug<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:34.170> there<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.159> that<00:02:35.189> if<00:02:35.459> you

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
just get it snug in there so that if you

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.050 
just get it snug in there so that if you
tip<00:02:35.969> it<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.329> tangle<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.439> won't<00:02:37.650> fall<00:02:37.950> out<00:02:38.060> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
tip it to tangle it won't fall out and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.339 
tip it to tangle it won't fall out and
you've<00:02:39.299> got<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.510> make<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.780> into<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.049> prop

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
you've got to make it into a prop

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:59.260 
you've got to make it into a prop
spawner<00:02:41.569> just<00:02:42.569> freeze<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.079> there

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.260 

and<00:03:00.270> when<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.380> weld<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.880> the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
and when you have to weld it to the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.860 
and when you have to weld it to the
cannon<00:03:04.370> Sauve<00:03:05.370> yeah<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.300> doesn't<00:03:06.750> fall

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
cannon Sauve yeah so it doesn't fall

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.930 
cannon Sauve yeah so it doesn't fall
apart<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:09.140> unfreeze<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:11.340> press<00:03:11.730> for

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
apart and unfreeze it and then press for

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.530 
apart and unfreeze it and then press for
binding<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:13.470> falls<00:03:13.800> down<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.790> chute<00:03:15.270> and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
binding and it falls down the chute and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.960 
binding and it falls down the chute and
yet<00:03:16.110> shot<00:03:16.410> out<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.830> side<00:03:19.370> as<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.580> can<00:03:20.730> see

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
yet shot out of a side as you can see

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.210 
yet shot out of a side as you can see
when<00:03:21.210> you<00:03:21.360> go<00:03:21.570> quite<00:03:21.900> far<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.040> very

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
when you go quite far this is very

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.540 
when you go quite far this is very
dangerous<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:24.090> I've<00:03:24.180> tested<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.810> does<00:03:25.550> 500

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
dangerous so I've tested it does 500

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.080 
dangerous so I've tested it does 500
damage<00:03:26.760> make<00:03:27.510> sure<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.840> don't<00:03:28.910> fill<00:03:29.910> up<00:03:29.940> your

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
damage make sure you don't fill up your

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.870 
damage make sure you don't fill up your
map<00:03:30.510> with<00:03:30.840> cannonballs<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.490> do<00:03:32.670> that

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
map with cannonballs and you do that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.540 
map with cannonballs and you do that
would<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.900> ewer<00:03:34.140> remove<00:03:35.100> em<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.430> the
