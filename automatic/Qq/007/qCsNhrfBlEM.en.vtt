and<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:27.160> type<00:01:27.370> that<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.610> used<00:01:27.940> for<00:01:28.150> your

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
and the type that you used for your

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.120 
and the type that you used for your
compression<00:01:28.780> gauge<00:01:28.960> set<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.620> he<00:01:29.680> took<00:01:29.980> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
compression gauge set and he took the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.860 
compression gauge set and he took the
number<00:01:30.400> one<00:01:30.550> spark<00:01:30.910> plug<00:01:31.180> out<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.390> screwed

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
number one spark plug out and screwed

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.320 
number one spark plug out and screwed
the<00:01:31.900> hose<00:01:32.170> right<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.890> cylinder<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.790> then

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
the hose right in the cylinder and then

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.500 
the hose right in the cylinder and then
he<00:01:34.750> took<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.020> spark<00:01:35.680> plug<00:01:36.190> wire<00:01:36.520> off<00:01:36.880> from

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
he took that spark plug wire off from

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.480 
he took that spark plug wire off from
number<00:01:37.840> one<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.320> connected<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> spark

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
number one and connected it to a spark

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.150 
number one and connected it to a spark
tester<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.690> he<00:01:40.810> could<00:01:40.990> simulate<00:01:41.290> a<00:01:41.740> spark<00:01:42.100> plug

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
tester so he could simulate a spark plug

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.520 
tester so he could simulate a spark plug
what<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.270> allowed<00:01:43.540> him<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.840> do<00:01:43.990> was<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.320> take

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
what this allowed him to do was to take

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.010 
what this allowed him to do was to take
a<00:01:44.800> sink<00:01:45.490> probe<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.090> connect<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.630> around<00:01:46.870> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
a sink probe and connect it around the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.110 
a sink probe and connect it around the
plug<00:01:47.230> wire<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:48.190> now<00:01:48.310> his<00:01:48.550> scope<00:01:48.910> is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
plug wire so now his scope is

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.450 
plug wire so now his scope is
synchronized<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.350> ignition<00:01:50.650> set<00:01:51.130> system

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
synchronized to the ignition set system

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.540 
synchronized to the ignition set system
and<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.840> screen<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.470> going<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.830> allow<00:01:54.100> him<00:01:54.370> to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
and the screen is going to allow him to

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.180 
and the screen is going to allow him to
look<00:01:54.790> at<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.540> actual<00:01:55.930> compression<00:01:56.500> pressures

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
look at the actual compression pressures

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.070 
look at the actual compression pressures
that<00:01:57.370> are<00:01:57.520> occurring<00:01:57.940> in<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.120> Psalter<00:01:58.540> each

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
that are occurring in the Psalter each

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.140 
that are occurring in the Psalter each
time<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.590> piston<00:02:00.010> goes<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.370> top<00:02:00.580> dead<00:02:00.820> center

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
time that piston goes to top dead center

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.359 
time that piston goes to top dead center
it's<00:02:01.330> going<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.720> create<00:02:02.020> pressure<00:02:02.320> each<00:02:03.010> time

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
it's going to create pressure each time

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.040 
it's going to create pressure each time
it<00:02:03.550> goes<00:02:03.670> down<00:02:03.729> at<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.210> bottom<00:02:04.570> you're<00:02:04.960> gonna

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
it goes down at the bottom you're gonna

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.270 
it goes down at the bottom you're gonna
see<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.440> pressure<00:02:05.680> drop<00:02:06.010> off<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:07.540> going<00:02:07.900> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
see the pressure drop off it's going to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.720 
see the pressure drop off it's going to
go<00:02:09.280> through<00:02:09.670> all<00:02:10.060> four<00:02:10.980> strokes<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.280> then

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
go through all four strokes and then

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.130 
go through all four strokes and then
it's<00:02:12.910> going<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.150> repeat<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.600> compression

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
it's going to repeat the compression

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.620 
it's going to repeat the compression
stroke<00:02:14.350> again<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.250> let's<00:02:15.520> zoom<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
stroke again so let's zoom in on the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.440 
stroke again so let's zoom in on the
waveform<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:17.590> fellow<00:02:17.920> acquired<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
waveform that this fellow acquired the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.750 
waveform that this fellow acquired the
first<00:02:19.690> thing<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.990> like<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> point<00:02:20.350> out<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:21.340> that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
first thing I like to point out is that

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.580 
first thing I like to point out is that
what<00:02:22.060> you're<00:02:22.209> seeing<00:02:22.480> here<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.290> yellow

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
what you're seeing here with this yellow

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.130 
what you're seeing here with this yellow
peak<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.640> I'm<00:02:25.269> gonna<00:02:25.360> draw<00:02:25.630> an<00:02:25.780> arrow<00:02:26.019> going

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
peak and I'm gonna draw an arrow going

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.350 
peak and I'm gonna draw an arrow going
up<00:02:26.560> that's<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.070> piston<00:02:27.519> going<00:02:27.820> up<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.180> top

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
up that's the piston going up on top

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.860 
up that's the piston going up on top
dead<00:02:28.600> center<00:02:29.910> then<00:02:30.910> once<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.300> piston<00:02:31.660> gets

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
dead center then once the piston gets

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.750 
dead center then once the piston gets
the<00:02:31.989> top<00:02:32.200> dead<00:02:32.410> center<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:32.860> travels<00:02:33.250> back<00:02:33.430> down

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
the top dead center it travels back down

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.650 
the top dead center it travels back down
and<00:02:34.060> what<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:34.900> see<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.980> pressure<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.030> the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
and what we see is the pressure and the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.720 
and what we see is the pressure and the
cylinder<00:02:38.340> depressurizing<00:02:39.340> because<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
cylinder depressurizing because the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.850 
cylinder depressurizing because the
piston<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.150> going<00:02:40.390> down<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.900> then<00:02:41.500> at<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
piston is going down and then at the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.090 
piston is going down and then at the
bottom<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.580> we<00:02:43.090> see<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.780> valve<00:02:44.620> open

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
bottom of that we see the valve open

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.449 
bottom of that we see the valve open
exhaust<00:02:45.580> valve<00:02:46.590> right<00:02:47.590> here<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.070> middle

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
exhaust valve right here in the middle

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.540 
exhaust valve right here in the middle
but<00:02:49.300> there's<00:02:49.540> there's<00:02:49.860> all<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:51.160> know<00:02:51.280> even

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
but there's there's all you know even

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.120 
but there's there's all you know even
though<00:02:51.670> there's<00:02:51.940> there's<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.739> an<00:02:53.739> event

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
though there's there's a an event

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.890 
though there's there's a an event
happening<00:02:54.640> we<00:02:54.790> don't<00:02:54.910> see<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.300> because<00:02:55.720> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
happening we don't see it because the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.170 
happening we don't see it because the
exhaust<00:02:56.200> valves<00:02:56.620> open<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.430> at<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.700> point<00:02:57.940> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
exhaust valves open so at this point the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.060 
exhaust valves open so at this point the
piston<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.630> going<00:02:58.900> back<00:02:59.110> up<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.530> top<00:02:59.830> dead

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
piston is going back up a top dead

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.449 
piston is going back up a top dead
center<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.660> exhaust<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.709> piston<00:03:03.130> pushes

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
center on exhaust so the piston pushes

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.160 
center on exhaust so the piston pushes
the<00:03:03.640> gases<00:03:04.060> out<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.420> solder<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:04.959> then<00:03:05.019> it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
the gases out of the solder and then it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.500 
the gases out of the solder and then it
comes<00:03:05.350> back<00:03:05.440> down<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:06.070> intake<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:07.060> finally

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
comes back down on intake and finally

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.810 
comes back down on intake and finally
goes<00:03:07.660> back<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.200> on<00:03:08.590> compression<00:03:09.100> right<00:03:09.489> here

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
goes back up on compression right here

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.390 
goes back up on compression right here
all<00:03:10.570> right<00:03:10.630> it's<00:03:10.930> time<00:03:11.080> for<00:03:11.290> questions<00:03:11.410> Chuck

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
all right it's time for questions Chuck

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.310 
all right it's time for questions Chuck
well<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.730> got<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.209> first<00:03:13.690> case<00:03:13.900> study<00:03:14.170> with

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
well you got the first case study with

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.039 
well you got the first case study with
the<00:03:14.410> VW<00:03:14.709> uh-huh<00:03:15.580> we<00:03:16.510> had<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.660> question<00:03:16.810> here

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
the VW uh-huh we had a question here

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.870 
the VW uh-huh we had a question here
wouldn't<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.650> scenario<00:03:18.070> cause<00:03:18.340> problem

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
wouldn't this scenario cause problem

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.060 
wouldn't this scenario cause problem
with<00:03:19.000> compression<00:03:19.660> cause<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.560> be<00:03:20.709> out<00:03:20.920> of

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
with compression cause it to be out of

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.610 
with compression cause it to be out of
light<00:03:21.310> time<00:03:21.730> also<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.540> original<00:03:23.019> technician

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
light time also the original technician

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.820 
light time also the original technician
put<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.250> timing<00:03:24.700> belt<00:03:24.730> on<00:03:25.260> based<00:03:26.260> upon<00:03:26.590> his

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
put a timing belt on based upon his

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.040 
put a timing belt on based upon his
compression<00:03:27.100> gauge<00:03:27.459> readings<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.600> it

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
compression gauge readings so it

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.690 
compression gauge readings so it
definitely<00:03:29.590> had<00:03:29.740> low<00:03:29.920> compression

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
definitely had low compression

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.559 
definitely had low compression
and<00:03:31.090> when<00:03:31.270> we<00:03:31.450> look<00:03:31.690> at<00:03:31.720> our<00:03:32.349> waveform<00:03:33.270> we<00:03:34.270> see

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
and when we look at our waveform we see

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.410 
and when we look at our waveform we see
that<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.400> peak<00:03:36.400> compression<00:03:37.120> for<00:03:37.300> this

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
that the peak compression for this

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:47.190 
that the peak compression for this
engine<00:03:37.630> at<00:03:37.900> cranking<00:03:38.319> was<00:03:38.800> only<00:03:39.040> 60<00:03:39.430> psi

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.620 

well<00:03:47.950> now<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.130> technician<00:03:48.910> runs<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.300> agent

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
well now the technician runs the agent

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.839 
well now the technician runs the agent
at<00:03:49.720> 2500<00:03:50.590> rpm<00:03:51.099> and<00:03:51.489> lets<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.940> warm<00:03:52.180> up<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:53.849> when

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
at 2500 rpm and lets it warm up and when

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.990 
at 2500 rpm and lets it warm up and when
he<00:03:55.290> gets<00:03:56.290> through<00:03:56.800> warming<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.400> engine<00:03:57.849> up

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
he gets through warming the engine up

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.660 
he gets through warming the engine up
which<00:03:58.540> occur<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.260> lets<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.739> go<00:03:59.950> back<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.310> idle

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
which occur and lets it go back to idle

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.110

which<00:04:00.880> occurs<00:04:01.239> right<00:04:01.480> about<00:04:01.810> here<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:03.160> engine

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
which occurs right about here the engine

trim on bank one is adding about 13% and

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.789 
trim on bank one is adding about 13% and
bank<00:04:14.590> two<00:04:14.890> is<00:04:15.130> now<00:04:15.310> subtracting<00:04:16.120> near<00:04:16.350> 14%

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
bank two is now subtracting near 14%

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.050

a<00:04:18.859> 50%<00:04:19.519> duty<00:04:20.090> cycle<00:04:20.269> puts<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:22.060> solenoid

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
a 50% duty cycle puts the the solenoid

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.659 
a 50% duty cycle puts the the solenoid
in<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.479> position<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:24.050> blocks<00:04:24.530> oil<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.430> both

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.360 
in a position that blocks oil to both
cavities<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.259> is<00:04:27.470> how<00:04:27.620> they<00:04:27.800> lock<00:04:28.099> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
cavities so this is how they lock the

cam in place once the proper position
has<00:04:31.729> been<00:04:31.970> achieved<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:34.610> 35%<00:04:35.560> value<00:04:36.560> is<00:04:36.860> the

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
has been achieved the 35% value is the

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.210 
has been achieved the 35% value is the

Michael has a question along the lines

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.350 
Michael has a question along the lines
of<00:05:45.600> when<00:05:46.020> servicing<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.620> hybrid<00:05:47.070> a/c<00:05:47.310> does<00:05:47.970> it

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
of when servicing the hybrid a/c does it

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.360 
of when servicing the hybrid a/c does it
cost<00:05:48.630> more<00:05:49.050> or<00:05:49.320> is<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.410> about<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.890> same<00:05:50.160> two

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
cost more or is it about the same two

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.020 
cost more or is it about the same two

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.760 
yeah the refrigerant capacity to the
system<00:06:02.730> I<00:06:02.820> think<00:06:02.850> is<00:06:03.090> down<00:06:03.330> there<00:06:03.510> like

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
system I think is down there like

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.340 
system I think is down there like
fourteen<00:06:04.770> or<00:06:04.919> sixteen<00:06:05.070> ounces<00:06:05.730> so<00:06:06.230> you<00:06:07.230> know

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
fourteen or sixteen ounces so you know

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.920 
fourteen or sixteen ounces so you know
the<00:06:07.650> refrigerant<00:06:08.580> costs<00:06:09.090> obviously<00:06:09.270> be<00:06:09.690> cheap

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
the refrigerant costs obviously be cheap

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.380 
the refrigerant costs obviously be cheap
but<00:06:10.140> the<00:06:10.320> but<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.100> oil<00:06:11.250> won't<00:06:11.640> be<00:06:11.820> so<00:06:12.210> if

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
but the but the oil won't be so if

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.950 
but the but the oil won't be so if
you're<00:06:12.600> pure<00:06:13.260> in<00:06:13.410> there<00:06:13.650> for<00:06:13.950> a<00:06:14.280> replacement<00:06:14.960> I

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
you're pure in there for a replacement I

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.200 
you're pure in there for a replacement I
would<00:06:16.530> say<00:06:16.800> you<00:06:17.310> know<00:06:17.400> that's<00:06:17.550> when<00:06:17.790> the<00:06:17.910> oils

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
would say you know that's when the oils

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.810 
would say you know that's when the oils
gonna<00:06:18.570> come<00:06:18.840> into<00:06:18.990> play<00:06:19.400> all<00:06:20.400> right<00:06:20.460> Chuck

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
gonna come into play all right Chuck

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.550 
gonna come into play all right Chuck
