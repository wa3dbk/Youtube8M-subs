00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello friends with you panda im very 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.530
 a lot of me senior lately about 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.630
 update 679 for dotka everyone is experiencing 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.340
 what will happen to the game personally, I am very 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.890
 I am calm about this because I 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.630
 I think that Gabe and his team are very 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.949
 well balances their games but by 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.109
 at least by the example of dota me 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.519
 it seems that they have problems especially with this 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.720
 No, I just know examples of games. 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.980
 hi blizzard which is absolutely absolutely 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.009
 balanced by some Koreans somewhere 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.140
 on your knees and then this balance is just 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.000
 terrible in dota same such moments 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 so that some hero bent straight and not 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.620
 I do not remember contr 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.410
 at least water second dota up to 1 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.149
 of course it was fake such moments but 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.600
 again it was not long before the next 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.820
 patch 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 that's why I think everything will be 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.399
 ok of course the mineral was not introduced again 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.890
 how much can you wait for the mine is of course 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.030
 it is just impossible already but 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.890
 hope that someday 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.140
 someday and more that you probably already 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.239
 have seen the arts and it will just look 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.630
 beautiful much more beautiful than the first 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.920
 Dotke I would like to make out some 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.200
 update moments because all of them 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.960
 I think that everyone has already read it 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 only lazy has not looked moments 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.140
 on game mechanics which me 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 seemed interesting and so after 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.710
 foreclosure 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.240
 25 percent remaining respawn time 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.060
 added to respawn after your 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 the next death is probably done 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.570
 so that you are swimming you have sweat 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.460
 some such let's say a flaw up 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.049
 disease call what's called in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.200
 some other games by we are quite 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.670
 a logical solution that is just she 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 need not to delay so 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.869
 Grute isis leader died then he died before 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 the end of them would have to be long 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.729
 at the base because when i'm strong kerry 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.170
 which is there a turn in this game which is 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.750
 you are now on screen yes there is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.920
 Mortra has a ghoul and in principle the game is on 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.930
 quite differently when one of these 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.340
 kerry dies because the team 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.000
 gets strong advantage of course 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.659
 cool when the main carry in the cemetery 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.700
 there is an opportunity in the tavern since 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.799
 in dota whales tavern still say 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.659
 Here is the opportunity to skip 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.149
 there is a possibility therefore that here is a horror 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.610
 good idea bag further ashan perry 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.760
 reborn between 8 and 11 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.470
 minutes and after death is fine this 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.489
 enhances the role of wards and it just 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.959
 fine that is not the game becomes 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.700
 slightly more random more 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.220
 interesting I find it very cool 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.590
 changes now change by which i 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.530
 a little bit confused a couple of 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.480
 them up to the initial gold reserve increased from 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.140
 600 3 to 125 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.329
 well plus or minus yes that's what i don't like 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.129
 what is the amount of gold if you choose 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.390
 random hero reduced by fifty dollars i 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.760
 I think that the random hero is still 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.260
 choose cool and I liked myself 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.000
 choose your random hero exactly 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.160
 because of the bonus and now as if on the shelves 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.129
 less well anyway one 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.260
 I will not buy a branch unpleasantly but 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.640
 no less tolerant again excellent 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.470
 innovation that amount of gold 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.329
 which you get for interrupting a series 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.519
 killing payment and both enough 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.440
 not bad it's 10 very cool there already 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.299
 now we get more gold each 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.599
 second but to be more precise every 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.819
 2 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.739
 it's very cool very cool because 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.489
 it speeds up the game that is real if 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.900
 even count 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.609
 per minute you will get more 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.349
 gold is doing nothing in dessert yet 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.030
 more gold, respectively, the game will be 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.950
 go faster because I personally 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.650
 I played matches which will be 73 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.230
 minutes they are interesting but often 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.060
 already just bothers and more gold 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.380
 Respectively better artifacts faster 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.599
 there is a match everything is fine me everything 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.810
 arranges now but bonus gold 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.919
 blockage of the tower increased it increases 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.660
 the role of day and yes it enhances exactly what 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.609
 need you have a tower that's enough 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.380
 kleopa you I do not see any problems 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.510
 plus I also liked that with 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.489
 chicken now run faster of course 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.069
 the fact that it can not be upset to 3 minutes is 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.989
 a little controversial but she runs faster 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.660
 so basically, I think it will 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.329
 he will run and we will be in time and and 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.069
 intercept besides more quickly 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.569
 chicken and from our don't like murder 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.889
 hens for myself fundamentally so i 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.989
 I think this is a good moment 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.889
 but updating heroes is a question at all 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.690
 very controversial 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.819
 need to look in the game so therefore from 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.799
 noodle I will not speak with you but 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.789
 Overall, I think that everything will be fine and 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.870
 don't worry 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:13.610
 ok here's the answer to 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.140
