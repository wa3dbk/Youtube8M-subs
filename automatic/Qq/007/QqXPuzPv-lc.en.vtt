you<00:01:47.159> kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> pull<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.880> back<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you kind of have to pull the back and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
you kind of have to pull the back and
then<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.750> pull<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> see

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
then you can pull all it as you can see

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.460 
then you can pull all it as you can see
there<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.970> basically<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.350> know

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
there that's basically it so you know

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.990 
there that's basically it so you know
you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.590> take<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.890> pretender<00:01:53.340> she'll<00:01:53.579> put

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you can take this pretender she'll put

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.920 
you can take this pretender she'll put
it<00:01:54.119> back<00:01:54.299> there<00:01:55.939> keep<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.000> there<00:01:57.509> from<00:01:57.750> now

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it back there keep that there from now

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.899 
it back there keep that there from now
as<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.040> now<00:02:00.000> his<00:02:01.490> robot<00:02:02.490> mode<00:02:02.520> is

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
as you can see now his robot mode is

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.270 
as you can see now his robot mode is
very<00:02:03.659> simple<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.320> his<00:02:04.469> monster<00:02:04.890> motor<00:02:05.070> should

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
very simple or his monster motor should

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.359 
very simple or his monster motor should
say<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:05.909> kind<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.270> take<00:02:06.479> these<00:02:07.369> swing

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
say you just kind of take these swing

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.680 
say you just kind of take these swing
them<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:10.110> way

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
them this way

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.380 
them this way
take<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:16.430> again<00:02:17.430> he's<00:02:17.640> one<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> very

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
take this and again he's one of the very

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.180 
take this and again he's one of the very
few<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.170> or<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> should<00:02:19.680> say<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.950> only

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
few that is on or I should say the only

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.100 
few that is on or I should say the only
one<00:02:20.340> that's<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.610> his<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:21.000> quads<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.630> hold<00:02:21.870> for

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
one that's on his on quads on hold for

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.270 
one that's on his on quads on hold for
his<00:02:22.230> feet<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.250> there's<00:02:23.489> his<00:02:23.670> monster<00:02:24.270> for<00:02:24.750> I

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
his feet so there's his monster for I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.580 
his feet so there's his monster for I
don't<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.459> what<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.849> hell<00:02:27.030> he<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.319> I'm<00:02:28.319> Petty

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
don't know what the hell he is I'm Petty

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.009 
don't know what the hell he is I'm Petty
he<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:28.800> very<00:02:29.069> cool<00:02:29.370> some<00:02:30.180> real<00:02:30.420> looking<00:02:30.810> on

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
he is very cool some real looking on

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.199 
he is very cool some real looking on
monster<00:02:32.239> he<00:02:33.239> definitely<00:02:33.569> has<00:02:33.810> some<00:02:34.050> nice

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
monster he definitely has some nice

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.720 
monster he definitely has some nice
armored<00:02:36.209> armor<00:02:37.019> here<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> guess<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.370> he<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.610> go

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
armored armor here I guess so he can go

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.390 
armored armor here I guess so he can go
on<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.910> attack<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.360> whatever<00:02:39.540> or<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:40.400> but

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
on the attack in whatever or not but

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.979 
on the attack in whatever or not but
yeah<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.760> that's<00:02:41.940> basically<00:02:42.090> he<00:02:42.599> has<00:02:42.630> all<00:02:42.870> his

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
yeah so that's basically he has all his

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.759 
yeah so that's basically he has all his
stickers<00:02:43.380> which<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.830> great<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:45.180> he's<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.330> plus

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
stickers which is great so he's a plus

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.920 
stickers which is great so he's a plus
to<00:02:46.769> do<00:02:46.920> his<00:02:47.100> robot<00:02:47.459> mode<00:02:47.489> very<00:02:48.239> simplest<00:02:48.720> come

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
to do his robot mode very simplest come

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.350 
to do his robot mode very simplest come
over<00:02:49.140> here<00:02:49.380> flip<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.489> back<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.090> see

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
over here flip that back as you can see

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.259 
over here flip that back as you can see
there's<00:02:51.660> his<00:02:51.810> face<00:02:52.160> his<00:02:53.160> hands<00:02:53.730> are<00:02:53.880> pretty

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
there's his face his hands are pretty

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:04.330 
there's his face his hands are pretty
much<00:02:54.830> uh<00:02:55.830> how<00:02:56.610> was<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.120> almost<00:02:57.420> forgot<00:02:58.730> oh

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.339 

just<00:03:05.340> basically<00:03:05.760> yes<00:03:05.970> hands<00:03:06.299> are<00:03:06.480> ready<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.170> go

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
just basically yes hands are ready to go

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.789 
just basically yes hands are ready to go
just<00:03:08.340> take<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.730> do<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.200> can<00:03:10.380> take<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
just take this do that you can take the

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.350 
just take this do that you can take the
back<00:03:10.980> legs<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.640> guess<00:03:11.819> do<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.150> for

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
back legs and I guess do that for

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.509 
back legs and I guess do that for
stability<00:03:12.540> because<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> don't<00:03:13.709> you'll

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
stability because if you don't you'll

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.560 
stability because if you don't you'll
move<00:03:14.700> back<00:03:14.989> see<00:03:15.989> he'll<00:03:16.170> fall<00:03:17.269> because<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:18.450> he

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
move back see he'll fall because it's he

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.539 
move back see he'll fall because it's he
has<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> round<00:03:18.989> back<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.530> that's<00:03:19.980> stability

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
has a round back so that's stability

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.210 
has a round back so that's stability
there<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:21.959> go<00:03:22.140> probably<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:23.010> much

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
there so you can go probably that much

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.470 
there so you can go probably that much
maybe<00:03:24.410> maybe<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.560> little<00:03:25.709> bit<00:03:25.859> more<00:03:26.390> there<00:03:27.390> you

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
maybe maybe a little bit more there you

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.479 
maybe maybe a little bit more there you
go<00:03:27.600> he's<00:03:27.840> nice<00:03:27.989> too<00:03:28.140> straight<00:03:28.380> there<00:03:28.590> let's

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
go he's nice too straight there let's

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.460 
go he's nice too straight there let's
come<00:03:29.700> over<00:03:29.910> here<00:03:30.350> unfortunately<00:03:31.350> he<00:03:31.440> is

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
come over here unfortunately he is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.309 
come over here unfortunately he is
missing<00:03:31.829> Decepticon<00:03:32.430> symbol<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.170> one<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.200> the

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
missing Decepticon symbol so one of the

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.470 
missing Decepticon symbol so one of the
very<00:03:34.530> few<00:03:34.709> things<00:03:34.920> he's<00:03:35.069> missing<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.239> we

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
very few things he's missing but that we

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.990 
very few things he's missing but that we
boils<00:03:36.930> can<00:03:37.049> take<00:03:37.230> care<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.500> if<00:03:37.829> I<00:03:38.250> ever<00:03:38.549> order

boils can take care of if I ever order
another<00:03:39.180> set<00:03:39.569> think<00:03:40.019> I'm<00:03:40.109> out<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.260> stickers

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
another set think I'm out of stickers

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
I'm a little too close so this is

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.620

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
pretty cool and then to transform them

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.560 
pretty cool and then to transform them
bring<00:04:46.380> these<00:04:46.530> forward<00:04:47.070> or<00:04:47.910> actually<00:04:48.270> bring

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
bring these forward or actually bring

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.720

these<00:04:48.720> down<00:04:48.870> first<00:04:50.810> if<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:51.990> can<00:04:52.430> like<00:04:53.430> that

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
these down first if you can like that

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.240 
these down first if you can like that
you<00:04:54.630> can<00:04:54.810> go<00:04:54.990> all<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.350> way<00:04:55.380> down<00:04:55.470> like<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.010> if

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
you can go all the way down like this if

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.000 
you can go all the way down like this if
you<00:04:56.340> like<00:04:56.580> or<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:58.140> think<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.530> looks<00:04:58.560> better<00:04:58.740> if

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010

you go back like that I think that's

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.630 
you go back like that I think that's
exactly<00:05:00.690> how<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.200> instruction<00:05:02.190> manual<00:05:02.220> had

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640
