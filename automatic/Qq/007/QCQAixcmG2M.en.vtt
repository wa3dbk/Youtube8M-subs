00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello my dear friends and warmly 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.890
 Welcome to a new video today 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.340
 I'll show you two quests the many 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.900
 places cause big problems in the new 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.199
 test update the dax namely kill that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.750
 heart of cotta the hand of cotta and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.939
 the eyes of quote and I show you 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 Now in this video where you can find it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.000
 So you can find the heart of Trotha 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.270
 you in the area of ​​the first he of the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 Dreiecks that in the rocket year so im 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.340
 contrary to the principle and there must 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.780
 Just go there I have a way in 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.579
 remember video and then just the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.260
 killing enemies there and once the dead 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.430
 is there now that seems to be from cotta 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.969
 a witch and that concedes a lot 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 hurt if you shoot with it or 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.010
 solar damage depending on 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.289
 so grow or icebreaker or heat 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.090
 Revenge something like that makes a lot of mega 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.189
 damage 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.740
 I died because I'm here and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.200
 that's me i believe every opponent in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 this video 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.479
 It was not quite my day then next 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.009
 is the hand of co 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.430
 For that you have to be near the skyy vodka 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.770
 there where the first fury beetle verge 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:31.229
 then he bends in the dark room or 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.650
 All over you have the idea of the horde 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.770
 Sharjah shit where it is 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.259
 then you weigh right on the plan 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.140
 and there could be such a little servant 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.200
 the hand, therefore, the kneeling think 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.939
 about such a brick over it and if he 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.110
 the part of baumberger many opponents 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.649
 are synonymous in the video 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.270
 and they go away relatively easy you can 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.070
 also the whole time to 1 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.189
 götze state would like that is 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.020
 have enabled her to get worse 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.020
 So it's really worth it 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.840
 to drive the athletes again and again 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.040
 we can see here who at the end after 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.480
 I defeated the opponent is the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.099
 Foray has not been completed 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.790
 So if he goes there and the opponents 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.810
 defeated 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.970
 this is of course advantageous is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.970
 exciting as many opponents at once to 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.560
 yes, that's not that hard 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.930
 I think I am even twice 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.329
 died because yes ok and then we have 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.819
 the third that is when you at the 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.950
 skywalk so at the first blood money 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.510
 can you continue the right building 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.060
 Of course you also see in the video 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.220
 and there if you kill that opponent 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.829
 Of course you can open this treasure 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:01.959
 and there comes a ship and in the back left 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:03.310
 are two polyps or acute and afford 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.109
 you can do that relatively quickly there 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.910
 shoot and then he clarified it too 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.220
 what brings you all this when he does 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.959
 of course you have completed that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.160
 it once 50 euros from 975 court per 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:21.790
 completed mission you get thus 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.970
 for which he is possibly not 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.389
 finished with my case 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.760
 and then you can finally get a new one 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.459
 So strike on earth unlock 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.959
 Thus, it is then a strike in 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.519
 the dlc then also two strikes on 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.799
 the earth is I have not yet 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.769
 but will be tried tomorrow in a video 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:49.769
 appears the triangle and I will 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.769
 try before the strike 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.989
 Twilight strike the mark slettvoll 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.190
 strike in a video too 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.280
 with the best possible guide so that you a 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.739
 I can sit solo and sit down there 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:11.440
 off then tomorrow or the day will 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:14.280
 you see that with the switch you then 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.650
 hold also the envious and the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:24.070
 weekly no-strike weekly 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:28.290
 strike starts this time 24 indicates 26 and 28 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:33.300
 I know maybe 30 and there 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:38.729
 Thirties of the twilight strike is 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:42.520
 unfortunately with batteries damage so you will 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.530
 Do pretty little harm if you do 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.600
 I have no destinies 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.419
 I would still recommend taking the 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:54.130
 pvp snapper i believe you are destiny 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.780
 and time or cells fate as on 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.460
 every case a snack bar with battery 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.590
 harm or a merger guarantees that 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.560
 Here also gets from this lady here 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.800
 that means mumbling or collecting means 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.720
 winner there you can between solar 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.340
 damage and battery damage change so 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:15.160
 is mega this weapon and as heavier 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.919
 for that too an exotic not one 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.750
 critical a legendary rocket for it 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.760
 with battery damage or one 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.450
 machine gun 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.729
 so you would be relatively relaxed 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.450
 I say so 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:35.950
 and now you know where and how you like that 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.310
 Hand the heart and eyes of the rotor 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.380
 can defeat 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.830
 and if it brings anything to us 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.270
 We then see in the raid I see 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.760
 I would be pleased about a rating 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.330
 and otherwise until next time 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.330
 14
