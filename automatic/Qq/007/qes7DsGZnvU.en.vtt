00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.950
 This time I would like to talk about self-tanning. If you read my blog, you know I absolutely love XEN-TAN 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.839
 so I'm gonna talk about her today 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.130
 I'm going out tonight and the reason I used this tanning agent is that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.149
 I can wash it after 3 hours after its application 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:27.169
 which simply means that the tanning ingredients act quickly 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.880
 it contains an instant color (bronzer) but not the type that is washed away when it rains outside 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.060
 so at this point you see the color right after applying the product - it is very dark 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.450
 the color will no longer be darker 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.670
 but for video purposes, I wanted to show you how dark it can be 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.440
 tan lasts a long time and it is 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.170
 dark version 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.710
 and it has a great pump, so it dosed well 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.730
 chocolate 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.010
 I will show it to you 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.600
 it just looks like chocolate, so if you like chocolate, you'll be satisfied 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.370
 and like chocolate smells 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.840
 It is very moisturizing. When you apply it, you feel like you are applying a moisturizer. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800
 So you know that you apply something to your body 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.560
 what will benefit him 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.990
 color is brown 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 definitely not orange, but brown, as if I just got back from vacation 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.870
 I think the reason I'm so brown is the one 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.830
 that reacts well with melanin in my skin 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 What I like about these products is that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.190
 You have an instant color that is brown, so you see the result right away 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.780
 don't worry about being too brown 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:42.830
 when you take a shower 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.220
 The instant color (bronzer) is flushed and you will remain amazing 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.160
 natural tan with olive undertone 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.810
 My golden rule the day before self-tanning is 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.390
 shave the day ahead 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.560
 otherwise, the color can be seen in the pores 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.290
 Do the peeling the day before, too 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.890
 Especially here in these places, which are always drier 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.879
 and other drier parts of the body like 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.110
 elbows 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.339
 and knees 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.739
 and make sure your face is clean before applying a self-tan 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.829
 I wouldn't use it on my face if you have acne 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.509
 because it usually gets a little worse 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.800
 in addition to XEN-TAN spray self-tanning 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.659
 who has improved my acne 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.249
 After you walk out of the shower where you shaved and made a scrub, apply moisturizing milk. 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.709
 then wait a day or several hours before applying the tanning agent 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.849
 I recommend to paint the next day 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.849
 otherwise the self-tanning agent gets into the pores 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.779
 Many people do not know what to do after applying a self-tanning agent 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.299
 something I do for years and when people ask me, I say it's a golden rule 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.299
 is: moisturize your skin every day 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.449
 So since I showered for the first time after the self-tanning, I hydrate - the same day, then after 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.539
 and so on 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.289
 as long as you want your tan to last 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.469
 and I'm just thrilled right now because I use this: 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.080
 it's XEN-TAN with 24 carat gold 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.779
 colored moisturizing milk 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:43.319
 colored moisturizers are much better than normal creams 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.469
 and I would recommend it to everyone 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:50.389
 because it extends the tan beautifully, enhances the skin color 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.739
 instead of fading 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.180
 I personally use this colored moisturizer 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.180
 it also contains delicate golden glitter 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.180
 and your tan will last for up to two weeks 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.629
 Thanks for looking at my first youtube video
