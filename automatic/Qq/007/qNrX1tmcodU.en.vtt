 ingredients 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.809
 both father 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:48.520
 Bitter cocoa and sugar market 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.520
 lack of sugar 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.629
 part 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.850
 and for a very delicious variety very 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 tasty 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.920
 they will have seen that the Chileans are 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.100
 are smaller in bold in rough the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 shell 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.649
 others that are green but anna stands 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.190
 as it is a way of having 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.120
 eggplant let's say 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:24.320
 and that we do not say and they are in Madrid 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:28.540
 canarias opens nobody and I do not appear 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.540
 you are actually appearing 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:44.720
 well do not need to place it 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.400
 place it 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.030
 miley for me wait 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.220
 very well 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.020
 meanwhile remember the palm is 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.340
 an excellent source of vitamin e 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.850
 antioxidant free radicals are 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.369
 those that cause a state of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.450
 explicit disorders of the body and 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.489
 anti sides hence antioxidants 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.600
 they make us less radical 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.970
 free 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.520
 In addition, vitamin E is excellent as 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.760
 heal the help of the process 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.760
 cicatrization 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.670
 and apart also intervenes from the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.390
 metabolism of organisms that are 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.390
 explained 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.720
 expertise in the city anxiety 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.030
 irritability in 22 states the vitamin 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.240
 It is essential that it be in our 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.700
 diets this cocoa by hand was mixed in 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.000
 this blender with mascabado sugar or 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.430
 is that everything is already mixed and toshiba 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.430
 I would put bitter caracas and sugar 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.590
 are asking what proportions 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.910
 what proportions 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.709
 development in your own criteria or 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.709
 it's the creativity itself 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.110
 and I give them their relatives 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.940
 actively in three years 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.370
 now we are putting two tablespoons of 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.080
 cocoa 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.080
 mixed with sugar 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.650
 well eivissa 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.239
 in front of natural vanilla 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.660
 artificial as I always tell them by 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.660
 favor 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.010
 ah 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.590
 how 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.129
 my door 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.950
 so I have all three ingredients 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:52.690
 basics that are aldamas cabos cacao 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.160
 bitter already with that enough aggregates 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.390
 the first the first added that 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:02.790
 we could think is vanilla but today 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.790
 I propose something that is very rich 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.050
 Orange peel 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.070
 about two teaspoons of tea 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.070
 medically 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.379
 Y 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:33.020
 but that this is a lot we are going to start 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.020
 with a spoonful 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.100
 rich 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.139
 Jesus is rich in this case are I have 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.470
 ground for these cases so there is no 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:49.870
 sticks and cooked 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.870
 it's not enough and thanks 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:56.190
 the combination is spectacular 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.920
 chocolate peperina and orange 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.540
 i 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.540
 and ice cubes 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.950
 we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 cubes 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:21.400
 and now he squeezed it to size him 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.949
 Add a lot more cocoa and everything 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.220
 the peperina pulling a tablespoon 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:30.650
 well it will be 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.650
 bayly for us 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.010
 let's decorate with some almonds 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.860
 in the river good 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.860
 with my other 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.740
 good 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.449
 and we are going to look for a spoon that 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.960
 here was with the blender 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.940
 and let's taste 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.940
 to see if you see well go down 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.879
 it is properly captured 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.210
 and 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.380
 to me 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.400
 your cousin 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:29.639
 do not 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:34.200
 this we take from snacks all 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:37.320
 days but sometimes enough if we have 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.120
 how we keep good antioxidants with the 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.510
 good antioxidant wall with corn 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.030
 the one that ended up bitter 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.050
 with vitamin C from big dandruff 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.229
 want 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.850
 leave it to me nothing more and many 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:53.850
 minerals with more sugar out 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.879
 good fatty acids with lack 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.909
 dessert snack intake we know healthy and 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.909
 delicious 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.470
 it squeezed it more 

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:15.769

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.350
 that they do so in these cases promptly 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:36.300
 and that they are made in their day very many 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.840
