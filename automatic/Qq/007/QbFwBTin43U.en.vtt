00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.210
 this project actually comes from the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.809
 concomitance of various meetings 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.240
 first meeting that had come between Marco 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.650
 800 what actually leads 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.080
 forward the whole project is worth moore 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.240
 emanuele malacarne that ours is the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.100
 head of our product is another 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.230
 almost contextual that I had with 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.160
 an old friend who fulvio nu 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.500
 the air the goal was to create 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.369
 a job actually for kids 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.309
 down 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.520
 I explained to them that in my opinion 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.309
 have a potential kids from 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.070
 incredible on what textile is 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.020
 this their spontaneity 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.469
 simplicity this their play with 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.699
 color makes fun and it's not who it is 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.280
 because he knows what a beautiful point and that's it 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.469
 the project is worth joining just already 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.170
 from the name vale moore is the union between vale 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.210
 and glamor means value to us 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 of people the things of projects is the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.320
 womb in the glittering world of fashion 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.080
 to unite our initiatives with which to 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 geox give body to this dream 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.520
 we take care of projects of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.020
 life of our kids and we help them 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.960
 in the school world with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.680
 consultancy from 14 years onwards we work 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.780
 on autonomy 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.509
 we study their business territory 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.320
 we produce in our cooperative 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.080
 let's prepare boy so let's do 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.200
 training and when they are ready with 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.479
 our educators and we follow boy in 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.159
 company I am the educator who works with 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.240
 the boys in close contact with i 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.549
 boys 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.799
 so I take care of teaching kids 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.049
 for example the working prerequisites 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.030
 rather than job requirements but 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.369
 the walls is a place of work where i 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.930
 boys are productive boys 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.540
 they come here 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.950
 in some moments there are formatives 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.110
 the chosen candidate will then come 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.490
 entered in workplaces to arrive 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.150
 autonomy means going to live by 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.860
 just 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.270
 it means living truly in society 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.580
 therefore it means being able to pay a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.870
 rent to buy to eat to take 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.850
 a public transport and then 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.039
 indispensable work of the seven boys 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.560
 they finished June let's say almost 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.270
 all will be placed at work I know 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.940
 that they can be inserted into 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.070
 work world and know that through 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.500
 Wall worth we can make contact with 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.720
 so we can make companies real 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.170
 this thing then insert guys for 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.950
 me is really fundamental 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.900
 make kids self-employed be 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.080
 really really working adults 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.820
 not being able to paint fabrics on Verona 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.550
 for 15 thousand pairs of shoes and 5 thousand bags 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.590
 at 5,000 scarves we spoke with 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.580
 national coordination and eight 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.260
 member associations 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.870
 national coordination of people 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.720
 with down syndrome they joined 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.630
 joined palermo taranto cosenza padua 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.660
 cuneo torino and another association of 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.660
 from the works we pass them all 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:11.680
 we put ourselves some tables with colors 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.700
 that we hate we started with 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.700
 the help of my girls to set 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.250
 how could you intervene with the color is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.790
 been a little piloted but leaving 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.040
 they too are free to put us 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:37.150
 gold I like this job 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:42.129
 because it gives me charge and gives me some 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.069
 money for videocom for a good quarry for 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.959
 the one on a clear I think it's beautiful 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.650
 the fact that they do things 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.169
 that final result becomes 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.739
 rewarding for the consumer's garden 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.840
 the final 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:02.079
 I'm happy I 'm here I want to live with 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.930
 the friend an anonymous family and surroundings 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.519
 but with the fia because russia is mine 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.310
 girl 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.940
 the boys who use rule than the brushes 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.430
 and print the fabric and compared to a 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.519
 fabric dyed with solidity 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.800
 to wear the temperature to light 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.199
 top of any dyed fabric 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.139
 We are immersed in this project 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.569
 managed to give an artisan mark 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.550
 then a 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.240
 got one piece because i 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.770
 boys painting these sheets paint 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.599
 in autonomy and in creativity 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.179
 therefore the shoes are all different 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.999
 one from the other so that so the bags 

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:50.819
 so the scarves for which it is beautiful 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:53.129
 will be able to go to the shops with gods 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:57.889
 products that in any case are unique pieces 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:05:01.800
 they have a very large human content e 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:04.199
 they are geox so many times they ask me if 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.930
 a company must be ethical 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.550
 I don't even think we should ask 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.680
 the problem 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.869
 the company must be as ethical as one 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.360
 ethical person but it is the normality that yes 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:18.689
 ethics for which it is normal for a company 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.990
 how geox shares these values ​​I the 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.180
 I consider it normal to include these 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.949
 people in society or a day 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.709
 beautiful for us because we have a 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.119
 product that is objectively beautiful is a 

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:32.849
 product that we don't really think is 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:35.009
 strong and characterizing and has been done 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.110
 making the retribution work for 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.819
 down guys who did it together 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.939
 with us along with all the kids 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.849
 by fulvio the boys of boys of marco 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.139
 geox has invested in moore applies in 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.659
 sense that made our work 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.639
 guys gave the chance to 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:52.319
 to become a worker and to the 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.129
 possibility to develop some skills 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:58.110
 and gave the chance to try what 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.759
 it means having colleagues what 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.039
 means to agree what 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.229
 means to respect the times of 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.959
 production gave a job on which 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.980
 working for us is fundamental work 

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:11.830
 which they will then see 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.080
 go out when they go to a store 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.730
 geox you will see the shoe and say 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.120
 this is actually the shoe that we 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.120
 we have done
