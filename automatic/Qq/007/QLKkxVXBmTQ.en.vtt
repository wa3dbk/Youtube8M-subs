mark 3 and what's cool and what I find

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.620 
mark 3 and what's cool and what I find
pretty<00:02:35.010> much<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.370> most<00:02:35.490> interesting<00:02:36.300> out<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
pretty much the most interesting out of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.510 
pretty much the most interesting out of
the<00:02:36.720> list<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.560> fact<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:37.980> from<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the list is the fact that from the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.820 
the list is the fact that from the
gunsmith<00:02:39.120> when<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.480> create<00:02:39.840> custom<00:02:40.410> camos

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
gunsmith when you create custom camos

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.950 
gunsmith when you create custom camos
you<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.550> move<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.030> zombies<00:02:42.390> multiplayer

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
you can move that to zombies multiplayer

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.720 
you can move that to zombies multiplayer
which<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.230> kind<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.470> interesting<00:02:43.710> not<00:02:44.550> sure

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
which is kind of interesting not sure

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.950 
which is kind of interesting not sure
why<00:02:44.880> they're<00:02:45.060> doing<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.300> but<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.600> suppose

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
why they're doing that but I suppose

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.510 
why they're doing that but I suppose
you'll<00:02:46.170> make<00:02:46.350> your<00:02:46.470> guns<00:02:46.710> look<00:02:46.890> wacky<00:02:47.250> and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
you'll make your guns look wacky and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.010 
you'll make your guns look wacky and
whatnot<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.180> next<00:02:48.420> thing<00:02:48.540> which<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.720> also

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
whatnot the next thing which is also

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.300 
whatnot the next thing which is also
interesting<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:49.800> they're<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> be

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
interesting is that they're going to be

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.700 
interesting is that they're going to be
adding<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.700> brand<00:02:51.090> new<00:02:51.300> XP<00:02:51.870> progression<00:02:52.530> system

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
adding a brand new XP progression system

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.200 
adding a brand new XP progression system
which<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.430> going<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.610> look<00:02:53.790> somewhat

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
which is going to look somewhat

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.480 
which is going to look somewhat
interesting<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.200> maps<00:02:55.470> will<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.130> roll

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
interesting and the maps will have roll

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.910 
interesting and the maps will have roll
/<00:02:56.820> missions<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:58.410> need<00:02:58.770> an

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
/ missions that you actually need an

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.460

order<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.820> complete<00:03:00.300> in<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.810> game<00:03:01.020> or<00:03:01.260> you'll

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
order to complete in the game or you'll

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.050 
order to complete in the game or you'll
get<00:03:01.620> penalized<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:02.430> something<00:03:02.760> along<00:03:02.820> those

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
get penalized or something along those

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.820 
get penalized or something along those
lines<00:03:03.210> so<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> bit<00:03:03.960> interesting<00:03:04.380> once<00:03:04.530> again

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
lines so a bit interesting once again

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.280 
lines so a bit interesting once again
and<00:03:05.040> three<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.940> four<00:03:06.090> maps<00:03:06.300> will<00:03:06.540> be<00:03:06.660> released

all these missions and stuff you've got
to<00:05:07.590> do<00:05:07.680> personally<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.310> would<00:05:08.669> like<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.940> see<00:05:09.090> it

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
to do personally I would like to see it

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.900 
to do personally I would like to see it
go<00:05:09.360> back<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:10.020> vanilla<00:05:10.500> what<00:05:11.130> at<00:05:11.310> war<00:05:11.580> our

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
go back to the vanilla what at war our

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.730 
go back to the vanilla what at war our
black<00:05:12.300> ops<00:05:12.540> zombies<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.200> suppose<00:05:13.560> they<00:05:13.710> are

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
black ops zombies and I suppose they are

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.710 
black ops zombies and I suppose they are
doing<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.550> as<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:14.880> can<00:05:15.030> see<00:05:15.060> the

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
doing that and as you can see the

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.740 
doing that and as you can see the
storyline<00:05:16.260> basically<00:05:16.950> behind<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:18.510> head

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
storyline basically behind the head

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.750 
storyline basically behind the head
black<00:05:19.020> ops<00:05:19.260> 3<00:05:19.440> zombies<00:05:19.470> its<00:05:19.980> element<00:05:20.370> 115

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
black ops 3 zombies its element 115

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.360 
black ops 3 zombies its element 115
going<00:05:21.540> to<00:05:21.750> be<00:05:21.930> from<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.770> different<00:05:23.010> company

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
going to be from a different company

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.010 
going to be from a different company
that<00:05:23.700> obviously<00:05:24.060> wants<00:05:24.390> people<00:05:24.720> back<00:05:24.990> from

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
that obviously wants people back from

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.380 
that obviously wants people back from
the<00:05:25.320> dead<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.770> eternal<00:05:26.310> life<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:27.000> suppose

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
the dead to eternal life and I suppose

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.060 
the dead to eternal life and I suppose
that<00:05:27.600> did<00:05:27.810> create<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.230> zombies<00:05:28.590> who<00:05:28.770> knows
