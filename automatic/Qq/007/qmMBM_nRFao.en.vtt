00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
revisit both of these tests but first we

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.220 
revisit both of these tests but first we
are<00:00:23.609> going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.000> discuss<00:00:24.390> two<00:00:24.630> big<00:00:24.810> changes

made to Enderman in 1.8 the ender might
will<00:00:29.099> no<00:00:29.250> longer<00:00:29.460> spawn<00:00:29.820> when<00:00:30.119> an<00:00:30.300> Enderman

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
will no longer spawn when an Enderman

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.470 

well<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.099> was<00:02:51.310> exactly<00:02:51.760> what<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.209> predicted

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
well that was exactly what I predicted

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.780 
well that was exactly what I predicted
however<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:53.470> always<00:02:53.650> good<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.129> do<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.310> test<00:02:54.670> to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
however it's always good to do a test to

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.910 
however it's always good to do a test to
be<00:02:54.910> sure<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.629> them<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.110> have<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.440> whitelist

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
be sure and them and have a whitelist

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.559 
be sure and them and have a whitelist
for<00:02:57.129> blocks<00:02:57.340> they<00:02:57.550> can<00:02:57.700> pick<00:02:57.879> up<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.269> means

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
for blocks they can pick up this means

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.270 
for blocks they can pick up this means
if<00:02:58.810> something<00:02:59.230> new<00:02:59.410> was<00:02:59.590> added<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.099> game

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
if something new was added to the game

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.009 
if something new was added to the game
they<00:03:00.790> wouldn't<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.150> able<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.510> pick<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.690> up<00:03:01.840> by

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
they wouldn't be able to pick it up by

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.960 
they wouldn't be able to pick it up by
default<00:03:02.200> unless<00:03:02.590> specifically<00:03:03.310> altered<00:03:03.790> to

default unless specifically altered to
do<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:05.019> means<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.440> only<00:03:05.500> new<00:03:05.890> block<00:03:06.129> for

do so this means the only new block for

do so this means the only new block for

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.990 
Enderman can pick up was coolster
because<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.920> same<00:03:09.130> block<00:03:09.400> as<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.790> it

because it's the same block as that it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.940 
because it's the same block as that it
just<00:03:10.300> has<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.599> different<00:03:10.630> damage<00:03:11.200> value<00:03:11.530> which

they don't teleport to the blocks then

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.729 
they don't teleport to the blocks then
we<00:03:34.269> notice<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.900> block<00:03:35.079> type<00:03:35.319> they<00:03:35.500> can't

we notice a block type they can't
teleport<00:03:36.069> -<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:37.030> been<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.299> long<00:03:37.540> time<00:03:37.810> since

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
we were last here in the episode we

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.370 
we were last here in the episode we
establish<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.239> Enderman<00:03:40.599> could<00:03:40.780> teleport<00:03:41.049> no

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
establish the Enderman could teleport no

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.620 
establish the Enderman could teleport no
further<00:03:41.590> than<00:03:41.799> 32<00:03:42.340> blocks<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.360> water

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
further than 32 blocks and that water

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.600 
further than 32 blocks and that water
would<00:03:43.900> not<00:03:44.110> affect<00:03:44.440> teleporting<00:03:45.130> if<00:03:45.280> between

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
would not affect teleporting if between

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.030 
would not affect teleporting if between
the<00:03:45.730> Enderman<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.269> its<00:03:46.750> destination<00:03:47.500> there

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
the Enderman and its destination there

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.559 
the Enderman and its destination there
have<00:03:48.130> also<00:03:48.250> been<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.610> lot<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.849> blocks<00:03:49.120> added<00:03:49.480> to

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
have also been a lot of blocks added to

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.330 
have also been a lot of blocks added to
the<00:03:49.660> game<00:03:49.780> since<00:03:50.140> then<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:50.829> as<00:03:50.950> well<00:03:51.099> as<00:03:51.130> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
the game since then so as well as the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.250 
the game since then so as well as the
new<00:03:51.459> blocks<00:03:51.700> in<00:03:51.910> 1.8<00:03:52.360> we<00:03:52.630> are<00:03:52.720> also<00:03:52.870> going<00:03:53.140> to

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
new blocks in 1.8 we are also going to

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.720 
new blocks in 1.8 we are also going to
test<00:03:53.440> some<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.799> more<00:03:53.950> interesting<00:03:54.190> blocks

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
test some of the more interesting blocks

00:03:54.730 --> 00:05:14.490 
test some of the more interesting blocks
from<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.389> previous<00:03:55.720> updates

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.770 

there<00:05:15.130> we<00:05:15.280> go<00:05:15.430> not<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.820> most<00:05:16.000> interesting<00:05:16.660> of

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
there we go not the most interesting of

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.600 
there we go not the most interesting of
results<00:05:17.260> however<00:05:17.590> it's<00:05:17.800> good<00:05:17.950> to<00:05:18.160> know<00:05:18.280> it

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
results however it's good to know it

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.070 
results however it's good to know it
would<00:05:18.820> seem<00:05:19.120> that<00:05:19.150> Enderman<00:05:19.660> can<00:05:19.810> still

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
would seem that Enderman can still

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.930 
would seem that Enderman can still
teleport<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.650> open<00:05:21.010> fence<00:05:21.250> gates<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.850> the

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
teleport to open fence gates and the

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.400 
teleport to open fence gates and the
last<00:05:22.180> test<00:05:22.450> you<00:05:22.630> saw<00:05:22.810> there<00:05:23.050> were<00:05:23.200> some

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
last test you saw there were some

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.440 
last test you saw there were some
floating<00:05:23.680> banners<00:05:24.190> so<00:05:24.670> they<00:05:24.790> can<00:05:24.970> target<00:05:25.180> the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
floating banners so they can target the

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.090 
floating banners so they can target the
banner<00:05:25.630> block<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.140> teleport<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.770> a

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
banner block and teleport to that a

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.950 
banner block and teleport to that a
slide<00:05:27.580> from<00:05:27.730> that<00:05:27.940> they<00:05:28.090> seem<00:05:28.300> reluctant<00:05:28.570> to

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
slide from that they seem reluctant to

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.780 
slide from that they seem reluctant to
teleport<00:05:29.350> to<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.560> fence<00:05:29.830> post<00:05:30.160> but<00:05:30.670> they

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
teleport to the fence post but they

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.030 
teleport to the fence post but they
would<00:05:30.970> do<00:05:31.150> it<00:05:31.270> on<00:05:31.420> occasion<00:05:32.050> and<00:05:32.200> I<00:05:32.620> did<00:05:32.830> test

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
would do it on occasion and I did test

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.500 
would do it on occasion and I did test
all<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.430> variants<00:05:33.790> for<00:05:33.970> sandstone

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
all of the variants for sandstone
