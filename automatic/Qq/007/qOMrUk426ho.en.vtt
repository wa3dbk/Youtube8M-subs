muscle and the more you work that muscle

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.469 
muscle and the more you work that muscle
the<00:01:51.500> thicker<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.009> gets<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:52.939> if<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.180> work<00:01:53.360> your

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the thicker it gets so if you work your

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.240 
the thicker it gets so if you work your
abs<00:01:53.659> really<00:01:53.869> hard<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.229> get<00:01:54.380> thick<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.740> know<00:01:54.799> mine

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
abs really hard to get thick I know mine

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.039 
abs really hard to get thick I know mine
for<00:01:55.520> example<00:01:56.000> if<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.150> do<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.420> hang<00:01:56.570> leg<00:01:56.810> raises

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
for example if I do the hang leg raises

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.230 
for example if I do the hang leg raises
which<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.710> really<00:01:57.950> heavy<00:01:58.159> resistance<00:01:58.369> my<00:01:59.090> abs

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
which is really heavy resistance my abs

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.730 
which is really heavy resistance my abs
get<00:01:59.390> fixed<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.750> get<00:01:59.930> big<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.229> there<00:02:00.320> protrude

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
get fixed I get big and there protrude

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.710 
get fixed I get big and there protrude
and<00:02:00.979> someone<00:02:01.549> says<00:02:01.640> gee<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:01.880> look<00:02:01.909> fat<00:02:02.240> not

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
and someone says gee you look fat not

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.560 
and someone says gee you look fat not
fat<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:03.140> just<00:02:03.350> have<00:02:03.439> big<00:02:03.619> abs<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:04.759> I<00:02:04.790> had<00:02:05.450> to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
fat I just have big abs and so I had to

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.749 
fat I just have big abs and so I had to
quit<00:02:05.810> really<00:02:06.049> working<00:02:06.439> him<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:06.710> hard<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.579> they

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
quit really working him so hard so they

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.810 
quit really working him so hard so they
would<00:02:07.909> come<00:02:08.060> down<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:09.049> I<00:02:09.380> think<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:10.220> when<00:02:10.700> you

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
would come down so I think that when you

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.430 
would come down so I think that when you
say<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.090> want<00:02:11.299> to<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:11.630> abs<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.200> someone

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
say I want to get abs and if someone

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.740 
say I want to get abs and if someone
says<00:02:12.560> I'm<00:02:12.709> gonna<00:02:12.799> go<00:02:12.980> do<00:02:13.100> 300<00:02:13.579> 300<00:02:14.329> reps<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.570> abs

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
says I'm gonna go do 300 300 reps of abs

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.449 
says I'm gonna go do 300 300 reps of abs
get<00:02:14.870> my<00:02:14.989> waist<00:02:15.230> down<00:02:15.320> it's<00:02:15.920> not<00:02:16.130> going<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.370> go

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
get my waist down it's not going to go

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.849 
get my waist down it's not going to go
down<00:02:16.639> it's<00:02:16.880> only<00:02:16.970> going<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.269> get<00:02:17.329> bigger<00:02:17.600> and

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
down it's only going to get bigger and

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.910 
down it's only going to get bigger and
you<00:02:18.859> can<00:02:18.980> argue<00:02:19.100> at<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.519> point

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920

abs bigger and they almost stayed that

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.550 
abs bigger and they almost stayed that
way<00:04:29.310> for<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.550> long<00:04:29.789> period<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.240> time<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:31.200> for<00:04:31.409> me

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
way for a long period of time so for me

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.290 
way for a long period of time so for me
sit-ups<00:04:31.950> no<00:04:32.130> waste<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.729> time

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
sit-ups no waste of time

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.939 
sit-ups no waste of time
the<00:04:33.449> leg<00:04:33.599> races<00:04:33.930> work<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.199> lower<00:04:34.349> abs<00:04:34.440> more

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.070 
the leg races work the lower abs more
and<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.370> think<00:04:35.430> they're<00:04:35.729> better<00:04:35.910> for<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.419> side

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
many people like I said doing those with

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.370 
many people like I said doing those with
heavy<00:04:41.400> dumbbells<00:04:41.940> with<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.660> cable<00:04:42.990> machines

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
heavy dumbbells with the cable machines

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.409

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
waste of time all it's going to do is

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.150 
waste of time all it's going to do is
make<00:04:45.569> your<00:04:45.660> waist<00:04:45.870> thick<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.590> idea<00:04:46.949> is<00:04:47.039> to

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
make your waist thick the idea is to

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.469 
make your waist thick the idea is to
have<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.310> smaller<00:04:47.669> waist<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:48.180> course<00:04:48.360> the

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
have a smaller waist of course the

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.270 
have a smaller waist of course the
smaller<00:04:48.750> your<00:04:48.930> waist<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.860> bigger<00:04:50.069> your

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
smaller your waist the bigger your

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.100 
smaller your waist the bigger your
shoulders<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:50.699> your<00:04:50.819> chest<00:04:51.000> look<00:04:51.180> so<00:04:51.449> it's<00:04:51.780> an

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
shoulders in your chest look so it's an

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.050

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
illusion but it's it's what happens

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.450 
illusion but it's it's what happens
alright<00:04:54.930> that's<00:04:55.199> my<00:04:55.289> piece<00:04:55.650> for<00:04:55.680> today<00:04:56.099> think

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
alright that's my piece for today think

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.740 
alright that's my piece for today think
about<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.789> old-time<00:04:57.090> bodybuilders<00:04:57.630> like

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
about the old-time bodybuilders like

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.210 
about the old-time bodybuilders like
Steve<00:04:57.960> Reeves<00:04:58.199> that<00:04:58.380> tiny<00:04:58.650> waist<00:04:58.889> and<00:04:59.009> broad

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
Steve Reeves that tiny waist and broad

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.939 
Steve Reeves that tiny waist and broad
shoulders<00:05:00.199> didn't<00:05:01.199> have<00:05:01.349> real<00:05:01.500> thick<00:05:01.710> waist

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.800 
shoulders didn't have real thick waist

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
that's why it's so big today's

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.020 
that's why it's so big today's
bodybuilders<00:05:04.440> are<00:05:04.560> all<00:05:04.650> bloated<00:05:04.949> up<00:05:05.220> because

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
bodybuilders are all bloated up because

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.850 
bodybuilders are all bloated up because
they<00:05:06.210> work<00:05:06.419> through<00:05:06.569> absum<00:05:07.139> that's<00:05:07.620> not<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
they work through absum that's not the

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.379 
they work through absum that's not the
only<00:05:08.009> reason<00:05:08.130> but<00:05:08.460> they<00:05:08.909> gain<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> lot<00:05:09.360> of

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
only reason but they gain a lot of

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.879 
only reason but they gain a lot of
weight<00:05:09.509> they<00:05:09.810> gain<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:09.990> lot<00:05:10.199> of<00:05:10.289> size<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.740> lot

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
weight they gain a lot of size and a lot

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.740 
weight they gain a lot of size and a lot
of<00:05:10.919> muscle<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.360> way<00:05:12.479> it's<00:05:12.569> going<00:05:12.690> to

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
of muscle so is the way it's going to

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.330 
of muscle so is the way it's going to
stay<00:05:12.900> small<00:05:13.169> no<00:05:13.500> it's<00:05:13.860> going<00:05:13.949> to<00:05:14.009> go<00:05:14.130> right

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340
