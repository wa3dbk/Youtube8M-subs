problem with a low carb diet is your

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.560 
problem with a low carb diet is your
body<00:06:23.010> is<00:06:23.190> creating<00:06:23.610> enough<00:06:23.850> energy<00:06:24.150> to

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
body is creating enough energy to

body is creating enough energy to
maintain<00:06:25.140> its<00:06:25.770> processes<00:06:26.640> but<00:06:27.390> it's<00:06:27.600> not

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
maintain its processes but it's not

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.720 
maintain its processes but it's not
creating<00:06:28.290> an<00:06:28.410> abundance<00:06:28.890> of<00:06:29.010> energy<00:06:29.160> and<00:06:29.580> it's

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
creating an abundance of energy and it's

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.270 
creating an abundance of energy and it's
not<00:06:29.880> doing<00:06:30.180> quickly<00:06:30.870> so<00:06:31.680> if<00:06:31.860> you're<00:06:32.039> doing

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
not doing quickly so if you're doing

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.370 
not doing quickly so if you're doing
things<00:06:32.460> like<00:06:32.669> physical<00:06:33.120> activity<00:06:33.690> exerting

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
things like physical activity exerting

things like physical activity exerting
yourself<00:06:34.770> working<00:06:35.220> out

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000

on<00:06:36.060> a<00:06:36.930> low-carb<00:06:37.200> diet<00:06:37.500> it's<00:06:37.920> going<00:06:38.070> to<00:06:38.130> be<00:06:38.250> hard

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
on a low-carb diet it's going to be hard

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.580 
on a low-carb diet it's going to be hard
to<00:06:38.670> really<00:06:38.970> bring<00:06:39.570> the<00:06:39.600> same<00:06:39.870> intensity<00:06:40.380> to

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
to really bring the same intensity to

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.640 
to really bring the same intensity to
the<00:06:40.710> gym<00:06:40.950> so<00:06:42.140> that's<00:06:43.140> something<00:06:43.350> to<00:06:43.470> be<00:06:43.620> aware

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650
