00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
corner and that's what i thought was

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.869 
corner and that's what i thought was
being<00:00:36.450> played<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.860> end<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.370> turns<00:00:38.640> out

keep your eye on the prize i believe
that<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.440> both<00:01:02.070> sides<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.940> was<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.830> little

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that on both sides there was a little

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.260 
that on both sides there was a little
bit<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> idea<00:01:05.519> well<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.060> kill

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
bit of the idea well just kill

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810 
bit of the idea well just kill
everything<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:08.040> manage<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
everything and if i manage to do that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.539 
everything and if i manage to do that
then<00:01:09.390> i'll<00:01:09.630> end<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:09.930> coming<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.530> top<00:01:10.560> but

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
then i'll end up coming out on top but

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
then i'll end up coming out on top but
as<00:01:11.670> you'll<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:15.000> really<00:01:15.540> better<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
as you'll see it's really better to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.499 
as you'll see it's really better to
position<00:01:16.590> your<00:01:16.740> guys<00:01:17.030> start<00:01:18.030> thinking<00:01:18.420> about

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
position your guys start thinking about

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
position your guys start thinking about
it<00:01:18.720> long<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.140> turn<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.740> where<00:01:20.280> they're

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it long that turn for where they're

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.850 
it long that turn for where they're
going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> end<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> end<00:01:21.590> because<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
going to end up at the end because that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
going to end up at the end because that
really<00:01:23.070> could<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.460> swung<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.000> battle<00:01:24.360> one

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
really could have swung the battle one

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.560 
really could have swung the battle one
way<00:01:24.750> or<00:01:25.080> another<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.009> can't<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.240> turn

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
way or another and you can't be at turn

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
way or another and you can't be at turn
five<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.229> realize<00:01:28.530> oh<00:01:28.770> you're<00:01:28.979> too<00:01:29.159> far<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
five and realize oh you're too far to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.969 
five and realize oh you're too far to
you<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> gain<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> certain<00:01:31.560> table

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you know go in and gain a certain table

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.660 
you know go in and gain a certain table
corner<00:01:32.220> also<00:01:33.000> people<00:01:33.270> tend<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:34.200> them

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
corner also people tend to get them

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
corner also people tend to get them
focus<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:36.000> start<00:01:36.299> killing<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.780> unit<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
focus like they start killing a unit and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.130 
focus like they start killing a unit and
they<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.159> can't<00:01:38.700> let<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.210> go<00:01:39.509> unless<00:01:39.930> they

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
they just can't let it go unless they

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.010 
they just can't let it go unless they
kill<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.770> whole<00:01:41.220> unit<00:01:41.850> completely<00:01:42.780> dead

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
kill that whole unit completely dead

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.910 
kill that whole unit completely dead
when<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.549> victory<00:01:44.939> points<00:01:45.390> mission<00:01:45.920> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
when in a victory points mission you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100 
when in a victory points mission you
really<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.700> need<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.909> knock<00:01:48.240> those<00:01:48.570> units

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
really just need to knock those units

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.399 
really just need to knock those units
down<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.829> below<00:01:50.310> half<00:01:50.579> strength<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.409> then

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
down to below half strength and then

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.260 
down to below half strength and then
effectively<00:01:53.040> other<00:01:53.520> than<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> fact<00:01:54.060> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
effectively other than the fact that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.090 
effectively other than the fact that
they<00:01:54.420> saw<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:54.899> fighting<00:01:55.290> power<00:01:55.439> they're

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
they saw up some fighting power they're

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.240 
they saw up some fighting power they're
out<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.490> game<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.990> keep<00:01:58.560> track<00:01:59.009> in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
out of the game and so keep track in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.090 
out of the game and so keep track in
your<00:01:59.369> mind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.630> units<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.380> scoring

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
your mind of which units have scoring

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.870 
your mind of which units have scoring
strength<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:03.710> also<00:02:04.710> might<00:02:05.009> add<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.640> tower

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
strength I also might add that the tower

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.389 
strength I also might add that the tower
