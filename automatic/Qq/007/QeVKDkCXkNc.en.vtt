now<00:03:08.520> see<00:03:08.820> where<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.360> text<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.110> loosely<00:03:10.470> there

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
now see where I text it loosely there

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.940 
now see where I text it loosely there
right<00:03:11.250> now<00:03:11.460> I<00:03:11.490> didn't<00:03:11.880> leave<00:03:12.030> enough<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:13.410> hook

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
right now I didn't leave enough the hook

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.280 
right now I didn't leave enough the hook
point<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.370> showing<00:03:14.790> simply<00:03:15.780> all<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:15.930> do<00:03:16.170> is

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
point is showing simply all you do is

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.720 
point is showing simply all you do is
you<00:03:16.440> grab<00:03:17.390> both<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.450> them<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:20.070> slide<00:03:20.580> them

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
you grab both of them and slide them

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.610 
you grab both of them and slide them
back<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.880> gets<00:03:24.270> it<00:03:24.450> perfect<00:03:25.260> right<00:03:25.440> where
