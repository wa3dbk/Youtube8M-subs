00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.420 

okay<00:00:04.080> so<00:00:04.140> I'm<00:00:04.380> using<00:00:04.560> my<00:00:04.800> thermal<00:00:05.220> compound

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
okay so I'm using my thermal compound

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.849 
okay so I'm using my thermal compound
cleaner<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.600> want<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.810> use<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.140> number<00:00:07.740> one

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
cleaner you want to use the number one

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.980 
cleaner you want to use the number one
bottle<00:00:08.220> first<00:00:08.400> it's<00:00:08.700> by<00:00:08.820> Arctic<00:00:09.090> clean<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
bottle first it's by Arctic clean and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.770 
bottle first it's by Arctic clean and
once<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.740> get<00:00:10.860> all<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.070> material<00:00:11.519> off<00:00:11.780> use

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
once you get all the material off use

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.949 
once you get all the material off use
the<00:00:13.099> thermal<00:00:14.099> compound<00:00:14.280> -<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.179> before<00:00:15.570> will

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959 
the thermal compound - so before will

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.040 
the thermal compound - so before will
look<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:18.590> and<00:00:20.420> with<00:00:21.420> all<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> thermal

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
look like this and with all the thermal

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.990 
look like this and with all the thermal
compound<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.710> there<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.369> once<00:00:23.820> you're

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
compound on there and then once you're

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.779 
compound on there and then once you're
all<00:00:24.060> done<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.420> should<00:00:24.570> look<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.789> so

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
all done it should look like this so

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.929 
all done it should look like this so
this<00:00:27.179> is<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> best<00:00:27.599> stuff<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.080> fairly<00:00:28.380> cheap

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
this is the best stuff it's fairly cheap

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.770 
this is the best stuff it's fairly cheap
choose<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> q-tip<00:00:32.180> I'll<00:00:33.180> show<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.450> how<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> do

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
choose a q-tip I'll show you how to do

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.830 
choose a q-tip I'll show you how to do
it

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.080 
it
what<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> set<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> q-tip<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.890> there<00:00:38.129> take

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
what I do is set the q-tip on there take

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
what I do is set the q-tip on there take
the<00:00:39.210> number<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.629> put<00:00:40.020> some<00:00:40.260> dye<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> q-tip

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the number one put some dye on the q-tip

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.240 
the number one put some dye on the q-tip
over<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> top<00:00:42.230> just<00:00:43.230> rub<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.620> around<00:00:43.800> but

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
over the top just rub it around but

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.680 
over the top just rub it around but
can't<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> all<00:00:44.760> over<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.239> thermal

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
can't get it all over all the thermal

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
can't get it all over all the thermal
compound<00:00:48.590> let<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> sit<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.399> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
compound let it sit on there for a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.650 
compound let it sit on there for a
little<00:00:50.670> bit<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.910> it'll<00:00:51.120> start<00:00:51.300> eating<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
little bit and it'll start eating it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.639 
little bit and it'll start eating it
away<00:00:53.840> starts<00:00:54.840> eating<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.140> away<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> should

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
away starts eating it away it should

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.630 
away starts eating it away it should
start<00:00:55.980> coming<00:00:56.129> right<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.960> shiny<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.640> GPU

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
start coming right up so shiny the GPU

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.960 
start coming right up so shiny the GPU
gets<00:01:06.680> just<00:01:07.680> keep<00:01:07.860> rubbing<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.370> until<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.880> all

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
gets just keep rubbing it until it all

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.360 
gets just keep rubbing it until it all
comes<00:01:09.450> off<00:01:12.500> just<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.710> dissolves<00:01:14.220> away

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
comes off just kind of dissolves away

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.720 
comes off just kind of dissolves away
like<00:01:15.470> it's<00:01:16.470> kind<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.830> chewing<00:01:17.400> gum<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
like it's kind of like chewing gum I

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:27.280 
like it's kind of like chewing gum I
guess

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.720 

get<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.500> stuff<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.190> switch<00:01:29.520> ends

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
get all that stuff out there switch ends

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.610 
get all that stuff out there switch ends
of<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.000> q-tip<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:31.080> can<00:01:33.320> drive<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.440> down

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
of the q-tip here just can drive it down

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.910 
of the q-tip here just can drive it down
should<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:36.110> come<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:37.890> looks

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
should all come right off so it looks

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.330 
should all come right off so it looks
something<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.860 

pretty<00:01:44.340> easy<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:47.180> little<00:01:48.180> bit<00:01:48.390> more<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
pretty easy a little bit more on the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.360 
pretty easy a little bit more on the
Arabian<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> drop<00:01:54.590> there<00:01:55.590> nice<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.740> clean<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
Arabian so drop there nice and clean and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.840 
Arabian so drop there nice and clean and
flat<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.480> flat<00:01:57.690> surface<00:01:58.490> I'm<00:01:59.490> doing

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
flat you want a flat surface I'm doing

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.320 
flat you want a flat surface I'm doing
this<00:02:01.100> now<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.880> way

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
this now that's out of the way

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.360 
this now that's out of the way
I<00:02:03.360> can't<00:02:04.110> dry<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.380> off<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.830> dry<00:02:05.070> end<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
I can't dry it off the dry end of the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:17.960 
I can't dry it off the dry end of the
q-tip<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.890> all<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.190> excess<00:02:12.030> off<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:16.970> comes

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
q-tip get all the excess off of it comes

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.970 
q-tip get all the excess off of it comes
right<00:02:18.180> off<00:02:18.240> okay<00:02:19.760> now<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.820> got<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> clean<00:02:21.420> unit

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
right off okay now we got a clean unit

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.190 
right off okay now we got a clean unit
want<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> use<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.490> number<00:02:23.760> two<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:25.410> clean<00:02:25.590> and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
want to use the number two to clean and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.310 
want to use the number two to clean and
put<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.260> drop<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.709> there<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:30.870> cleans

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
put a drop on there and that just cleans

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:40.540 
put a drop on there and that just cleans
it<00:02:31.530> once<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.830> get<00:02:31.950> all<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> compound<00:02:32.640> off<00:02:38.030> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
it once you get all the compound off and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.210 
it once you get all the compound off and
should<00:02:41.550> be<00:02:41.640> nice<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:41.820> clean<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.300> dry<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> dry

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
should be nice and clean and dry so dry

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.570 
should be nice and clean and dry so dry
end<00:02:44.430> again<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:46.590> ready<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.920> play<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.250> thermal

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
end again you ready to play the thermal

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.759 
end again you ready to play the thermal
compound<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.650> next<00:02:52.830> video<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.850> got

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
compound it's the next video so you got

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.860 
compound it's the next video so you got
q-tips<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.920> look<00:02:56.070> like<00:02:56.280> that's<00:02:56.910> essentially

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
q-tips that look like that's essentially

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.620 
q-tips that look like that's essentially
all<00:03:00.980> right<00:03:03.650> okay<00:03:04.650> now<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.420> CPU<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.570> GPU

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
all right okay now that the CPU and GPU

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.410 
all right okay now that the CPU and GPU
are<00:03:07.380> cleaned<00:03:08.310> up<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:10.500> want<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.830> clean<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
are cleaned up you want to clean all the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.120 
are cleaned up you want to clean all the
thermal<00:03:12.420> compound<00:03:12.720> off<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.320> heatsink<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.040> you

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
thermal compound off the heatsink so you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.410 
thermal compound off the heatsink so you
got<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.459> one<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:16.470> got<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.769> one<00:03:17.010> so

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
got this one and you got this one so

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
got this one and you got this one so
basically<00:03:18.420> do<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.810> same<00:03:18.870> thing<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.320> did

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
basically do the same thing that you did

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.410 
basically do the same thing that you did
to<00:03:19.590> clean<00:03:19.800> off<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:21.140> CPU<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:24.140> put<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.170> drop<00:03:26.420> and

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
to clean off the CPU just put a drop and

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.420 
to clean off the CPU just put a drop and
this<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.780> got<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.989> lot<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.980> I'm

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
this is got a lot of it on it so I'm

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.369 
this is got a lot of it on it so I'm
probably<00:03:29.640> gonna<00:03:29.880> put<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.090> couple<00:03:30.390> drops<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.810> it

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
probably gonna put a couple drops on it

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.679 
probably gonna put a couple drops on it
can<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.010> let<00:03:33.249> it<00:03:33.370> sit<00:03:33.700> there<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.090> rub<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.599> in

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
can I let it sit there and rub it in

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.140 
can I let it sit there and rub it in

it'll eat it away a little bit I'm gonna
put<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.680> little<00:05:10.830> more<00:05:10.919> on<00:05:11.190> there<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.699> once

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
put a little more on there this is once

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:19.060 
put a little more on there this is once
again<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.180> number<00:05:12.449> one<00:05:12.720> Arcanine

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.520 

number<00:05:20.070> one<00:05:20.220> arctic<00:05:20.610> clean<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.419> should<00:05:22.320> put<00:05:22.500> a

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
number one arctic clean so should put a

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.420 
number one arctic clean so should put a
couple<00:05:22.830> jobs<00:05:23.099> along<00:05:23.370> here<00:05:26.360> so<00:05:28.099> it's<00:05:29.099> probably

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
couple jobs along here so it's probably

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.689 
couple jobs along here so it's probably
too<00:05:29.550> much<00:05:29.759> but<00:05:30.030> it<00:05:30.120> kinda<00:05:30.360> smells<00:05:30.539> orangey

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
it's like that citrus clean that might

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.490 
it's like that citrus clean that might
even<00:05:34.139> work<00:05:34.380> in<00:05:34.620> my<00:05:34.680> lunch<00:05:34.949> as<00:05:35.130> citrus<00:05:35.639> clean
