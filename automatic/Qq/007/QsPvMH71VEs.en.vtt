00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.930 
own physics and that makes you doubt
about<00:02:17.959> yourself<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:19.160> it's<00:02:19.340> not<00:02:19.549> actually

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
about yourself but it's not actually

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.059 
about yourself but it's not actually
your<00:02:19.970> fault<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.650> it's<00:02:21.860> always

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
your fault you know and so it's always

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.320 
your fault you know and so it's always
like<00:02:22.959> sad<00:02:23.959> party<00:02:24.470> she's<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.549> you've<00:02:26.030> been

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
like sad party she's you and you've been

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.650 
like sad party she's you and you've been
viewed<00:02:27.260> by<00:02:27.350> audience<00:02:27.950> too<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.640> you're<00:02:29.540> always

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
viewed by audience too so you're always

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.150 
viewed by audience too so you're always
subjected<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:31.540> other<00:02:32.540> people's<00:02:33.230> judgement<00:02:33.950> in

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
subjected to other people's judgement in

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.240 
subjected to other people's judgement in
a<00:02:34.280> way<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:35.299> can<00:02:35.690> be<00:02:35.900> very<00:02:36.049> harsh<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.040> that's

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
a way and it can be very harsh so that's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.030 
a way and it can be very harsh so that's
a<00:02:37.430> very<00:02:37.640> hard<00:02:37.970> sort<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.480> challenge<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.290> saying<00:02:39.890> I

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
a very hard sort of challenge a saying I

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.979 
a very hard sort of challenge a saying I
find<00:02:40.310> always<00:02:40.579> fine<00:02:40.940> with<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.239> dancing<00:02:41.720> or

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
find always fine with the dancing or

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.710 
find always fine with the dancing or
ballet<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.530> critical<00:02:42.859> barrier<00:02:42.920> because<00:02:43.720> it's

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
ballet a critical barrier because it's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.620 
ballet a critical barrier because it's
an<00:02:44.840> art<00:02:44.989> form<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.820> there's<00:02:47.799> something

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
an art form and there's something

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.280 
an art form and there's something
exact<00:02:50.560> we<00:02:51.010> are<00:02:51.130> trying<00:02:51.460> to<00:02:51.550> Express<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:52.990> not

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
exact we are trying to Express it's not

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.120 
exact we are trying to Express it's not
about<00:02:53.560> physics<00:02:54.370> or<00:02:54.730> how<00:02:55.030> pretty<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.950> rather

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
about physics or how pretty the rather

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.670 
about physics or how pretty the rather
than<00:02:57.460> more<00:02:58.360> like<00:02:58.870> what<00:02:59.170> you're<00:02:59.380> trying<00:02:59.620> to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
than more like what you're trying to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.220 
than more like what you're trying to
express<00:03:00.070> in<00:03:00.580> your<00:03:00.820> movement<00:03:01.270> or<00:03:01.480> your<00:03:01.720> emotion

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
express in your movement or your emotion

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.060 
express in your movement or your emotion
all<00:03:02.440> those<00:03:02.650> things<00:03:02.890> it's<00:03:03.190> more<00:03:03.370> about<00:03:03.550> here

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
all those things it's more about here

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.930 
all those things it's more about here
something<00:03:06.070> one<00:03:06.220> moves<00:03:06.580> and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870 

but<00:03:09.940> if<00:03:10.030> audiences<00:03:10.840> sort<00:03:11.770> of<00:03:11.860> can<00:03:12.580> really

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
but if audiences sort of can really

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.600 
but if audiences sort of can really
grasps<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.480> feeling<00:03:13.960> and<00:03:14.170> still<00:03:14.800> just<00:03:15.190> look<00:03:15.400> at

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
grasps a feeling and still just look at

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.300 
grasps a feeling and still just look at
oh<00:03:16.120> my<00:03:16.570> god<00:03:16.810> they're<00:03:17.110> beautiful<00:03:17.350> like<00:03:17.920> fetus

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
oh my god they're beautiful like fetus

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.830 
oh my god they're beautiful like fetus
or<00:03:18.400> beautiful<00:03:18.910> or<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.330> bodies<00:03:19.630> are<00:03:19.750> so

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
or beautiful or the bodies are so

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.080 
or beautiful or the bodies are so
beautiful<00:03:20.350> then<00:03:20.710> you<00:03:21.700> know<00:03:21.790> there's<00:03:22.030> a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
beautiful then you know there's a

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.900 
beautiful then you know there's a
distance<00:03:22.570> right<00:03:22.870> between<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:24.430> performers

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
distance right between the performers

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.020 
distance right between the performers
and<00:03:24.940> audience<00:03:25.480> but<00:03:26.020> to<00:03:26.650> bridge<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:27.030> distance

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
and audience but to bridge that distance

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.590 
and audience but to bridge that distance
would<00:03:28.600> be<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:29.320> think<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:29.770> always<00:03:30.070> been

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
would be I think it's always been

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.160 
would be I think it's always been
challenging<00:03:31.600> and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
challenging and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.270 
challenging and
at<00:03:34.040> least<00:03:34.280> what<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.460> feel<00:03:34.850> is<00:03:35.350> needed<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.560> keep

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
at least what I feel is needed and keep

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.110 
at least what I feel is needed and keep
sort<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.060> striping<00:03:38.870> as<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.590> dancer<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.520> achieve

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
sort of striping as a dancer to achieve

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.690 
sort of striping as a dancer to achieve
to<00:03:41.870> shorten<00:03:42.770> that<00:03:42.890> distance<00:03:43.070> between

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
to shorten that distance between

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.610 
to shorten that distance between
audience<00:03:44.240> and<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:45.080> performer

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
audience and the performer

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.380 
audience and the performer
yeah<00:03:47.080> you<00:03:48.080> haven't<00:03:48.350> recorded<00:03:48.560> this<00:03:48.860> have<00:03:49.040> you

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
yeah you haven't recorded this have you

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.690 
yeah you haven't recorded this have you
what<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:50.510> it
