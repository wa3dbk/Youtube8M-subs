pop up the elbow then move it to the
shoulder<00:00:33.660> yeah<00:00:33.840> that's<00:00:34.050> kind<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.559> correct<00:00:34.890> but

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
shoulder yeah that's kind of correct but

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.639 
shoulder yeah that's kind of correct but
it<00:00:36.180> doesn't<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:36.960> work<00:00:37.170> because<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.469> mean

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it doesn't really work because I mean

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.549 
it doesn't really work because I mean
does<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> look<00:00:38.610> right<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
does that look right to you

does that look right to you
really<00:00:40.590> no<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:42.059> really<00:00:42.450> need<00:00:42.770> your<00:00:43.770> fingers

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
really no you really need your fingers

really no you really need your fingers
in<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.550> your<00:00:44.700> fingers<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.390> hands

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
have to be in there look this is what I

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.779 
have to be in there look this is what I
mean<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.230> fluid<00:00:49.230> motion<00:00:49.649> right<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:49.860> your

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
mean that fluid motion right there your

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
mean that fluid motion right there your
hand<00:00:51.149> weight<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.930> basis<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.580 
hand weight that's the basis of this it
really<00:00:53.460> emphasizes<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.449> another<00:00:55.140> thing<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
really emphasizes it another thing that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.020 
really emphasizes it another thing that
the<00:00:55.710> tutorials<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.340> tell<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:56.879> you

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
comfortable with this you can't do it

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.770 
comfortable with this you can't do it
freehand<00:02:26.710> like<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.300> once<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.600> feel

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
freehand like this so once you feel

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.710 
freehand like this so once you feel
comfortable<00:02:29.020> with<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.620> try<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.460> stop<00:02:31.420> using

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
comfortable with this try to stop using

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.080 
comfortable with this try to stop using
your<00:02:31.960> force<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.370> free<00:02:33.610> motion

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
your force so it's just a free motion

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.640 
your force so it's just a free motion
you're<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.900> using<00:02:35.080> all<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.380> muscle

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you're just using all that muscle

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.470 
you're just using all that muscle
control<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.400> built<00:02:36.640> up<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.300> are

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
control that you built up and you are

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.510 
control that you built up and you are
making<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.960> little<00:02:38.110> handling<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:39.040> take<00:02:39.370> your

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
making a little handling then take your

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520 
making a little handling then take your
fingers<00:02:39.790> apart<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.720> will<00:02:40.840> allow<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.380> do

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
fingers apart that will allow you to do

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.130 
fingers apart that will allow you to do
this<00:02:41.820> after<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.180> down<00:02:43.420> do<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.990> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
this after you get that down do it the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.260 
this after you get that down do it the
other<00:02:44.350> way<00:02:44.650> learn<00:02:45.130> how<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.340> do<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.640> like<00:02:45.790> this

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
other way learn how to do it like this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.180 
other way learn how to do it like this
learn<00:02:46.600> how<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.840> do<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.170> like<00:02:47.320> this<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.890> then

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
learn how to do it like this and then

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.040 
learn how to do it like this and then
learn<00:02:48.400> how<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.610> do<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.940> like<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.300> so<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.840> can

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
learn how to do it like this so you can

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.500 
learn how to do it like this so you can
do<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.380> both<00:02:50.560> ways<00:02:51.060> see<00:02:52.060> one<00:02:52.450> way<00:02:52.690> other<00:02:53.290> way

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
do it both ways see one way other way

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.970 
do it both ways see one way other way
pretty<00:02:55.510> simple<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.140> way<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.380> can<00:02:56.620> do<00:02:56.740> that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
pretty simple that way you can do that

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.700 
pretty simple that way you can do that
handling<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:58.000> way<00:02:58.210> hand<00:02:59.080> wave<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.530> way

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
handling it that way hand wave that way

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.920 
handling it that way hand wave that way
and<00:03:00.070> then<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.220> way<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:01.300> we<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.540> not<00:03:01.690> kind

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
and then that way that we have not kind

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.760 
and then that way that we have not kind
of<00:03:01.960> that<00:03:02.320> way<00:03:02.530> thus<00:03:03.160> creating<00:03:04.230> both<00:03:05.230> sides<00:03:05.590> of

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
of that way thus creating both sides of

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.170 
of that way thus creating both sides of
the<00:03:05.890> way<00:03:06.010> obviously

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
the way obviously

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.790 
the way obviously
now<00:03:08.050> when<00:03:08.800> waving<00:03:09.310> really<00:03:10.210> basic<00:03:10.650> stick<00:03:11.650> your

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
now when waving really basic stick your

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.640 
now when waving really basic stick your
hand<00:03:12.040> out<00:03:12.220> wrist<00:03:12.880> goes<00:03:13.090> up<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.690> then<00:03:14.410> when<00:03:14.560> you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
hand out wrist goes up and then when you

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
hand out wrist goes up and then when you
put<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:14.980> wrist<00:03:15.220> down<00:03:15.540> nobody's<00:03:16.540> how<00:03:16.690> the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
put this wrist down nobody's how the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.020 
put this wrist down nobody's how the
wrist<00:03:17.140> goes<00:03:17.470> up<00:03:17.680> here<00:03:17.980> when<00:03:18.340> your<00:03:18.580> hand<00:03:18.820> goes

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
wrist goes up here when your hand goes

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.120 
wrist goes up here when your hand goes
down<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.420> wrist<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.810> up<00:03:19.960> here<00:03:20.140> thus<00:03:20.650> creating

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
down the wrist is up here thus creating

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.980 
down the wrist is up here thus creating
a<00:03:21.220> straight<00:03:21.580> line<00:03:21.790> from<00:03:22.090> your<00:03:22.180> elbow<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.720> your

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
a straight line from your elbow to your

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.650 
a straight line from your elbow to your
fingers<00:03:23.440> right<00:03:23.680> there<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:25.150> have<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.510> keep

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
fingers right there you have to keep

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.920 
fingers right there you have to keep
that<00:03:25.840> straight<00:03:26.350> line<00:03:26.590> when<00:03:26.890> you're<00:03:27.010> waving

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
that straight line when you're waving

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.540 
that straight line when you're waving
okay<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.650> have<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.980> maintain<00:03:30.190> that

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
okay so you have to maintain that

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.860 
okay so you have to maintain that
straight<00:03:30.820> line<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.150> whole<00:03:31.360> time<00:03:31.390> see
