gonna be kayak fishing and flowing

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.760 
gonna be kayak fishing and flowing
rivers<00:00:15.599> then<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.960> chances<00:00:16.350> are<00:00:16.500> you're<00:00:16.710> gonna

rivers then the chances are you're gonna

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
rivers then the chances are you're gonna
have<00:00:16.980> some<00:00:17.220> type<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.460> encounter<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
have some type of encounter with the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
have some type of encounter with the
rock<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.260> need<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> know<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.039> do<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
rock so you need to know what to do and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700 
rock so you need to know what to do and
more<00:00:20.699> importantly<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:22.080> when<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
more importantly what not to do when it

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.650 
more importantly what not to do when it
happens<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.910> that's<00:00:24.029> we're<00:00:24.269> gonna<00:00:24.359> look<00:00:24.510> at

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
happens and that's we're gonna look at

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.929 
happens and that's we're gonna look at
this<00:00:24.840> week<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.920> first<00:00:26.070> thing<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.519> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
this week the first thing to know is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.550 
this week the first thing to know is
that<00:00:27.000> plastic<00:00:27.480> Hayek's<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.930> designed<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.439> do

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that plastic Hayek's are designed to do

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.220 
that plastic Hayek's are designed to do
some<00:00:28.769> bouncing<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.369> rocks<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.900> as<00:00:31.019> long<00:00:31.050> as

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
some bouncing on rocks and so as long as

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.020 
some bouncing on rocks and so as long as
you're<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:32.130> fast-moving<00:00:32.700> water

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you're not in really fast-moving water

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.910 
you're not in really fast-moving water
you<00:00:33.660> don't<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.170> need<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.469> worry<00:00:34.649> about

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
you don't really need to worry about

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.580 
you don't really need to worry about
them<00:00:35.100> holding<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> abuse<00:00:36.380> your<00:00:37.380> kayak

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
them holding up to the abuse your kayak

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.750 
them holding up to the abuse your kayak
has<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> rudder<00:00:37.980> though<00:00:38.190> you'll<00:00:38.399> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> have

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
has a rudder though you'll want to have

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.590 
has a rudder though you'll want to have
it<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.260> break<00:00:40.680> very<00:00:41.040> quickly

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
it up because it will break very quickly

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
it up because it will break very quickly
if<00:00:42.600> you're<00:00:42.750> pointing<00:00:43.230> straight<00:00:43.500> downstream

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
if you're pointing straight downstream

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
if you're pointing straight downstream
and<00:00:44.399> bouncing<00:00:44.850> over<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.120> shallow<00:00:45.450> area<00:00:45.600> there's

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and bouncing over a shallow area there's

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.590 
and bouncing over a shallow area there's
not<00:00:46.500> much<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.070> know<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.360> rocks

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
not much you need to know it's the rocks

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
not much you need to know it's the rocks
that<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> water<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.250> under

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that are out of the water or just under

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.740 
that are out of the water or just under
the<00:00:50.640> surface<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> need<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.600> more

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the surface that you need to be more

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.510 
the surface that you need to be more
concerned<00:00:52.199> about<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:53.010> they'll<00:00:53.280> stock

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
concerned about because they'll stock

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
concerned about because they'll stock
your<00:00:53.699> kayak<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.329> spin<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> sideways<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
your kayak and spin you sideways and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380 
your kayak and spin you sideways and
that's<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.460> greatest<00:00:56.670> position<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> be

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
that's not the greatest position to be

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.959 
that's not the greatest position to be
in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.079> problem<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> main<00:00:59.430> current

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
in the problem is that the main current

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.250 
in the problem is that the main current
is<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> hit<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> upstream<00:01:00.960> side<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
is going to hit the upstream side of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.920 
is going to hit the upstream side of
your<00:01:01.469> kayak<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.030> let<00:01:03.239> my<00:01:03.359> upstream<00:01:03.780> edge

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
your kayak and if I let my upstream edge

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.980 
your kayak and if I let my upstream edge
dip<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.489> current<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.119> pile<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.600> on

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
dip at all that current can pile up on

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.260 
dip at all that current can pile up on
the<00:01:07.049> edge<00:01:07.260> push<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> flip<00:01:09.119> me

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the edge push it down and flip me

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
the edge push it down and flip me
upstream<00:01:09.630> incredibly<00:01:10.110> quickly<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.799> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
upstream incredibly quickly all that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.490 
upstream incredibly quickly all that
means<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.240> need<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.630> lean<00:01:12.780> downstream

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
means is that I need to lean downstream

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
means is that I need to lean downstream
or<00:01:13.710> into<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> rock<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:14.939> balance<00:01:15.210> my

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
or into the rock it can balance my

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840 
or into the rock it can balance my
weight<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:15.990> downstream<00:01:16.710> butt<00:01:16.920> cheek<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.430> can

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
weight on my downstream butt cheek I can

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.510 
weight on my downstream butt cheek I can
then<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.030> push<00:01:18.540> myself<00:01:18.990> off<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.189> keep

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
then just push myself off and keep

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
then just push myself off and keep
moving<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:20.970> downstream<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> same

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
moving on downstream it's for the same

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.410 
moving on downstream it's for the same
reason<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.340> anchors<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:23.850> tricky<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
reason that anchors are tricky and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
reason that anchors are tricky and
usually<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> bad<00:01:24.960> idea<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.650> use<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.040> current

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
usually a bad idea to use in current

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
usually a bad idea to use in current
unless<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.330> anchored<00:01:27.689> directly<00:01:27.869> off<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
unless you're anchored directly off the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.560 
unless you're anchored directly off the
stern<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> bow<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.970> will<00:01:30.119> point<00:01:30.360> my

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
stern or the bow which will point my

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
stern or the bow which will point my
boat<00:01:31.170> come<00:01:31.530> directly<00:01:32.130> downstream<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.060> line

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
boat come directly downstream in line

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.539 
boat come directly downstream in line
with<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> current<00:01:33.900> my<00:01:34.799> kayak<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> be

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
with the current my kayak is going to be

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.760 
with the current my kayak is going to be
on<00:01:35.670> some<00:01:35.970> type<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> angle<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> current<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
on some type of angle to the current and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
on some type of angle to the current and
that<00:01:38.009> means<00:01:38.310> water<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.970> gonna<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.240> hitting<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
