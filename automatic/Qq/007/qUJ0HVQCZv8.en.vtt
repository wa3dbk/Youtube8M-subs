00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.200 

one<00:02:43.370> more<00:02:43.490> time

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.920 

yes<00:02:48.220> for<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.310> F<00:02:49.490> chord<00:02:50.030> I'm<00:02:50.510> going<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.780> pick

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
all the middle strings so a DG and be

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.110 
all the middle strings so a DG and be
like<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.670> thumb<00:02:55.970> thumb<00:02:56.720> 1<00:02:57.380> 2<00:02:58.160> i'll<00:02:58.910> do

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and then for the laugh G chord this is

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.080 
and then for the laugh G chord this is
what<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.470> confusion<00:03:06.920> was<00:03:06.950> earlier<00:03:07.400> but<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:07.880> got

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
what the confusion was earlier but I got

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.670 
what the confusion was earlier but I got
it<00:03:08.210> now<00:03:08.890> loi<00:03:10.570> d<00:03:11.570> string<00:03:12.190> g<00:03:13.190> string<00:03:14.320> b<00:03:15.320> string

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
it now loi d string g string b string

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.920 
it now loi d string g string b string
and<00:03:15.950> then<00:03:16.490> again<00:03:16.760> hammer<00:03:17.060> on<00:03:17.240> that<00:03:17.450> first<00:03:17.660> fret

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
and then again hammer on that first fret

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
and then again hammer on that first fret
of<00:03:17.960> the<00:03:18.080> B<00:03:18.140> like<00:03:18.740> this

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.730 

one<00:03:22.610> more<00:03:22.730> time

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:38.010 

so<00:03:26.340> altogether<00:03:26.580> we've<00:03:27.180> got

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:50.330 

I'll<00:03:39.020> do<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.200> again

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.729 

I<00:03:50.400> keep<00:03:51.300> picking<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:51.660> wrong<00:03:51.750> string<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:52.500> i

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
I keep picking the wrong string but i

00:03:52.739 --> 00:04:03.080 
I keep picking the wrong string but i
will<00:03:53.220> get<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.370> let<00:03:53.640> me<00:03:53.730> do<00:03:53.819> it<00:03:53.849> one<00:03:53.970> more<00:03:54.000> time

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.210 

you

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.490 

there<00:04:09.820> we<00:04:10.030> go<00:04:10.150> now<00:04:10.480> I'm<00:04:10.750> going<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:11.020> do<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.290> with

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
there we go now I'm going to do it with

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.680 
there we go now I'm going to do it with
the<00:04:12.040> pic<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:12.490> you<00:04:12.550> can<00:04:12.640> kind<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:12.970> see<00:04:13.150> same

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
the pic so you can kind of see same

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:31.210 
the pic so you can kind of see same
exact<00:04:14.020> thing<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:14.710> using<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.100> pic

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.040 

so<00:04:32.000> that's<00:04:32.210> how<00:04:32.390> we<00:04:32.420> pick<00:04:32.780> up<00:04:32.900> with<00:04:32.990> the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
so that's how we pick up with the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.810 
so that's how we pick up with the
fingers<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.530> take<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.830> with<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.010> pic<00:04:34.220> if<00:04:34.610> we

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
fingers and take it with the pic if we

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.170 
fingers and take it with the pic if we
were<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.120> strum<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.570> same<00:04:36.410> chords<00:04:37.030> probably<00:04:38.030> do

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
were to strum it same chords probably do

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.080 
were to strum it same chords probably do
like<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.420> down<00:04:38.930> down<00:04:39.350> down<00:04:39.770> down<00:04:40.280> up<00:04:40.310> strumming

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
like a down down down down up strumming

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.660 
like a down down down down up strumming
if<00:04:41.210> you're<00:04:41.540> picking<00:04:41.930> or<00:04:42.050> finger<00:04:42.320> picking

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
if you're picking or finger picking

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.160 
if you're picking or finger picking
don't<00:04:43.670> feel<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.120> confident<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:45.050> could

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
don't feel that confident you could

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.170 
don't feel that confident you could
always<00:04:45.320> have<00:04:45.560> this<00:04:45.680> option<00:04:45.920> too<00:04:46.280> so<00:04:46.760> same

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
always have this option too so same

00:04:47.180 --> 00:05:02.140 
always have this option too so same
chords<00:04:47.510> though<00:04:47.660> SI<00:04:48.910> g<00:04:50.110> f<00:04:52.180> g<00:04:54.250> c/g<00:04:56.800> f<00:04:58.900> g<00:05:00.970> so<00:05:01.970> that's

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
chords though SI g f g c/g f g so that's

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.480 
chords though SI g f g c/g f g so that's
our<00:05:02.360> intro<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.110> that's<00:05:03.260> also<00:05:03.470> our<00:05:03.740> verse<00:05:04.130> now

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
our intro and that's also our verse now

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.850 
our intro and that's also our verse now
for<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:04.790> chorus<00:05:05.300> part<00:05:05.660> what<00:05:06.260> I'm<00:05:06.380> going<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.560> do

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
for the chorus part what I'm going to do

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.040 
for the chorus part what I'm going to do
is<00:05:07.370> I'm<00:05:07.490> going<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:07.640> strum<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:08.270> for<00:05:08.630> you<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:09.020> you

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
is I'm going to strum it for you so you

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.950 
is I'm going to strum it for you so you
could<00:05:09.350> get<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:10.070> chords<00:05:10.490> in<00:05:10.610> order<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:11.690> what<00:05:11.840> we

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
could get the chords in order so what we

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.839 
could get the chords in order so what we
need<00:05:12.140> is<00:05:12.380> again<00:05:12.980> SI<00:05:14.080> g

now if you wanted to actually pick that

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.890 
now if you wanted to actually pick that
chorus<00:05:57.060> it's<00:05:58.060> not<00:05:58.180> going<00:05:58.270> to<00:05:58.360> be<00:05:58.450> quite<00:05:58.750> as
