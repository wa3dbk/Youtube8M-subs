00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.830
 Well friends here seeing my bora that 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.799
 is a little flooded with the carpet and 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.980
 we check possible water inflows that 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:15.750
 it's on the floor 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.439
 there's nothing fire wall either and what 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.849
 that here the hoses of the sunroof and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.849
 they were a little bit covered 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.609
 in the case of the seven and the golf the 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.900
 sunroof drain hose comes 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.519
 in the doors on the poles of the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.230
 doors I do not remember if it laporta in the 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:38.629
 post but in the bora do not measure the task 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.410
 to disarm everything investigate in forums 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.800
 all that and nobody could give me 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.630
 some possible solution already disarming and 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.340
 I found the sunroof hose 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.260
 what it looks like, it could be said that the wall 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.980
 Fire is not good front cargo 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.440
 and goes out to the fenders 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.840
 well I found this this hose 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.210
 what is the sunroof this connector 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.190
 that goes towards the tip of good towards the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.479
 front of the car I put silicone 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.420
 here so that you will not be going back to 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.909
 water but I found this in the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.090
 tip comes like this now what I'm going to do 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.310
 is going to be cut it so that of certain 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.840
 no longer stop because the self 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.000
 always left the car below the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.520
 trees or in the shade look for shade 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.710
 but the twigs and everything is all those 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.259
 situations have complicated me a bit 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.180
 in these rainy times not that I was 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.909
 wets the car already and floor and 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.119
 Remove all garbage 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.010
 all the trash that comes that comes to give 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.890
 on this side 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.960
 look at it, look at it, there is appreciated 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.570
 see one will appreciate a bit the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.330
 little flowers all ok the hose 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.780
 that comes in front of the good of the burning 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.260
 coconuts low towards this side you have to 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.830
 remove this good the cleaners and this 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.130
 plastic thing I do not know what it's called 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.310
 to be able to take out the hose this 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.310
 here 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.180
 and cut it now the row is going to be 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.540
 put it in this case if I will have to 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.970
 remove that plastic thing put this 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.120
 hose and this one that I imagine are going to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.430
 some sheet of the car and put it 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.300
 silicon but obviously I have to cut 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.980
 this so that it remains direct but with the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.040
 the passage of time all those garbage that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.760
 They are on the roof of my car 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.760
 are going to accumulate 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.520
 are going to accumulate in the container of 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 here the sunroof and the drool goes 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.629
 to filter him 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.170

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.599
 hopefully and serve you this little video 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.060

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.620
