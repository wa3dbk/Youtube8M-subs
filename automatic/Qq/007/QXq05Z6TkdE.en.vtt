00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
popped in that time so let's go ahead

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:52.150 
popped in that time so let's go ahead
and<00:05:28.660> continue<00:05:29.660> to<00:05:30.050> press<00:05:30.200> this<00:05:30.410> down<00:05:50.919> okay<00:05:51.919> we

and continue to press this down okay we
just<00:05:52.190> about<00:05:52.550> hit<00:05:52.729> the<00:05:52.820> bottom<00:05:53.120> there<00:05:53.270> so<00:05:53.390> we

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
just about hit the bottom there so we

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:00.580 
just about hit the bottom there so we
want<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.690> go<00:05:53.750> ahead<00:05:53.810> and<00:05:53.960> release<00:05:58.450> all<00:05:59.450> right

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
want to go ahead and release all right

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.490 
want to go ahead and release all right
we're<00:06:01.280> gonna<00:06:01.370> have<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.669> press<00:06:01.910> this<00:06:02.120> through

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
we're gonna have to press this through

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.870 
we're gonna have to press this through
I'll<00:06:03.500> show<00:06:03.710> you<00:06:03.770> in<00:06:03.919> a<00:06:04.010> few

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.400 

all<00:06:07.880> right<00:06:08.060> normally<00:06:08.450> we<00:06:08.600> wouldn't<00:06:08.840> use<00:06:08.990> this

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
all right normally we wouldn't use this

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.950 
all right normally we wouldn't use this
on<00:06:09.770> this<00:06:10.639> thin<00:06:10.910> sheet<00:06:10.940> metal<00:06:11.389> here<00:06:11.540> because<00:06:11.840> it

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
on this thin sheet metal here because it

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.990 
on this thin sheet metal here because it
may<00:06:12.080> cause<00:06:12.110> it<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.590> collapse<00:06:12.770> but<00:06:13.400> because

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
may cause it to collapse but because

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.790 
may cause it to collapse but because
it's<00:06:14.210> a<00:06:14.270> bushing<00:06:14.630> that<00:06:14.840> we're<00:06:14.990> probably

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
it's a bushing that we're probably

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.900 
it's a bushing that we're probably
everything<00:06:15.950> bushing<00:06:16.340> we<00:06:16.430> were<00:06:16.520> putting<00:06:16.790> into

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
everything bushing we were putting into

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.400 
everything bushing we were putting into
here<00:06:17.180> this<00:06:17.630> should<00:06:17.780> be<00:06:17.900> fine<00:06:18.139> for<00:06:18.169> these

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
here this should be fine for these

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.460 
here this should be fine for these
purposes<00:06:18.860> makes<00:06:19.100> life<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:19.460> little<00:06:19.610> easier<00:06:20.000> so

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
purposes makes life a little easier so

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.680 
purposes makes life a little easier so
just<00:06:21.470> take<00:06:21.650> that<00:06:21.680> place<00:06:22.460> it<00:06:22.639> around<00:06:22.730> the<00:06:23.330> area

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
just take that place it around the area

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.370 
just take that place it around the area
here<00:06:24.400> make<00:06:25.400> sure<00:06:25.550> it's<00:06:25.700> a<00:06:25.940> good<00:06:26.450> amount<00:06:26.720> larger

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
here make sure it's a good amount larger

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.590 
here make sure it's a good amount larger
so<00:06:27.710> you<00:06:28.070> can<00:06:28.250> press<00:06:28.520> that<00:06:28.730> bushing<00:06:29.180> in<00:06:29.360> and

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
so you can press that bushing in and

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.050 
so you can press that bushing in and
it'll<00:06:29.810> pop<00:06:29.960> out<00:06:30.200> on<00:06:30.260> the<00:06:30.410> other<00:06:30.500> end<00:06:30.889> and<00:06:31.130> we'll

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
it'll pop out on the other end and we'll

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.700 
it'll pop out on the other end and we'll
go<00:06:32.210> ahead<00:06:32.480> and<00:06:32.630> get<00:06:32.750> this<00:06:32.900> closed<00:06:33.200> and<00:06:33.500> start

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
go ahead and get this closed and start

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.430 
go ahead and get this closed and start
pressing<00:06:33.950> it<00:06:34.190> down<00:06:34.870> make<00:06:35.870> sure<00:06:36.080> it's<00:06:36.229> centered

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
pressing it down make sure it's centered

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.520 
pressing it down make sure it's centered
as<00:06:36.680> you<00:06:36.800> get<00:06:36.950> close<00:06:40.270> all<00:06:41.270> right<00:06:41.540> go<00:06:42.080> ahead<00:06:42.110> and

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
as you get close all right go ahead and

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:55.690 
as you get close all right go ahead and
start<00:06:42.800> to<00:06:42.889> press<00:06:53.680> all<00:06:54.680> right<00:06:54.919> she<00:06:55.190> slipped<00:06:55.520> in

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
start to press all right she slipped in

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.000 
start to press all right she slipped in
and<00:06:55.880> released<00:06:56.180> pressure<00:06:56.530> that's<00:06:57.530> how<00:06:57.740> we<00:06:57.800> know

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
and released pressure that's how we know

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:06.400 
and released pressure that's how we know
it's<00:06:58.040> a<00:06:58.190> good<00:06:58.340> fit<00:07:03.640> all<00:07:04.640> right<00:07:05.229> there's<00:07:06.229> our

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
it's a good fit all right there's our

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.130 
it's a good fit all right there's our
bushing<00:07:06.800> in<00:07:06.979> now<00:07:07.520> just<00:07:07.850> like<00:07:08.690> before<00:07:08.840> we're

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.140 
bushing in now just like before we're

gonna go ahead and put in our sleeve so
I'm<00:07:17.030> gonna<00:07:17.150> go<00:07:17.330> ahead<00:07:17.440> use<00:07:18.440> the<00:07:18.650> remainder

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
I'm gonna go ahead use the remainder

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:26.380 
I'm gonna go ahead use the remainder
amount<00:07:20.300> of<00:07:20.419> grease<00:07:20.630> here<00:07:25.060> get<00:07:26.060> it<00:07:26.180> nice<00:07:26.360> and

lubed up go ahead and start putting that

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
lubed up go ahead and start putting that
in<00:07:32.950> should<00:07:33.950> be<00:07:33.979> fairly<00:07:34.340> easy<00:07:34.669> just<00:07:35.330> a<00:07:35.450> little

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:35.630 
in should be fairly easy just a little

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:42.040 
in should be fairly easy just a little
bit<00:07:35.720> of<00:07:35.780> pressure<00:07:35.990> there<00:07:39.520> you<00:07:40.520> have<00:07:40.700> it<00:07:41.050> this

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
bit of pressure there you have it this

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:50.030 
bit of pressure there you have it this
is<00:07:42.169> the<00:07:42.229> trailing<00:07:42.590> arm<00:07:43.270> front<00:07:44.650> bushing
