there's what's called fire lapping and
it's<00:00:18.580> basically<00:00:18.789> this<00:00:19.720> is<00:00:19.929> basically<00:00:20.380> the

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
it's basically this is basically the

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.740 
it's basically this is basically the
fire<00:00:20.830> lapping<00:00:21.189> kit<00:00:21.539> basically<00:00:22.539> what<00:00:22.630> it<00:00:22.720> is

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
fire lapping kit basically what it is

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.640 
fire lapping kit basically what it is
these<00:00:23.109> are<00:00:23.170> this<00:00:24.009> is<00:00:24.070> for<00:00:24.339> a<00:00:24.369> two<00:00:24.519> to<00:00:24.670> three

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
these are this is for a two to three

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.339 
these are this is for a two to three
caliber<00:00:26.650> rifle<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.480> basically<00:00:28.750> these

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
caliber rifle so basically these

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.529 
caliber rifle so basically these
projectiles<00:00:30.250> come<00:00:30.609> imbedded<00:00:31.029> with<00:00:31.150> different

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
projectiles come imbedded with different

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.100 
projectiles come imbedded with different
with<00:00:31.869> varying<00:00:33.000> coarseness<00:00:34.000> of<00:00:34.329> polishing

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
with varying coarseness of polishing

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.130 
with varying coarseness of polishing
compound<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:35.590> this<00:00:35.739> is<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.160> coarsest<00:00:37.059> all<00:00:37.899> the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
compound so this is the coarsest all the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.770 
compound so this is the coarsest all the
way<00:00:38.230> up<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.620> finest<00:00:39.039> and<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:40.660> this

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
way up to the finest and what this

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.590 
way up to the finest and what this
basically<00:00:41.430> does<00:00:42.430> is<00:00:42.760> basically<00:00:42.940> laps<00:00:43.390> your

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
basically does is basically laps your

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.040 
basically does is basically laps your
barrel<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:45.430> they<00:00:46.059> claim<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.449> does<00:00:46.660> improve

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
barrel it they claim it does improve

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.090 
barrel it they claim it does improve
accuracy<00:00:47.469> I<00:00:47.859> have<00:00:48.219> seen<00:00:48.489> that<00:00:48.609> personally

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
accuracy I have seen that personally

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.529 
accuracy I have seen that personally
worst<00:00:51.100> case<00:00:51.399> I<00:00:51.640> have<00:00:51.760> found<00:00:51.969> that<00:00:52.180> actually

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
worst case I have found that actually

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.959 
worst case I have found that actually
accuracy<00:00:53.530> does<00:00:53.680> not<00:00:53.859> improve<00:00:54.160> but<00:00:54.609> cleaning

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
accuracy does not improve but cleaning

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.680 
accuracy does not improve but cleaning
the<00:00:55.180> barrel<00:00:55.480> greatly<00:00:56.379> improves<00:00:57.690> typically

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
the barrel greatly improves typically

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.680 
the barrel greatly improves typically
I've<00:00:59.379> had<00:00:59.590> barrels<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:01.120> know<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.269> scrub

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
I've had barrels it you know you scrub

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.330 
I've had barrels it you know you scrub
and<00:01:01.870> scrub<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.140> scrub<00:01:02.289> scrub<00:01:02.590> and<00:01:02.980> finally

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
and scrub and scrub scrub and finally

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.700 
and scrub and scrub scrub and finally
they<00:01:03.460> come<00:01:03.640> clean<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.320> after<00:01:05.320> running<00:01:05.500> this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
they come clean and after running this

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.219 
they come clean and after running this
kit<00:01:05.920> through<00:01:06.130> them<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:07.390> know<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.600> first<00:01:07.810> four

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
kit through them you know the first four

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.050 
kit through them you know the first four
or<00:01:08.320> five<00:01:08.470> patches<00:01:09.040> come<00:01:09.189> out<00:01:09.280> just<00:01:09.490> black<00:01:09.850> and

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
or five patches come out just black and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.810 
or five patches come out just black and
then<00:01:10.420> boom<00:01:11.259> they<00:01:11.470> start<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.799> come<00:01:12.189> light<00:01:12.580> gray

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
then boom they start to come light gray

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.929 
then boom they start to come light gray
and<00:01:12.850> then<00:01:13.119> boom<00:01:13.540> you're<00:01:13.780> done<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.939> absolutely

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
and then boom you're done so absolutely

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.270 
and then boom you're done so absolutely
in<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.330> worse<00:01:16.479> case<00:01:16.720> no<00:01:17.350> acts<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.710> improvement

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
in a worse case no acts of improvement

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.520 
in a worse case no acts of improvement
but<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:18.820> does<00:01:18.939> help<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.810> short<00:01:20.409> in<00:01:20.470> the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
but it does help the short in the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.880 
but it does help the short in the
cleaning<00:01:20.829> time<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:21.790> it<00:01:22.409> basically<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.740> is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
cleaning time so it basically it is

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.440 
cleaning time so it basically it is
doing<00:01:24.220> sidings<00:01:24.579> basically<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.000> smoothing<00:01:25.270> out

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
doing sidings basically is smoothing out

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.350 
doing sidings basically is smoothing out
your<00:01:25.509> boar<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.250> I<00:01:27.280> bought<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:27.729> kit<00:01:27.970> here<00:01:28.150> this

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
your boar so I bought this kit here this

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.480 
your boar so I bought this kit here this
is<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.659> bought<00:01:28.990> for<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.320> two<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.680> three<00:01:29.920> wild

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
is I bought for the two to three wild

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.850 
is I bought for the two to three wild
build<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.299> I<00:01:31.390> just<00:01:31.570> put<00:01:31.780> together<00:01:31.960> I've

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
build that I just put together I've

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
build that I just put together I've
rebuilt<00:01:33.790> that<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.590> was<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:35.770> few<00:01:35.950> things<00:01:36.159> that<00:01:36.369> I

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
rebuilt that it was a few things that I

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960 
rebuilt that it was a few things that I
had<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.810> know<00:01:38.280> weren't<00:01:39.280> quite<00:01:39.490> right<00:01:39.700> so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
had you know weren't quite right so

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.730 
had you know weren't quite right so
fixed<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.509> I<00:01:40.780> figure<00:01:40.990> what<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.320> process

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
fixed that and I figure what the process

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.219 
fixed that and I figure what the process
because<00:01:42.430> why<00:01:42.579> I<00:01:42.610> did<00:01:42.970> clean<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.329> after<00:01:44.200> I

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
because why I did clean it after I

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.770 
because why I did clean it after I
firing<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.130> was<00:01:45.640> some<00:01:45.790> copper<00:01:46.060> fouling<00:01:46.420> so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
firing it it was some copper fouling so

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.959 
firing it it was some copper fouling so
figure<00:01:46.990> well<00:01:47.189> worst<00:01:48.189> case<00:01:48.399> this<00:01:48.640> will<00:01:48.790> help

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
figure well worst case this will help

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.929 
figure well worst case this will help
the<00:01:49.630> cleaning<00:01:50.049> process<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.850> possibly<00:01:51.850> even

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
the cleaning process and possibly even

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.969 
the cleaning process and possibly even
maybe<00:01:52.329> tighten<00:01:52.630> up<00:01:52.750> some<00:01:52.899> groups<00:01:53.170> make<00:01:53.469> you

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
maybe tighten up some groups make you

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.380 
maybe tighten up some groups make you
know<00:01:54.070> if<00:01:54.189> there's<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.460> burr<00:01:54.670> on<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.969> crown<00:01:55.210> that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
know if there's a burr on the crown that

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.840 
know if there's a burr on the crown that
I<00:01:55.450> missed<00:01:55.719> or<00:01:55.899> something<00:01:56.170> like<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
I missed or something like that so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.209 
I missed or something like that so
basically<00:01:58.000> what<00:01:58.299> you<00:01:58.420> do<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:59.079> love<00:01:59.829> this<00:02:00.009> as

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
you would any other normal projectile

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.719 
you would any other normal projectile
you<00:02:01.810> start<00:02:02.049> with<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.259> first<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:02.979> first<00:02:03.250> want

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
you start with this first you first want

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.149 
you start with this first you first want
to<00:02:03.820> clean<00:02:04.000> your<00:02:04.090> barrel<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:05.530> run<00:02:05.710> these<00:02:05.860> ten

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
to clean your barrel you run these ten

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.800 
to clean your barrel you run these ten
through<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.939> clean<00:02:07.210> your<00:02:07.329> barrel<00:02:07.600> make

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
through and you clean your barrel make

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.210 
through and you clean your barrel make
sure<00:02:07.930> that<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.140> get<00:02:08.259> everything<00:02:08.680> in<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.130> know

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
sure that you get everything in you know

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.310 
sure that you get everything in you know
as<00:02:09.369> much<00:02:09.550> as<00:02:09.610> clean<00:02:10.030> as<00:02:10.120> possible<00:02:10.510> I<00:02:10.540> guess<00:02:10.690> and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
as much as clean as possible I guess and

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.950 
as much as clean as possible I guess and
then<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:12.010> run<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.400> next<00:02:12.610> ten<00:02:12.960> clean

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
then you just run the next ten clean

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.030 
then you just run the next ten clean
again<00:02:14.170> next<00:02:14.740> ten

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
again next ten

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.820 
again next ten
and<00:02:15.189> you<00:02:15.370> know<00:02:15.459> your<00:02:15.640> repeat<00:02:16.180> until<00:02:16.330> your

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
and you know your repeat until your

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.429 
and you know your repeat until your
completed<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:19.269> basically<00:02:19.510> want<00:02:19.689> to<00:02:19.780> load<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
completed you basically want to load the

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.720 
completed you basically want to load the
like<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.650> said<00:02:20.890> load<00:02:21.069> these<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.400> any<00:02:21.579> other

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
like I said load these like any other

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.670 
like I said load these like any other
normal<00:02:21.939> round<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:23.049> want<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.260> load<00:02:23.379> it<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
normal round you want to load it on the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.440 
normal round you want to load it on the
low<00:02:23.799> side<00:02:24.010> I'm<00:02:24.400> going<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.730> take<00:02:24.939> basically<00:02:25.299> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
low side I'm going to take basically the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.059 
low side I'm going to take basically the
minimum<00:02:25.599> load<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.230> drop<00:02:26.439> it<00:02:26.590> five<00:02:26.860> ten

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
minimum load and drop it five ten

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.319 
minimum load and drop it five ten
percent<00:02:27.400> something<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.790> range<00:02:27.909> make<00:02:28.180> it

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
percent something in that range make it

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.559 
percent something in that range make it
you<00:02:28.629> know<00:02:28.750> very<00:02:29.140> mild<00:02:29.379> load<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.239> supposed

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
you know very mild load that is supposed

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.539 
you know very mild load that is supposed
to<00:02:31.690> well<00:02:32.049> that's<00:02:32.409> in<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.890> instructions<00:02:33.370> that

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
to well that's in the instructions that

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.089 
to well that's in the instructions that
you<00:02:33.640> should<00:02:33.790> use<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.409> minimum<00:02:35.409> load<00:02:35.650> I'm<00:02:35.829> going

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
you should use a minimum load I'm going

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.699 
you should use a minimum load I'm going
to<00:02:36.159> take<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> minimum<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.269> then<00:02:37.360> minus<00:02:38.079> five<00:02:38.560> to

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
to take a minimum and then minus five to

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.160 
to take a minimum and then minus five to
ten<00:02:38.890> percent<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.569> what<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.930> it's

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
ten percent so this is what it is it's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.250 
ten percent so this is what it is it's
they<00:02:41.590> come<00:02:41.769> in<00:02:41.859> pretty<00:02:42.400> much<00:02:42.489> every<00:02:43.260> Wednesday

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
they come in pretty much every Wednesday

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.899 
they come in pretty much every Wednesday
but<00:02:44.379> pretty<00:02:44.890> much<00:02:44.950> every<00:02:45.310> calleb<00:02:45.609> I've<00:02:45.700> ever

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
but pretty much every calleb I've ever

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.240 
but pretty much every calleb I've ever
had<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.450> require<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.890> can<00:02:47.920> get<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.159> for

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
had to require you can get it for

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.210 
had to require you can get it for
pistols<00:02:48.640> rifles<00:02:49.590> I've<00:02:50.590> actually<00:02:50.769> used<00:02:50.980> this

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
pistols rifles I've actually used this

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.690 
pistols rifles I've actually used this
kit<00:02:51.900> kit<00:02:52.900> little<00:02:53.590> kid<00:02:53.739> back<00:02:53.920> there<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.129> ran<00:02:54.430> this

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
kit kit little kid back there I ran this

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.699 
kit kit little kid back there I ran this
this<00:02:55.120> previous<00:02:55.510> kit<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:56.019> was<00:02:56.139> also<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.409> two<00:02:56.590> to

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
this previous kit it was also a two to

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.979 
this previous kit it was also a two to
three<00:02:56.889> run<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.459> on<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.909> two<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.720> one

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
three run this on the two to one

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.410 
three run this on the two to one
fireball<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.799> it<00:02:59.980> seemed<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:00.970> make<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.150> bit<00:03:01.329> of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
fireball and it seemed to make a bit of

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.640 
fireball and it seemed to make a bit of
a<00:03:01.450> difference<00:03:01.720> thing<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.049> groups<00:03:02.290> got<00:03:02.470> more

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
a difference thing the groups got more

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.569 
a difference thing the groups got more
consistent<00:03:04.409> and<00:03:05.409> then<00:03:05.709> actually<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.489> I'm

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
consistent and then actually what I'm

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.879 
consistent and then actually what I'm
using<00:03:06.760> for<00:03:06.879> now<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.540> just<00:03:07.569> you<00:03:08.139> know<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.409> had<00:03:08.680> put

it actually demonstrates the actual
process<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.949> laughing<00:03:26.949> a<00:03:27.040> barrel<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:28.500> it's<00:03:29.500> in

process of laughing a barrel and it's in

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.409 
process of laughing a barrel and it's in
my<00:03:30.400> experience<00:03:30.879> it's<00:03:32.519> it's<00:03:33.519> helped<00:03:33.940> either

my experience it's it's helped either

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.339 
my experience it's it's helped either
with<00:03:34.900> accuracy<00:03:35.560> or<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:37.629> time<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:37.900> takes<00:03:38.139> to

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
with accuracy or the time it takes to

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.550 
with accuracy or the time it takes to
get<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.500> barrel<00:03:38.769> clean<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.989> I've<00:03:41.109> actually<00:03:41.230> had
