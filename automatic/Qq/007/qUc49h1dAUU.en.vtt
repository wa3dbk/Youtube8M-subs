00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 5 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 that where friends within a euro then 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.630
 well here in a video more in which you 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.050
 let's give a little review to what 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.150
 which is the 0.8 alpha came as antier 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.520
 other good antier we are going to achieve us 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.110
 well, I did not see it, the real ones 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.810
 he already knew how the real ones serve the 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.220
 guards serves what is the games of the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.720
 hungry and what is catch the flag 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.680
 nazi but good directions are the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 I leave in the video description already 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.180
 they know how to get in good which still 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.610
 I have not tested well I do not know how to 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.170
 play this thing good if I know how it 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.629
 play but I do not know how this starts 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.540
 so well this does not matter to us 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.970
 now and well , you know how to enter 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.700
 to one of these types of servers 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.580
 we give ndic externan and here we put the 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.050
 what their what we left them in the 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.580
 description of the video not for each one 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.489
 well let's enter this world of 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.410
 texture and then it does not bring anything new not in 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.800
 if everything that came previously well 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.170
 it's just like that and not a ball nothing new 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.100
 until now one thing I saw good 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.390
 something new 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.270
 well this lens has nothing to do 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.500
 I do it but not simply because I said 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.090
 and the rider already exploits it 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.719
 they agreed to give me a ship that I did not 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.719
 exploited the tnt 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.850
 the dolls are still the same you go up and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.490
 normal forward leaves you the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.690
 little arrow that is not a book and I'm not 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.580
 saying it's a book because the time 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.810
 Last I said let the little arrow 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.920
 later missions that is not a book 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.830
 Well, I never said it was a book 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.150
 simply that it was something new and 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.270
 good from there to there everything follows 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.150
 being as it is not paints the bed 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.909
 the animals that already mate in each 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.100
 one of the plants 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.920
 and then all the materials do not 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.770
 zombies the spiders think so 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.600
 well also all this here not to see in 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.020
 the inventory because I did not find anything 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.020
 new 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.900
 nothing new here, no, well, one of the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.700
 things that I do think that many stop being 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.680
 bothered this little ship bring 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.020
 now when you write you do not see there 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.150
 learn the s I give him gift and as you see if 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.490
 it was written but you do not notice there is no longer what 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.110
 I deleted I give him gift and he takes off the s is not 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.730
 here where is my name they realize 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.260
 you write but you can not see but if you 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.780
 write I do not know if you write but do not know 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.330
 comes to see is a loop because if it bothers 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.310
 not good in my device happens we're going to 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.140
 enter are blogs and other things 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.370
 I do not know if you are also 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.640
 changed good here we are in world mode 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 today 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.090
 one of the good things seen say 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.130
 general and very good generator can 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.050
 be that is a little surprise that they 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.459
 I had and this I added it with the little 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.660
 of immediate as with the lava there 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.360
 and he washes them and answers them from cows because 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.220
 you added it is to try the the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.900
 generator so I'm going to remove it in 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.010
 the series is not going to be and good 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.480
 one of the things that I am going to show you 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.730
 it's true I do not remember and I the truth 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.560
 break the armor I do not know if I read a 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.110
 new again touch the armor or so and 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.940
 I was coming but I do not know if I touched the attitude in 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.209
 everything has changed everything 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.010
 totally there from zero points 7.6 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.100
 until 0.8 everything has changed 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.660
 totally and nothing but I like them 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.480
 I say I did not find anything new in itself 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.239
 it's still all many have 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.850
 asked also today how is believed 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.950
 aftea this here the folders good 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.600
 here it is called folders but they are this 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.350
 rugs so to speak here where 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.350
 we live like that is called 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.920
 how it changes color I do not know if I'm 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.209
 to change like the sheep I do not know if 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.000
 they remember that the sheep when they 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.769
 Touches change color with another color 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.959
 different if the pints do not sit 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.730
 well the rugs are going to change 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.590
 touching them with other colors or still 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.480
 they have not totally added all of them 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.519
 but good guys themselves as I say 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.519
 they have not added anything new you know 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.349
 that simply because I brought them the 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.970
 review of all the versions 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.680
 which you can then keep bringing what 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.720
 same the previous relationships and 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.220
 some little books that brought you another 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.120
 time they were not in the other 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.260
 versions and practically that would be all 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.020
 I also want to use this video not 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.970
 let's forgive, let me forgive 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.280
 in minimizing the soft 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.350

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.020
