00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 everyone as a pleasure to receive them from 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.250
 new in the kitchen wide awake let's go 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.080
 to make meat cannelloni ham and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.420
 cheese let's mix the two let's 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
 do together for what happens one when 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.460
 talk about cannelloni and more in this country 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:32.269
 we talk about doing it with that with soy 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:32.269
 like the six states 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.180
 do not tell him that he said to silvia 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:44.710
 novarese I am a marianita of course 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.710
 but good 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:56.620
 clear one of the most drastic please 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.320
 actually this is false this is a 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.440
 a matter of time the cannelloni the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.460
 true cannelloni or cannelloni dough and 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.830
 I got you as they say in Italy 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.780
 also the tubes to fill and 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.220
 come soon it is made with dough a kilo 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.500
 of flour of 10 games that is an egg 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.479
 every 100 grams of flour is true 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.200
 a much more consistent dough is boiled 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.940
 first it goes through cold water it is cut 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.560
 the cooking wraps the channels and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.840
 after finishing the oven this is a 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.520
 practical matter a deformation of the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.899
 recipe that we did the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.340
 Uruguayans but keep in mind that the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.340
 true channel 11 does with that mass 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.069
 there then the little secret of this what 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.659
 good is to have a good white sauce or 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.090
 Bechamel sauce with him 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.759
 in a container suitable for oven as in 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.840
 this case I have this little plate that 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.939
 I put white sauce underneath like that and 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.100
 I'm going to put a good range that is a good 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.049
 raul or what we would call a 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.590
 little bit of minced meat the truth that 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.780
 because the tail holds everyone 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.310
 ask that because in reality all 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.429
 these recipes are from formations 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.420
 European that we adapt this is 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.220
 a raul is minced meat very cooked or 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.650
 it takes 45 minutes of cooking 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.170
 approximately with tomato and vegetables 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.930
 very good of course this is also what 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.020
 we put here come this way then 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.600
 we are like a mattress there 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.970
 we leave it here and finish the filling 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.800
 let's also put a little bit of 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.670
 white sauce here so it does not look too 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.830
 very dry in the cannelloni 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.410
 and we are going to add the meat filling 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.989
 chopped here if there are several variants 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.120
 There are those who like a little sweet and you 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.690
 add raisin there is a payment not 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.870
 so perfect negative equal then you 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.690
 we put the meat filling to the section 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.390
 I do not like GastÃ³n this day you spend 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.100
 of grapes raisins none of their 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.140
 good variants but in this case not 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.750
 has nothing to do with it, that's why we put 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.600
 cheese and ham 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.150
 this mozzarella cheese this is look for ela 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.660
 and sandwich cheese in two years and 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.730
 Now let's wrap and see 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.230
 if you want to cut the ends I in this 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.030
 case I do not want to cut the ends what 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.810
 I want to do is grab the little fountain and 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.240
 put my cannelloni here come and then 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.860
 when I put the cannelloni together 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.230
 I think three and one more will come in 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.580
 three here tight I'm going to put 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.560
 more white sauce and more ragu of this or 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.900
 tuco of minced meat then later to 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.940
 norm that that grated and when the that 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.550
 it is well golden above it is already 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.290
 soon the cannelloni to be consumed 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.300
 continue cooking for you here with us 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.660

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.660

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.860
 Mary Jesus - before we go where we 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.770
 we go until moments like this is this come 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.130
 at the beginning of cannelloni you put the 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.680
 white sauce then being up 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.690
 is there is now value not how much and until 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.250
 brown the cheese well well browned because 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.080
 I'm adding right now I'm telling you 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.120
