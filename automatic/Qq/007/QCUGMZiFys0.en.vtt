00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
at the difference and they can become

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520 
at the difference and they can become
plugged<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> when<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.380> will

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the engine will just quit the problem is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
the engine will just quit the problem is
that<00:00:39.690> these<00:00:39.870> screens<00:00:40.440> are<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.829> easy<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
threads in this screen a lot of times

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.979 
threads in this screen a lot of times
just<00:00:52.800> by<00:00:52.949> removing<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.610> hose<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.660> get

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
just by removing the hose you can get

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.450 
just by removing the hose you can get
the<00:00:55.110> screen<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.590> come<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.980> at<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> same<00:00:56.250> time

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the screen to come out at the same time

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.180 
the screen to come out at the same time
but<00:00:57.390> sometimes<00:00:57.930> you'll<00:00:58.170> pull<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.620> hose<00:00:58.890> out

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
but sometimes you'll pull this hose out

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.970 
but sometimes you'll pull this hose out
and<00:00:59.480> there's<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.629> screen<00:01:01.079> stuck<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> bottom

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and there's a screen stuck in the bottom

and there's a screen stuck in the bottom
of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> tank<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.609> without<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> proper<00:01:03.809> tool

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
of the tank and without the proper tool

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.929 
of the tank and without the proper tool
it's<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:05.309> difficult<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> about

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it's very difficult to get out so about

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
it's very difficult to get out so about
five<00:01:09.360> or<00:01:09.570> six<00:01:09.689> years<00:01:09.960> ago<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.229> decided<00:01:10.530> okay

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
five or six years ago I decided okay

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
five or six years ago I decided okay
it's<00:01:11.010> time<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.580> make<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> tool<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.360> makes<00:01:12.540> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it's time to make a tool that makes it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.039 
it's time to make a tool that makes it
easy<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.409> our<00:01:14.310> customers<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.360> remove<00:01:15.750> this

right here let me show you this in

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
right here let me show you this in
detail<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> size<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
detail you can see from the size of the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.510 
detail you can see from the size of the
screen<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> takes<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.680> rather<00:01:23.009> large

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
screen that it takes a rather large

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.690 
screen that it takes a rather large
socket<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.210> talking<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.869> big<00:01:25.409> socket<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
socket and I'm talking a big socket the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
socket and I'm talking a big socket the
problem<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.299> most<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.720> these<00:01:27.840> big<00:01:28.140> sockets

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
problem with most of these big sockets

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770 
problem with most of these big sockets
is<00:01:28.799> they're<00:01:29.100> three<00:01:29.520> quarter<00:01:29.880> inch<00:01:30.000> drive<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
is they're three quarter inch drive and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.390 
is they're three quarter inch drive and
that<00:01:30.810> requires<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.159> go<00:01:32.310> out

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that requires that you have to go out

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.690 
that requires that you have to go out
and<00:01:32.549> buy<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> 3/4<00:01:33.360> inch<00:01:33.740> ratchet<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.130> extension

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and buy a 3/4 inch ratchet or extension

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
and buy a 3/4 inch ratchet or extension
and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.030> there's<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> limited<00:01:36.869> amount<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
and then there's a limited amount of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.620 
and then there's a limited amount of
space<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:38.009> work<00:01:38.159> above<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> axles<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
space to work above the axles to get the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.960 
space to work above the axles to get the
screen<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.130> I've<00:01:41.280> done<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.729> I've

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
screen out so what I've done is I've

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.039 
screen out so what I've done is I've
come<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.740> welded<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.920> 17<00:01:44.909> millimeter<00:01:45.659> bolt

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
come in and welded a 17 millimeter bolt

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.770 
come in and welded a 17 millimeter bolt
to<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> top<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> socket<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.479> will

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to the top of the socket which will

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.010 
to the top of the socket which will
allow<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.860> use<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.430> smaller<00:01:50.909> wrench<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.780> get

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
allow you to use a smaller wrench to get

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.100 
allow you to use a smaller wrench to get
up<00:01:52.140> underneath<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.950> rear<00:01:53.579> axle<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.210> to
