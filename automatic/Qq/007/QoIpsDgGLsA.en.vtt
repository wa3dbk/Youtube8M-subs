00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
yeah I have had an opportunity to test

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.010 
yeah I have had an opportunity to test
the<00:00:15.930> view<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.139> DMT<00:00:16.610> dye<00:00:17.610> spray<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.240> if<00:00:18.869> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the view of DMT dye spray and if I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.689 
the view of DMT dye spray and if I
should<00:00:19.080> found<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> results<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> be<00:00:20.070> very

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
should found the results to be very

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.679 
should found the results to be very
promising<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.949> DMT<00:00:23.699> dye<00:00:23.910> spray<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.509> a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
promising the the DMT dye spray is a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.339 
promising the the DMT dye spray is a
half<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.349> micron<00:00:26.390> in<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.509> diamond<00:00:27.839> suspension

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
half a micron in a diamond suspension

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.950 
half a micron in a diamond suspension
and<00:00:28.589> you<00:00:28.679> just<00:00:28.830> spray<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.900> spray<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and you just spray it on to spray it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
and you just spray it on to spray it
onto<00:00:31.109> your<00:00:31.380> surface<00:00:31.560> I've<00:00:32.340> got<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:32.820> surfaces

onto your surface I've got two surfaces

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.100 
onto your surface I've got two surfaces
here<00:00:33.860> that<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> recommend<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.930> spray

block of hard maple

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.930 
block of hard maple
I<00:00:47.579> also<00:00:48.420> spray<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.800> MDF<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> have

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I also spray it on to MDF if you have

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.299 
I also spray it on to MDF if you have
that<00:00:51.120> available<00:00:51.649> for<00:00:52.649> knives<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.980> typically

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that available for knives that typically

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.450 
that available for knives that typically
do<00:00:53.550> recommend<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.239> leather<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> really

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
do recommend the leather so you really

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790 
do recommend the leather so you really
just<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.449> spray<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.930> onto<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
just you just spray it on onto the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.119 
just you just spray it on onto the
surface<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:04.019> pull<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
surface and and really just pull the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.240 
surface and and really just pull the
knife<00:01:05.280> across<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.660> would<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.740> leather

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
knife across as you would a leather

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.770 
knife across as you would a leather
strop<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.540> didn't<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:12.600> Daiya

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
strop if it didn't have the the Daiya

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.670 
strop if it didn't have the the Daiya
spray<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.320> there

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
spray on there

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
spray on there
and<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:14.130> it'll<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:16.520> really<00:01:17.520> refine

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and what it'll do is just really refine

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.230 
and what it'll do is just really refine
that<00:01:18.600> edge<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:19.080> quickly<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> would<00:01:21.030> just

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
that edge more quickly and it would just

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.469 
that edge more quickly and it would just
be<00:01:21.329> with<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> leather<00:01:21.780> by<00:01:22.020> itself<00:01:23.270> if<00:01:24.270> you're

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
be with the leather by itself if you're

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
be with the leather by itself if you're
a<00:01:24.540> woodworker<00:01:25.340> you're<00:01:26.340> gonna<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:27.030> know<00:01:27.119> have

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
a woodworker you're gonna you know have

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.679 
a woodworker you're gonna you know have
access<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.619> maple<00:01:29.310> block<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.450> make

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
access to a maple block or you just make

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.889 
access to a maple block or you just make
on<00:01:31.520> again<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.880> been<00:01:33.180> sprayed<00:01:33.509> right<00:01:33.689> on

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
on again you just been sprayed right on

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.830 
on again you just been sprayed right on
to<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.320> right<00:01:35.070> onto<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> surface<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.600> then

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to the right onto the surface and then

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.120 
to the right onto the surface and then
you<00:01:36.869> would<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.500> much<00:01:37.649> like<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.890> would<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you would use that much like you would a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.210 
you would use that much like you would a
sharpening<00:01:38.549> stone<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> chisel

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
sharpening stone and I have a chisel

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
sharpening stone and I have a chisel
here<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:42.090> you're<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.270> gonna<00:01:42.420> pull<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
here so you're just gonna pull that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.240 
here so you're just gonna pull that
across<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> push<00:01:44.040> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
across you're not going to push it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.920 
across you're not going to push it
you're<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.880> push<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.689> it's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you're not gonna push it on because it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
you're not gonna push it on because it's
going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> cut<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.470> into<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> into<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
going to cut right into the into the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.200 
going to cut right into the into the
wood<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.270> acts<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:50.210> sharpening

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
wood it acts just like a sharpening

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.999 
wood it acts just like a sharpening
stone<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.869> very<00:01:52.140> very<00:01:52.409> fine<00:01:52.680> so

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
stone that would be very very fine so

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
stone that would be very very fine so
basically<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.250> did<00:01:56.369> what<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.869> my

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
basically what did what I in my

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.289 
basically what did what I in my
experience<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.799> done<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.189> you<00:02:00.180> know

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
experience what it's done is you know

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.620 
experience what it's done is you know
both<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.289> know<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> leather<00:02:01.740> strap<00:02:02.039> will<00:02:02.219> be

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
both you know the leather strap will be

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.649 
both you know the leather strap will be
sharpened<00:02:04.430> chopper<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.579> quite<00:02:05.759> quite<00:02:06.390> fine

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
sharpened chopper not quite quite fine

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.350 
sharpened chopper not quite quite fine
but<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.920> Dyess<00:02:08.160> prey<00:02:08.430> makes<00:02:09.180> that

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
but really the the Dyess prey makes that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.690 
but really the the Dyess prey makes that
process<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.380> lot<00:02:10.590> quicker

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
process go a lot quicker

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.580 
process go a lot quicker
that's<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.599> advantage<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.410> have

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that's that is the advantage that I have

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:23.540
