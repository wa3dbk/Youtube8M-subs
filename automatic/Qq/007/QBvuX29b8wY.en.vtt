what memory is whereas you know
internal<00:03:41.069> memory<00:03:41.370> they<00:03:41.519> call<00:03:41.729> it<00:03:41.819> SD<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.540> then

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
internal memory they call it SD and then

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.360 
internal memory they call it SD and then
they<00:03:42.780> call<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.079> SD<00:03:43.409> external<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.190> that's

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
they call the SD external so that's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.599 
they call the SD external so that's
sometimes<00:03:44.609> confusing<00:03:45.829> but<00:03:46.829> I'm<00:03:47.099> seeing<00:03:47.489> that

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
sometimes confusing but I'm seeing that

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.860 
sometimes confusing but I'm seeing that
there<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.229> a<00:03:49.639> 512<00:03:50.639> for<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.329> base<00:03:51.540> part

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
there is a 512 for like the base part

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.930 
there is a 512 for like the base part
and<00:03:52.049> then<00:03:52.229> there's<00:03:52.409> like<00:03:52.560> another<00:03:53.010> two<00:03:53.790> to

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
and then there's like another two to

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.269 
worked out absolutely fine again there's
a<00:05:42.180> couple<00:05:42.360> of<00:05:42.539> goofy<00:05:42.900> apps<00:05:43.139> that<00:05:43.770> they<00:05:43.919> put<00:05:44.159> in

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
a couple of goofy apps that they put in

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.219 
a couple of goofy apps that they put in
like<00:05:44.460> for<00:05:44.639> example<00:05:44.729> they<00:05:45.120> have<00:05:45.270> video<00:05:45.599> because

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
like for example they have video because

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.079 
like for example they have video because
they<00:05:46.349> couldn't<00:05:46.620> put<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:47.490> Google<00:05:47.849> video

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
they couldn't put the Google video

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:49.790 
they couldn't put the Google video
because<00:05:48.479> you<00:05:48.750> can't<00:05:48.990> use<00:05:49.139> a<00:05:49.169> Google<00:05:49.560> video

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
because you can't use a Google video

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.680 
because you can't use a Google video
outside<00:05:50.039> in<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.490> United<00:05:50.789> States<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.330> they<00:05:51.479> did

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
outside in the United States so they did

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.040 
outside in the United States so they did
that

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
that

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.050 
that
but<00:05:52.440> luckily<00:05:52.650> because<00:05:53.219> this<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.639> Ice<00:05:53.789> Cream

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
but luckily because this is Ice Cream

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.510 
but luckily because this is Ice Cream

was<00:06:10.259> able<00:06:10.469> to<00:06:10.650> load<00:06:10.979> as<00:06:11.159> I<00:06:11.279> said

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
was able to load as I said

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.990 
was able to load as I said
Google's<00:06:12.689> music<00:06:13.110> player<00:06:13.409> and<00:06:13.860> then<00:06:14.819> of<00:06:14.939> course

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
Google's music player and then of course

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.640 
Google's music player and then of course
I<00:06:15.210> had<00:06:15.330> all<00:06:15.449> my<00:06:15.479> there's<00:06:16.020> all<00:06:16.169> my<00:06:16.289> stuff<00:06:16.500> that's

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
I had all my there's all my stuff that's

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.800 
I had all my there's all my stuff that's
already<00:06:16.860> loaded<00:06:17.430> again<00:06:17.819> so<00:06:18.060> it's<00:06:18.509> actually

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
already loaded again so it's actually

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.179 
already loaded again so it's actually
not<00:06:18.960> on<00:06:19.139> the<00:06:19.229> tablet<00:06:19.589> and<00:06:19.680> I<00:06:19.710> think<00:06:19.919> that<00:06:20.039> that

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
not on the tablet and I think that that

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.909 
not on the tablet and I think that that
again<00:06:20.839> lends<00:06:21.839> itself<00:06:22.169> very<00:06:22.289> well<00:06:22.500> to<00:06:22.680> this

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
again lends itself very well to this

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.769 
again lends itself very well to this
because<00:06:23.219> we<00:06:23.339> remember<00:06:23.580> that<00:06:24.210> means<00:06:24.419> I<00:06:24.509> don't

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779 
because we remember that means I don't

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:28.879 
because we remember that means I don't
actually<00:06:25.020> have<00:06:25.379> to<00:06:25.439> load<00:06:26.779> my<00:06:27.779> songs<00:06:28.139> on<00:06:28.469> this
