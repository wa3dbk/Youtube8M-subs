00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.589
 the motorola family of mobile phones 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.000
 now has representatives in all 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.700
 categories 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.820
 the first was the moto x an appliance 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.750
 high performance soon after the bike came 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.000
 g to occupy the intermediate category 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.340
 now it's time for the bike and show that 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.339
 can dominate the category of 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.770
 input 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.990
 the design of the three appliances is similar 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.490
 but with fundamental differences in 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.910
 structure 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.080
 the screen increases 0.2 inch of a model 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.470
 To the other 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.780
 the smallest of all is the bike and the others 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.660
 two are almost the same size as 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.480
 difference is that the ratio of the screen to 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:57.130
 the carcass is best used on the bike 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.640
 x oea and g has practically the same 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.340
 thickness while x is thinner in the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.240
 part of the screen can also separate the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.490
 position of the speakers is the only 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.740
 splash proof of the three because it 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.960
 has metal bars protecting the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.359
 microphone and speaker 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.840
 the three appliances have rear with 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.079
 curved shape and micro usb input 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.539
 below can not have the battery 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.939
 removed but now can have the 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.429
 rear casing replaced by another 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.630
 of different color this characteristic 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:38.170
 leaves the x looking much more solid 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.270
 the bike and the GT have the same weight 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.909
 since x is the lightest of all the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.359
 Screen resolutions are also different 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.270
 which guarantees a pixel density 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:54.549
 particularly the gas has the highest density 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.460
 pixels per inch between the three 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.789
 models since the screen of x is larger 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.999
 physically but there is another factor that 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:07.749
 can influence image quality 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:09.789
 the display technology the bike is the most 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.820
 simple of all so he works 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.970
 with the lcd panel with less brightness 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:20.110
 and lower contrast between colors 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.470
 the bike geosar an ips lcd panel 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.160
 which ensures better color and brightness 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.630
 moto x already works with amoled 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.240
 The most common technology is the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.070
 samsung and known for showing colors 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.960
 with more contrast 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.540
 as both have excellent quality 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.720
 visual this leaves them in a tie 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.720
 technician 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.800
 the three appliances belong to categories 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.190
 different and naturally has a 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.220
 hardware but all are any 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.830
 as expected x leads with hardware 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.650
 more gracious followed by the moto gp and 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.380
 leaving the last place 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.750
 the surprise comes with the comparison of 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.660
 devices all use android 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.080
 kitkat in its purest version what 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.270
 ensures good performance for everyone when 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.330
 placed side by side we have a 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.740
 quite similar performance 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.400
 mainly in simple application 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.410
 messengers and social networks is fast 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.769
 execute and switch between programs 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.200
 in all three 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.540
 it is clear that the balance tends to weigh 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.910
 the most powerful hardware side in the case 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.670
 heavier applications 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.340
 An example of this are programs 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.980
 they need a lot of memory that they leave 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.560
 best on the bike x because of the 2 gb of 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:49.540
 talking about optional radio and 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.640
 television the g only radio already x not 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.030
 have none of these features 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.090
 storage is an important 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.269
 be discussed and in that case it ends up 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.610
 right behind your big brothers 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.610
 The advantage is that it has a slot for 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.070
 memory card the only problem is that 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.640
 can not install apps on card 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.920
 only save pictures and music 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.989
 this makes it necessary to manage 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.259
 better what is installed on the device 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.870
 The camera of the x motorcycle wins easy from your 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.669
 two younger brothers since he is the most 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.310
 power of this line 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.360
 it offers many exclusive features 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.349
 As auto focus flash led and hdr 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.240
 in addition an exclusive technology 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:42.419
 ensures that the 10-megapixel sensor 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.120
 can work with larger pixels 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.949
 This increases light detection and ensures 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.960
 more vivid colors 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.930
 it is also capable of recording videos in 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.419
 full hd quality 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.509
 both the bike and moto gp in cameras 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.310
 of 5 megapixels but that does not mean 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.610
 that they are the same 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.520
 to start the gt camera has focus 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.490
 automatic HD movie and has many 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.069
 other resources while working and working 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.009
 with fixed focus recording only low 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.710
 definition and is quite limited 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:20.729
 the is the only one that has no front camera 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.240
 like his older brothers the three 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.159
 handsets have 3g connectivity like motorbike 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.340
 gp just won versions with the 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:31.680
 support for 4g and became the only 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.070
 without this technology 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.919
 in case of iff today and it's in 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.659
 almost all features but are behind 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.509
 the x that can offer 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:45.509
 compatibility with band album life 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:48.150
 the three models have groups but only 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:51.090
 oea and g are supported for two 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.990
 chips yes what makes them more appliances 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.090
 versatile the gps of the three also at the same 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.000
 with support for the most 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.800
 advanced 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.270
 wondered which of these 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.770
 appliances is the best 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.560
 at first you could 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.020
 tell it is the bike x clear it has more 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.219
 resources but it is not quite what 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.740
 the power of each device is 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:20.159
 what he can do with what he has and 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.430
 especially for what it costs in the case of 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:26.069
 moto x yes it has more powerful hardware 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.570
 but it costs a lot more than your brothers 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.330
 minors 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.500
 the average price for motorcycle x is one thousand and 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.760
 one hundred reais 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.850
 already the bike 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.720
 can be found for about 650 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.080
 real 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.800
 the bike and is the most in everyone's account 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.700
 The model without TV can be purchased by 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.240
 530 reais 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.870
 so we have a powerful device one 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.720
 cost effective and an inexpensive model 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.510
 in this fight will get the one that most 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.610
 will meet your needs 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.710
 It's no use wanting to save money if you 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.820
 you need robust hardware and 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.280
 same way 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.140
 no use investing in a more top model 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.890
 if you use the device only for 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.990
 basic tasks to complete the best 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.220
 device is one that combines more with 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.590
 you 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.560
 be sure to check out the full review 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:23.030
 of all these devices in the world and 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.030
 until our next video
