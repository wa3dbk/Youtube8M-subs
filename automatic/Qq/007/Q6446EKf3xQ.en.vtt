off<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.450> would<00:02:40.570> be<00:02:40.690> short<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.950> you

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
off and it would be short and just you

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.390 
off and it would be short and just you
know<00:02:42.579> messed<00:02:43.239> up<00:02:43.510> like<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.230> was<00:02:44.260> when<00:02:44.829> I<00:02:45.070> had

but<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:05.769> at<00:03:05.980> times<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.640> know<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.880> course<00:03:07.120> it

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
but just at times you know of course it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.660 
but just at times you know of course it
gets<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.200> little<00:03:08.380> bit<00:03:08.650> dumb

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
gets a little bit dumb

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.480 
gets a little bit dumb
I<00:03:10.020> guess<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.140> know<00:03:11.500> unless<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.770> wash<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.400> and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
I guess you know unless you wash it and

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.729 
I guess you know unless you wash it and
it<00:03:12.610> takes<00:03:12.819> a<00:03:13.000> lot<00:03:13.240> of<00:03:13.270> time<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:14.080> that's<00:03:14.530> not

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
it takes a lot of time and that's not

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.839 
it takes a lot of time and that's not
the<00:03:14.800> other<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:17.620> can<00:03:18.220> get<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.430> little<00:03:18.670> bit

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
the other it can get a little bit

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.089 
the other it can get a little bit
cumbersome<00:03:19.450> at<00:03:19.630> times<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:20.260> still<00:03:20.349> love<00:03:21.069> it

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
cumbersome at times I still love it
