and it came out wavy in the morning but

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.750 
and it came out wavy in the morning but
obviously<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.409> was<00:02:16.500> still<00:02:16.680> damp<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.340> wet<00:02:17.489> so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
it didn't come out as curly because the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.530 
it didn't come out as curly because the
water<00:02:20.099> was<00:02:20.280> shrugging<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.670> down<00:02:20.849> whatever<00:02:21.090> I
