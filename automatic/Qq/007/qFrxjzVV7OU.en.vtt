this<00:01:02.340> particular<00:01:03.210> area<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this particular area here this is the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.130 
this particular area here this is the
nipple<00:01:05.000> where<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> internal<00:01:06.720> manifold

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
nipple where the internal manifold

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.820 
nipple where the internal manifold
pressure<00:01:07.470> acts<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.570> manifold<00:01:10.530> pressure

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
pressure acts and that manifold pressure

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.760 
pressure acts and that manifold pressure
pulls<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.299> piston<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.260> housed<00:01:13.470> in

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
pulls on a piston which is housed in

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120 
pulls on a piston which is housed in
here<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.520> piston<00:01:14.939> Rises<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:16.650> there's<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
here the piston Rises when there's a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.940 
here the piston Rises when there's a
negative<00:01:17.700> manifold<00:01:18.540> pressure<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.500> sucked

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
negative manifold pressure it's sucked

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
negative manifold pressure it's sucked
up<00:01:20.220> basically<00:01:20.909> sucked<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.750> area

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
up basically sucked up into this area

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
up basically sucked up into this area
here<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> resistance<00:01:23.580> against<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.240> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
here with the resistance against that is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
here with the resistance against that is
a<00:01:24.509> spring<00:01:24.990> through<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.439> against<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
a spring through just against that and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.969 
a spring through just against that and
to<00:01:26.909> tension<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> spring<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.990> bolt<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
to tension the spring is a bolt so that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
to tension the spring is a bolt so that
basically<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:30.180> more<00:01:30.360> attention<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
basically there more attention on the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
basically there more attention on the
bolt<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.590> more<00:01:31.770> tension<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> spring<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
bolt the more tension on the spring the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.260 
bolt the more tension on the spring the
more<00:01:33.600> vacuum<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.979> required<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.880> lift<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
more vacuum is required to lift the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.929 
more vacuum is required to lift the
piston<00:01:36.689> when<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> piston<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.770> lifted<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.520> will

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
piston when the piston is lifted it will

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.149 
piston when the piston is lifted it will
release<00:01:39.299> excess<00:01:40.079> boost<00:01:40.409> pressure<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
release excess boost pressure that you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.550 
release excess boost pressure that you
might<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.600> changed<00:01:42.930> gear<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
might have when you changed gear and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.760 
might have when you changed gear and
that<00:01:44.310> excess<00:01:44.700> boost<00:01:45.240> pressure<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:46.259> pass<00:01:46.500> by

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that excess boost pressure will pass by

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.340 
that excess boost pressure will pass by
the<00:01:46.829> piston<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.549> out<00:01:48.180> through<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.780> funnel

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the piston and out through the funnel

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.069 
the piston and out through the funnel
