00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.799
 it's really ugly this video thing that 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.459
 It came out on social networks and well, well, 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:18.340
 especially bean and well, this plane 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.430
 that crashed in the French Alps and 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.699
 we make a line 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.310
 chronological of what happened of the 41 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.769
 minutes of terror of what happened that day 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.169
 and well, we are reconstructing little to 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.120
 little until the time comes for this 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.579
 course video we also have 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.770
 information from a specialist in 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.350
 phones that details how good that 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.260
 a phone can be destroyed in a thousand 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.550
 pieces but if you can survive 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.289
 just the card the price is 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.989
 awesome the last rider the heat 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.149
 of the speed of impact everything but the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.539
 card if you can survive then that 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.489
 it is possible that this phone is 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.949
 cellular has been destroyed almost entirely 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.899
 and that just the unseen card 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.820
 that he had inside and that was what 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.400
 they recorded then that could belong 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.560
 exactly those last seconds do not 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.930
 then there I love you and talking 10 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.280
 hours the plane took off with 150 passengers 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.229
 on board 10 days the commander 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.060
 andriani blue beats that this young man be 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.820
 I have not had time to go to the bathroom before 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.290
 to take off he replies that when 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.170
 you want 1027 albion reached its altitude 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.590
 of cruise and beyond the three thousand 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.540
 800 feet the commander asks the vix 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.759
 verify that the plane can pass to 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.290
 Ãºbeda descent mode to repeat the 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.119
 commander for the second time 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.119
 you can go you can go now to the bathroom 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.250
 then the club comes out just and you 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.130
 you're alone in the saw cabin and the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.289
 armored door of the cabin now good 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.240
 It is impossible to open from the 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.550
 outside part then you hear it program 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.060
 manually the rate of descent 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.970
 to accelerate the and pass of three thousand 811 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.610
 thousand meters like that starts at 30 meters in 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.009
 a few minutes then 10 33 starts on 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.649
 descent and there the debacle begins on 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.290
 plane loses three thousand feet 900 meters of 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.930
 altitude per minute air control 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.330
 It deals with several occasions to contact 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.480
 the people on the plane by radio lubitsch 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.800
 and does not answer you hear the commander who 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.050
 try to open the door 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.530
 It's me there are several knocks at the door 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.420
 increasingly stronger no answer 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.220
 obviously the commander does not answer 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.540
 scream for the love of god open that 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.810
 Door 1034 sounds a first alarm 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.660
 sound is that it indicates that there is a fall 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.910
 important that it should be because they should be 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.040
 take precautions no reaction 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.420
 by lubitsch through the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.250
 cabin door you hear the first 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.950
 passengers get scared in seats 10 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.260
 35 the commander asks him to leave 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.910
 look good is a tool that 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.320
 had hidden in the back of the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.060
 apparatus sound stronger blows 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.030
 strong against the wall 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.880
 this is this recording they have it already 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.220
 the authorities just try to open 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.350
 the door does not succeed 1037 is activated 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.740
 a second alarm where it says earth 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.420
 well, it must be straightened either 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.480
 reacts to the place the commander shout 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.970
 open this damn door 1038 you hear the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.620
 lubitsch breathing under his 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.510
 oxygen mask obviously because 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.360
 they have already gone down they have already descended very fast 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.520
 they breathe normally the plane is at 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.060
 13,000 feet 4 thousand meters so that 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.000
 nothing 10 40 you hear a violent noise that 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.980
 proceeds abroad at that moment 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.990
 the interior screams the plane crashes 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.180
 against a mountain with the right wing not 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.590
 you hear no other sound than that of 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.280
 the alarms in the screams of the 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.020
 1041 passengers the plane hits the front 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.440
 against the French Alps 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.290
 so terrible then this line of 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.600
 time and good because now it is assumed that 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.360
 This video on this card that 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.980
 find now inside the remains 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.260
 good that cries are heard justly 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.660
 the people were very aware all the 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.640
 time until the crash 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.430
 life they suffered in all this time 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.620
 totally throughout the journey of 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.970
 descent and because you will remember that 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.980
 at first it had been said that the 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.270
 passengers do not know even noticed 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.920
 until the moment of the shock 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.709
 for me personally where it seems very 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.240
 difficult for a plane to go down so fast and 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.680
 that you do not realize that something is 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.510
 bad not and especially when you know you're going 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.760
 half-flight and they are also powered 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.530
 alarm so is we are talking about 41 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.600
 not tension minutes 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.580
 41 minutes that they began to occur 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.069
 notice that something was happening 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.020
 the 10-15 minutes trying to open the 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.729
 door of the plane until good 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.729
 until they lose their lives and until 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.229
 this subject is supposed to crash the 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.150
 airplane obviously there are many 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.120
 speculations already around this 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.840
 situation because it is much money I 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.870
 airline could also or not recognize 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.939
 that could have had an accident that 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.360
 were other failures is very easy 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:03.699
 also say no that the pilot had or the 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.889
 copilot was to blame for a depression 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.539
 So, well, this is coming out 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.849
 little by little now there is a video and 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.370
 surely the next days will come out 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.469
 more more data about it now 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.069
 imagine if this little chip could 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.840
 survive on a mobile device when you 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.340
 can insert our bodies good 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.840
 the identification of or not to arrive 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.389
 to that but the identification of bodies 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.580
 in any sense at airports like 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.409
 a security measure now calls me 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.240
 much attention because many of the 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.680
 devices that we use as 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.539
 our smartphones or in this case 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.129
 our tablets 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.139
 well, a lot of information, even 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.980
 when you steal your cell phone you 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.450
 comes the photo of the guy who stole you 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.760
 because obviously it goes up to the cloud and 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.560
 is totally connected I think it's going 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.500
 to have more information from people who 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.420
 recorded of people who support their phones 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.560
 even if it was destroyed maybe it was uploaded 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.120
 to the cloud so do a 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.340
 research they are already doing 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.440
 and well, it will be known for sure 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.070
 what happened because we continue 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.070
 slopes 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.259
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.259
 information with the following videos
