agents<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.909> shield<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> he's<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.869> one

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
agents of shield and he's just like one

agents of shield and he's just like one
of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> most<00:01:40.380> likely<00:01:40.710> candidates<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
of the most likely candidates the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
of the most likely candidates the
current<00:01:42.600> plot<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.899> agent<00:01:43.140> Carter<00:01:43.409> well<00:01:43.950> we

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
current plot and agent Carter well we

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.289 
current plot and agent Carter well we
actually<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.490> mean<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.700> don't<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.000> enough<00:01:45.149> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
actually I mean we don't know enough I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.850 
actually I mean we don't know enough I
think<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.899> way<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.170> explained<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
think the way they explained it in the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.039 
think the way they explained it in the
episode<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.939> there's<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.329> six<00:01:48.720> pieces

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
episode is that there's about six pieces

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
episode is that there's about six pieces
of<00:01:49.490> stark<00:01:50.490> Tech<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.829> formula<00:01:53.310> was

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
of stark Tech and that that formula was

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.819 
of stark Tech and that that formula was
just<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> them<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> think<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.409> is

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
just one of them so I think that that is

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.350 
just one of them so I think that that is
going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.060> chase

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
going to be the thing that they chase

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.389 
going to be the thing that they chase
around<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:58.020> those<00:01:58.200> different<00:01:58.710> things<00:01:58.979> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
around like those different things that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.420 
around like those different things that
got<00:01:59.549> stolen<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.259> Dominic<00:02:01.259> Cooper<00:02:01.380> isn't<00:02:02.009> in

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
got stolen so Dominic Cooper isn't in

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.940 
got stolen so Dominic Cooper isn't in
every<00:02:02.939> episode<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.689> not<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> big<00:02:04.770> way

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
every episode are not in like a big way

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
every episode are not in like a big way
it's<00:02:05.939> mostly<00:02:06.210> based<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.780> Peggy<00:02:07.049> Carter<00:02:07.259> so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it's mostly based on Peggy Carter so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.320 
it's mostly based on Peggy Carter so
when<00:02:07.950> he<00:02:08.069> said<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.459> gonna<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.789> Europe<00:02:09.149> and

to for Atlantis that doesn't mean

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.020

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I think universal might still have the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.520 
I think universal might still have the
rights<00:02:38.550> for<00:02:38.760> him<00:02:38.990> otherwise<00:02:39.990> like<00:02:40.350> they

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
rights for him otherwise like they

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.080 
rights for him otherwise like they

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
probably would have mentioned him in a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.750 
probably would have mentioned him in a
bigger<00:02:42.270> way<00:02:42.560> Agent<00:02:43.560> Coulson<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.950> director<00:02:44.400> get

the nitramene it was at stark labs so

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.240 
the nitramene it was at stark labs so
this<00:04:09.300> is<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:09.780> some<00:04:10.080> time<00:04:10.320> before<00:04:10.830> they<00:04:11.130> have

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
this is like some time before they have

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.070 
this is like some time before they have
their<00:04:11.370> falling<00:04:11.640> out<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.600> if<00:04:12.810> they<00:04:12.870> get<00:04:13.050> a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
their falling out and if they get a

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.590 
their falling out and if they get a
season<00:04:13.290> 2<00:04:13.700> maybe<00:04:14.700> they'll<00:04:14.940> explore<00:04:15.300> that<00:04:15.540> more

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
season 2 maybe they'll explore that more

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.560 
season 2 maybe they'll explore that more
but<00:04:16.230> i<00:04:16.410> don't<00:04:16.680> think<00:04:16.770> that<00:04:16.980> Vanko<00:04:17.460> is<00:04:18.270> going<00:04:18.510> to

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
but i don't think that Vanko is going to

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.780 
but i don't think that Vanko is going to
be<00:04:18.660> as<00:04:18.870> big<00:04:19.230> a<00:04:19.260> part<00:04:19.530> early<00:04:20.040> on<00:04:20.190> i<00:04:20.430> think<00:04:20.580> i

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
be as big a part early on i think i

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.830 
be as big a part early on i think i
think<00:04:20.820> they'll<00:04:21.090> just<00:04:21.120> go<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.420> him<00:04:21.540> every<00:04:21.720> once

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
think they'll just go to him every once

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.260 
think they'll just go to him every once
in<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.049> while<00:04:22.200> dil<00:04:23.010> um<00:04:23.250> yeah<00:04:23.490> this<00:04:23.730> like<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
in a while dil um yeah this like the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.750 
in a while dil um yeah this like the
eight<00:04:24.390> episodes<00:04:24.900> they<00:04:25.860> wrote<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.160> you<00:04:26.669> know

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
eight episodes they wrote it you know

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.800 
eight episodes they wrote it you know
assuming<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.419> they<00:04:27.510> were

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
assuming that they were

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.240 
assuming that they were
gonna<00:04:27.990> get<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.200> season<00:04:28.500> two<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:28.800> it's<00:04:28.950> not<00:04:29.070> like

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
gonna get it season two so it's not like

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.440 
gonna get it season two so it's not like
there's<00:04:29.460> going<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.669> be<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.820> big<00:04:30.030> hanging

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
there's going to be a big hanging

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.270 
there's going to be a big hanging
hanging<00:04:31.080> plot<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:31.410> mean<00:04:31.530> they'll<00:04:31.680> throw<00:04:31.950> like

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
hanging plot I mean they'll throw like

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.830 
hanging plot I mean they'll throw like
the<00:04:32.520> play<00:04:32.700> announce<00:04:33.060> whether<00:04:33.450> or<00:04:33.600> not<00:04:33.690> they're

going<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.050> renew<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.470> before<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.220> before<00:04:35.520> it's

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
going to renew it before the before it's

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.030 
going to renew it before the before it's
over<00:04:35.970> but<00:04:36.540> they<00:04:36.660> wrote<00:04:37.139> it<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.710> it's<00:04:37.860> like

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
over but they wrote it so that it's like

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.680

a fairly satisfying conclusion and

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.420 
a fairly satisfying conclusion and
they're<00:04:40.200> building<00:04:40.560> towards<00:04:40.889> like<00:04:41.100> something

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
they're building towards like something

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.730 
they're building towards like something
big<00:04:41.639> I<00:04:41.850> mean<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.120> have<00:04:42.270> no<00:04:42.360> idea<00:04:42.600> what<00:04:42.810> but<00:04:43.620> it'll
