00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 very good chicuelo and today I bring you the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.629
 50 mm review 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.670
 it was a pretty little goal and that 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.070
 it weighs very little that for those of us 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.830
 because there is the objective the flash such 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.390
 what accessories here for there for today 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.610
 I carry a goal that weighs more 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.890
 little and they are tiny 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.560
 thanks for the back is a goal 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.710
 very economical that particular objective 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.860
 It is not the cheapest of the 50 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.500
 millimeters this goal is 50 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.660
 millimeters one with eight of this wants 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 say that the objective itself does not have 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.130
 other approaches but good if we have a 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.920
 camera that does have that focusing motor 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.800
 something that basically does not affect us 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.290
 As you know, it is a very bright objective 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.420
 and that one with another means that the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.809
 diaphragm we can open it up to a 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.970
 maximum opening of 1 x 8 and ideal for 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.190
 those of us who are not very close friends 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.649
 use flash for example in 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.899
 situations such as sunrise and 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.550
 sunset the portrait outdoors in 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.310
 regarding the image quality 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.620
 makes a very sharp photograph despite 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.960
 good to be in poor condition 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.670
 light that means fixed focal little 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.130
 haughty means that the ones I have 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.620
 those of zoom with which does not force 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.570
 have to move us as much as 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.250
 to frame as to have to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.780
 approaching our subject is 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.180
 recommended for portraits 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.490
 fundamentally for that possibility of 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.250
 have very unfocused backgrounds 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.320
 for its ability to have a diaphragm 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.210
 very open and if you do not understand 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.770
 Last past for this book that appears 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.840
 down here for you to understand 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.820
 better and that you know how it works 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.560
 this topic and here I leave some 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 examples some pictures that I've 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.820
 I made this objective 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.100
 If you have any doubt any other 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.130
 Ask any other curiosity 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.160
 about this goal I remember you 50 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.810
 millimeters and 18 of you can you can me 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.180

 rations of sirte to which the photograph is 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:45.420
 very romantic and emotional and pornography to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.090
 ambiguous and non-professional mediocre and other 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.010
 type of qualifications granted by
