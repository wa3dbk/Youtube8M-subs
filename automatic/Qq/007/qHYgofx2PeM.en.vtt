 shows circus on the way 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.640
 we want to know when he started exactly 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.269
 i'm going to be in this freedom trainer too 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.390
 work out 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.850
 Jobs was hardly one of you're doing something 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:14.900
 but the exactly where to start 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.909
 presenting horses I have not been with 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.530
 horses started but referred to as 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.910
 I was about seven years old 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.460
 played with a goat and there 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.780
 noticed that these animals are blocking about 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.820
 Two years later came the first 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.290
 I have horses on our farm there 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.460
 try what I do with the goats 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.380
 I also learned from the horses 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.730
 unfortunately not that good 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.350
 worked because horses are not the 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.690
 same technique can be used as with 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.490
 a goat around with his work 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.750
 Nevertheless I have success 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 also gradually different methods 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.020
 tried out 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.090
 Of course, we are interested in burning 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.010
 horse whisperer is there any 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.120
 special breed the most suitable 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:56.120
 is for such freedom training the 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.090
 ns pacific race of the maximums jubilation 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:11.330
 from the emperor's presentation gfk markus 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:13.489
 is yes v.li special respect from that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.660
 many people ask me this question and 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.120
 I want to know if I'm specific 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.220
 But horse breeds really prefer 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.690
 There is no better proof for that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.319
 that certain races are especially good 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.030
 are 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.920
 I myself work with horses from the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.450
 camargue with haflingers the planners in 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.470
 Spanish and Portuguese horses 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:36.290
 but also with ponies class up to 70 kg of 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.700
 Football is a bit of a sport outside 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.920
 more it comes to the physis and psyche 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.390
 For example, if the horses are theirs 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.520
 nervous or calm 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.080
 I then choose each exercise from the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.700
 the character of the horse 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.390
 I agree with that 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.550
 often calls characters without reason 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.440
 you need him the horse whisperer it 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.569
 give any special language the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.640
 already was raging around with his 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.870
 horses to communicate what else 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.060
 should induce her 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.060
 to make these special art pieces 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.590
 it will not make any of it's language 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.300
 Beijing, the horses dreams a 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.459
 There is a special secret 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.050
 The technology is not important, however 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.730
 it is even more important in the 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:29.270
 to be the right state of mind and 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:31.490
 everything breaks schazad jan belongs to the 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.950
 I need seriousness 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.080
 fortunately, have the inner peace 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.850
 you radiate yourself a certain amount 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.740
 but you should also be strict 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.540
 but you always have to have it right away 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.950
 be fair and not be so tough 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:52.010
 is so transparent warmth wears concert 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:57.020
 andré trepoll himself delicious trient usama 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.709
 quieter but the central element is 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.360
 love 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.370
 that endangers them immediately 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.200
 but also work with those 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.470
 it is a bit more difficult and special 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.040
 then positive emotions are indispensable 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.430
 chisora ​​game but i guess you can 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.410
 orange clip sascha turi if it 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.299
 These are the principles that are important 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.099
 for work with the horses then 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.319
 We are interested, of course, the one 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.720
 each one of us learns the same way with the horses 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:26.630
 to interact 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.870
 that was so important to five points 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.379
 for work in the horses kenny

 diepresse.com yes , everybody can do that 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.440
 For example , I would like to learn courses 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.750
 However, many people do not understand 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.599
 that it is particularly important to the animals 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.620
 to observe 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:56.360
 Ursula kuhn from her problems with 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.520
 Problem reader needs to be aware of this 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.110
 be that the world of humans themselves 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.150
 fundamental of the horses 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.860
 makes a difference when it's between horses 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.629
 There are problems very quickly 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.610
 and just solved if there are problems 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.909
 there is always between humans 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.909
 complicated 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:19.490
 the dry when you go there 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.229
 that horses are not human and that 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.699
 then points noted above 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.240
 works well with the 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.370
 horses 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.199
 because generally higher would like us to 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.240
 However, you should not overdo it 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.069
 especially fast when under each other 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.409
 themselves are usually noisy 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.389
 communicate when horses times loud 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.009
 For example, viruses will mean that 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.169
 mostly nothing good and is one 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:44.240
 sign of danger 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:46.789

 not only experienced horses trained 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.919
 You can get four to five years old 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.889
 still imagine that 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.020
