they<00:04:42.150> get<00:04:42.300> from<00:04:42.450> sales<00:04:42.720> later<00:04:43.020> on<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.740> $7

they get from sales later on and the $7
seems<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.610> be<00:04:44.700> their<00:04:44.850> sweet<00:04:45.090> spot<00:04:45.210> at<00:04:45.480> least

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
seems to be their sweet spot at least

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.720 
seems to be their sweet spot at least
for<00:04:45.900> culture<00:04:46.169> packs<00:04:46.490> basically<00:04:47.490> what<00:04:47.639> I'm

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
for culture packs basically what I'm

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.040 
for culture packs basically what I'm
saying<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.090> if<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.300> don't<00:04:48.480> like<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.870> price

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
saying is if you don't like the price

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.990 
saying is if you don't like the price
then<00:04:49.410> just<00:04:49.650> don't<00:04:49.860> buy<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.070> if<00:04:50.639> enough<00:04:50.790> people

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
then just don't buy it if enough people

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.120 
then just don't buy it if enough people
don't<00:04:51.480> buy<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.690> at<00:04:51.870> 7<00:04:52.139> dollars<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.470> they<00:04:52.980> lower

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
don't buy it at 7 dollars and they lower

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.790 
don't buy it at 7 dollars and they lower
the<00:04:53.310> price<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.700> say<00:04:53.880> $5<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:54.960> more<00:04:55.410> people<00:04:55.590> buy

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
the price to say $5 and more people buy

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.310 
the price to say $5 and more people buy
it<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.040> outweigh<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.090> revenue<00:04:57.450> at<00:04:57.570> 7<00:04:57.960> then

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
it to outweigh the revenue at 7 then

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.110 
it to outweigh the revenue at 7 then
we've<00:04:58.470> won<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.770> war<00:04:58.800> they'll<00:04:59.490> keep<00:04:59.669> it<00:04:59.790> at<00:04:59.910> 5

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
we've won the war they'll keep it at 5

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.060 
we've won the war they'll keep it at 5
because<00:05:00.419> they're<00:05:00.690> gaining<00:05:00.990> more<00:05:01.110> revenue<00:05:01.500> for

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
because they're gaining more revenue for

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.159 
because they're gaining more revenue for
the<00:05:02.130> lower<00:05:02.280> price<00:05:02.580> mind<00:05:03.540> you<00:05:03.660> eventually<00:05:03.900> it

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
the lower price mind you eventually it

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.780 
the lower price mind you eventually it
will<00:05:04.320> reach<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.620> cap<00:05:04.830> because<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.490> limited

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
will reach a cap because of the limited

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.030 
will reach a cap because of the limited
player<00:05:06.000> base<00:05:06.320> $0.99<00:05:07.320> factions<00:05:07.680> will<00:05:07.800> probably

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
player base $0.99 factions will probably

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.200 
player base $0.99 factions will probably
never<00:05:08.160> happen<00:05:08.580> because<00:05:08.669> there<00:05:08.940> are<00:05:09.060> enough

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
never happen because there are enough

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.150 
never happen because there are enough

players who buy DLC to get them as much

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.409 
players who buy DLC to get them as much
money<00:05:11.340> as<00:05:11.520> they<00:05:11.639> would<00:05:11.760> selling<00:05:12.120> at<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.240> higher

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
money as they would selling at a higher

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.300 
money as they would selling at a higher
price<00:05:12.740> currently<00:05:13.740> they<00:05:13.860> must<00:05:14.040> be<00:05:14.130> gaining

price currently they must be gaining

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.860

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
more revenue from the current price than

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.629 
more revenue from the current price than
what<00:05:15.960> they<00:05:16.110> expect<00:05:16.530> or<00:05:16.740> have<00:05:16.919> tested<00:05:17.340> at<00:05:17.430> lower

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
what they expect or have tested at lower

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.460 
what they expect or have tested at lower
prices<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.240> that's<00:05:18.660> why<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:18.930> is<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.260> way<00:05:19.350> it

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
prices and that's why it is the way it

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.850 
prices and that's why it is the way it
