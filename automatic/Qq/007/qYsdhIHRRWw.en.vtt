00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
braid is the exact same thing as a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.360 
braid is the exact same thing as a
French<00:00:54.899> braid<00:00:55.199> except<00:00:55.739> we're<00:00:55.920> braiding<00:00:56.250> those

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
outer strands underneath the middle so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740
