00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.080
Hi.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.910
I'm Doug Donahue.

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.259
You may remember me from such informational
films as:

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.221
Custom Magnets: How Do They Work?

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:17.681
and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.680
Day Planners: The Unexpected Killer.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.070
Today we'll be talking about water bottles.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.870
How they're made.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.070
The different styles.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.770
How to customize them.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.340
And what they dream about at night.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.820
The two most popular types are plastic bottles
and metal bottles.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.070
First the plastic bottles.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.560
Polypropylene and co-polyester are turned
into rigid and sturdy bottles.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.820
Like the aptly named Poly-Pure Travel Bottle.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.239
Or you might like a bottle made of squeezable,
high density polyethylene, like the 20 ounce

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.259
Bike Bottle.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.390
These are the bottles most commonly seen at
the gym.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.681
On bikes.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.500
Or dressed as rodeo clowns.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.660
But Mister Donahue.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.760
Yes Jimmy.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.150
It's Jenny.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.400
What's B.P.A?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.521
That's a good question, lil' guy.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.760
I'm a girl.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:08.589
Of course you are.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.420
BPA is short for Bisphenol A.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.550
Aren't ya glad they shortened it?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.830
BPA is an industrial chemical that's been
used in the manufacturing of certain plastics

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.690
since the age of the hippies.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
Some research has shown that small amounts
can seep into food or beverages held in BPA

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.510
Plastic containers.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.630
How do you tell if the bottle you're looking
at is BPA free?

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.290
Just check the product description, watch
the product video,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.250
or simply ask your sales rep.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.990
Yes, Jimmy.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.000
But what if I live a more extreme lifestyle.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.369
Hiking. Or rock climbing. And train hopping.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.549
Excellent question.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.969
If the bottle you give your customers or your
employees might take a bit of a beating,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.370
we recommend going with one of our metal water
bottles.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.109
Made of either aluminum, or stainless steel.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.140
These bottles can take a lickin',

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.680
and you'll keep on drinkin'.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.259
Now aluminum bottles may contain a plastic
resin or epoxy liner inside to protect odors

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.099
and tastes from being transferred from use
to use.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.140
And food grade stainless steel by itself will
not transfer any food tastes or odors.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.040
So there's no need for a lining in those bottles.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.540
No matter what the material, the designs and
features of our bottle is where the fun is

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.140
at.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.060
Fat bottles,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.000
skinny bottles,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.540
bottles that climb on rocks.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.010
Tough bottles,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.050
sissy bottles,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.070
even bottles with chicken pox.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.240
So what're you in the market for?

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.970
You want a collapsible water bottle for easy
storage and travel?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.380
How about a water bottle with a filter?

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.129
Now you're probably thinking,

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.149
"Wait, do those even exist?"

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.989
Silly question Jimmy.

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:50.709
But I didn't say-

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.809
We wouldn't mention them if they didn't.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.640
Hmph.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.680
Maybe the bottle style isn't all you care
about.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.340
Maybe how you drink matters more.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.550
Push-Pull tops. We got 'em.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.860
Sports tops. Game on.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.970
Screw off lids, lids with carabiners, we've
got a bottle with your type of lid.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.600
Do you have any with a straw for me to drink
out of?

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.309
Do we ever, Jimmy. Do we ever.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.379
It's Jenny.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.349
Flip straws,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.030
sipper straws,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.400
flip open sippers,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.780
and flip lid sippers.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.390
Honestly, I can't even keep 'em all straight.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.890
Bu I'll tell ya' one thing,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.020
they DO come in handy.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.790
Though maybe not as handy as the most important
part of your custom bottles.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.890
The imprint.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.320
Recognition's the name of the game.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.360
And what better way to get recognized than
with a bold, vivid logo.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.320
How about you take advantage of our 4-color,
CMYK digital printing process.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.930
CMYK printing is pretty sweet.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.410
But we get it. That might be a little bit
out of your price range.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.780
Screen printing is another popular option,
with one or two imprint locations.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.380
Some bottles even come with that second imprint
location at no charge.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.740
Or better yet, get a wrap.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.889
No, that chicken tortilla thing.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.060
Your design can be printed around the whole
bottle, all 360 degrees.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.489
Now you're going to get the very best prices
on your bottles.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.749
But don't forget to consider that you've gotta
get your bottles shipped to you.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.440
Shipping costs vary based on location AND
the weight of your shipment.

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:32.349
An order of 100 stainless steel water bottles
will weigh far more than 100 plastic bottles,

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.609
and therefore cost more to ship.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.340
Still, all water bottles take up a bit of
space, which means lots of large boxes to

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.020
ship.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.780
Something to consider in your water bottle
budget.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.669
There you have it.

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.509
Everything you need to know about water bottles.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.129
Oh right, they dream about slushies.
