00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
want to mention to you is when we were

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.430 
want to mention to you is when we were
building<00:00:38.420> this<00:00:38.720> mudroom<00:00:39.489> we<00:00:40.489> ran<00:00:40.790> a<00:00:41.480> chase<00:00:42.140> a

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
building this mudroom we ran a chase a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.959 
building this mudroom we ran a chase a
pipe<00:00:42.710> chase<00:00:43.040> through<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.430> floor<00:00:43.700> joist

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
pipe chase through the floor joist

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.240 
pipe chase through the floor joist
system<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.510> we<00:00:44.570> used<00:00:44.780> this<00:00:45.010> electrical<00:00:46.010> fish

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
system and we used this electrical fish

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.970 
system and we used this electrical fish
tape<00:00:46.520> they<00:00:46.730> call<00:00:46.969> it<00:00:47.090> or<00:00:47.350> string<00:00:48.350> for<00:00:48.680> pulling

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
tape they call it or string for pulling

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.310 
tape they call it or string for pulling
wire<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.030> wire<00:00:50.210> runs<00:00:50.690> through<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.140> floor

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
wire so this wire runs through the floor

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.950 
wire so this wire runs through the floor
system<00:00:51.800> through<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.820> floor<00:00:53.420> system<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.899> the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
system through the floor system of the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.660 
system through the floor system of the
main<00:00:54.140> house<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:54.739> goes<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.190> electrical

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
main house and it goes to the electrical

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.729 
main house and it goes to the electrical
service<00:00:56.030> panel<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:56.809> we'll<00:00:56.960> use<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.530> fish

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
service panel so we'll use this to fish

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.470 
service panel so we'll use this to fish
our<00:00:57.949> wire<00:00:57.980> through<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:58.940> we<00:00:59.059> can<00:00:59.210> make<00:00:59.360> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
our wire through so we can make the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.060 
our wire through so we can make the
connections<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.079> electrical<00:01:00.590> connections

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070

this<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:09.320> we're<00:01:09.470> gonna<00:01:09.560> use<00:01:09.649> to

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
this and this is what we're gonna use to

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.440 
this and this is what we're gonna use to
fish<00:01:10.190> through<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.490> house<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:10.940> bring<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:11.360> to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
fish through the house and bring it to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.020 
fish through the house and bring it to
the<00:01:11.570> service<00:01:11.930> connector<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:13.039> green<00:01:13.340> wire<00:01:13.670> is

the service connector the green wire is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.630 
the service connector the green wire is
the<00:01:14.869> wire<00:01:15.080> that<00:01:15.349> heats<00:01:15.560> up<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:15.920> raises<00:01:16.490> to

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
the wire that heats up and raises to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.339 
the wire that heats up and raises to
temperature<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:17.240> we're<00:01:17.869> going<00:01:17.959> to<00:01:18.020> install

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:18.349 
temperature so we're going to install

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.800 
temperature so we're going to install
this<00:01:18.679> as<00:01:19.009> well<00:01:19.789> as<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:19.970> sensor<00:01:20.569> and<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.780> sensor

one thing I want to mention is depending
on<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.869> thickness<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.470> your<00:01:51.530> walkway<00:01:52.039> and<00:01:52.099> the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
on the thickness of your walkway and the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.400 
on the thickness of your walkway and the
material<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:52.880> you're<00:01:53.090> going<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.360> use<00:01:53.810> you'll

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
material that you're going to use you'll

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.020 
material that you're going to use you'll
want<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.649> check<00:01:54.920> with<00:01:55.039> normally<00:01:55.459> yours<00:01:55.670> ahead

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
want to check with normally yours ahead

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.389 
want to check with normally yours ahead
of<00:01:56.149> time<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.810> figure<00:01:56.989> out<00:01:57.259> your<00:01:57.440> spacing<00:01:57.920> we're

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
of time to figure out your spacing we're

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.309 
of time to figure out your spacing we're
using<00:01:58.580> an<00:01:58.819> inch<00:01:58.940> and<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> half<00:01:59.149> maybe<00:01:59.569> two<00:02:00.140> inch

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
using an inch and a half maybe two inch

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.710 
using an inch and a half maybe two inch
thick<00:02:00.410> bluestone<00:02:01.130> patio<00:02:01.759> here<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.630> we

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
thick bluestone patio here that we

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.570 
thick bluestone patio here that we
actually<00:02:03.289> removed<00:02:03.709> and<00:02:04.099> we're<00:02:04.429> going<00:02:04.550> to

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
actually removed and we're going to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.669 
actually removed and we're going to
relay<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.239> we'll<00:02:05.840> probably<00:02:05.989> put<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.319> half<00:02:06.500> inch

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
relay and we'll probably put a half inch

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.469 
relay and we'll probably put a half inch
to<00:02:06.830> an<00:02:06.920> inch<00:02:07.039> stand<00:02:07.399> over<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.910> cables<00:02:08.330> to

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
to an inch stand over the cables to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.050 
to an inch stand over the cables to
protect<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.899> cables<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.950> based<00:02:10.280> on<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.729> and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
protect the cables so based on that and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.119 
protect the cables so based on that and
the<00:02:11.540> thickness<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.989> our<00:02:12.110> stone<00:02:12.410> we're<00:02:12.860> going

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
the thickness of our stone we're going

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.820 
the thickness of our stone we're going
to<00:02:13.280> space<00:02:13.580> we're<00:02:14.150> going<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.330> try<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> achieve<00:02:15.530> a

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
to space we're going to try to achieve a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.760 
to space we're going to try to achieve a
spacing<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:16.550> three<00:02:17.150> inches<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.650> we're

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
spacing of about three inches so we're

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.680 
spacing of about three inches so we're
gonna<00:02:18.890> wrap<00:02:19.250> our<00:02:19.460> cable<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.210> three<00:02:20.480> inch

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
gonna wrap our cable in a three inch

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.510 
gonna wrap our cable in a three inch
spacing<00:02:21.110> pattern<00:02:21.680> evenly<00:02:22.160> all<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.400> way

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
spacing pattern evenly all the way

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.340 
spacing pattern evenly all the way
around<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.120> that's<00:02:23.600> going<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.780> be<00:02:23.900> our<00:02:23.990> goal<00:02:24.200> on

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
around so that's going to be our goal on

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.670 
around so that's going to be our goal on
this<00:02:24.440> and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
this and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.530 
this and
halation<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.640> other<00:02:25.760> thing<00:02:25.939> is<00:02:26.090> womanly

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
halation the other thing is womanly

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.270 
halation the other thing is womanly
yours<00:02:26.719> is<00:02:26.900> great<00:02:27.200> about<00:02:27.349> designing<00:02:28.159> this

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
yours is great about designing this

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.280 
yours is great about designing this
whole<00:02:28.519> thing<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.000> made<00:02:29.510> some<00:02:29.750> very<00:02:29.989> detailed

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
whole thing I made some very detailed

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.440 
whole thing I made some very detailed
measurements<00:02:31.099> I<00:02:31.310> told<00:02:31.849> them<00:02:31.969> how<00:02:32.120> big<00:02:32.329> my

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
measurements I told them how big my

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.940 
measurements I told them how big my
steps<00:02:32.719> were<00:02:32.840> going<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.019> be<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.409> they

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
steps were going to be and they

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.640 
steps were going to be and they
basically<00:02:34.189> sent<00:02:34.670> me<00:02:34.790> back<00:02:34.909> a<00:02:34.969> drawing<00:02:35.689> and<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
basically sent me back a drawing and and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.770 
basically sent me back a drawing and and
had<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.069> all<00:02:37.250> laid<00:02:37.790> out<00:02:37.819> and<00:02:38.000> all<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:38.359> have<00:02:38.599> to

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
had it all laid out and all you have to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.690 
had it all laid out and all you have to
do<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.079> follow<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.500> instructions<00:02:40.159> you<00:02:40.370> do
