too much and just go right into the
splits<00:00:58.730> we're<00:00:59.730> gonna<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> few<00:01:00.239> different

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
splits we're gonna do a few different

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.820 
splits we're gonna do a few different
stretches<00:01:00.629> first<00:01:01.969> example<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.870> one

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
stretches first example this one is one

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
go down then you go forwards and you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.760 
go down then you go forwards and you

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
don't go over here like this and then

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
don't go over here like this and then
this<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.140> another<00:01:46.439> way<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.729> like

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
this is another way of just going like

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.600 
this is another way of just going like
this<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:50.130> pretty<00:01:50.340> much<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this go like this it's pretty much the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.100 
this go like this it's pretty much the
same<00:01:50.640> thing<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.119> I'm<00:01:51.270> pretty<00:01:51.509> sure<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.899> one

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
same thing but I'm pretty sure this one

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.380 
same thing but I'm pretty sure this one
stretches<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> little<00:01:52.860> deeper<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:54.149> sure

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
stretches a little deeper I'm not sure

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.780 
stretches a little deeper I'm not sure
how<00:01:57.350> then<00:01:58.350> we'll<00:01:58.619> repeat<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.950> process<00:01:59.340> on

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
how then we'll repeat that process on

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:09.980 
how then we'll repeat that process on
the<00:02:00.149> second<00:02:00.719> leg

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.350 

don't<00:02:11.260> off<00:02:11.470> on<00:02:11.740> your<00:02:11.890> badge<00:02:12.100> leg<00:02:12.400> cuz<00:02:13.240> if

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
don't off on your badge leg cuz if

don't off on your badge leg cuz if
you<00:02:13.390> slack<00:02:13.630> off<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.050> one<00:02:14.550> then<00:02:15.550> it's

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you slack off on that one then it's

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.100 
you slack off on that one then it's
gonna<00:02:15.820> be<00:02:16.000> not<00:02:16.180> flexible<00:02:16.540> at<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.020> you

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
splits just go to the point where it

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.240 
splits just go to the point where it
hurts<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.570> most<00:04:32.889> because<00:04:33.889> that's<00:04:34.070> where

go on top of where it hurts the most

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.129 
go on top of where it hurts the most
then<00:04:39.350> you're<00:04:39.560> gonna<00:04:39.650> get<00:04:39.770> them<00:04:39.919> faster<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.960> for

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
then you're gonna get them faster so for

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.190 
then you're gonna get them faster so for
me<00:04:42.260> I'm<00:04:42.470> flat<00:04:43.060> but<00:04:44.060> if<00:04:44.389> you're<00:04:44.690> not<00:04:44.870> flat

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
should look like this or to go down

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.879 
should look like this or to go down
deeper<00:04:55.700> I<00:04:55.729> can<00:04:55.910> go<00:04:56.060> here<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:57.970> then<00:04:58.970> no<00:04:59.120> slowly

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
deeper I can go here and then no slowly

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.450 
deeper I can go here and then no slowly
over<00:05:00.889> a<00:05:00.919> few<00:05:01.280> days<00:05:01.630> um<00:05:02.630> or<00:05:03.110> if<00:05:03.169> you<00:05:03.830> have<00:05:04.130> had

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
can go here and check and see if it's a

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.770 
can go here and check and see if it's a
straight<00:05:34.970> line<00:05:35.120> over<00:05:35.990> there<00:05:37.540> that'll<00:05:38.540> see<00:05:38.720> if

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
straight line over there that'll see if

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.520 
straight line over there that'll see if
it's<00:05:38.930> fight<00:05:39.050> or<00:05:39.110> not

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
um and then let's see also to stretch

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.630 
um and then let's see also to stretch
your<00:05:50.440> brows<00:05:51.440> you<00:05:51.800> can<00:05:51.920> go<00:05:52.040> here<00:05:52.310> which<00:05:52.430> is<00:05:52.610> a

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
your brows you can go here which is a

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
then you know exactly what this stretch

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:15.430 
then you know exactly what this stretch
is<00:05:59.650> so<00:06:13.060> now<00:06:14.060> let's<00:06:14.390> see<00:06:14.540> how<00:06:14.660> far<00:06:14.840> we've<00:06:15.050> come

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
is so now let's see how far we've come

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.440 
is so now let's see how far we've come
let's<00:06:16.160> go<00:06:16.340> to<00:06:16.400> our<00:06:16.520> right<00:06:16.730> side<00:06:18.970> then<00:06:19.970> if<00:06:20.270> your

let's go to our right side then if your
hips<00:06:20.630> are<00:06:20.810> flexible<00:06:21.410> enough<00:06:21.650> try<00:06:22.520> to<00:06:22.580> just

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
hips are flexible enough try to just

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:33.580 
hips are flexible enough try to just
transfer<00:06:23.840> over<00:06:26.350> and<00:06:27.350> then<00:06:27.669> over<00:06:28.669> to<00:06:32.380> also<00:06:33.380> if

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
your splits lean backwards now this is

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.780 
your splits lean backwards now this is
my<00:06:41.000> bad<00:06:41.180> side<00:06:41.450> so<00:06:45.070> it<00:06:46.070> will<00:06:46.130> go<00:06:46.370> to<00:06:46.430> my<00:06:46.460> good
