sim cockpit designs basically what you
see<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.070> my<00:00:11.250> for<00:00:11.580> cutting<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.150> platform

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
see here is my for cutting a platform

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.600 
see here is my for cutting a platform
that<00:00:12.990> I've<00:00:13.170> made<00:00:13.410> out<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.679> four<00:00:13.860> by<00:00:13.980> four<00:00:14.190> posts

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
that I've made out of four by four posts

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
that I've made out of four by four posts
and<00:00:14.820> I've<00:00:15.450> got<00:00:15.630> my<00:00:15.750> salt<00:00:16.049> here<00:00:16.230> ready<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.500> go

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
and I've got my salt here ready to go

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
and I've got my salt here ready to go
I'm<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.039> use<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.190> rigid<00:00:17.520> cordless<00:00:17.940> skin

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
I'm going to use my rigid cordless skin

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.810 
I'm going to use my rigid cordless skin
saw<00:00:18.510> skill<00:00:19.230> saw<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.859> project<00:00:20.100> just

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
saw skill saw for this project just

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.250 
saw skill saw for this project just
because<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> thin<00:00:21.660> material<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
because this is the thin material and

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.160 
because this is the thin material and
easy<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.650> cut<00:00:22.830> through<00:00:23.300> basically<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.630> part<00:00:24.960> 1i

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
easy to cut through basically in part 1i

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.140 
easy to cut through basically in part 1i
discussed<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> could<00:00:26.220> use<00:00:26.430> two<00:00:27.000> by

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
discussed that you could use two by

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.700 
discussed that you could use two by
fours<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> cutting<00:00:28.019> platform<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
fours for a cutting platform but I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.560 
fours for a cutting platform but I
didn't<00:00:28.949> really<00:00:29.039> recommend<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.699> especially

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
didn't really recommend that especially

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.150 
didn't really recommend that especially
using<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.960> single<00:00:31.260> two-by-four<00:00:31.769> simply

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
using a single two-by-four simply

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.280 
using a single two-by-four simply
because<00:00:32.520> using<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> single<00:00:33.719> two-by-four

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
because using a single two-by-four

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.260 
because using a single two-by-four
doesn't<00:00:34.530> really<00:00:35.250> allow<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.880> properly

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
doesn't really allow you to properly

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
doesn't really allow you to properly
clamp<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.750> material<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.530> fiber<00:00:37.860> board<00:00:38.129> or

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
clamp your material be it fiber board or

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
clamp your material be it fiber board or
plywood<00:00:38.700> you'll<00:00:39.450> find<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> use<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
plywood you'll find that if you use to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.190 
plywood you'll find that if you use to
single<00:00:40.980> two-by-four<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:42.420> your<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.809> cutting

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
option if you don't want to use four by

option if you don't want to use four by
four<00:00:56.039> posts<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.570> actually<00:00:58.079> screw<00:00:58.559> two

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
four posts you can actually screw two

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.410 
four posts you can actually screw two
pieces<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.129> two<00:00:59.340> by<00:00:59.489> four<00:00:59.730> together<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.239> will

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
pieces of two by four together this will

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
pieces of two by four together this will
give<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.719> three-inch<00:01:01.140> distance<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
give you a three-inch distance and you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
give you a three-inch distance and you
can<00:01:01.920> use<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.059> too<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.300> actually

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
can use that but that too is actually

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
can use that but that too is actually
going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.470> less<00:01:04.680> than<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
going to be a little bit less than a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.370 
going to be a little bit less than a
four<00:01:05.880> by<00:01:06.000> four<00:01:06.030> post<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.350> believe

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
four by four post which is I believe

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.929 
four by four post which is I believe
actually<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.100> three<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> half<00:01:08.460> by<00:01:08.760> three

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
actually like three and a half by three

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.929 
actually like three and a half by three
and<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> half<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.159> double<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and a half but if you do double up to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.480 
and a half but if you do double up to
two<00:01:12.150> pieces<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.020> by<00:01:13.170> four<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:14.159> talking

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
two pieces of two by four I was talking

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
two pieces of two by four I was talking
about<00:01:14.520> driving<00:01:14.939> screws<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.140> marry

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
about driving screws into this to marry

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
about driving screws into this to marry
two<00:01:16.590> pieces<00:01:16.979> together<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.270> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
two pieces together and if you do that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.789 
two pieces together and if you do that
you're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> want<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.200> recess<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
you're going to want to recess the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.219 
you're going to want to recess the
screws<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.060> drill<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> pre-drilled<00:01:21.990> hole

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
screws so you drill a pre-drilled hole

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
screws so you drill a pre-drilled hole
first<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:24.060> drill<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> bigger

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
first and then actually drill a bigger

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.530 
first and then actually drill a bigger
hole<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> diameter<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> screw<00:01:26.040> head

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
hole if the diameter of the screw head

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.060 
hole if the diameter of the screw head
recess<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.780> down<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> half<00:01:28.500> inch<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
recess that down about a half inch and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
recess that down about a half inch and
then<00:01:29.189> drive<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.729> screw<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.570> marry<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
then drive in your screw to marry the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.870 
then drive in your screw to marry the
two<00:01:30.960> pieces<00:01:31.259> together<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.860> while<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.790> is

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
two pieces together and while I this is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
two pieces together and while I this is
particularly<00:01:33.270> important<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:34.920> if

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
particularly important is because if

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
particularly important is because if
you're<00:01:35.490> using<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> skill<00:01:36.090> saw<00:01:36.470> want<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> make

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you're using the skill saw want to make

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.010 
you're using the skill saw want to make
sure<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.579> set<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:39.000> saw<00:01:39.240> blade<00:01:39.600> at<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
sure that you set your saw blade at the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.539 
sure that you set your saw blade at the
depth<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.770> material<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.430> going

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
depth of the material that you're going

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.819 
depth of the material that you're going
to<00:01:41.640> cut<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.509> case<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:42.990> cutting<00:01:43.350> two

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
to cut in this case I'm cutting two

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
to cut in this case I'm cutting two
pieces<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:44.490> eighth<00:01:44.640> inch<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.540> combined

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
pieces of one eighth inch so a combined

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.770 
pieces of one eighth inch so a combined
distance<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:47.220> height<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:48.509> quarter

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
distance of or height of one quarter

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.740 
distance of or height of one quarter
inch<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.890> go<00:01:49.979> ahead<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.130> set<00:01:50.369> my

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
inch so I'm going to go ahead and set my

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.539 
inch so I'm going to go ahead and set my
saw<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> distance<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.490> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
saw now to that distance I'm going to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.100 
saw now to that distance I'm going to
eyeball<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.850> from<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> rear

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
eyeball it from the rear

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.950 
eyeball it from the rear
I'm<00:01:56.530> gonna<00:01:56.680> set<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.310> actually<00:01:58.270> about<00:01:58.540> 38

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
I'm gonna set it to actually about 38

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.630 
I'm gonna set it to actually about 38
because<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.320> want<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.560> go<00:01:59.620> a<00:01:59.650> little<00:01:59.890> past<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
because you want to go a little past the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.170 
because you want to go a little past the
distance<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.660> cut<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:03.640> looks<00:02:03.970> good

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
distance that you cut so that looks good

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.200 
distance that you cut so that looks good
right<00:02:04.390> there<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:06.640> going<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.880> tighten<00:02:07.120> that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
right there I'm going to tighten that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.200 
right there I'm going to tighten that
back<00:02:07.420> up<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.369> then<00:02:09.460> lastly<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.850> just<00:02:09.970> want<00:02:10.149> to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
back up and then lastly you just want to

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.990 
back up and then lastly you just want to
check<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.539> hold<00:02:11.350> your<00:02:11.500> fence<00:02:11.770> off<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.280> then

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
check it hold your fence off and then

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.190 
check it hold your fence off and then
just<00:02:13.120> make<00:02:13.300> sure<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.780> tooth<00:02:13.960> of<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
just make sure that the tooth of the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.960 
just make sure that the tooth of the
blade<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.710> penetrating<00:02:15.430> down<00:02:15.610> through<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
blade is penetrating down through the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.310 
blade is penetrating down through the
material<00:02:16.390> that's<00:02:16.540> actually<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.990> little<00:02:17.050> too

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
material that's actually a little too

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.990 
material that's actually a little too
too<00:02:18.010> less<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.360> from<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> loose<00:02:19.930> snack<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
too less and so from the loose snack and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.340 
too less and so from the loose snack and
it<00:02:22.180> would<00:02:22.360> drop<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.720> down<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.900> little<00:02:23.110> further

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
it would drop it down a little further

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.150 
it would drop it down a little further
and<00:02:24.030> that's<00:02:25.030> good<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:26.440> point<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.010> your

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
and that's good this point so is your

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.040 
and that's good this point so is your
teeth<00:02:27.370> patru<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.910> bottom<00:02:28.240> now<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.870> don't

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
teeth patru the bottom now you don't

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.810 
teeth patru the bottom now you don't
want<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.320> do<00:02:29.410> too<00:02:29.620> much<00:02:29.770> obviously<00:02:30.340> because<00:02:30.670> as

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
want to do too much obviously because as

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.240 
want to do too much obviously because as
you<00:02:30.970> cut<00:02:31.260> on<00:02:32.260> your<00:02:32.320> cutting<00:02:32.620> platforms

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
you cut on your cutting platforms

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.710 
you cut on your cutting platforms
eventually<00:02:33.700> you're<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.030> be<00:02:34.180> having<00:02:34.510> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
eventually you're going to be having to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.500 
eventually you're going to be having to
cut<00:02:34.930> over<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.440> pieces<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:36.000> your<00:02:37.000> platform

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
cut over your pieces of your platform

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.660 
cut over your pieces of your platform
material<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.200> be<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:39.220> doubled<00:02:39.580> up

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
material and be it you know doubled up

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.240 
material and be it you know doubled up
two<00:02:39.820> by<00:02:39.940> four<00:02:40.209> or<00:02:40.390> four<00:02:40.989> by<00:02:41.110> four<00:02:41.350> posts<00:02:41.709> so

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
two by four or four by four posts so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.340 
two by four or four by four posts so
actually<00:02:42.520> at<00:02:42.610> some<00:02:42.820> point<00:02:43.060> your<00:02:43.600> blade<00:02:43.959> is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
actually at some point your blade is

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.800 
actually at some point your blade is
actually<00:02:45.100> going<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.370> cut<00:02:45.610> some<00:02:46.090> grooves<00:02:46.420> as

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
actually going to cut some grooves as

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.530 
actually going to cut some grooves as
you<00:02:47.440> can<00:02:47.560> see<00:02:47.770> there<00:02:48.040> will<00:02:48.760> actually<00:02:48.970> wind<00:02:49.420> up

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
you can see there will actually wind up

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.620 
you can see there will actually wind up
cutting<00:02:49.840> your<00:02:50.530> floor<00:02:50.800> supports<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.940> once<00:02:52.480> you

you want to use this for and you will

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.940 
you want to use this for and you will
always<00:03:10.209> continue<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.049> use<00:03:11.260> these<00:03:11.410> pieces<00:03:11.680> for

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
always continue to use these pieces for

always continue to use these pieces for
your<00:03:12.070> cutting<00:03:12.310> platform<00:03:12.760> but<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.630> know<00:03:13.720> it's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
your cutting platform but you know it's

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.509 
your cutting platform but you know it's
important<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.440> set<00:03:14.920> your<00:03:15.070> solid<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.430> the

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
important that you set your solid of the

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.000 
important that you set your solid of the
proper<00:03:15.880> depth<00:03:16.180> because<00:03:16.989> if<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.350> had<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.799> set

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
proper depth because if you had it set

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.970 
proper depth because if you had it set
too<00:03:18.220> deep<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:19.420> would<00:03:19.570> tend<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.930> bind<00:03:20.320> or<00:03:20.739> really

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
too deep it would tend to bind or really

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.979 
too deep it would tend to bind or really
slow<00:03:21.340> down<00:03:21.580> when<00:03:22.239> you<00:03:22.299> hit<00:03:22.600> your<00:03:22.750> floor

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
slow down when you hit your floor

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.380 
slow down when you hit your floor
platform<00:03:23.470> material<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:25.060> don't<00:03:25.239> want

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
platform material and you don't want

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.910 
platform material and you don't want
that<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.660> happen<00:03:25.690> because<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.380> want<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.650> make

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
that to happen because you want to make

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.520 
that to happen because you want to make
a<00:03:26.980> nice<00:03:27.459> smooth<00:03:27.820> even<00:03:28.060> cut<00:03:28.420> pretty<00:03:29.290> much<00:03:29.500> a

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
a nice smooth even cut pretty much a

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.220 
a nice smooth even cut pretty much a
continuous<00:03:30.130> speed<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:31.600> setting<00:03:31.930> your<00:03:32.049> blade

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
continuous speed so setting your blade

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.610 
continuous speed so setting your blade
depth<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.950> extremely<00:03:33.489> important

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
depth is extremely important

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.190 
depth is extremely important
for<00:03:34.890> this<00:03:35.099> type<00:03:35.580> of<00:03:35.610> cutting<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.840> basically

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
for this type of cutting so basically

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.110 
for this type of cutting so basically
i'll<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.440> make<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.680> first<00:03:37.920> cut<00:03:37.980> here<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.549> i

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
i'll just make the first cut here and i

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.880 
i'll just make the first cut here and i
could<00:03:39.299> go<00:03:39.450> ahead<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.690> set<00:03:40.019> up<00:03:40.140> my<00:03:40.319> rip<00:03:40.860> fence

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
could go ahead and set up my rip fence

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.089 
could go ahead and set up my rip fence
as<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.120> see<00:03:42.299> here<00:03:42.629> using<00:03:43.620> some<00:03:43.769> extra

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
as you can see here using some extra

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.550 
as you can see here using some extra
cramps<00:03:44.580> obviously<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.450> see<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:46.200> clamps

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
cramps obviously you can see the clamps

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.350 
cramps obviously you can see the clamps
i'm<00:03:46.680> using<00:03:47.010> right<00:03:47.040> now<00:03:47.190> i<00:03:47.400> have<00:03:47.730> set<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.120> place

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
i'm using right now i have set in place

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.020 
i'm using right now i have set in place
to<00:03:49.170> hold<00:03:49.409> my<00:03:49.799> fiber<00:03:50.069> board<00:03:50.310> material<00:03:50.819> actually

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
to hold my fiber board material actually

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.690 
to hold my fiber board material actually
together<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:52.319> if<00:03:52.560> i<00:03:52.680> had<00:03:52.709> extra<00:03:53.220> clamps<00:03:53.579> on

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
together but if i had extra clamps on

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.020 
together but if i had extra clamps on
hand<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.209> could<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:55.290> know<00:03:55.430> measure<00:03:56.430> my<00:03:56.700> fence

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
hand I could you know measure my fence

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.839 
hand I could you know measure my fence
you<00:03:57.780> know<00:03:57.870> fence<00:03:58.170> defense<00:03:59.129> or<00:03:59.430> rip<00:03:59.610> fence

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
you know fence defense or rip fence

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.180 
you know fence defense or rip fence
distance<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:01.230> make<00:04:01.379> sure<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.739> I'm<00:04:01.829> cutting

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
distance to make sure that I'm cutting

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.509 
distance to make sure that I'm cutting
on<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.400> right<00:04:03.030> side<00:04:03.329> of<00:04:03.360> my<00:04:03.569> line<00:04:04.250> as<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.400> can

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
on the right side of my line as you can

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.720 
on the right side of my line as you can
see<00:04:05.730> right<00:04:05.760> there<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:07.260> cut<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:08.220> piece<00:04:08.489> out

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
see right there to cut this piece out

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.360 
see right there to cut this piece out
but<00:04:09.390> I'm<00:04:09.540> pretty<00:04:09.780> good<00:04:10.019> at<00:04:10.079> free<00:04:10.859> hand<00:04:11.069> cutting

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
but I'm pretty good at free hand cutting

little six and a half inch Bridget skill

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.199 
little six and a half inch Bridget skill
saw<00:04:18.139> so<00:04:19.139> we<00:04:19.709> will<00:04:19.859> set<00:04:20.070> aside<00:04:20.250> my<00:04:20.639> red<00:04:20.820> pens<00:04:21.030> for

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
saw so we will set aside my red pens for

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.969 
saw so we will set aside my red pens for
now<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.600> I'll<00:04:21.959> just<00:04:22.139> make<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.470> first<00:04:22.740> cut

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
now and I'll just make this first cut

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.680 
now and I'll just make this first cut
and<00:04:23.340> then<00:04:23.760> basically<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.270> know<00:04:24.419> you're<00:04:24.630> just

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
and then basically you know you're just

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.570 
and then basically you know you're just
going<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.930> want<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.229> do<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:26.070> same<00:04:26.280> thing

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
going to want to do the same thing

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.550 
going to want to do the same thing
obviously<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.600> know<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.750> could<00:04:28.020> use<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.380> rib

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
obviously you know you could use the rib

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.860 
obviously you know you could use the rib
pencil<00:04:29.010> plan<00:04:29.280> if<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.669> want<00:04:29.910> measure<00:04:30.570> out<00:04:30.720> your

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
pencil plan if you want measure out your

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.650 
pencil plan if you want measure out your
offense<00:04:31.740> defense<00:04:32.039> distance<00:04:32.699> properly<00:04:33.240> cut<00:04:33.510> on

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
offense defense distance properly cut on

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.659 
offense defense distance properly cut on
the<00:04:33.780> outside<00:04:34.169> edge<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.470> your<00:04:34.560> line<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:35.490> can

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
the outside edge of your line you can

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.490 
the outside edge of your line you can
clamp<00:04:35.970> this<00:04:36.120> down<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.630> other<00:04:36.750> side<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.380> then

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
clamp this down the other side and then

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.260 
clamp this down the other side and then
you<00:04:37.620> do<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.800> there<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.280> they<00:04:38.400> are<00:04:38.460> there<00:04:38.789> and

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
you do it there and they are there and

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.080 
you do it there and they are there and
so<00:04:39.479> on<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:40.110> know<00:04:40.229> around<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:41.310> around<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.880> so

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
so on you know around and around and so

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.990 
so on you know around and around and so
on<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.539> your<00:04:42.660> pieces<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.380> fiberboard<00:04:44.070> here<00:04:44.520> to

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
on on your pieces of fiberboard here to

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.930 
on on your pieces of fiberboard here to
cut<00:04:45.180> out<00:04:45.300> your<00:04:45.330> exterior<00:04:45.780> skin<00:04:46.110> panels<00:04:46.940> but

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
cut out your exterior skin panels but

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.640 
cut out your exterior skin panels but
you<00:04:48.180> know<00:04:48.270> if<00:04:48.479> you're<00:04:48.630> if<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:48.960> feel<00:04:49.139> confident

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.529 
you know if you're if you feel confident
of<00:04:49.800> your<00:04:49.889> free<00:04:50.130> hand<00:04:50.160> abilities<00:04:50.940> just<00:04:51.270> make

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
of your free hand abilities just make

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.839 
of your free hand abilities just make
sure<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.840> go<00:04:51.960> really<00:04:52.169> slow<00:04:52.530> pay<00:04:53.250> attention<00:04:53.280> to

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
sure you go really slow pay attention to

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.760 
sure you go really slow pay attention to
where<00:04:54.000> your<00:04:54.210> blade<00:04:54.810> is<00:04:55.080> meeting<00:04:55.440> your<00:04:55.590> line

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
where your blade is meeting your line

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.980 
where your blade is meeting your line
and<00:04:56.070> then<00:04:56.340> just<00:04:56.580> cut<00:04:56.849> slowly<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:57.840> carefully

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
and then just cut slowly and carefully

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.589
