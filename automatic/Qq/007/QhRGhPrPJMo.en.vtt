the Empire State Building 3d puzzle has
55<00:00:29.029> pieces<00:00:29.560> it's<00:00:30.560> not<00:00:30.740> a<00:00:30.769> super<00:00:31.369> difficult

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
55 pieces it's not a super difficult

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.000 
55 pieces it's not a super difficult
thing<00:00:32.390> to<00:00:32.419> put<00:00:32.689> together<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.530> once<00:00:33.739> it's<00:00:33.920> a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
thing to put together but once it's a

the box your faces and they get quite a
few<00:00:47.809> different<00:00:48.200> panels<00:00:48.559> each<00:00:49.100> panel<00:00:49.550> is

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
few different panels each panel is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.540 
few different panels each panel is
numbered<00:00:50.540> so<00:00:51.469> you<00:00:51.530> can<00:00:51.710> see<00:00:51.950> exactly<00:00:52.160> what

needs to be done you just have to punch
out<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.710> pieces<00:00:55.010> follow<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:55.940> instructions

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
out the pieces follow the instructions

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.860 
out the pieces follow the instructions
and<00:00:56.829> move<00:00:57.829> on<00:00:58.010> well<00:00:58.340> let's<00:00:58.460> get<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.870> putting

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.330 

all<00:01:34.520> right<00:01:34.729> for<00:01:35.360> resection<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.990> built<00:01:36.340> that

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
all right for resection is built that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.859 
all right for resection is built that
would<00:01:37.460> be<00:01:37.610> dating<00:01:38.000> now<00:01:38.390> we're<00:01:38.479> gonna<00:01:38.570> move<00:01:38.719> on

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
would be dating now we're gonna move on

00:01:38.869 --> 00:02:16.130 
would be dating now we're gonna move on
to<00:01:38.899> beat

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.510 

all<00:02:17.140> right<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.500> we've<00:02:17.650> built<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.040> two<00:02:18.250> pieces

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
all right so we've built the two pieces

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.540 
all right so we've built the two pieces
now<00:02:19.270> we're<00:02:19.420> down<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.870> final<00:02:20.440> steps<00:02:20.740> which

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
now we're down to the final steps which

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.210 
now we're down to the final steps which
is<00:02:21.760> assembling<00:02:22.540> all<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.470> separate<00:02:23.830> bases

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
is assembling all of the separate bases

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.130 
is assembling all of the separate bases
so<00:02:24.790> first<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.240> need<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> assemble<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> base

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
so first we need to assemble the base

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:51.839 
so first we need to assemble the base
and<00:02:26.440> then<00:02:26.800> put<00:02:27.610> everything<00:02:27.820> together

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
okay so now we've got all of the pieces

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.330 
okay so now we've got all of the pieces
pretty<00:02:55.930> much<00:02:56.079> ready<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.409> go<00:02:56.469> we're<00:02:57.129> just<00:02:57.249> gonna
