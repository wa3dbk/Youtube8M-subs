cool<00:05:27.100> host<00:05:27.460> which<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.510> could<00:05:28.720> they<00:05:28.870> say<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.110> a

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
cool host which I could they say is a

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.890 
cool host which I could they say is a
vacuum<00:05:29.710> which<00:05:30.250> makes<00:05:30.610> sense<00:05:30.850> I<00:05:31.000> guess<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.360> suck

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
vacuum which makes sense I guess to suck

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.320 
vacuum which makes sense I guess to suck
the<00:05:32.139> fumes<00:05:32.470> like<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:32.979> vent<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.610> vent<00:05:33.639> hood<00:05:34.000> so

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
the fumes like a vent the vent hood so

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.879 
the fumes like a vent the vent hood so
when<00:05:34.479> you're<00:05:34.630> in<00:05:34.720> science<00:05:35.080> class<00:05:35.229> and<00:05:35.620> you<00:05:35.680> see

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
when you're in science class and you see

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.520 
when you're in science class and you see
a<00:05:35.919> hood<00:05:36.220> or<00:05:36.700> like<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.389> container<00:05:38.139> that<00:05:38.229> has<00:05:38.500> a

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
a hood or like a container that has a

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.070 
a hood or like a container that has a
event<00:05:39.250> that's<00:05:39.970> what<00:05:40.150> this<00:05:40.270> is<00:05:40.330> for<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.900> says

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
event that's what this is for it says

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.710 
event that's what this is for it says
kind<00:05:41.289> of<00:05:41.410> sucks<00:05:42.250> up<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.550> air<00:05:42.700> any<00:05:43.000> noxious

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
kind of sucks up the air any noxious

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.740 
kind of sucks up the air any noxious
fumes<00:05:44.110> or<00:05:44.410> anything<00:05:44.740> from<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:46.330> see<00:05:46.479> how<00:05:46.599> it's

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
fumes or anything from and see how it's

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.960 
fumes or anything from and see how it's
under<00:05:46.960> net<00:05:47.139> die<00:05:47.380> green<00:05:47.680> beaker<00:05:48.099> except<00:05:48.880> maybe

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
under net die green beaker except maybe

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.300 
under net die green beaker except maybe
it's<00:05:49.240> like<00:05:49.330> bubbling<00:05:49.990> and<00:05:50.229> it's<00:05:50.380> like

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
it's like bubbling and it's like

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.400 
it's like bubbling and it's like
vacuuming<00:05:51.729> up<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.030> air<00:05:52.210> why<00:05:52.840> does<00:05:52.990> this<00:05:53.110> come

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
vacuuming up the air why does this come

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.080 
vacuuming up the air why does this come
down<00:05:53.710> like<00:05:54.070> can<00:05:54.250> she<00:05:54.280> like<00:05:54.580> maybe<00:05:54.789> why<00:05:55.030> I'm

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
down like can she like maybe why I'm

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.460 
down like can she like maybe why I'm
thinking<00:05:55.419> is<00:05:55.510> that<00:05:55.539> maybe<00:05:55.660> you<00:05:55.930> can<00:05:56.080> take<00:05:56.289> the

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
thinking is that maybe you can take the

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.860 
thinking is that maybe you can take the
chalkboard<00:05:56.979> off<00:05:57.220> and<00:05:57.580> then<00:05:58.090> put<00:05:58.300> beakers<00:05:58.690> on

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
chalkboard off and then put beakers on

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.360 
chalkboard off and then put beakers on
it<00:05:59.020> so<00:05:59.110> it's<00:05:59.229> like<00:05:59.349> an<00:05:59.440> extra<00:05:59.590> table<00:05:59.919> for<00:06:00.280> her

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
it so it's like an extra table for her

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.200 
it so it's like an extra table for her
to<00:06:00.490> work<00:06:00.700> on<00:06:00.910> possibly<00:06:01.630> or<00:06:02.110> it<00:06:02.650> could<00:06:02.800> just<00:06:02.830> be

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
to work on possibly or it could just be

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.610 
to work on possibly or it could just be
standing<00:06:04.210> out<00:06:04.449> the<00:06:04.510> entire<00:06:04.720> time<00:06:05.020> and<00:06:05.440> they

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
standing out the entire time and they

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.170 
standing out the entire time and they
use<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:05.830> piece<00:06:06.250> instead<00:06:06.669> of<00:06:06.789> making<00:06:07.090> an

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
use that piece instead of making an

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.230 
use that piece instead of making an
entirely<00:06:07.449> new<00:06:07.630> piece<00:06:08.490> yeah<00:06:09.490> Oh<00:06:09.699> instead<00:06:10.180> of

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
entirely new piece yeah Oh instead of

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.760 
entirely new piece yeah Oh instead of
happy<00:06:10.360> oh<00:06:10.539> yeah<00:06:10.870> because<00:06:11.139> there's<00:06:11.349> nowhere<00:06:11.530> to

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
happy oh yeah because there's nowhere to

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.570 
happy oh yeah because there's nowhere to
clip<00:06:12.039> this<00:06:12.310> to<00:06:12.550> clip<00:06:12.820> it<00:06:12.940> on<00:06:13.120> yeah<00:06:13.630> huh<00:06:14.550> see<00:06:15.550> I

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
clip this to clip it on yeah huh see I

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.070 
clip this to clip it on yeah huh see I
was<00:06:15.789> trying<00:06:15.970> think<00:06:16.120> more<00:06:16.240> creatively<00:06:16.449> that

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
was trying think more creatively that

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.170 
was trying think more creatively that
you<00:06:17.169> could<00:06:17.440> use<00:06:17.470> it<00:06:17.710> for<00:06:17.889> other<00:06:18.070> purposes<00:06:18.310> now

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
you could use it for other purposes now

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.790 
you could use it for other purposes now
I<00:06:19.210> do<00:06:19.300> love<00:06:19.539> my<00:06:19.690> hairpiece<00:06:19.870> also<00:06:20.260> besides<00:06:20.470> the

kettle service the skillet here it's
such<00:06:22.510> a<00:06:22.539> little<00:06:22.960> detail<00:06:23.260> but<00:06:23.440> it<00:06:23.560> looks<00:06:23.680> so

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
such a little detail but it looks so

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.210 
such a little detail but it looks so
cute<00:06:24.820> I<00:06:25.090> mean<00:06:25.510> there's<00:06:25.720> gonna<00:06:25.900> be<00:06:26.169> um<00:06:26.440> I<00:06:26.919> think

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
cute I mean there's gonna be um I think

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.550 
cute I mean there's gonna be um I think
car<00:06:27.940> for<00:06:28.479> this<00:06:28.599> I<00:06:28.690> know<00:06:28.780> it's<00:06:28.990> a<00:06:29.050> roadster<00:06:29.349> and

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
car for this I know it's a roadster and

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.230 
car for this I know it's a roadster and
then<00:06:29.710> the<00:06:29.949> actual<00:06:30.370> like<00:06:30.760> out<00:06:30.880> of<00:06:31.000> its<00:06:31.120> the

then the actual like out of its the

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.580 
then the actual like out of its the
catacombs<00:06:31.630> were<00:06:31.780> high<00:06:31.960> school<00:06:32.260> I<00:06:32.289> think

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
catacombs were high school I think

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.900 
catacombs were high school I think
through<00:06:32.710> the<00:06:32.800> high<00:06:32.919> school<00:06:33.160> then<00:06:33.669> actually

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
through the high school then actually

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.670 
through the high school then actually

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
that summer I have not seen these

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.290 
that summer I have not seen these
available<00:06:38.080> in<00:06:38.380> stores<00:06:38.620> just<00:06:39.220> yet<00:06:39.490> but<00:06:40.150> I'm

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
available in stores just yet but I'm

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.070 
available in stores just yet but I'm
assuming<00:06:40.389> that<00:06:40.840> they

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
assuming that they

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.990 
assuming that they
babe<00:06:41.289> just<00:06:42.250> because<00:06:42.460> it's<00:06:42.610> probably<00:06:42.849> really

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
babe just because it's probably really

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.610 
babe just because it's probably really
new<00:06:43.270> and<00:06:43.509> maybe<00:06:43.659> it<00:06:44.020> was<00:06:44.139> I<00:06:44.229> thought<00:06:44.470> at<00:06:44.590> first

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
new and maybe it was I thought at first

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.070 
new and maybe it was I thought at first
but<00:06:45.580> he's<00:06:45.849> really<00:06:46.000> cute<00:06:46.330> I<00:06:46.539> mean<00:06:46.720> I<00:06:46.780> like<00:06:46.990> the
