00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.280 
because the the sparkles are kind of
like<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.190> matte<00:02:39.550> sparkle<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.360> doesn't<00:02:40.750> it

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
like a matte sparkle it doesn't it

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.650 
like a matte sparkle it doesn't it
doesn't<00:02:41.350> have<00:02:41.770> like<00:02:41.980> Holograms<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.540> it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
doesn't have like Holograms to it so it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.370 
doesn't have like Holograms to it so it
doesn't<00:02:44.110> really<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:44.590> show<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.640> Sun<00:02:45.850> like

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
doesn't really like show in the Sun like

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.000 
doesn't really like show in the Sun like
different<00:02:47.380> colors<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.950> just<00:02:48.130> has<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:49.090> mat

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
different colors it just has the mat

00:02:50.010 --> 00:03:01.280 
different colors it just has the mat
sparkle<00:02:51.930> awesome

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.460 

so<00:03:02.290> as<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.590> can<00:03:02.709> see<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:04.000> right<00:03:04.659> now<00:03:04.840> it's

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
so as you can see the right now it's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.670 
so as you can see the right now it's
it's<00:03:06.400> really<00:03:06.640> gentle<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:08.170> once<00:03:08.349> we<00:03:08.500> add

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
it's really gentle but once we add

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.600 
it's really gentle but once we add
another<00:03:09.010> layer<00:03:09.280> it's<00:03:10.000> going<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.239> be<00:03:10.480> even

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
another layer it's going to be even

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.110 
another layer it's going to be even
gentler<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:17.620> looks<00:03:17.799> really<00:03:18.190> pretty<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:19.000> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
gentler that looks really pretty in the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.670 
gentler that looks really pretty in the
Sun<00:03:21.510> that's<00:03:22.510> what<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.720> really<00:03:23.140> love<00:03:23.319> about<00:03:23.349> the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
Sun that's what I really love about the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.369 
Sun that's what I really love about the
shears<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.129> is<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.090> add<00:03:25.379> another

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
shears to is that you can add another

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.020 
shears to is that you can add another
layer<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:26.680> top<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.400> still<00:03:27.760> see<00:03:27.910> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
layer on top and you can still see the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:40.589 
layer on top and you can still see the
sparkle<00:03:28.629> with<00:03:28.989> within<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.950> layers<00:03:30.159> and<00:03:39.599> I

like<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.079> this<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.410> really<00:03:41.709> easy<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:43.239> take

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
like that this is really easy to take

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.210 
like that this is really easy to take
care<00:03:43.599> of<00:03:43.660> it's<00:03:43.959> just<00:03:44.049> like<00:03:46.470> four<00:03:47.470> layers<00:03:47.709> or
