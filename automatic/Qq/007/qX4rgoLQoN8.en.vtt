00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.910
 mia electric ge inherits this again 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.350
 week of a vehicle a little bit 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.660
 iconoclast to share my life 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.460
 daily for a week then 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.470
 on the other hand this time we stop with 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.710
 the featherweight we spent the bulk of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.630
 heavy of the sturdy dripping 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.500
 truth assumed by Ford rank 3 stars 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.010

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.269
 and congratulations to the mom 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.100
 the version we have today it's 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.809
 the high-end over-equipped is the top 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.650
 the top is the luxury menu with 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.780
 ketchup supplement 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.019
 it's the web stalking who know a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.480
 mainly to his profile arch and his 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.180
 orange paint and its alloy wheels in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.579
 18 inches 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.739
 aesthetically he is profiled as a 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.629
 bus shelter and a little flashy 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.049
 it's a real toy hot wheels to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.049
 scale 1 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.840
 just waiting for me to find out how the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.420
 blocking under the very wide hood on 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.620
 find a five-cylinder in-line 3 beds 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.980
 2 tdci duratorq which makes 200 horses 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.850
 with a comfortable couple of 470 we 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.490
 early m 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.980
 unfortunately all at a price 2 160 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.170
 grams of CO2 per kilometer which we 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.360
 immediately gives a penalty of 6000 euros 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.800
 which is added to the forty thousand euros 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.800
 of all all options 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.130
 first if plastics are a small 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.610
 little rough but the appearance really 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.830
 solid 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.369
 the ranger really has nothing to envy to 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.320
 suv with a specific leather upholstery 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.660

 refrigerated glove box a gps with 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.550
 5-inch screen and there is even a system 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.710
 voice control to adjust the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.259
 radio up to air conditioning without 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.100
 have to move a finger

 little side skip kirk captain 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.989
 motor ties we will not forget also the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.760
 indispensable rearview camera with 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.129
 control screen in the rearview mirror 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.690
 central and proximity sensors that 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.620
 really is not a luxury when he 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.260
 is maneuver is a mastodon 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.760
 like this, let's not forget that the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.860
 talent of the ranger does not stop with the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.510
 bitumen by default it's a propulsion 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.250
 but with a wheel you can pass it 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.019
 in all-wheel drive with a range 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.849
 long or short speed 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.470
 and we can even electronically blocked 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:58.829

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.870
 conditions of advertising the basics being 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.430
 asked a question always remains the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.560
 same as for the vehicles I have 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.920
 already had or your daily life with 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.079
 a ford ranger or itrac in town on 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.010
 road or highway or even outside of 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.790
 the road is what we are going 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.790
