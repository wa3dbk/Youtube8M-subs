00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
that goal so in transistor you play red

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.750 
that goal so in transistor you play red

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
sword that almost looks like a like a

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.110 
sword that almost looks like a like a
something<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.220> should<00:05:02.460> go<00:05:02.580> into<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.850> computer

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
something that should go into a computer

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.960 
something that should go into a computer
it's<00:05:03.360> very<00:05:03.570> sci-fi<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.280> are<00:05:05.580> traveling

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
through the city and at first I thought

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.480 
through the city and at first I thought
it<00:05:07.170> was<00:05:07.320> going<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.560> be<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> platformer<00:05:08.220> but<00:05:08.250> it's

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
it was going to be a platformer but it's

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.910 
it was going to be a platformer but it's
actually<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.060> strategy<00:05:09.690> game<00:05:09.890> because<00:05:10.890> you

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
actually a strategy game because you

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.580 
actually a strategy game because you
setup<00:05:11.760> moves<00:05:12.090> in<00:05:12.450> advance<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:13.110> then<00:05:13.380> can<00:05:13.560> you

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
setup moves in advance and then can you

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.960 
setup moves in advance and then can you
complete<00:05:13.890> them<00:05:14.070> it's<00:05:14.310> complicated<00:05:14.880> but

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
complete them it's complicated but

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.180 
complete them it's complicated but
you'll<00:05:15.120> see<00:05:15.300> once<00:05:15.480> you<00:05:15.600> start<00:05:15.840> playing<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.230> but

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
you'll see once you start playing it but

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.980 
you'll see once you start playing it but
basically<00:05:17.280> once<00:05:17.970> again<00:05:18.210> we<00:05:18.330> have<00:05:18.480> a<00:05:18.510> game<00:05:18.720> that
