our<00:00:04.340> last<00:00:04.670> flower<00:00:05.090> is<00:00:05.540> this<00:00:05.750> really<00:00:06.260> pretty

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:06.439 
our last flower is this really pretty

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.350 
our last flower is this really pretty
one<00:00:06.680> that<00:00:06.830> we've<00:00:06.950> used<00:00:07.460> a<00:00:07.819> piece<00:00:08.330> of

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
one that we've used a piece of

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.320 
one that we've used a piece of
dictionary<00:00:08.990> paper<00:00:09.260> with<00:00:09.559> and<00:00:09.889> it's<00:00:10.639> it's<00:00:11.000> a

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
dictionary paper with and it's it's a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.699 
dictionary paper with and it's it's a
little<00:00:11.599> bit<00:00:11.719> more<00:00:11.839> difficult<00:00:12.019> than<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.559> other

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:12.709 
little bit more difficult than the other

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.079 
little bit more difficult than the other
two<00:00:12.769> but<00:00:13.160> it<00:00:13.280> really<00:00:13.429> finishes<00:00:13.910> off<00:00:14.059> the

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
two but it really finishes off the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.440 
two but it really finishes off the
cluster<00:00:14.719> nicely<00:00:15.370> okay<00:00:16.370> this<00:00:16.520> last<00:00:16.820> fire<00:00:17.150> we've

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
cluster nicely okay this last fire we've

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.840 
cluster nicely okay this last fire we've
cut<00:00:17.810> a<00:00:18.020> large<00:00:18.470> scout<00:00:18.920> circle<00:00:19.400> in<00:00:19.550> our<00:00:19.670> die<00:00:19.820> cut

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
cut a large scout circle in our die cut

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.110 
cut a large scout circle in our die cut
center<00:00:20.240> this<00:00:20.900> is<00:00:21.050> a<00:00:21.080> five<00:00:21.380> inch<00:00:21.620> circle<00:00:22.120> you

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
center this is a five inch circle you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.520 
center this is a five inch circle you
could<00:00:23.300> obviously<00:00:23.570> do<00:00:23.900> this<00:00:24.050> with<00:00:24.200> a<00:00:24.230> smaller

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
could obviously do this with a smaller

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.810 
could obviously do this with a smaller
circle<00:00:24.770> but<00:00:25.010> we<00:00:25.100> like<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.400> way<00:00:25.520> this<00:00:25.670> one

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
circle but we like the way this one

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.910 
circle but we like the way this one
turns<00:00:26.090> out<00:00:26.240> a<00:00:26.270> little<00:00:26.480> larger<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.500> I'm<00:00:27.740> going

cutting out books so wish I am and then

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.730 
cutting out books so wish I am and then
I'm<00:01:23.509> going<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.659> do<00:01:23.780> I'm<00:01:24.049> going<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.380> do<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.710> same

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
I'm going to do I'm going to do the same

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.590 
I'm going to do I'm going to do the same
with<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.460> centerpiece<00:01:26.030> which<00:01:26.210> we've<00:01:26.390> cut

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
with the centerpiece which we've cut

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.810 
with the centerpiece which we've cut
with<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.780> wavy<00:01:27.460> circle<00:01:28.460> punch

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.090 

there<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.940> go<00:01:36.350> okay<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.410> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.890> probably

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
there you go okay so this is probably

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.980 
there you go okay so this is probably
the<00:01:38.370> trickiest<00:01:38.700> part<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.930> that

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the trickiest part it's really not that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.090 
the trickiest part it's really not that
hard<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.410> you<00:01:40.530> might<00:01:40.770> need<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> little

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
hard but you might need a little

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.590 
hard but you might need a little
practice<00:01:41.370> on<00:01:41.730> them<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:41.940> kind<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> she<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.450> these

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
practice on them so kind of she of these

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830 
practice on them so kind of she of these
out<00:01:43.100> what<00:01:44.100> we're<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.910> i'm<00:01:45.270> using<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
out what we're going to do i'm using the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.590 
out what we're going to do i'm using the
art<00:01:46.050> glitter<00:01:46.380> dries<00:01:46.860> clear<00:01:47.190> glue<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:48.330> dries

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
art glitter dries clear glue which dries

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060

your fingers to really scrunch up the
center<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.810> will<00:02:57.989> make<00:02:58.080> your<00:02:58.260> petals

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
center and this will make your petals

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.930 
center and this will make your petals
come<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.280> little<00:02:59.400> further<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:01.730> make<00:03:02.730> them<00:03:02.910> a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
come in a little further and make them a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.470 
come in a little further and make them a
little<00:03:03.120> more<00:03:03.269> roughly<00:03:03.750> which<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.620> cute<00:03:05.480> so

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
little more roughly which is cute so

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.460 
little more roughly which is cute so
we're<00:03:06.570> just<00:03:06.600> going<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.900> kind<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.110> do<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.350> and

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
we're just going to kind of do that and

we're just going to kind of do that and
arrange<00:03:07.739> your<00:03:08.010> pedals<00:03:08.340> till<00:03:08.580> they<00:03:08.700> look<00:03:08.940> like

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
now let me do the same thing with this

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.270 
now let me do the same thing with this
little<00:03:15.930> circle<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.590> punched<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
little circle that we punched for the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.160 
little circle that we punched for the
center<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.390> I'm<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.630> going<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.840> make<00:03:18.989> my

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
center so I'm just going to make my

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.660 
center so I'm just going to make my
little<00:03:19.350> circle<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.340> glue<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:23.280> down<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.550> my

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
little circle of glue just down to my

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.430 
little circle of glue just down to my
hand<00:03:23.910> which<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.420> little<00:03:24.660> harder<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.050> do<00:03:25.200> and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
hand which is a little harder to do and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.960 
hand which is a little harder to do and
on<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.769> I'm<00:03:25.860> not<00:03:26.040> going<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> trim<00:03:26.610> off<00:03:26.640> any

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
on this so I'm not going to trim off any

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.630 
on this so I'm not going to trim off any
of<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.269> bottom<00:03:27.620> this<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.769> really<00:03:29.100> not<00:03:29.370> big

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
of the bottom this is really not big

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.710 
of the bottom this is really not big
enough<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.910> do<00:03:30.180> that

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
enough to do that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.060 
enough to do that
so<00:03:32.020> put<00:03:32.230> this<00:03:32.350> down<00:03:32.530> in<00:03:32.710> the<00:03:32.830> glue<00:03:34.770> open<00:03:35.770> up<00:03:35.890> the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
so put this down in the glue open up the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.770 
so put this down in the glue open up the
petals<00:03:38.700> take<00:03:39.700> your<00:03:39.910> fingers<00:03:40.330> in<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.570> dye<00:03:40.720> and
