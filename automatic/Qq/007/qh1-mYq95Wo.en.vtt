00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
cases are different than the later rib

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.750 
cases are different than the later rib
case<00:02:57.599> about<00:02:57.959> 25<00:02:58.470> they<00:02:58.680> changed<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.579> made

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
case about 25 they changed it and made

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.160 
case about 25 they changed it and made
it<00:02:59.790> actually<00:03:00.299> thicker<00:03:00.599> because<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.989> kept

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
it actually thicker because I kept

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.949 
it actually thicker because I kept
blowing<00:03:01.530> them<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:03.329> felt<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.630> little<00:03:03.810> more

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
blowing them up it felt a little more

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.670 
blowing them up it felt a little more
powerful<00:03:04.560> yeah<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:06.079> little<00:03:07.079> more<00:03:07.200> potent

powerful yeah a little more potent

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.420 
powerful yeah a little more potent
machine<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.200> have<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.650> done<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.859> thing<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.160> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
machine so I have not done a thing to it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.420 
machine so I have not done a thing to it
besides<00:03:11.579> let<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.090> sit<00:03:12.329> in<00:03:12.569> some<00:03:13.260> oil<00:03:14.180> and
