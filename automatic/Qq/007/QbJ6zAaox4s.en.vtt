00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.080
 see 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 you 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.810
 r 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 r 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 you 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 and 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900
 from where ing know 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.770
 the rumor that the sales sters 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.930
 the stolen things 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 the kind so one by one 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.410
 so that 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.050
 Walcott shot in October 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.480
 moment is a kind of fund 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.640
 the director 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.750
 so ahead 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 and certainly not there 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.240
 in every number 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 we want one 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 there or shares they would like it to be possible 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.290
 next to third paul le guen 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.630
 and if you want prorail 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.620
 3 the project 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.070
 we have 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.070
 but how the police report 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
 That is how the track will move forward to what the citizen 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.549
 although they managed to detect I have been in the spotlight 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.529
 the rest of the field 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.609
 hopefully that often happened extremely seriously
