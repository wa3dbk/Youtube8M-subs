it<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> very<00:01:37.770> very<00:01:38.070> long<00:01:38.280> game<00:01:38.490> place<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
it was a very very long game place you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.310 
it was a very very long game place you
can<00:01:38.909> imagine<00:01:39.090> getting<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.540> 100<00:01:39.960> kill<00:01:40.110> streak

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.630 
can imagine getting a 100 kill streak
would<00:01:40.409> take<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> quite<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> while<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.369> achieve

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
would take a quite a while to achieve

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.420 
would take a quite a while to achieve
even<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> fastest<00:01:42.869> rates<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
even at the fastest rates and the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
even at the fastest rates and the
biggest<00:01:44.759> thing<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.090> gameplay<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
biggest thing about this gameplay I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.240 
biggest thing about this gameplay I
guess<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.869> stress<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.799> didn't<00:01:47.070> have

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
guess that I can stress is I didn't have

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.370 
guess that I can stress is I didn't have
on<00:01:47.399> specialist<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.210> didn't<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.990> any<00:01:49.200> sort

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
on specialist I didn't have on any sort

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.230 
on specialist I didn't have on any sort
of<00:01:49.500> specialist<00:01:50.040> kill<00:01:50.220> streaks<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> wasn't

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
of specialist kill streaks so I wasn't

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.789 
of specialist kill streaks so I wasn't
collecting<00:01:51.630> perks<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.320> was<00:01:52.649> only

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
collecting perks at all I was only

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
go-around with the air support once I

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.810

could have gotten a 73 gun only kill
streak<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:44.220> hundred<00:02:44.760> total<00:02:44.879> kills<00:02:45.239> without

using specialists my palos did quite a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.089 
using specialists my palos did quite a
bit<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.959> work<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:49.319> there<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.440> call<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:49.829> mom

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099

I got an assault mom very very early on

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.210 
I got an assault mom very very early on
in<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.349> gameplay<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.829> almost<00:02:52.950> about

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
in this gameplay it's almost about

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.039 
in this gameplay it's almost about
halfway<00:02:53.430> through<00:02:53.609> here<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.150> I'm<00:02:54.660> also<00:02:54.840> went

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
halfway through here and I'm also went

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.569 
halfway through here and I'm also went
ahead<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.349> defuse<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.829> bomb<00:02:55.980> miles<00:02:56.310> at<00:02:56.430> it

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
ahead and defuse the bomb miles at it

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.130 
ahead and defuse the bomb miles at it
the<00:02:56.970> reason<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.269> called<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.629> mob<00:02:57.750> right<00:02:57.930> there

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the reason I called the mob right there

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.020 
the reason I called the mob right there
is<00:02:58.260> because<00:02:58.409> I'm<00:02:59.250> trying<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.519> be<00:02:59.579> as<00:02:59.700> much<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.849> a

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
is because I'm trying to be as much of a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.280 
is because I'm trying to be as much of a
team<00:03:00.180> player<00:03:00.390> as<00:03:00.510> possible<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.049> still<00:03:01.170> get

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
team player as possible and still get

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.960 
team player as possible and still get
plenty<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.590> kills<00:03:01.859> but<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.519> notice<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.819> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
plenty of kills but to notice that the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.250 
plenty of kills but to notice that the
enemy<00:03:03.180> team<00:03:03.209> had<00:03:03.390> planted<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.780> bomb<00:03:03.900> off<00:03:04.079> and

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
enemy team had planted the bomb off and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.899 
enemy team had planted the bomb off and
we're<00:03:04.349> already<00:03:04.530> down<00:03:04.709> one<00:03:04.980> round<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.400> didn't

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
we're already down one round I didn't

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.970 
we're already down one round I didn't
want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> risk<00:03:06.720> losing<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.319> objective<00:03:07.829> and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
want to risk losing that objective and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.170 
want to risk losing that objective and
then<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> whole<00:03:08.549> game<00:03:08.700> would<00:03:08.819> have<00:03:08.909> been<00:03:09.000> lost

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
then the whole game would have been lost

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.759 
then the whole game would have been lost
so<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.959> great<00:03:10.109> thing<00:03:10.230> about<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.440> Moab<00:03:10.709> and

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
so the great thing about the Moab and

having the move in your back pocket is

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.550 
having the move in your back pocket is

such a small map like dome you really

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.689 
such a small map like dome you really
need<00:03:51.750> every<00:03:52.139> bolt<00:03:52.349> that<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.709> get<00:03:52.889> and

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
then my backup bang an MP 9 suppress

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.750 
then my backup bang an MP 9 suppress
means<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.709> get<00:03:55.769> them<00:03:55.980> even<00:03:56.250> more<00:03:56.400> rounds

here every once again there you go just

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.589 
here every once again there you go just
more<00:03:59.220> proof<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.940> know<00:04:00.060> it's<00:04:00.180> not<00:04:00.329> you

unfortunately<00:04:05.970> enough<00:04:06.209> for<00:04:06.389> me<00:04:06.510> though<00:04:06.810> we

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
unfortunately enough for me though we

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.479 
unfortunately enough for me though we
did<00:04:07.199> get<00:04:07.319> a<00:04:07.379> couple<00:04:07.530> guys<00:04:07.829> to<00:04:07.859> replace<00:04:08.250> them

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.979 
did get a couple guys to replace them
and<00:04:08.669> then<00:04:09.180> those<00:04:09.299> guys<00:04:09.329> leave<00:04:09.750> immediately

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
and then those guys leave immediately

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.170 
and then those guys leave immediately
and<00:04:10.440> then<00:04:10.560> come<00:04:10.769> back<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:12.000> whole

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
right now so you can get the first quad

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.980 
right now so you can get the first quad
mode<00:04:39.129> and<00:04:39.400> demolition<00:04:39.969> and<00:04:40.330> I'm<00:04:40.509> so<00:04:40.659> far<00:04:40.840> we've

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
mode and demolition and I'm so far we've

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.869 
mode and demolition and I'm so far we've
each<00:04:41.080> had<00:04:41.110> triples<00:04:41.590> several<00:04:41.919> times<00:04:42.159> but<00:04:42.759> um

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
each had triples several times but um

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.149 
each had triples several times but um
quad<00:04:43.360> mode<00:04:43.539> is<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:43.990> very<00:04:44.289> very<00:04:44.439> difficult<00:04:44.860> to

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
quad mode is just very very difficult to

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.369 
quad mode is just very very difficult to
pull<00:04:45.310> off<00:04:45.449> think<00:04:46.449> about<00:04:46.569> a<00:04:46.599> quad<00:04:46.840> mode<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.229> that

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
pull off think about a quad mode is that

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.559 
pull off think about a quad mode is that
you<00:04:47.500> can't<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:48.550> have<00:04:48.639> to<00:04:48.729> die<00:04:48.909> four<00:04:49.180> times<00:04:49.449> you

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
you can't you have to die four times you

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:50.700 
you can't you have to die four times you
have<00:04:49.659> to<00:04:49.750> get<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.870> hundred<00:04:50.169> kills<00:04:50.379> in<00:04:50.560> that

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
have to get a hundred kills in that

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.649 
have to get a hundred kills in that
small<00:04:51.099> time<00:04:51.639> period<00:04:51.789> and<00:04:52.270> even<00:04:52.509> though<00:04:52.569> it's

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
small time period and even though it's

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.570 
small time period and even though it's
about<00:04:52.750> 15<00:04:53.169> minutes<00:04:53.469> to<00:04:53.560> get<00:04:53.710> 100<00:04:54.069> kills<00:04:54.340> and

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
about 15 minutes to get 100 kills and

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.670 
about 15 minutes to get 100 kills and
then<00:04:54.639> die<00:04:54.879> in<00:04:54.939> between<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.569> not<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.349> know<00:04:56.439> die

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
then die in between and not you know die

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.230 
then die in between and not you know die
more<00:04:56.979> than<00:04:57.159> four<00:04:57.370> times<00:04:57.520> it's<00:04:57.789> pretty<00:04:57.879> rough

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
more than four times it's pretty rough

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.300 
more than four times it's pretty rough

the reason I did really well with
without<00:06:11.379> using<00:06:11.680> specialist<00:06:12.159> is<00:06:12.279> because<00:06:12.940> I

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
without using specialist is because I

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.339 
without using specialist is because I

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
that specialist kill streak you feel

that's a big thing that people should

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:40.170 
that's a big thing that people should
realize<00:06:38.199> in<00:06:38.500> games<00:06:38.770> is<00:06:38.979> a<00:06:39.430> lot<00:06:39.610> of<00:06:39.729> guys<00:06:39.880> think

not<00:06:48.769> always<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.369> truth<00:06:49.729> I<00:06:49.879> think<00:06:50.089> that

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:50.209 
not always the truth I think that

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.729 
not always the truth I think that
there's<00:06:50.389> a<00:06:50.479> lot<00:06:50.599> more<00:06:50.659> to<00:06:51.139> it<00:06:51.169> than<00:06:51.409> that

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:51.739 
there's a lot more to it than that

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:53.439 
there's a lot more to it than that
whenever<00:06:52.249> I<00:06:52.309> rush<00:06:52.579> a<00:06:52.610> spawn<00:06:52.939> I<00:06:52.969> always<00:06:53.269> make

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
whenever I rush a spawn I always make

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:54.909 
whenever I rush a spawn I always make
sure<00:06:53.479> I've<00:06:53.629> got<00:06:53.659> cover<00:06:54.199> in<00:06:54.409> front<00:06:54.529> of<00:06:54.709> me<00:06:54.799> and

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 
sure I've got cover in front of me and

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.079 
sure I've got cover in front of me and
I'm<00:06:54.979> thinking<00:06:55.339> you<00:06:55.399> know<00:06:55.459> where's<00:06:55.699> enemy<00:06:55.969> team

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:56.089 
I'm thinking you know where's enemy team

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:59.049 
I'm thinking you know where's enemy team
going<00:06:56.239> to<00:06:56.299> be<00:06:56.419> at<00:06:56.679> notice<00:06:57.679> 90%<00:06:58.459> of<00:06:58.489> my<00:06:58.579> kills<00:06:58.849> I

00:06:59.049 --> 00:06:59.059 
going to be at notice 90% of my kills I

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:00.999 
going to be at notice 90% of my kills I
kill<00:06:59.239> them<00:06:59.299> from<00:06:59.449> behind<00:06:59.599> also<00:07:00.379> notice<00:07:00.860> here

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009 
kill them from behind also notice here

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.589 
kill them from behind also notice here
is<00:07:01.129> when<00:07:01.249> I<00:07:01.279> start<00:07:01.579> to<00:07:01.729> just<00:07:01.879> disregard<00:07:02.239> my

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
is when I start to just disregard my

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.689 
is when I start to just disregard my
killstreaks<00:07:02.839> entirely<00:07:03.319> I<00:07:03.619> think<00:07:04.369> that's<00:07:04.519> the

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
killstreaks entirely I think that's the

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.189 
killstreaks entirely I think that's the
first<00:07:04.969> or<00:07:05.149> second<00:07:05.449> Osprey<00:07:05.749> chopper<00:07:06.019> gunner

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 
first or second Osprey chopper gunner

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.649 
first or second Osprey chopper gunner
that<00:07:06.259> I've<00:07:06.409> replaced<00:07:06.909> they<00:07:07.909> don't<00:07:08.089> stack<00:07:08.419> so

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659 
that I've replaced they don't stack so

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:09.909 
that I've replaced they don't stack so
when<00:07:08.779> you<00:07:08.869> get<00:07:09.019> more<00:07:09.199> than<00:07:09.259> one<00:07:09.619> if<00:07:09.799> you<00:07:09.889> just

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
when you get more than one if you just

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.949 
when you get more than one if you just
if<00:07:10.369> there's<00:07:10.759> already<00:07:11.089> one<00:07:11.329> there<00:07:11.569> they<00:07:11.779> just

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:11.959 
if there's already one there they just

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:14.289 
if there's already one there they just
doesn't<00:07:12.199> get<00:07:12.259> replaced<00:07:12.649> and<00:07:12.889> these<00:07:13.849> guys<00:07:14.089> were

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:14.299 
doesn't get replaced and these guys were

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:16.689 
doesn't get replaced and these guys were
just<00:07:14.539> horrible<00:07:15.139> horrible<00:07:15.309> you'll<00:07:16.309> notice<00:07:16.549> on

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:16.699 
just horrible horrible you'll notice on

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:17.829 
just horrible horrible you'll notice on
the<00:07:16.819> other<00:07:16.939> team<00:07:17.149> I'm<00:07:17.299> just<00:07:17.479> getting<00:07:17.689> like

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:17.839 
the other team I'm just getting like

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.149 
the other team I'm just getting like
triples<00:07:18.289> kind<00:07:18.649> of<00:07:18.739> all<00:07:18.829> over<00:07:18.979> the<00:07:19.039> place

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:19.159 
triples kind of all over the place

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:20.319 
triples kind of all over the place
because<00:07:19.309> they<00:07:19.579> weren't<00:07:19.789> very<00:07:19.819> good<00:07:20.089> players

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:20.329 
because they weren't very good players

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:22.299 
because they weren't very good players
and<00:07:21.259> this<00:07:21.469> is<00:07:21.589> just<00:07:21.739> one<00:07:21.829> of<00:07:21.889> those<00:07:21.979> magic

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:22.309 
and this is just one of those magic

and this is just one of those magic
lobbies<00:07:22.610> I<00:07:22.699> think<00:07:22.909> where<00:07:23.059> I<00:07:23.089> just<00:07:23.179> happened<00:07:23.689> to

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:23.779 
lobbies I think where I just happened to

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:25.779
