00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.940
 hi my name is barbara i'm a teacher 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.550
 at the budokan association that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 It runs the dojo center of Milan I 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.260
 I deal with modern tribal oriental dance 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.820
 fusion and various mergers 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.250
 today I will explain to you what the benefits are 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.560
 of modern oriental dance on the body 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.690
 the modern oriental dance to multiple 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.270
 benefits both from the physical point of view 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.290
 that from the psychological point of view 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.300
 it also serves to tone the muscles 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.570
 especially the abdominal one 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 of the arms and that of the legs and gods 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.470
 buttocks oriental and modern dance in the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 which I deal with differs from that 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.460
 oriental because of the sinuous movements 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.739
 typical of dance at its origins 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.590
 they are joined by smaller movements 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 with greater muscle control 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.630
 moreover it is used more 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.120
 dynamic the stage space is the music 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.729
 which is used is more contemporary 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.620
 compared to that of oriental dance 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.409
 classic that uses ethnic sounds 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.390
 we talked about the benefits it has 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 modern oriental dance on the body in 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.650
 specific the most part 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 involved is that of the abdomen i 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.880
 sinuous movements but also those a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.880
 just a little more controlled are needed 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.369
 to tone up and specifically come 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.960
 use undulations that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.070
 all three bands are involved 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.840
 abdominal 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.820
 also i 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.960
 precisely small movements with the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.530
 muscle control 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.210
 call the shots that involve both the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.799
 part of the abdomen but also the part of the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 hips here we find therefore one 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.610
 toning of both buttocks and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.439
 abdomen 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.450
 also the posture in oriental dance is 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.909
 very important as regards the center of gravity 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.460
 low the basin behind and the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.830
 knees bent this typical posture 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.930
 it also serves to tone the lower part 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.509
 of the body as the whole skin 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.270
 leg muscles in tension 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.740
 when the main steps are taken 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 also the upper part of the body is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.569
 involved in this specific dance e 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.060
 the arms are used a lot 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.190
 through soft and sinuous movements 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.170
 fluids used for toning 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.720
 muscle strengthening 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.730
 the lesson generally lasts for an hour 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.550
 an hour and a half and to keep fit 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.220
 I think it is necessary to practice this 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.520
 type of dance at least once or twice 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.520
 per week
