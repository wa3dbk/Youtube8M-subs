00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
fall into a pit and explode violently I

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.780 
fall into a pit and explode violently I
guess<00:02:28.560> there<00:02:28.769> must<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.130> something<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.640> makes

you<00:02:29.970> explode<00:02:30.480> off<00:02:30.750> screen<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.320> those<00:02:31.440> bits

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
you explode off screen in those bits

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.820 
you explode off screen in those bits
because<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.820> don't<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.560> why<00:02:34.560> am<00:02:34.709> i

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.160 

you<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.090> either<00:03:26.180> shoot<00:03:26.510> those<00:03:26.750> guys<00:03:26.960> while

you can either shoot those guys while

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.570 
you can either shoot those guys while
they're<00:03:27.320> jumping<00:03:27.680> or<00:03:27.830> let<00:03:27.980> them<00:03:28.130> fall<00:03:28.310> into

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
the pit either way worse and now we

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.430 
the pit either way worse and now we
carve<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.350> path<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.620> destruction<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.930> also<00:03:36.110> see

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
carve a path of destruction you also see

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.040 
carve a path of destruction you also see
oil<00:03:36.470> slider<00:03:37.070> blocks<00:03:37.460> up<00:03:37.730> there<00:03:38.020> which<00:03:39.020> is

oil slider blocks up there which is

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.480 
oil slider blocks up there which is
pretty<00:03:39.440> odd<00:03:41.860> because<00:03:42.860> that<00:03:43.100> implies<00:03:43.220> that

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
pretty odd because that implies that

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.310 
pretty odd because that implies that
you'd<00:03:43.820> actually<00:03:44.000> bother<00:03:44.480> playing<00:03:44.840> his<00:03:45.080> oil

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
you'd actually bother playing his oil

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.760 
you'd actually bother playing his oil
man<00:03:46.630> at<00:03:47.630> first<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:47.990> guess<00:03:48.110> you<00:03:48.230> could<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.560> come

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
man at first I guess you could just come

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.920 
man at first I guess you could just come
back<00:03:48.890> as<00:03:49.070> mega<00:03:49.310> man<00:03:49.580> oil<00:03:50.210> man<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:50.510> really<00:03:50.750> hard

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
to play as he only gets one shot at his

to play as he only gets one shot at his

screen he can't shoot again is what I

screen he can't shoot again is what I

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
jump farther so from our awkward to

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.580 
jump farther so from our awkward to
control<00:04:04.360> also<00:04:05.360> he<00:04:05.690> involves<00:04:06.140> running<00:04:06.290> into

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
control also he involves running into

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.210 
control also he involves running into
the<00:04:06.680> boss<00:04:06.860> all<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.340> time<00:04:08.620> now<00:04:09.620> let's<00:04:09.650> try<00:04:10.160> for

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
the boss all the time now let's try for

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.830 
the boss all the time now let's try for
some<00:04:11.060> bomb<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.630> fight

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:36.440 

this<00:04:18.840> looks<00:04:19.050> like<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.230> safe<00:04:19.470> environment<00:04:35.450> it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
this looks like a safe environment it

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.050 
this looks like a safe environment it
was<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:36.780> clever<00:04:37.050> bomb<00:04:37.410> man<00:04:37.730> you<00:04:38.730> should<00:04:38.910> get<00:04:39.000> a

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
job that involves your cleverness and

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.580 
job that involves your cleverness and
