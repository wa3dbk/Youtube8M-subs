00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
this is CTB TV we're here today at the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.929 
this is CTB TV we're here today at the
second<00:00:23.670> launch<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.119> crash-test<00:00:24.779> Barbies<00:00:25.199> boat

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
second launch of crash-test Barbies boat

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
second launch of crash-test Barbies boat
what<00:00:26.939> happened<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> first<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.019> well<00:00:28.980> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
what happened with the first one well it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.669 
what happened with the first one well it
didn't<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.210> work<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.750> way<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:30.900> wanted<00:00:31.439> you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
didn't really work the way we wanted you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.520 
didn't really work the way we wanted you
know<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.009> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.940> didn't<00:00:33.210> move<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.840> kind

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
know it kind of didn't move and it kind

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.400 
know it kind of didn't move and it kind
of<00:00:34.620> didn't<00:00:35.160> float<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.870> we've<00:00:37.050> totally

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
of didn't float and so we've totally

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.470 
of didn't float and so we've totally
redesigned<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> new<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.270> we're

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
redesigned this is a new one we're

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
redesigned this is a new one we're
really<00:00:39.750> excited<00:00:40.050> we've<00:00:40.680> incorporated<00:00:41.010> rocket

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
really excited we've incorporated rocket

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
really excited we've incorporated rocket
engines<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.300> well<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.110> auxiliary

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
engines as well as an auxiliary

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.490 
engines as well as an auxiliary
secondary<00:00:44.280> propulsion<00:00:45.210> unit<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:46.289> think

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
secondary propulsion unit and we think

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
secondary propulsion unit and we think
it's<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> light<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.120> move

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it's just going to light up and move

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.790 
it's just going to light up and move
across<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.870> water<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.530> when<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
across the water and then when the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680 
across the water and then when the
rocket<00:00:50.579> engines<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> auxiliary<00:00:51.449> power

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
rocket engines get the auxiliary power

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.729 
rocket engines get the auxiliary power
is<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.430> boom<00:00:53.930> cross<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.170> pond<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
is just going to boom cross the pond and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
is just going to boom cross the pond and
then<00:00:56.149> Nestle<00:00:57.149> gently<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.629> against<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> shore

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
then Nestle gently up against the shore

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
then Nestle gently up against the shore
all<00:00:58.680> spent<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> exhausted<00:00:59.719> then<00:01:00.719> we'll

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
all spent and exhausted then we'll

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
all spent and exhausted then we'll
probably<00:01:00.930> smoke<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.430> high<00:01:02.609> hopes

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
probably smoke so you have high hopes

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.050 
probably smoke so you have high hopes
for<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.120> run<00:01:03.449> oh<00:01:03.719> yeah<00:01:04.610> our<00:01:05.610> design

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
for this run oh yeah our design

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
for this run oh yeah our design
incorporates<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.990> finest<00:01:07.680> materials<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
incorporates the finest materials that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.859 
incorporates the finest materials that
we<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> find<00:01:09.650> we<00:01:10.650> are<00:01:10.890> using<00:01:11.420> sd's<00:01:12.420> rocket

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
we can find we are using sd's rocket

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.780 
we can find we are using sd's rocket
engines<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.619> powerful<00:01:14.130> ones<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> they<00:01:14.670> go

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
engines really powerful ones and they go

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.690 
engines really powerful ones and they go
into<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.170> block<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.470> manifold<00:01:17.130> block<00:01:17.430> made
