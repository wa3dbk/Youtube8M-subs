how<00:01:55.350> depth<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.130> field<00:01:56.430> works<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.939> now<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
how depth of field works and now the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.050 
how depth of field works and now the
best<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.469> show<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.829> how<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.219> really

with<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.939> frog<00:02:03.240> who<00:02:03.810> I've<00:02:03.960> become<00:02:04.369> well

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
with this frog who I've become well

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
with this frog who I've become well
acquainted<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:06.719> does<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.990> actually

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
acquainted to but what does it actually

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.190 
acquainted to but what does it actually
look<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.429> get<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> picture<00:02:08.940> at<00:02:09.270> 1.8

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
look like when you get a picture at 1.8

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.460 
look like when you get a picture at 1.8
first<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.830> picture<00:02:11.160> at<00:02:11.390> 22<00:02:12.390> what's<00:02:12.870> going<00:02:13.260> on

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
first a picture at 22 what's going on

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.880 
first a picture at 22 what's going on
here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.760 
here
well<00:02:14.280> what's<00:02:14.460> going<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:16.020> your<00:02:16.470> depth

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
well what's going on is that your depth

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.850 
well what's going on is that your depth
of<00:02:16.920> field<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.490> changing<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:18.360> shallow<00:02:19.260> depth<00:02:19.710> of

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
of field is changing a shallow depth of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.170 
of field is changing a shallow depth of
field<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.310> what<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.610> see<00:02:20.880> when<00:02:21.060> you're

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
field is what you see when you're

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.990 
field is what you see when you're
shooting<00:02:21.360> at<00:02:21.600> 1.8<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.380> very<00:02:22.770> narrow<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.850> your

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
shooting at 1.8 it's very narrow so your

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900 
shooting at 1.8 it's very narrow so your
focus<00:02:24.300> point<00:02:24.750> or<00:02:25.080> your<00:02:25.680> area<00:02:26.040> focus<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.580> very

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
focus point or your area focus is very

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.750 
focus point or your area focus is very
small<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.020> numbers<00:02:28.440> go<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.980> all<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.670> way

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
small as the numbers go up all the way

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.660 
small as the numbers go up all the way
here<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.120> 22<00:02:30.660> your<00:02:31.410> focus<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.040> changing<00:02:32.550> so

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
here to 22 your focus is changing so

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.280 
here to 22 your focus is changing so
more<00:02:32.940> things<00:02:33.210> are<00:02:33.330> gonna<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.660> focus<00:02:33.900> from

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
more things are gonna be in focus from

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.680 
more things are gonna be in focus from
front<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.800> back<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.760> that's<00:02:36.030> important<00:02:36.600> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
front to back so that's important to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.570 
front to back so that's important to
keep<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.020> mind<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.710> what<00:02:37.860> we're<00:02:38.040> doing<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.370> is

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
keep in mind so what we're doing here is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.520 
keep in mind so what we're doing here is
I'm<00:02:38.670> gonna<00:02:38.760> photograph<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.480> Frog<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.959> I'm

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
I'm gonna photograph the Frog and I'm

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.490 
I'm gonna photograph the Frog and I'm
gonna<00:02:40.709> focus<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.400> its<00:02:41.550> eye<00:02:41.700> at<00:02:42.090> 1.8<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
gonna focus in on its eye at 1.8 and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.900 
gonna focus in on its eye at 1.8 and
then<00:02:43.590> I'm<00:02:43.680> gonna<00:02:43.770> work<00:02:44.010> my<00:02:44.220> way<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.880> way

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
then I'm gonna work my way all the way

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
then I'm gonna work my way all the way
up<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.209> 22<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.530> what's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
up to 22 so that you can see what's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.320 
up to 22 so that you can see what's
happening<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> background<00:02:47.850> then<00:02:48.209> we're

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
happening to the background then we're

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.360 
happening to the background then we're
gonna<00:02:48.420> talk<00:02:48.690> about<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.290> figure<00:02:49.680> out<00:02:49.890> you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
gonna talk about it and figure out you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.920 
gonna talk about it and figure out you
know<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.670> little<00:02:50.880> subtleties<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.690> are

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
know the little subtleties that are

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
know the little subtleties that are
going<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.860> right<00:02:53.190> now<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> camera

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
going on so right now I have the camera

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.240 
going on so right now I have the camera
set<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.270> aperture<00:02:54.870> priority<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.920> aperture

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
set to aperture priority but aperture

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.890 
set to aperture priority but aperture
priority<00:02:56.489> means<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.150> am<00:02:57.300> setting<00:02:57.600> my

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
priority means that I am setting my

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.470 
priority means that I am setting my
aperture<00:02:58.290> I'm<00:02:59.040> picking<00:02:59.640> where<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.850> want<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.360> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
aperture I'm picking where I want it and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.500 
aperture I'm picking where I want it and
the<00:03:01.200> camera<00:03:01.800> is<00:03:01.950> then<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.730> select<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the camera is then going to select the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.500 
the camera is then going to select the
shutter<00:03:03.810> speed<00:03:04.050> for<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.739> proper<00:03:05.220> exposure

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
shutter speed for a proper exposure

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.180 
shutter speed for a proper exposure
let's<00:03:06.510> shoot<00:03:06.660> at<00:03:06.780> one<00:03:06.930> point<00:03:07.170> eight<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.950> I'm<00:03:08.040> at

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
let's shoot at one point eight so I'm at

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.130 
let's shoot at one point eight so I'm at
one<00:03:08.370> point<00:03:08.580> eight<00:03:08.760> right<00:03:08.940> now<00:03:09.090> I'm<00:03:09.390> focused<00:03:09.959> in

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
one point eight right now I'm focused in

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.430 
one point eight right now I'm focused in
on<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.709> frogs<00:03:10.980> eye<00:03:11.250> boom<00:03:12.150> that's<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:13.200> point

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
on the frogs eye boom that's one point

eight let's take it to F two point eight
yeah<00:03:17.820> she's<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> nice<00:03:18.330> smile<00:03:19.190> now<00:03:20.190> I'm<00:03:20.310> making

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
yeah she's a nice smile now I'm making

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.490 
yeah she's a nice smile now I'm making
sure<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.269> almost<00:03:21.510> did<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.080> here<00:03:22.290> I'm<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.440> to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
sure I almost did this here I'm going to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.740 
sure I almost did this here I'm going to
shoot<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.830> there<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.640> cut<00:03:24.000> her<00:03:24.120> finger<00:03:24.450> off<00:03:24.480> and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
shoot it there I cut her finger off and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.390 
shoot it there I cut her finger off and
I<00:03:24.780> saw<00:03:25.019> it<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:25.739> why<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.950> didn't<00:03:26.160> shoot<00:03:26.280> it

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
I saw it so that's why I didn't shoot it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.009 
I saw it so that's why I didn't shoot it
initially<00:03:26.880> but<00:03:27.000> now<00:03:27.060> I'm<00:03:27.989> recomposing<00:03:30.019> boom

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
initially but now I'm recomposing boom

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.229 
initially but now I'm recomposing boom
I'm<00:03:31.530> making<00:03:32.130> sure<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.459> have<00:03:32.640> her<00:03:32.850> finger

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
I'm making sure that I have her finger

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.509 
I'm making sure that I have her finger
in<00:03:33.390> there<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.070> really

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
in there and I do so that is really

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.610 
in there and I do so that is really
sharp<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.450> can<00:03:36.660> see<00:03:37.019> in<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.260> pictures<00:03:37.590> that

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
sharp you can see in the pictures that

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.380 
sharp you can see in the pictures that
the<00:03:37.860> background<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.580> nice<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.000> blown<00:03:39.209> out

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
the background is nice and blown out

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.180 
the background is nice and blown out
when<00:03:39.600> we<00:03:39.660> talk<00:03:39.840> about<00:03:40.140> blowing<00:03:40.410> out<00:03:40.650> it's

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
when we talk about blowing out it's

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.580 
when we talk about blowing out it's
compressed<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.269> that's<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.080> point<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.350> using

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
compressed so that's the point of using

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.500 
compressed so that's the point of using
a<00:03:43.650> piece<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.340> glass<00:03:44.519> like<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.420> I'm

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
a piece of glass like this and I'm

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.850 
a piece of glass like this and I'm
probably<00:03:45.720> gonna<00:03:45.959> switch<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.560> bigger

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
probably gonna switch to the bigger

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.440 
probably gonna switch to the bigger
piece<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.220> glass<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.670> three<00:03:47.910> hundred<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.299> eight

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
piece of glass to three hundred to eight

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.570 
piece of glass to three hundred to eight
in<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.690> few<00:03:48.900> minutes<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.590> we<00:03:49.769> can<00:03:50.040> see<00:03:50.220> how

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
in a few minutes so that we can see how

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.340 
in a few minutes so that we can see how
we<00:03:50.640> can<00:03:50.850> really<00:03:51.239> compress<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.930> background

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
we can really compress the background

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.110 
we can really compress the background
step<00:03:52.650> away<00:03:52.799> from<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.190> tree<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.610> make<00:03:54.090> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
step away from the tree and make a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.060 
step away from the tree and make a
parking<00:03:54.570> lot<00:03:54.600> look<00:03:55.320> really<00:03:55.560> awesome<00:03:55.860> so<00:03:55.980> we're

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
parking lot look really awesome so we're

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.860 
parking lot look really awesome so we're
gonna<00:03:56.160> come<00:03:56.430> back<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:57.030> in<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.720> couple

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
gonna come back to that in a couple

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.800 
gonna come back to that in a couple
seconds<00:03:58.730> well<00:03:59.730> why<00:03:59.880> don't<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.090> sit<00:04:00.360> back<00:04:00.390> on

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
seconds well why don't you sit back on

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.680 
seconds well why don't you sit back on
it<00:04:01.130> just<00:04:02.130> face<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.850> way<00:04:03.030> but<00:04:03.209> just<00:04:03.330> rest<00:04:03.630> your

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
it just face that way but just rest your

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.430 
it just face that way but just rest your
tuchus<00:04:04.019> on<00:04:04.320> on<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:06.630> now<00:04:06.750> we're<00:04:06.900> ready<00:04:07.140> to

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
tuchus on on it so now we're ready to

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.710 
tuchus on on it so now we're ready to
photograph<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.340> swing<00:04:08.610> here<00:04:08.880> I'm<00:04:09.090> locking<00:04:09.390> in

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
photograph the swing here I'm locking in

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.979 
photograph the swing here I'm locking in
on<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.440> tripod<00:04:10.709> just<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.640> have<00:04:11.790> a

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
on the tripod just so that I have a

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.390 
on the tripod just so that I have a
something<00:04:12.989> that's<00:04:13.140> not<00:04:13.260> moving<00:04:13.320> so<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.310> each

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
something that's not moving so that each

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.759 
something that's not moving so that each
image<00:04:14.670> kind<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.390> stays<00:04:15.570> similar<00:04:16.019> right<00:04:16.620> now

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
image kind of stays similar right now

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.310 
image kind of stays similar right now
I'm<00:04:16.919> set<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.459> shutter<00:04:18.450> priority<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:19.229> that

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
I'm set to shutter priority and that

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.110 
I'm set to shutter priority and that
means<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.400> am<00:04:20.459> setting<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.850> shutter

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
means that I am setting the shutter

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.550 
means that I am setting the shutter
speed<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.630> camera<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.109> going<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.320> do<00:04:22.440> the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
speed and the camera is going to do the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.960 
speed and the camera is going to do the
rest<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.039> work<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.370> make<00:04:23.460> sure<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.789> it's

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
rest of the work to make sure that it's

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.060 
rest of the work to make sure that it's
exposed<00:04:24.419> properly<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:25.320> I'm<00:04:25.680> going<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.890> start

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
exposed properly so I'm going to start

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.410 
exposed properly so I'm going to start
at<00:04:26.220> one<00:04:26.669> tenth<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.210> a

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
at one tenth of a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.930 
at one tenth of a
ii<00:04:27.720> remember<00:04:28.170> how<00:04:28.440> slow<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.770> was<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.760> could

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
ii remember how slow that was you could

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.810 
ii remember how slow that was you could
hear<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.450> sound<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:31.800> how<00:04:31.980> slow<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.460> was<00:04:32.610> when

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
hear the sound of how slow that was when

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.940 
hear the sound of how slow that was when
we<00:04:32.850> were<00:04:33.050> testing<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.260> letting<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:34.530> hear<00:04:34.800> the

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
we were testing and letting you hear the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.620 
we were testing and letting you hear the
different<00:04:35.310> shutter<00:04:35.460> speeds<00:04:35.610> now<00:04:36.270> let's<00:04:36.510> see

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
different shutter speeds now let's see

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.280 
different shutter speeds now let's see
what<00:04:36.780> happens<00:04:37.110> when<00:04:37.560> we<00:04:37.710> move<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.130> swing<00:04:38.430> and

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
what happens when we move the swing and

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.960 
what happens when we move the swing and
shoot<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.440> at<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> tenth<00:04:40.890> of<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.100> second<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.910> i'm

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
shoot it at a tenth of a second so i'm

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.250 
shoot it at a tenth of a second so i'm
going<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.150> try<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.360> capture<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.840> swing<00:04:46.050> at<00:04:46.170> the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
going to try to capture the swing at the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.070 
going to try to capture the swing at the
very<00:04:46.440> bottom<00:04:46.680> boom<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.940> as<00:04:48.540> we<00:04:48.690> look<00:04:48.870> at<00:04:48.990> the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
very bottom boom and as we look at the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.900 
very bottom boom and as we look at the
swing<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.620> can<00:04:49.770> see<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:50.280> it's<00:04:50.400> it's<00:04:50.610> kind<00:04:50.850> of

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
swing you can see that it's it's kind of

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.980 
swing you can see that it's it's kind of
hard<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.150> see<00:04:51.330> because<00:04:51.480> it's<00:04:51.630> actually

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
hard to see because it's actually

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.350 
hard to see because it's actually
blurring<00:04:52.890> its<00:04:53.670> blurring<00:04:54.030> because<00:04:54.300> the

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
blurring its blurring because the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.930
