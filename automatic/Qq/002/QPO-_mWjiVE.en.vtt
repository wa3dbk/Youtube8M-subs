so<00:00:00.690> I'm<00:00:00.750> going<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:00.960> show<00:00:01.140> you<00:00:01.170> how<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.909> solder<00:00:02.909> a

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
so I'm going to show you how to solder a

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.880 
so I'm going to show you how to solder a
very<00:00:03.560> very<00:00:04.560> thin<00:00:04.980> band<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.670> two<00:00:06.290> very<00:00:07.290> small

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
very very thin band on two very small

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.390 
very very thin band on two very small
bezel<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> two<00:00:09.090> millimeter<00:00:09.420> bezel

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
bezel this is a two millimeter bezel

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.580 
bezel this is a two millimeter bezel
that<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.550> made<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> round<00:00:12.509> stone<00:00:12.809> now<00:00:13.559> I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
that I made it's for a round stone now I

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.440 
that I made it's for a round stone now I
made<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.160> one<00:00:14.400> open<00:00:14.759> back<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:15.179> because<00:00:15.330> I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
made this one open back just because I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.840 
made this one open back just because I
probably<00:00:16.440> won't<00:00:16.770> actually<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.340> using<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.699> for

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
probably won't actually be using it for

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.330 
probably won't actually be using it for
advanced<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> show<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.340> usually

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
advanced just to show you I usually

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.300 
advanced just to show you I usually
close<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.800> we're<00:00:22.920> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.100> take

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
close that up so we're going to take

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.269 
close that up so we're going to take
this<00:00:23.810> it's<00:00:24.810> about<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.380> millimeter<00:00:25.590> band<00:00:26.070> on

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this it's about a one millimeter band on

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.859 
this it's about a one millimeter band on
a<00:00:26.310> two<00:00:26.550> millimeter<00:00:27.439> bezel<00:00:28.439> cup<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.820> I'm<00:00:30.750> going

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
a two millimeter bezel cup and I'm going

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.299 
a two millimeter bezel cup and I'm going
to<00:00:30.929> show<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.050> how<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.529> how<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> solder

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to show you how to do that how to solder

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.319 
to show you how to do that how to solder
this<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:33.210> third<00:00:33.600> hand<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:35.329> flat

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
this on with third hand and then flat

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.760 
this on with third hand and then flat
solder<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.899> may<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.170> wire<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:39.500> paste<00:00:40.500> I

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
solder you may have wire or paste I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.810 
solder you may have wire or paste I
don't<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> help<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> face

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
don't know how to help you with the face

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.700 
don't know how to help you with the face
I've<00:00:42.059> never<00:00:42.239> used<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.570> before<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.440> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I've never used that before but if you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
I've never used that before but if you
have<00:00:43.860> wire<00:00:44.129> solder<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:45.960> of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
have wire solder you can just kind of

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.170 
have wire solder you can just kind of
hammer<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.530> flat<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.039> cut<00:00:47.610> off<00:00:47.760> little<00:00:48.000> pieces

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
hammer it flat and cut off little pieces

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.760 
hammer it flat and cut off little pieces
it's<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.110> easier<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.710> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it's going to be a lot easier for you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.430 
it's going to be a lot easier for you
because<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.160> need<00:00:50.449> some<00:00:51.449> very<00:00:51.809> small<00:00:52.199> solder

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
because you need some very small solder

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.420 
because you need some very small solder
for<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.480> first<00:00:54.690> thing<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.430> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
for this so the first thing that I do to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.590 
for this so the first thing that I do to
actually<00:00:56.820> start<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.090> soldering<00:00:57.480> process

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
actually start the soldering process

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.889 
actually start the soldering process
after<00:00:58.440> I've<00:00:58.530> made<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> bezel<00:00:59.190> cup<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.899> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
after I've made the bezel cup and the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
after I've made the bezel cup and the
band<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> ring<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.730> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> set

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
band for the ring is I just kind of set

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.300 
band for the ring is I just kind of set
it<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:04.010> what's<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.159> little<00:01:05.280> better

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.790 

I've<00:01:11.790> already<00:01:12.030> done<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.710> obviously

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
I've already done this but you obviously

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.240 
I've already done this but you obviously
should<00:01:14.430> make<00:01:14.640> sure<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.040> band<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
should make sure that the the band is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
should make sure that the the band is
very<00:01:18.170> nicely<00:01:19.170> filed<00:01:19.710> before<00:01:20.550> you<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.080> so

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
very nicely filed before you do this so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.710 
very nicely filed before you do this so
that<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.320> fits<00:01:23.090> pretty<00:01:24.090> well<00:01:26.479> what<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> want

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that it fits pretty well what you want

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.040 
that it fits pretty well what you want
it<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:29.130> bezel<00:01:30.000> cup<00:01:30.240> held

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
it to do is to have the bezel cup held

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.600 
it to do is to have the bezel cup held
in<00:01:32.119> by<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> band<00:01:33.800> without<00:01:34.800> using<00:01:35.100> any<00:01:35.220> special

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
in by the band without using any special

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.030 
in by the band without using any special
methods<00:01:36.330> before<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.869> actually<00:01:37.080> solder<00:01:37.800> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
methods before you actually solder it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
methods before you actually solder it
it's<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> make<00:01:38.850> things<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.330> whole<00:01:39.360> lot

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
it's going to make things a whole lot

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:49.630 
it's going to make things a whole lot
easier<00:01:39.750> yeah

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.550 

I<00:01:49.670> kind<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.480> wanted<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.750> be<00:01:50.930> perfect<00:01:51.320> so

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
I kind of wanted to be perfect so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.130 
I kind of wanted to be perfect so
they're<00:01:51.740> with<00:01:51.950> me

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.550 

okay<00:01:58.010> it<00:01:58.790> looks<00:01:58.940> pretty<00:01:59.210> good<00:01:59.360> if<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.350> see

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
okay it looks pretty good if you can see

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.040 
okay it looks pretty good if you can see
that<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.860> looks<00:02:01.790> pretty<00:02:02.060> flush<00:02:02.390> all<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.810> way

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
that it looks pretty flush all the way

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.990 
that it looks pretty flush all the way
across<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.710> bottom<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:04.190> course<00:02:04.700> I'm<00:02:04.820> going<00:02:04.940> to

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
across the bottom of course I'm going to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.020 
across the bottom of course I'm going to
go<00:02:05.060> in<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.300> file<00:02:05.480> that<00:02:05.740> or<00:02:06.740> mom<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.670> smooth<00:02:07.910> it

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
go in and file that or mom to smooth it

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.440 
go in and file that or mom to smooth it
out<00:02:08.149> with<00:02:08.330> my<00:02:08.539> little<00:02:09.110> rotary<00:02:09.320> tool<00:02:10.420> but<00:02:11.420> I

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
out with my little rotary tool but I

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.030 
out with my little rotary tool but I
want<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.900> as<00:02:11.990> perfect<00:02:12.110> as<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.530> can<00:02:12.590> get<00:02:12.890> it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
want it to be as perfect as I can get it

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.590 
want it to be as perfect as I can get it
before<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.490> actually<00:02:13.610> put<00:02:14.090> solder<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:14.690> it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
before I actually put solder on it

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.500 
before I actually put solder on it
which<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.810> like<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.170> check<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.650> way<00:02:19.510> make

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
which I like to check it this way make

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.460 
which I like to check it this way make
sure<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.080> straight

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.080 

I'm<00:02:25.950> gonna<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.400> go<00:02:26.490> back<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.820> do<00:02:26.940> this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
I'm gonna have to go back and do this

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.210 
I'm gonna have to go back and do this
again<00:02:27.380> sometimes<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.590> gets<00:02:28.740> knocked<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.070> of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
again sometimes it gets knocked out of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.530 
again sometimes it gets knocked out of
place<00:02:29.370> when<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.610> put<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> third<00:02:30.300> hand

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
place when I put it in the third hand

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:40.280 
place when I put it in the third hand
tweezers<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:33.510> takes<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.930> lot<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.080> patience

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.190 

okay<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:42.209> what<00:02:42.330> I'm<00:02:42.390> going<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.569> do<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.900> I've<00:02:43.049> got

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
okay so what I'm going to do is I've got

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
okay so what I'm going to do is I've got
these<00:02:43.470> these<00:02:44.189> tweezers<00:02:44.610> set<00:02:44.849> up<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:46.220> do

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
these these tweezers set up and I do

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.610 
these these tweezers set up and I do
this<00:02:47.370> was<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.579> pretty<00:02:48.030> much<00:02:48.239> every<00:02:49.140> ring<00:02:49.379> that<00:02:49.590> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
this was a pretty much every ring that I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.649 
this was a pretty much every ring that I
make<00:02:49.950> with<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> setting<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.329> this<00:02:52.250> because<00:02:53.250> I

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
make with a setting like this because I

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.660 
make with a setting like this because I
do<00:02:54.659> not<00:02:54.840> put<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.680> setting<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.099> top<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.579> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
do not put the setting on top of the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.250 
do not put the setting on top of the
band<00:02:56.849> I<00:02:56.970> usually<00:02:57.510> do<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:57.780> coming<00:02:58.019> out<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
band I usually do it coming out of the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.259 
band I usually do it coming out of the
sides<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:59.159> I'm<00:02:59.760> just<00:02:59.819> gonna<00:03:00.060> get

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
sides like this so I'm just gonna get

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.300 
sides like this so I'm just gonna get
down<00:03:00.450> here<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.840> take<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.110> look<00:03:03.950> flip<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.069> over

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
down here and take a look flip this over

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.800 
down here and take a look flip this over
and<00:03:05.489> use<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> smooth<00:03:06.120> part<00:03:07.909> something<00:03:08.909> a<00:03:09.359> little

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and use a smooth part something a little

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.420 
and use a smooth part something a little
bit<00:03:09.900> bigger<00:03:10.109> it's<00:03:10.349> not<00:03:10.590> too<00:03:10.829> hard<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.159> find<00:03:11.280> a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
bit bigger it's not too hard to find a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
bit bigger it's not too hard to find a
smooth<00:03:11.640> part<00:03:11.909> on<00:03:12.030> my<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.629> my<00:03:12.690> block<00:03:13.079> here<00:03:13.319> but

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
smooth part on my on my block here but

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.220 
smooth part on my on my block here but
this<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.159> is<00:03:14.810> just<00:03:15.810> going<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.989> stab

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
this little one is just going to stab

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.330 
this little one is just going to stab
usually<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:16.920> harden<00:03:17.579> I<00:03:18.230> let<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.349> flux<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.190> it's

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
usually I harden I let the flux do it's

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.580 
usually I harden I let the flux do it's
bubbling<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.450> all<00:03:21.659> of<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.810> before<00:03:22.379> I<00:03:22.409> put

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
bubbling and all of that before I put

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.910 
bubbling and all of that before I put
the<00:03:22.920> solder<00:03:23.129> on<00:03:24.290> because<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.409> tends<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.709> knock

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the solder on because it tends to knock

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.729 
the solder on because it tends to knock
the<00:03:26.069> solder<00:03:26.310> out<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.670> place<00:03:27.079> if<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.230> see<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.500> I

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
the solder out of place if I see it I

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.759 
the solder out of place if I see it I
don't<00:03:28.920> know<00:03:29.010> if<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:30.109> correct<00:03:31.109> or

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
don't know if this is like correct or

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.550 
don't know if this is like correct or
not<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.099> usually<00:03:32.549> put<00:03:32.870> some<00:03:33.870> flux<00:03:34.200> on<00:03:34.379> there

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
not I usually put some flux on there

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.470 
not I usually put some flux on there
when<00:03:34.709> it's<00:03:34.889> hot<00:03:35.010> if<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.670> see<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:35.940> little<00:03:36.150> spot

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
when it's hot if I see a little spot

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.229 
when it's hot if I see a little spot
that's<00:03:36.780> not<00:03:37.489> done<00:03:38.489> correctly

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
that's not done correctly

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.259 
that's not done correctly
like<00:03:40.139> there's<00:03:40.319> not<00:03:40.440> enough<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.829> there<00:03:41.269> and

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
like there's not enough in there and

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.849 
like there's not enough in there and
that's<00:03:42.420> where<00:03:42.599> I<00:03:42.629> get<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.870> all<00:03:42.959> over<00:03:43.139> my<00:03:43.260> block

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.110 

it<00:03:46.859> just<00:03:47.099> gives<00:03:47.280> me<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.459> little<00:03:47.519> bit<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.879> peace

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
it just gives me a little bit of peace

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.680 
it just gives me a little bit of peace
of<00:03:48.329> mind<00:03:48.569> when<00:03:48.870> I'm<00:03:49.019> doing<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.560> guess

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
of mind when I'm doing it I guess

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.069 
of mind when I'm doing it I guess
alright<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.049> there's<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.840> did<00:03:54.840> the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
alright so there's that and I did the

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.589 
alright so there's that and I did the
best<00:03:55.290> little<00:03:55.560> cup<00:03:55.919> in<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:57.480> probably

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
best little cup in you probably

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.300 
best little cup in you probably
shouldn't<00:03:57.959> touch<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.560> little<00:03:59.010> bit<00:03:59.129> warm

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
shouldn't touch that a little bit warm

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.900 
shouldn't touch that a little bit warm
but<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.030> did<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.329> bezel<00:04:00.599> cup<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:01.489> hard<00:04:02.489> solder

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
but I did the bezel cup in hard solder

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.759 
but I did the bezel cup in hard solder
which<00:04:03.359> is<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.690> pretty<00:04:03.900> much<00:04:04.019> do<00:04:04.260> hard<00:04:04.500> solder

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
which is I pretty much do hard solder

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.580 
which is I pretty much do hard solder
for<00:04:05.010> everything<00:04:05.810> that's<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.930> very<00:04:07.109> small<00:04:07.379> piece

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
for everything that's a very small piece

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.750 
for everything that's a very small piece
of<00:04:07.739> solder<00:04:07.919> I<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.250> put<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.430> there<00:04:08.639> I'll<00:04:08.730> show

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
of solder I just put on there I'll show

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.199 
of solder I just put on there I'll show
you<00:04:10.370> I'll<00:04:11.370> show<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.639> another<00:04:11.790> one<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.120> don't

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
you I'll show you another one I don't

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.330 
you I'll show you another one I don't
have<00:04:12.419> one<00:04:12.780> that's<00:04:13.650> quite<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.949> right<00:04:14.160> oh

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
have one that's quite the right oh

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.930 
have one that's quite the right oh
that's<00:04:15.030> good

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
that's good

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.879 
that's good
so<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.239> about<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.599> size<00:04:18.780> I'm<00:04:18.959> using<00:04:19.169> it's

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
so this is about the size I'm using it's

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.640 
so this is about the size I'm using it's
really<00:04:20.430> small<00:04:20.750> no<00:04:21.750> more<00:04:22.019> than<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.260> thickness

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
really small no more than the thickness

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.260 
really small no more than the thickness
of<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.860> band<00:04:23.039> this<00:04:23.340> one's<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.699> little<00:04:23.849> bit<00:04:24.060> big

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
of the band this one's a little bit big

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.409 
of the band this one's a little bit big
but<00:04:24.449> it<00:04:24.810> won't<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:26.190> won't<00:04:26.430> glob<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:27.030> won't<00:04:27.270> do

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
but it won't it won't glob it won't do

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.490 
but it won't it won't glob it won't do
that<00:04:27.570> organic<00:04:28.440> looking<00:04:29.990> glob<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.199> solder<00:04:31.380> on

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
that organic looking glob of solder on

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:39.340 
that organic looking glob of solder on
the<00:04:31.620> top<00:04:32.659> it's<00:04:33.659> like<00:04:33.720> playing<00:04:34.110> operation<00:04:35.120> okay

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.190 

it<00:04:39.860> looks<00:04:40.010> pretty<00:04:40.130> good<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:40.840> I've<00:04:41.840> got<00:04:41.990> two

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
it looks pretty good so I've got two

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.690 
it looks pretty good so I've got two
pieces<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.740> solder<00:04:42.950> on<00:04:43.160> there<00:04:43.340> right<00:04:43.490> on<00:04:43.610> the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
pieces of solder on there right on the

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.660 
pieces of solder on there right on the
joint<00:04:43.910> pretty<00:04:44.810> small<00:04:45.050> pieces<00:04:45.490> about<00:04:46.490> the

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
joint pretty small pieces about the

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.330 
joint pretty small pieces about the
thickness<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.240> band<00:04:47.420> so<00:04:47.660> I<00:04:48.650> my<00:04:48.980> side<00:04:49.190> or

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
thickness of the band so I my side or

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.220 
thickness of the band so I my side or
these<00:04:49.460> on<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:49.790> hopefully<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.510> flame<00:04:50.810> doesn't

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
these on and hopefully the flame doesn't

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.550 
these on and hopefully the flame doesn't
cause<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:52.510> solder<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.660> fly<00:04:54.050> off

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
cause the solder to fly off

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.350 
cause the solder to fly off
sometimes<00:04:55.520> when<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:55.790> solder<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.090> really

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
sometimes when the solder is really

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.840 
sometimes when the solder is really
really<00:04:56.540> small<00:04:56.810> little<00:04:57.130> they'll<00:04:58.130> fly<00:04:58.400> off<00:04:58.580> just

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
really small little they'll fly off just

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.760 
really small little they'll fly off just
from<00:04:59.030> the<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.880> flame<00:05:02.150> going<00:05:02.390> so<00:05:02.990> give<00:05:03.650> her<00:05:03.740> a

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
from the the flame going so give her a

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.200 
from the the flame going so give her a
shot

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.480 

with<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.990> third<00:05:08.199> hand<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.560> usually<00:05:08.979> started<00:05:09.370> at

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
with the third hand I usually started at

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.499 
with the third hand I usually started at
the<00:05:09.580> top<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:11.229> part<00:05:11.440> above<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:12.070> deal<00:05:12.509> because

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
the top the part above this deal because

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:14.969 
the top the part above this deal because
it<00:05:13.750> heats<00:05:13.960> up<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.199> tweezers<00:05:14.530> too<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:14.889> that

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
it heats up the tweezers too and that

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.570 
it heats up the tweezers too and that
helps<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.990> seems<00:05:17.289> to<00:05:17.470> work<00:05:17.500> better<00:05:17.889> for<00:05:18.220> me<00:05:18.370> it

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
helps it seems to work better for me it

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:33.330 
helps it seems to work better for me it
stops<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.500> metal<00:05:20.500> from<00:05:20.710> expanding<00:05:21.370> so<00:05:21.699> much

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.020 

sometimes<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:35.560> band<00:05:35.830> will<00:05:36.160> expand<00:05:36.730> and

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
sometimes the the band will expand and

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.870 
sometimes the the band will expand and
then<00:05:37.270> it'll<00:05:37.480> drop<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:38.170> setting<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:39.160> that<00:05:39.610> is

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
then it'll drop the setting and that is

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.840 
then it'll drop the setting and that is
really<00:05:40.300> not<00:05:40.420> good<00:05:40.750> oh<00:05:41.050> there<00:05:41.590> it<00:05:41.650> went<00:05:41.850> all

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
really not good oh there it went all

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.290 
really not good oh there it went all
right<00:05:43.030> oh<00:05:44.430> if<00:05:45.430> you<00:05:45.520> saw<00:05:45.669> that<00:05:45.820> but<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.090> solder

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
right oh if you saw that but the solder

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.760 
right oh if you saw that but the solder
flowed<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.780> looks<00:05:46.960> like<00:05:47.080> there<00:05:47.230> was<00:05:47.320> plenty<00:05:47.590> of

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
flowed it looks like there was plenty of

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.040 
flowed it looks like there was plenty of
it<00:05:48.040> but<00:05:48.190> not<00:05:48.400> not<00:05:49.270> too<00:05:49.480> much<00:05:49.660> so<00:05:50.400> there<00:05:51.400> we<00:05:51.520> go

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
it but not not too much so there we go

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.970 
it but not not too much so there we go
that<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.790> not<00:05:54.790> bad<00:05:55.060> I<00:05:55.300> didn't<00:05:55.650> don't<00:05:56.650> mind<00:05:56.830> the

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
that is not bad I didn't don't mind the

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.190 
that is not bad I didn't don't mind the
ring<00:05:57.190> it's<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.700> it's<00:05:58.360> not<00:05:58.540> completely<00:05:59.050> round

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
ring it's a it's not completely round

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.100 
ring it's a it's not completely round
yet<00:05:59.500> I<00:05:59.530> was<00:05:59.740> going<00:05:59.919> to<00:05:59.980> do<00:06:00.100> that<00:06:00.130> afterwards<00:06:01.110> so

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
yet I was going to do that afterwards so

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.379 
yet I was going to do that afterwards so
yeah<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:03.040> looks<00:06:03.250> like<00:06:03.340> there<00:06:03.580> was<00:06:03.639> just<00:06:03.700> enough

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
yeah it looks like there was just enough

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.750 
yeah it looks like there was just enough
solder<00:06:04.630> and<00:06:05.020> we<00:06:05.770> got<00:06:05.919> it<00:06:06.040> to<00:06:06.160> flow<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.640> we

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
solder and we got it to flow and we

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.740 
solder and we got it to flow and we
didn't<00:06:07.060> melt<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:08.020> seams<00:06:08.260> on<00:06:08.470> my<00:06:08.560> bezel<00:06:08.890> cup<00:06:09.100> so

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
didn't melt the seams on my bezel cup so

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.640 
didn't melt the seams on my bezel cup so
I'd<00:06:10.750> say<00:06:10.900> that's<00:06:11.050> a<00:06:11.640> success
