 Hello, my name is Maureen Guryevich 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.279
 director of online store world 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.980
 beautiful 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.610
 i will tell you bites from natural 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.309
 coral 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.940
 classic round shape which 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.140
 called leten beads from natural 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.350
 coral the so-called classic of the genre 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.490
 beautiful rich juicy color 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.980
 nothing tinted that is it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.019
 natural color 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.189
 natural corals if you take a look 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.250
 tons every bead can even 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.380
 consider drawing the coral itself besides 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.329
 moreover on these natural coral beads 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.969
 there may be minor 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.620
 defects, for example, weigh as if 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.250
 it seems small not even original 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.469
 smooth to my school but small defect 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.510
 it is admissible and superfluous 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.750
 proof that it is natural 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.989
 coral, these may be even fingernail I am now 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.719
 I feel it is so ribbed that is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.329
 it is the texture of natural coral 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.180
 color a little bit non-uniform again this 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.150
 due to the very pattern of these 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.890
 natural sea ​​corals 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.560
 Generally beads from coral they are 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.159
 different diameter most often they 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.460
 collected either on the sharp or on the thread 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.950
 Musa looks especially beautiful 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.770
 threading thread 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.400
 that is, they will lie more smoothly on 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.790
 the lines of your shoulders and clavicle are beautiful 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.060
 emphasizes the neckline and in general 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.610
 beads collected causing no more durable 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 which is also pretty nice you can't 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 accidentally breaking them so beads 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.390
 natural coral is very bright 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.750
 crucian carp 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.530
 the item that should be in the box 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.479
 almost any woman with that 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.050
 decorations you definitely left no 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.880
 go unnoticed
