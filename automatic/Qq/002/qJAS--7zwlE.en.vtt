00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.290
 a novelty from the blooms of autumn 2014 this 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.049
 system type he plus bluemotion which 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.510
 allows you to combine yourself two different 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.510
 systems it is opening facades without handles 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.590
 and at the same time smooth closing due to 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.420
 recent moment this was possible 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.780
 only when using our system 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.860
 servo-drive is electric 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.720
 pusher which is powered by 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.060
 special power supply is located 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.740
 in the back of the case 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.740
 when using this system we 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.940
 we get even more ease of installation then 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.980
 there is no need to get tied to an electrician 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.310
 and and there mount somewhere behind here 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.270
 it costs a little less than I do 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.450
 now the system 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 This system is currently available. 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.890
 Is there a box game for our new boxes ? 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.150
 it may soon be available for 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.150
 our other nomination systems 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.380
 our sample is represented on this 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.539
 tefund plus bluemotion system in section 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.780
 that is, these are two special guides 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.360
 with bluemotion system i.e. with smooth 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.759
 closing them extra 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.159
 elements on it themselves 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.469
 pushers type it if necessary 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.070
 put a synchronizer between them and in 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:32.789
 rear of the rail mounted 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.789
 trigger mate 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.280
 once again pay attention to the small 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.610
 clearance required for operation 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.810
 system type he as well as smooth ride 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.810
 when closing
