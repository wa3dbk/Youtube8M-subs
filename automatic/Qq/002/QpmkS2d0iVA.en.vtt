the<00:06:43.479> canopy<00:06:44.099> the<00:06:45.099> fabric<00:06:45.490> that<00:06:45.610> I<00:06:45.669> chose<00:06:46.149> it's

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659 
the canopy the fabric that I chose it's

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.040 
the canopy the fabric that I chose it's
like<00:06:46.779> a<00:06:46.809> light<00:06:47.139> blue<00:06:47.580> with<00:06:48.580> a<00:06:48.719> floral<00:06:49.719> print

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
like a light blue with a floral print

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.589 
like a light blue with a floral print
and<00:06:50.349> then<00:06:50.499> the<00:06:50.619> inside<00:06:51.219> is<00:06:51.909> this<00:06:52.149> grey<00:06:52.419> and

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
and then the inside is this grey and

and then the inside is this grey and
white<00:06:53.459> print<00:06:54.459> it<00:06:55.360> just<00:06:55.599> has<00:06:55.749> like<00:06:55.959> a<00:06:55.990> stitched

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.409 
white print it just has like a stitched

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:01.109 
white print it just has like a stitched
edge<00:06:56.709> on<00:06:57.009> it<00:06:57.159> I<00:06:57.399> think<00:06:57.759> too<00:06:57.969> you<00:06:58.029> fancy<00:07:00.119> so

00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:01.119 
edge on it I think too you fancy so

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:05.850 
edge on it I think too you fancy so
there's<00:07:01.449> the<00:07:03.719> knot<00:07:04.719> just<00:07:04.749> like<00:07:05.019> drapes<00:07:05.559> down

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
there's the knot just like drapes down

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.959 
there's the knot just like drapes down
and<00:07:06.249> then<00:07:06.399> in<00:07:06.849> the<00:07:06.999> back<00:07:07.239> I<00:07:08.009> did<00:07:09.009> in<00:07:09.279> elastic

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
and then in the back I did in elastic

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:11.639 
and then in the back I did in elastic
and<00:07:10.119> this<00:07:10.300> is<00:07:10.479> not<00:07:10.629> typically<00:07:11.079> how<00:07:11.319> they<00:07:11.379> come

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:11.649 
and this is not typically how they come

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.040 
and this is not typically how they come
this<00:07:11.829> is<00:07:11.979> just<00:07:12.159> my<00:07:12.309> own<00:07:12.339> way<00:07:13.179> of<00:07:13.209> doing<00:07:13.389> it<00:07:13.839> so

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
this is just my own way of doing it so

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.239 
this is just my own way of doing it so
that<00:07:14.800> you<00:07:15.839> can<00:07:16.839> have<00:07:17.229> it<00:07:17.409> be<00:07:17.589> fitted<00:07:18.009> to<00:07:18.039> the

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:18.249 
that you can have it be fitted to the

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:20.429 
that you can have it be fitted to the
car<00:07:18.399> seat<00:07:18.849> so<00:07:19.479> that<00:07:19.509> it's<00:07:19.779> not<00:07:19.959> like<00:07:20.139> another

00:07:20.429 --> 00:07:20.439 
car seat so that it's not like another

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.709 
car seat so that it's not like another
corner<00:07:21.069> hanging<00:07:21.490> here<00:07:21.789> and<00:07:21.999> here<00:07:22.240> and<00:07:22.360> making

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:22.719 
corner hanging here and here and making

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:26.129 
corner hanging here and here and making
it<00:07:22.839> like<00:07:23.019> really<00:07:23.289> bulky<00:07:23.829> and<00:07:24.369> then<00:07:24.819> it<00:07:25.809> just

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139 
it like really bulky and then it just

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.100 
it like really bulky and then it just
fitted<00:07:26.649> like<00:07:26.860> along<00:07:27.819> the<00:07:27.849> bottom<00:07:28.329> with<00:07:28.929> an

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
fitted like along the bottom with an

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.069 
fitted like along the bottom with an
elastic<00:07:29.909> so<00:07:30.909> that's<00:07:31.059> just<00:07:31.149> how<00:07:31.329> I<00:07:31.360> make<00:07:31.869> them

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:32.079 
elastic so that's just how I make them

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:37.980 
elastic so that's just how I make them
so<00:07:33.209> and<00:07:34.209> then<00:07:34.749> I<00:07:35.550> chose<00:07:36.550> these<00:07:36.849> I<00:07:37.209> think

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
so and then I chose these I think

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.409 
so and then I chose these I think
they're<00:07:38.169> called<00:07:38.469> cutout<00:07:38.860> buttons<00:07:39.309> for<00:07:40.240> it

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:40.419 
they're called cutout buttons for it

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.739 
they're called cutout buttons for it
it's<00:07:41.050> like<00:07:41.229> little<00:07:41.439> pearly<00:07:42.119> and<00:07:43.119> then<00:07:43.300> it's

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:43.749 
it's like little pearly and then it's

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:46.319 
it's like little pearly and then it's
just<00:07:43.959> a<00:07:44.110> standard<00:07:44.499> buttonhole<00:07:45.099> and<00:07:45.149> sewn<00:07:46.149> on

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:46.329 
just a standard buttonhole and sewn on
