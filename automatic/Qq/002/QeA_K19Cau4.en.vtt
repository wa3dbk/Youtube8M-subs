00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.220
 who of us does not dance the toad in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.220
 his childhood 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.100
 wow wow 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 Blog 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.800
 everything remember that beautiful stage of the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.920
 where life will get together with girls 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.899
 point and join with children and files to 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.750
 opposite of today than to get together with children 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.579
 and tell fucking with girls is also 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.960
 of fucking prototype and they will not let me lie 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.850
 that many of us would like 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.800
 return to moments of that beautiful stage 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.449
 of life and nine people for more than 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.980
 20 years that perhaps are the most 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.780
 they will identify with moments that I am going to 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.399
 mention in this video I do not know if you 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.409
 remember that sentence I did not decide 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.409
 everything that was when the last goal 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.240
 no mames was that phrase you want to run 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.220
 with half a lung on the outside it did not matter 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.110
 if you had the pinche ray de sol over 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.970
 of god sitting barefoot but there's 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.310
 difficult you arrived last because 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.990
 that became hot or auto, but not 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.520
 They needed to give truth to anyone. 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.800
 crouch for him like nowhere 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.750
 it was just automatic auto and 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.580
 after this you had bullying for a 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.770
 good time make you follow the chubby 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.330
 that I did not run much because you suffered many 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.910
 of bullying and not necessarily for being 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.460
 fat but to come and what to say of the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.920
 fucking power that had the word and 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.229
 you could stop the entire mechanism of the game 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.850
 with that simple word and all because you 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.010
 you were pissing you had to go take 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.330
 now imagine that that word had 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.330
 validity throughout our lives 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.870
 we are going to do no matter 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.900
 please have my uncles the Arab 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.000
 he said I was going to look or going to drink water 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.380
 put together for a new layoff I ask and today 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.480
 we can realize that children 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.120
 they show their value and simone day taking out 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.130
 your iphone ipad tablet or any 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.870
 cellular with operating systems that I 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.849
 I'm just beginning to understand when 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.340
 I remember before that what really 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.500
 it made you look like a chingÃ³n what 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.480
 I really let you see like a champion 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.430
 and it really felt like 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.319
 you had a millennial treasure in your 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.769
 hands was this 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.599
 to play a pinche mountain of cups the 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.760
 that had the biggest mountain is 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.950
 his will be the most chinky because you could 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.129
 lose everything you could lose your fucking 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.730
 Lunch tourist your backpack and whatever 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.769
 but your fucking cases I do not remember that 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.629
 We even bought the blankets only 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.670
 for the case of the edges the blankets 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.079
 let's fuck your mother while 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.609
 now it's the other way around we buy up 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.260
 now if the deal is sent to the 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.419
 fucking and we swallowed all the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.340
 factories that's why we're good spikes 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.079
 crazy and you have to admit that when 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.090
 we were children we were much more 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.980
 brave that today because we encourage ourselves to 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.930
 do nonsense pranks and not for 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.590
 money neither for reproductions nor for 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.590
 subscribers 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.959
 we did it for the simple fact that 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.959
 tell us and do not chew 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.040
 and that was enough to encourage us to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.040
 do things 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.550
 fucking bastards and bullying and that 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.710
 only for the children's pains 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.710
 now more before the bullying 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.610
 and more because there is of you euros 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.880
 woe to you if you came screaming with your 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.880
 mom 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.669
 so that bullying is 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.740
 relatively I'm going number I really do not 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.870
 I feel that I have suffered definitively and 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.000
 they said of things they threw me guerrilla 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.160
 They hit me occasionally slaps and 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.630
 that is, but here I am, I say no 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.630
 I suffer from trauma or anything 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.900
 and there is no doubt that childhood for me 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.880
 It is one of the most beautiful stages of the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.440
 life that many times we would like to have 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.540
 the way how to return to these 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.490
 moments because it's wonderful to remember 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.500
 like a ball in the case of men 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.420
 some dolls in the case of women and 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.700
 a couple of friends was enough to be 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.960
 happy everyone and I know that as we go 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.970
 growing we are filling up 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.070
 commitments and responsibilities but of 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.900
 truth never leave that child that leads to 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.360
 be from time to time with is from a 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.610
 insanity in its measure I do it and of 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.750
