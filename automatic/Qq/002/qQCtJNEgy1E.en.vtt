and then use them all at the obelisk at
the<00:01:20.070> same<00:01:20.280> time<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:20.850> basically<00:01:21.210> means<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the same time which basically means you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
the same time which basically means you
can<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.020> carry<00:01:22.290> more<00:01:22.650> things<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> obelisk

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
disintegration right like it does not

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
disintegration right like it does not
take<00:01:36.420> long<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:37.110> spirit<00:01:37.920> Diamond

items<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.310> rare<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.240> if

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
items are really rare I don't know if

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.520 
items are really rare I don't know if
you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.540> buy<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.930> sell<00:01:46.140> them<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you can buy and sell them off of the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.840 
you can buy and sell them off of the
grand<00:01:46.770> exchange<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.460> something<00:01:47.640> I'm

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
grand exchange so that's something I'm

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.539 
grand exchange so that's something I'm
definitely<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> try<00:01:48.420> right<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.549> okay

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
definitely going to try right now okay

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340 
definitely going to try right now okay
so<00:01:50.610> after<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.270> checking<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> cannot<00:01:52.200> buy

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
so after just checking you cannot buy

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
so after just checking you cannot buy
and<00:01:52.590> sell<00:01:52.829> them<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.159> grand<00:01:53.399> exchange<00:01:53.610> so

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and sell them on the grand exchange so

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
and sell them on the grand exchange so
they<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.180> completely<00:01:54.509> based<00:01:55.110> off<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> monster

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
they are completely based off of monster

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.380 
they are completely based off of monster
drops<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.369> whatever<00:01:56.670> drops<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.240> get

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
prepare them you get no exp for

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.910 
prepare them you get no exp for
preparing<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.630> now<00:04:13.630> we're<00:04:13.959> going<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.260> use

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
preparing and now we're going to use

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.819 
preparing and now we're going to use
these<00:04:15.220> on<00:04:15.579> a<00:04:15.640> gem<00:04:16.329> like<00:04:16.539> that<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.709> will

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
these on a gem like that and it will

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.099 
these on a gem like that and it will
store<00:04:18.250> them<00:04:18.489> it'll<00:04:19.239> store<00:04:19.479> them<00:04:19.630> in<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.840> gem

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
store them it'll store them in the gem

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.870 
store them it'll store them in the gem
that's<00:04:20.260> really<00:04:20.530> cool<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.039> we<00:04:21.310> can<00:04:21.549> go<00:04:21.580> ahead

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
that's really cool and we can go ahead

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.719 
that's really cool and we can go ahead
and<00:04:22.060> use<00:04:22.479> this<00:04:22.720> on<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.020> gem<00:04:23.229> here<00:04:23.580> they're<00:04:24.580> all

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
and use this on the gem here they're all

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.570 
and use this on the gem here they're all
stored<00:04:25.030> there

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
stored there

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.540 
stored there
and<00:04:26.439> we<00:04:27.439> can<00:04:27.620> go<00:04:27.740> ahead<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.009> we<00:04:28.159> can<00:04:28.280> craft

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
and we can go ahead and we can craft

to summoning opolis alright so we are at
the<00:04:47.120> obelisk<00:04:47.569> here<00:04:47.870> we're<00:04:48.530> going<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.740> go<00:04:48.919> ahead

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
the obelisk here we're going to go ahead

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.010 
the obelisk here we're going to go ahead
and<00:04:49.900> use<00:04:50.900> these<00:04:51.469> right<00:04:52.310> on<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:53.120> obelisk<00:04:53.689> and

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
and use these right on the obelisk and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.270 
and use these right on the obelisk and
get<00:04:54.439> some<00:04:54.650> unicorn<00:04:55.009> pouches<00:04:55.520> like<00:04:55.939> normal<00:04:56.389> and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
get some unicorn pouches like normal and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.390 
get some unicorn pouches like normal and
just<00:04:58.280> like<00:04:59.210> that<00:04:59.680> everything<00:05:00.680> from<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.099> gems

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
just like that everything from the gems

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.459 
just like that everything from the gems
if<00:05:01.729> you<00:05:01.969> inspect<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.419> gems<00:05:02.659> they<00:05:02.960> are<00:05:03.110> empty

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
if you inspect the gems they are empty

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:10.800 
if you inspect the gems they are empty
again<00:05:05.229> they<00:05:06.229> get<00:05:06.500> turned<00:05:06.770> into<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:09.310> bank<00:05:10.310> notes

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
again they get turned into a bank notes

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.649 
again they get turned into a bank notes
so<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:12.289> saves<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.889> bunch<00:05:13.099> of<00:05:13.219> space<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.759> there

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
so it saves a bunch of space and there

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.869 
so it saves a bunch of space and there
can<00:05:14.960> be<00:05:14.990> pretty<00:05:15.259> useful<00:05:15.349> because<00:05:15.949> this<00:05:16.759> is

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
can be pretty useful because this is

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.790 
can be pretty useful because this is
diamond<00:05:17.240> one<00:05:17.419> here<00:05:17.719> can<00:05:17.930> almost<00:05:18.139> double<00:05:18.620> your

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
diamond one here can almost double your

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.149 
diamond one here can almost double your
trip<00:05:19.219> size<00:05:20.110> which<00:05:21.110> doubles<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.620> experience

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
trip size which doubles the experience

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.820 
trip size which doubles the experience
raise<00:05:22.400> per<00:05:23.029> hour<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:24.020> unfortunately<00:05:24.650> this

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
raise per hour and unfortunately this

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.189 
raise per hour and unfortunately this
only<00:05:25.009> has<00:05:25.219> a<00:05:25.250> hundred<00:05:25.639> uses<00:05:26.060> so<00:05:26.779> it's<00:05:26.930> just<00:05:27.050> a

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
only has a hundred uses so it's just a

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.309 
only has a hundred uses so it's just a

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
I personally love them and I wish that

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:42.760 
I personally love them and I wish that
they<00:05:39.500> were<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.650> little<00:05:39.710> bit<00:05:39.979> more<00:05:40.250> common<00:05:41.770> but

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
they were a little bit more common but

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.469 
they were a little bit more common but
with<00:05:43.219> that<00:05:43.339> being<00:05:43.520> said<00:05:43.610> I<00:05:44.060> think<00:05:44.180> that's

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
with that being said I think that's

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.790 
with that being said I think that's
pretty<00:05:44.629> much<00:05:44.779> all<00:05:44.930> i<00:05:44.990> gotta<00:05:45.199> cover<00:05:45.409> in<00:05:45.680> this
