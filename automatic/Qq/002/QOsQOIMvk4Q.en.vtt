 a season really that I love I love 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.710
 I love spring and I love when we 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.660
 garden that blooms all that comes out 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.760
 smells it's really a season that is 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.760
 Fondaci it is not too hot there 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.250
 not too cold we are well at home 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.510

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.260

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.270

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.860
 I do not even need to plant it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 So, you just have to take the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.220
 tenderest leaves that are at 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.110
 middle so this is it here 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.520
 that of the turn they are a little more 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.350
 hard but if they are in two you 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.350
 can you take them too? 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.120
 middle here it's not eating so here you go 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.790
