the basic concept of e collar training
you<00:03:26.160> really<00:03:26.400> need<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.730> understand<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.660> whole

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
you really need to understand the whole

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140 
you really need to understand the whole

philosophy of pressure on pressure off
using<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.080> training<00:03:31.530> chain<00:03:31.890> you'll<00:03:32.460> see<00:03:32.700> how

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
using a training chain you'll see how

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.930 
using a training chain you'll see how
this<00:03:33.030> applies<00:03:33.740> when<00:03:34.740> we<00:03:34.830> give<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> command<00:03:35.520> we

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
this applies when we give the command we

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.390 
this applies when we give the command we
give<00:03:36.150> pressure<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.810> when<00:03:37.470> our<00:03:37.620> dog<00:03:37.800> performs

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
give pressure on when our dog performs

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.150 
give pressure on when our dog performs
the<00:03:38.580> command<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.390> pressure<00:03:39.750> comes<00:03:40.170> off<00:03:40.440> now

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
the command the pressure comes off now

your<00:03:41.340> dog<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:41.820> basically<00:03:42.360> going<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.630> learn

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
your dog is basically going to learn

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.720 
your dog is basically going to learn
that<00:03:43.080> pressure<00:03:43.710> on<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:44.160> something<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:44.610> he

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
that pressure on is something that he

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.100 
that pressure on is something that he
doesn't<00:03:44.880> want<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.510> he's<00:03:45.750> going<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.960> be

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
doesn't want and he's going to be

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.430 
doesn't want and he's going to be
working<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.740> total<00:03:47.640> pressure<00:03:47.970> off<00:03:48.360> yep<00:03:48.840> we're
