00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
ability stuff with that but really I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.970 
ability stuff with that but really I
honestly<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.199> a<00:00:46.289> letdown<00:00:46.559> for

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
honestly it was kind of a letdown for

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.410 
honestly it was kind of a letdown for
the<00:00:47.100> trailer<00:00:47.340> wise<00:00:47.610> because<00:00:47.850> most<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> stuff

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the trailer wise because most of stuff

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
the trailer wise because most of stuff
that<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:48.989> were<00:00:49.110> showing<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.920> chair<00:00:50.129> was

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that they were showing in this chair was

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.729 
that they were showing in this chair was
a<00:00:50.399> very<00:00:50.699> reminiscent<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> stuff<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.410> have

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
a very reminiscent of the stuff we have

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.790

seen<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.280> NHL<00:00:53.820> 14<00:00:54.059> other<00:00:54.719> than<00:00:55.079> maybe<00:00:55.320> one

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
seen in NHL 14 other than maybe one

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.340 
seen in NHL 14 other than maybe one
little<00:00:55.829> instance<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> couple<00:00:57.600> instances<00:00:57.870> in

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.020 
will say though that looks a lot better
because<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.530> definitely<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.670> when

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
because you can definitely see that when

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.030 
because you can definitely see that when
the<00:02:03.330> player<00:02:03.900> is<00:02:03.930> trying<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> move<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.770> puck

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the player is trying to move the puck

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.070 
the player is trying to move the puck
back<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.460> forth<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.150> actually<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.660> his

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
back and forth you can actually see his

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.990 
back and forth you can actually see his
wrists<00:02:07.560> moving<00:02:08.099> back<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.489> forth<00:02:08.580> which<00:02:08.880> I

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
wrists moving back and forth which I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.440 
wrists moving back and forth which I
thought<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.509> good<00:02:09.780> detail<00:02:10.430> so<00:02:11.450> maybe

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
thought was really good detail so maybe

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.450 
thought was really good detail so maybe
they<00:02:12.930> were<00:02:13.080> showing<00:02:13.320> off<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> lot<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.010> those

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
they were showing off a lot of those

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.400 
they were showing off a lot of those
one<00:02:14.610> handed<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.180> windmill<00:02:15.570> deke<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:15.990> maybe<00:02:16.200> that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
one handed a windmill deke so maybe that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.530 
one handed a windmill deke so maybe that
might<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.740> kind<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> new<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:17.910> touch<00:02:18.120> DQ

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
might be kind of like a new one touch DQ

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.210 
might be kind of like a new one touch DQ
might<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.840> able<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.050> do<00:02:19.350> might<00:02:19.890> be<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> little

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
might be able to do might be a little

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.040 
might be able to do might be a little
bit<00:02:20.400> easier<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:21.000> pull<00:02:21.180> off<00:02:21.390> rather<00:02:21.600> than<00:02:21.810> just

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
bit easier to pull off rather than just

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.660 
bit easier to pull off rather than just
holding<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.680> one<00:02:22.830> side<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.280> pressing

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
holding it out to one side and pressing

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.960 
holding it out to one side and pressing
up<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.360> controller<00:02:24.780> stick<00:02:25.080> who<00:02:25.200> knows<00:02:25.440> but

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
up on the controller stick who knows but

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.820 
up on the controller stick who knows but
a<00:02:26.970> lot<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:27.900> touch<00:02:28.080> Deeks<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:28.500> use<00:02:28.590> also

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
a lot of the one touch Deeks we use also

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.060 
a lot of the one touch Deeks we use also
shown<00:02:29.610> where<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.690> only<00:02:30.930> does<00:02:31.260> like<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> one

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
shown where not only does like the one

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.710 
shown where not only does like the one
touch<00:02:32.250> d<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.640> left<00:02:32.940> where<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.240> would<00:02:33.420> kind

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
touch d to the left where you would kind

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.780 
touch d to the left where you would kind
of<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:33.870> glide<00:02:34.290> off<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> left<00:02:35.070> off<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.640> one

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
of just glide off to the left off of one

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.670 
of just glide off to the left off of one
player<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.150> looks<00:02:36.330> like<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.530> can

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
player it looks like you can you can

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.460 
player it looks like you can you can
maybe<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.340> quicker<00:02:39.270> Deeks<00:02:39.630> after<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.440> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
maybe do quicker Deeks after you do a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.750 
maybe do quicker Deeks after you do a
one<00:02:40.740> touch<00:02:40.920> deke<00:02:41.160> that's<00:02:41.340> kind<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.580> something

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
one touch deke that's kind of something

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.030 
one touch deke that's kind of something
I<00:02:41.970> saw<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:42.930> did<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.500> movement

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
I saw but I really did like the movement

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.380 
I saw but I really did like the movement
of<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.130> puck<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.640> really<00:02:44.970> looks<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.270> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
of the puck it really looks like the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.360 
of the puck it really looks like the
stick<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.750> moving<00:02:46.110> up<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.680> down<00:02:46.800> on<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.220> ice

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
stick is moving up and down on the ice

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.820 
stick is moving up and down on the ice
road<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.850> then<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.120> gliding<00:02:49.050> across<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
road and then just gliding across the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.790 
road and then just gliding across the
ice<00:02:49.980> which<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.370> thought<00:02:50.520> was<00:02:50.670> pretty<00:02:50.760> cool<00:02:51.000> but

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
ice which I thought was pretty cool but

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.890 
ice which I thought was pretty cool but
for<00:02:52.800> trailer<00:02:53.160> wise<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:54.090> really<00:02:54.480> nothing<00:02:54.720> we

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
for trailer wise it's really nothing we

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.600 
for trailer wise it's really nothing we
haven't<00:02:55.230> other<00:02:55.620> than<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> few<00:02:56.160> things<00:02:56.370> it's

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
haven't other than a few things it's

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.700 
haven't other than a few things it's
really<00:02:56.880> nothing<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.240> haven't<00:02:57.540> seen<00:02:57.780> before<00:02:58.050> in

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
really nothing we haven't seen before in

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.150 
really nothing we haven't seen before in
NHL<00:02:59.640> 14<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.780> honestly<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.350> think<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.830> trailer

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
NHL 14 so honestly I think this trailer

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.850 
NHL 14 so honestly I think this trailer
will<00:03:02.430> have<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.360> analyzed<00:03:04.050> due<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.740> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
will have to be analyzed due to the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.970 
will have to be analyzed due to the
gameplay<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.870> really<00:03:06.870> think<00:03:07.050> like<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.770> said

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
gameplay so I really think like I said

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.380 
gameplay so I really think like I said
if<00:03:08.070> you're<00:03:08.160> judging<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.580> by<00:03:08.760> visual<00:03:09.180> wise

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
if you're judging this by visual wise

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.570 
if you're judging this by visual wise
it's<00:03:09.660> not<00:03:09.870> really<00:03:10.260> going<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> be<00:03:11.070> something

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's not really going to be something

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.150 
it's not really going to be something
you're<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.600> excited<00:03:13.050> about<00:03:13.230> but<00:03:13.830> when<00:03:14.040> you

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
you're all so excited about but when you

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.440 
you're all so excited about but when you
start<00:03:14.430> playing<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.790> game<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.180> might

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
start playing the game you might

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.140 
start playing the game you might
actually<00:03:15.720> notice<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.650> new<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.670> new<00:03:17.700> stick

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
actually notice the new the new stick

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.510 
actually notice the new the new stick
movements<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.840> things<00:03:19.500> like<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.740> how<00:03:20.310> they

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
movements and things like that how they

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.070 
movements and things like that how they
could<00:03:20.790> actually<00:03:21.030> affect<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.750> game<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.020> how

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
could actually affect the game and how

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.170 
could actually affect the game and how
they<00:03:22.230> could<00:03:22.380> actually<00:03:22.530> turn<00:03:23.490> out<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.940> and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
they could actually turn out to be and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.700 
they could actually turn out to be and
they<00:03:24.390> could<00:03:24.570> be<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> lot<00:03:24.990> more<00:03:25.050> fun<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.530> use<00:03:25.680> a

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
they could be a lot more fun to use a

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.440 
they could be a lot more fun to use a
lot<00:03:25.920> more<00:03:26.100> easier<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.910> use<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.090> lot<00:03:27.270> more

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
lot more easier to use a lot more

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.820 
lot more easier to use a lot more
difficult<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.020> pull<00:03:28.170> off<00:03:28.200> some<00:03:28.440> good<00:03:28.620> Deeks

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
difficult to pull off some good Deeks

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.140 
difficult to pull off some good Deeks
and<00:03:29.070> stuff<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.400> could<00:03:29.730> be<00:03:29.820> easier<00:03:30.090> to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and stuff like that could be easier to

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.730 
and stuff like that could be easier to
blow<00:03:30.360> up<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.600> extreme<00:03:30.810> nose<00:03:30.960> but<00:03:31.500> we'll<00:03:31.590> have

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
blow up the extreme nose but we'll have
