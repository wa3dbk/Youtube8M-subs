going to be super comfortable the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.569 
going to be super comfortable the
materials<00:00:43.359> also<00:00:43.570> coated<00:00:44.559> with<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.309> thing

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
materials also coated with a thing

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.849 
materials also coated with a thing
called<00:00:45.730> dwr<00:00:46.359> this<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.749> durable<00:00:47.109> water

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
called dwr this is a durable water

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.309 
called dwr this is a durable water
resistant<00:00:48.370> coating<00:00:48.819> this<00:00:49.510> just<00:00:49.839> prevents

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.319 
resistant coating this just prevents

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:51.989 
resistant coating this just prevents
some<00:00:50.620> water<00:00:50.859> from<00:00:51.219> soaking<00:00:51.609> up<00:00:51.699> into<00:00:51.909> the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
some water from soaking up into the

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.639 
some water from soaking up into the
board<00:00:52.210> shorts<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:52.899> if<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:53.050> have<00:00:53.140> less<00:00:53.350> water

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
board shorts so if you have less water

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.899 
board shorts so if you have less water
in<00:00:53.800> your<00:00:53.859> board<00:00:54.100> shorts<00:00:54.429> it's<00:00:54.550> going<00:00:54.729> to<00:00:54.789> take

in your board shorts it's going to take

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.270 
in your board shorts it's going to take
less<00:00:55.149> time<00:00:55.179> to<00:00:55.479> dry<00:00:56.170> out<00:00:56.350> so<00:00:56.589> once<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.069> get<00:00:57.159> out

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
less time to dry out so once you get out

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.590
