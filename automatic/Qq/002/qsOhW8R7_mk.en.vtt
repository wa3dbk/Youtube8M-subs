00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
I've never talked about kombucha tea

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.550 
I've never talked about kombucha tea
before<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> give<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> little

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.930 
brewing it's done and it's ready for the
second<00:00:46.530> ferment<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.399> I'm<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> show<00:00:47.910> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
second ferment so I'm going to show you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.590 
second ferment so I'm going to show you
the<00:00:48.300> process<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:49.379> both<00:00:49.860> making<00:00:50.670> tea<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the process of both making tea for the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
the process of both making tea for the
original<00:00:52.020> ferment<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> process<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
original ferment and the process for the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
original ferment and the process for the
second<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.649> kombucha<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.430> often

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
second from it now kombucha is often

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.630 
second from it now kombucha is often
called<00:00:57.000> mushroom<00:00:57.420> tea<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.680> reason<00:00:59.100> being<00:00:59.340> is

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
called mushroom tea the reason being is

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.030 
called mushroom tea the reason being is
it<00:00:59.850> has<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.510> floating<00:01:01.940> slime<00:01:02.940> ball<00:01:03.769> that<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it has this floating slime ball that is

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.480 
it has this floating slime ball that is
it's<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.700> Oh<00:01:05.909> glial<00:01:06.510> Matt<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.560> called<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it's as Oh glial Matt it's called a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
it's as Oh glial Matt it's called a
Scobie<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.570> an<00:01:09.750> acronym<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
Scobie which is an acronym for a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.550 
Scobie which is an acronym for a
symbiotic<00:01:11.520> colony<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.270> yeast<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.900> bacteria

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
symbiotic colony of yeast and bacteria

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.240 
symbiotic colony of yeast and bacteria
so<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.880> yeast<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.420> bacteria<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.320> each<00:01:16.680> scoby

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so the yeast and bacteria in each scoby

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310 
so the yeast and bacteria in each scoby
is<00:01:17.430> slightly<00:01:18.000> different<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.020> different

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
is slightly different the different

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.120 
is slightly different the different
strains<00:01:19.680> make<00:01:20.310> up<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:21.030> zoo<00:01:21.960> glial<00:01:22.409> mat<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
strains make up this zoo glial mat that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.880 
strains make up this zoo glial mat that
or<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> mother<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.360> call<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.619> I'm

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
or the mother is what we call it so I'm

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.310 
or the mother is what we call it so I'm
gonna<00:01:26.040> pull<00:01:26.280> her<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.549> show<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> how

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
gonna pull her out and show you how

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.050 
gonna pull her out and show you how
fantastic<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.470> awesome<00:01:28.619> she<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.790> when

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
you're working with your Scoobies they

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.999 
you're working with your Scoobies they
can<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.470> cross-contaminated<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:34.950> to

about the
the<00:02:13.290> scoby<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.460> has<00:02:14.580> both<00:02:14.850> yeast<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the scoby is it has both yeast and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.199 
the scoby is it has both yeast and
bacteria<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.770> yeast<00:02:17.100> convert<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.760> sugars

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
bacteria the yeast convert the sugars

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.070 
bacteria the yeast convert the sugars
into<00:02:18.630> alcohol<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.850> bacteria<00:02:21.510> convert<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
into alcohol the bacteria convert the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.699 
into alcohol the bacteria convert the
alcohol<00:02:22.560> into<00:02:22.980> acid<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.990> sugar<00:02:25.380> that

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
alcohol into acid and so this sugar that

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.160 
alcohol into acid and so this sugar that
we're<00:02:25.860> adding<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.700> sweeten<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.959> not

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
and start a new batch it will just take

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.920 
and start a new batch it will just take
you<00:03:20.310> longer<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.880> firm<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.329> until<00:03:21.720> it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
you longer to firm it until it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.930 
you longer to firm it until it
establishes<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.709> nice<00:03:23.010> thick<00:03:23.310> Scobie<00:03:23.730> and

degrees<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:35.520> order<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.300> facilitate<00:04:36.479> that

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
degrees so in order to facilitate that

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.200

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.450 
because if you threw hot tea like this
much<00:04:39.570> hot<00:04:39.780> tea<00:04:39.930> it<00:04:40.020> will<00:04:40.110> take<00:04:40.350> hours<00:04:40.979> for<00:04:41.160> it

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
much hot tea it will take hours for it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.110
