00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.670 
right and start in a musical what would
it<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.180> about<00:01:45.329> I'm<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> say<00:01:46.380> never

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
but I think it is very very unlikely

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.210 
but I think it is very very unlikely
because<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.990> fully<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:53.040> understand
