a 45-degree angle that way my jaws are
nice<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.769> flat<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.349> sitting<00:02:20.620> down<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:21.040> there

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
nice and flat so I sitting down in there

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.430 
nice and flat so I sitting down in there
like<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.549> and<00:02:21.910> I'll<00:02:22.810> show<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.049> this<00:02:23.290> is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
like that and I'll show you this is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.869 
like that and I'll show you this is
where<00:02:24.780> trace<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.200> just<00:02:26.890> take<00:02:27.069> my<00:02:27.190> marker<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.819> I

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
where trace I just take my marker and I

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.330 
where trace I just take my marker and I
trace<00:02:28.120> along<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.540> part<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.220> frame<00:02:30.220> of

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
trace along that part of the frame of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.170 
trace along that part of the frame of
the<00:02:30.400> trap<00:02:30.640> there<00:02:31.209> back<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:32.410> here<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.030> then

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the trap there back here here and then

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.970 
the trap there back here here and then
on<00:02:34.330> both<00:02:34.510> sides<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.170> long<00:02:35.349> spring<00:02:35.709> better

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
on both sides of a long spring better

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.240 
on both sides of a long spring better
the<00:02:36.700> reason<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.180> trace<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:38.440> lines<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.160> is

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the reason I trace the lines of it is

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.190 
the reason I trace the lines of it is
just<00:02:39.819> kind<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.269> guide<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.840> tell<00:02:41.019> me

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
just kind of like a guide to tell me

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.009 
just kind of like a guide to tell me
where<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:41.860> want<00:02:42.129> to<00:02:42.190> put<00:02:42.340> my<00:02:42.489> nails<00:02:42.930> after<00:02:43.930> you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
have that that's right and I know where

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.339 
have that that's right and I know where
my<00:02:47.860> traps<00:02:48.190> gonna<00:02:48.340> sit<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.970> make<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.510> small<00:02:50.110> mark

this is where I prefer to put my nails I
put<00:03:26.500> one<00:03:26.889> on<00:03:27.040> each<00:03:27.069> line<00:03:27.459> basically<00:03:28.209> right

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
put one on each line basically right

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.409 
put one on each line basically right
there<00:03:28.720> right<00:03:28.870> there<00:03:29.049> right<00:03:29.079> there<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:31.299> you

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
they're gonna hold the trap on before

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.330 
they're gonna hold the trap on before
cancer<00:03:39.819> muskrat<00:03:40.239> but<00:03:40.870> then<00:03:41.019> after<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.069> trap

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
cancer muskrat but then after the trap

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.819 
cancer muskrat but then after the trap
goes<00:03:42.609> off<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.299> lot<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:43.870> that<00:03:44.019> muskrat<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.709> that

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
goes off a lot of that muskrat in that

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.849 
goes off a lot of that muskrat in that
trap<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.340> roll<00:03:45.549> off<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.790> platform<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.560> allow

that trap to drown the muskrat I'm going

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.069 
that trap to drown the muskrat I'm going
to<00:03:52.780> do<00:03:53.160> will<00:03:54.160> go<00:03:54.250> ahead<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.519> test<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:55.000> this<00:03:55.840> one

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
to do will go ahead and test it this one

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:02.550 
to do will go ahead and test it this one
I<00:03:56.109> did<00:03:56.530> before<00:04:00.060> hold<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.150> trap<00:04:01.419> on<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:02.470> the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
I did before hold the trap on to the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.940 
I did before hold the trap on to the
platform<00:04:02.799> but<00:04:03.760> still<00:04:04.060> allows<00:04:04.419> it<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.930> flip<00:04:05.739> out

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
platform but still allows it to flip out

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.500 
platform but still allows it to flip out
of<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.489> nails<00:04:07.739> whatever

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
of the nails whatever

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:27.030 
of the nails whatever
exactly<00:04:10.510> what<00:04:10.660> you<00:04:10.810> want<00:04:24.360> see<00:04:25.650> we<00:04:26.650> go<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.830> little

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
exactly what you want see we go a little

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.380 
exactly what you want see we go a little
bit<00:04:27.310> but<00:04:27.490> it's<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:27.610> gonna<00:04:27.760> flip<00:04:28.030> off<00:04:28.180> there

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
bit but it's not gonna flip off there

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.210 
bit but it's not gonna flip off there
where<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.690> currents<00:04:29.110> moving<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:29.860> Creek

or whatever when the muskrat gets on the
platform<00:04:32.470> he's<00:04:33.040> not<00:04:33.190> gonna<00:04:33.340> like<00:04:33.460> kick<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.240> off

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360
