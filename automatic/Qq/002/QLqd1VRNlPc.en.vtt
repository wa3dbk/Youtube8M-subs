space<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.240> then<00:02:04.479> as<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.840> will<00:02:05.289> work<00:02:05.410> a<00:02:05.440> lot

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
space and then as you will work a lot

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.770 
space and then as you will work a lot
about<00:02:05.800> use<00:02:06.070> your<00:02:06.250> other<00:02:06.429> hands<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.570> just

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
about use your other hands so just

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.680 
about use your other hands so just
flatten<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.500> down<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.979> squash<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.479> into<00:02:10.479> place

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
flatten it down and squash it into place

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.270 
flatten it down and squash it into place
and<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:11.050> will<00:02:11.140> naturally<00:02:11.380> kind<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.980> fall<00:02:12.250> down

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
and it will naturally kind of fall down

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.990 
and it will naturally kind of fall down
into<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.940> sheep<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.829> have<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.310> squash

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
into that sheep so you can have a squash

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.120 
into that sheep so you can have a squash
fold<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.630> looks<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:17.140> do<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.829> same<00:02:17.860> on

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
fold that looks like that do the same on

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.410 
fold that looks like that do the same on
the<00:02:18.190> other<00:02:18.220> side<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.670> yet<00:02:18.970> poking<00:02:19.299> your

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the other side so just yet poking your

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.240 
the other side so just yet poking your
finger<00:02:19.480> into<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.290> hole<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:23.739> squashing

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
finger into the hole and just squashing

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.270 
finger into the hole and just squashing
it<00:02:24.370> down<00:02:24.459> with<00:02:24.670> your<00:02:24.700> other<00:02:25.000> hand<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.860> get<00:02:27.040> this

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
it down with your other hand to get this

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.370 
it down with your other hand to get this
kind<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.329> think<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:28.989> looks<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.230> an

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
kind of like I think it looks like an

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.060 
kind of like I think it looks like an
ice-cream<00:02:29.769> kind<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.220> shape<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.829> so<00:02:32.980> you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
ice-cream kind of shape like that so you

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.250 
ice-cream kind of shape like that so you
have<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> shape<00:02:33.730> looks<00:02:33.940> like<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.299> then<00:02:35.140> we're

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
have a shape looks like that then we're

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.440 
have a shape looks like that then we're
gonna<00:02:35.380> take<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.769> top<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.850> sheep<00:02:37.180> and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
gonna take the top of that sheep and

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.810 
gonna take the top of that sheep and
fold<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> back<00:02:38.019> on<00:02:38.049> itself<00:02:38.430> just<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.640> goes

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
fold it back on itself just so it goes

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.020 
fold it back on itself just so it goes
in<00:02:39.970> line<00:02:40.239> with<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:42.579> other<00:02:42.760> side<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:45.280> do<00:02:45.910> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
in line with the other side and do the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.620 
in line with the other side and do the
same<00:02:46.299> with<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.989> other<00:02:47.140> side

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.570 

and<00:02:52.920> then<00:02:53.920> we're<00:02:54.070> gonna<00:02:54.160> take<00:02:55.710> this<00:02:56.710> part<00:02:57.130> here

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
and then we're gonna take this part here

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.220 
and then we're gonna take this part here
this<00:02:57.790> edge<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.420> fold<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.780> back<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:59.050> itself

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
this edge and fold it back on itself

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.630 
this edge and fold it back on itself
again<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.920> should<00:03:00.040> form<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.370> easily

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
again and it should form I easily

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.150 
again and it should form I easily
because<00:03:01.150> we've<00:03:01.270> already<00:03:01.420> had<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.170> fold<00:03:02.830> there

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
because we've already had a fold there

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.490 
because we've already had a fold there
from<00:03:03.490> before<00:03:03.820> we<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> squash<00:03:04.420> fold<00:03:04.720> so

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
from before we that the squash fold so

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.080 
from before we that the squash fold so
that<00:03:05.530> should<00:03:05.800> just<00:03:05.950> easily<00:03:06.340> fold<00:03:06.580> over<00:03:06.820> into

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
that should just easily fold over into

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.620 
that should just easily fold over into
place<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.580> do<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.150> same<00:03:10.330> on<00:03:10.390> the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
place like so and do the same on the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.800 
place like so and do the same on the
other<00:03:10.660> side

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.290 

and<00:03:18.900> then<00:03:19.650> you're<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:19.980> going<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.400> roll<00:03:20.940> into

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
and then you're just going to roll into

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.240 
and then you're just going to roll into
the<00:03:21.630> petal<00:03:22.080> sheep<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.500> you're<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.770> take

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
the petal sheep so you're going to take

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.620 
the petal sheep so you're going to take
these<00:03:23.370> two<00:03:23.430> sides<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.030> join<00:03:24.209> them<00:03:24.390> together

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
these two sides and join them together

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.650 
these two sides and join them together
so<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.230> gently<00:03:25.680> rolling<00:03:26.040> them<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.660> towards

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
so just gently rolling them and towards

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.120 
so just gently rolling them and towards
each<00:03:27.750> other<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:29.990> then<00:03:30.990> just<00:03:31.050> pressing<00:03:31.830> really

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
each other and then just pressing really

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.930 
each other and then just pressing really
firmly<00:03:33.410> along<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.590> edge<00:03:34.770> just<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.760> make<00:03:35.910> sure

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
firmly along the edge just to make sure

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.000 
firmly along the edge just to make sure
that<00:03:36.300> stays<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.930> place<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.860> where

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that stays in place and this is where

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.800 
that stays in place and this is where
your<00:03:38.220> stapler<00:03:38.520> comes<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.000> handy<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.569> we<00:03:39.690> can

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
your stapler comes in handy so we can

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.400 
your stapler comes in handy so we can
actually<00:03:39.930> staple<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.860> into<00:03:41.640> place<00:03:41.850> and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
actually staple that into place and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.260 
actually staple that into place and
depending<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.500> how<00:03:43.680> thick<00:03:43.980> your<00:03:44.190> paper<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.850> my

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
depending on how thick your paper is my

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.880 
depending on how thick your paper is my
paper<00:03:45.750> was<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.110> between<00:03:46.319> like<00:03:46.530> paper<00:03:46.770> and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
paper was in between like paper and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.590 
paper was in between like paper and
cards<00:03:47.459> some<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.880> was<00:03:48.000> quite<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.300> think<00:03:48.480> you

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
cards some of it was quite you think you

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.850

might need to kind of really press there
and<00:03:50.040> your<00:03:50.130> staple<00:03:50.550> like<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.820> did<00:03:51.000> here<00:03:51.239> then

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
and your staple like I did here then

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.110 
and your staple like I did here then
we're<00:03:52.200> gonna<00:03:52.290> put<00:03:52.500> some<00:03:52.709> hot<00:03:53.070> glue<00:03:53.100> just<00:03:53.880> in

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
we're gonna put some hot glue just in

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.390 
we're gonna put some hot glue just in
between<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.440> space<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.040> middle<00:03:56.250> there

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
between that space in the middle there

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.940 
between that space in the middle there
just<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.300> really<00:03:57.630> secure<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.200> into<00:03:58.350> place<00:03:58.680> and

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.860 

then<00:04:04.950> just<00:04:05.280> press<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.209> really<00:04:06.450> firmly

then just press on that really firmly

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.229 
then just press on that really firmly
just<00:04:07.019> until<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.709> glue<00:04:07.920> sets

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.429 

and<00:04:12.239> here's<00:04:12.420> something<00:04:12.599> I<00:04:12.720> did<00:04:12.870> earlier<00:04:13.230> that

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
and here's something I did earlier that

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.640 
and here's something I did earlier that
have<00:04:13.530> dried<00:04:13.739> now<00:04:15.139> so<00:04:16.139> once<00:04:16.350> they<00:04:16.500> have

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
have dried now so once they have

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.099

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
completely dried you can take one of

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.420 
completely dried you can take one of
your<00:04:19.260> petals<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.340> just<00:04:21.060> like<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.449> kind<00:04:21.660> of

your petals and I just like to kind of
Benza<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> little<00:04:23.760> bit<00:04:23.910> just<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.330> open<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.780> up

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
Benza a little bit just to open it up

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.620 
Benza a little bit just to open it up
and<00:04:25.199> make<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.800> look<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.100> little<00:04:26.250> bit<00:04:26.460> bigger<00:04:26.639> and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
and make it look a little bit bigger and

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.939 
and make it look a little bit bigger and
to<00:04:27.900> make<00:04:28.050> quite<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.289> flower<00:04:28.500> we're<00:04:28.740> going<00:04:28.889> to

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
to make quite a flower we're going to

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.129 
to make quite a flower we're going to
need<00:04:29.039> five<00:04:29.370> petals<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.150> your<00:04:30.389> wooden<00:04:30.600> skewer

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
need five petals and your wooden skewer

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.900 
need five petals and your wooden skewer
so<00:04:31.680> you're<00:04:31.770> gonna<00:04:31.860> take<00:04:32.130> two<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.430> your<00:04:32.639> petals

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
so you're gonna take two of your petals

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.580 
so you're gonna take two of your petals
and<00:04:33.300> we're<00:04:33.419> going<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.720> glue<00:04:33.870> them<00:04:34.229> together

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
and we're going to glue them together

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.490 
and we're going to glue them together
like<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:36.240> we're<00:04:36.360> gonna<00:04:36.449> run<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.930> strip<00:04:37.289> of

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
like so so we're gonna run a strip of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.700 
like so so we're gonna run a strip of
glue<00:04:37.680> along<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.400> edge<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.389> outer<00:04:39.650> part<00:04:40.650> of

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
glue along the edge of the outer part of

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.779 
glue along the edge of the outer part of
the<00:04:40.800> petal<00:04:41.010> I<00:04:45.949> think<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.010> easiest<00:04:47.340> way<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.550> do

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
the petal I think the easiest way to do

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.520 
the petal I think the easiest way to do
this<00:04:47.820> is<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.240> race<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.630> petals<00:04:49.050> on<00:04:49.289> the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
this is to race the petals on the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.219 
this is to race the petals on the
tabletop<00:04:49.889> so<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.820> make<00:04:51.210> sure<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.810> they<00:04:51.990> are

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
tabletop so to make sure that they are

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.439 
tabletop so to make sure that they are
both<00:04:52.530> even<00:04:53.039> and<00:04:53.310> just<00:04:53.550> holding<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:53.940> few<00:04:54.090> seconds

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
both even and just holding a few seconds

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:01.129 
both even and just holding a few seconds
to<00:04:54.600> sit<00:04:58.820> then<00:04:59.820> I'm<00:05:00.090> just<00:05:00.270> gonna<00:05:00.419> do<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.930> exact

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
to sit then I'm just gonna do the exact

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.000 
to sit then I'm just gonna do the exact
same<00:05:01.199> thing<00:05:01.590> applying<00:05:02.490> glue<00:05:02.820> around<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:04.050> edge

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
same thing applying glue around the edge

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.790 
same thing applying glue around the edge
sucking<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.090> other<00:05:06.210> petal<00:05:06.539> into<00:05:06.690> place<00:05:07.020> and

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
sucking the other petal into place and

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.920 
sucking the other petal into place and
doing<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.100> same

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.790 

and<00:05:14.000> once<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.270> have<00:05:15.509> stuck<00:05:15.990> four<00:05:16.440> petals

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
and once you have stuck four petals

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.680 
and once you have stuck four petals
together<00:05:17.130> we're<00:05:17.550> then<00:05:17.699> going<00:05:17.910> to<00:05:18.000> put<00:05:18.570> the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
together we're then going to put the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.770 
together we're then going to put the
wooden<00:05:18.960> skewer<00:05:19.440> into<00:05:19.910> the<00:05:20.910> flower<00:05:21.120> before<00:05:21.360> we

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
wooden skewer into the flower before we

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.409 
wooden skewer into the flower before we
put<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.770> final<00:05:22.949> one<00:05:23.250> end<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.669> just<00:05:23.699> pop<00:05:24.060> quite

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
put the final one end so just pop quite

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.360 
put the final one end so just pop quite
a<00:05:24.449> bit<00:05:24.660> of<00:05:24.750> glue<00:05:25.020> into<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.380> middle<00:05:25.770> there<00:05:25.949> and

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
a bit of glue into the middle there and

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.960 
a bit of glue into the middle there and
then<00:05:27.060> just<00:05:27.389> nestle<00:05:28.050> your<00:05:28.410> wooden<00:05:28.919> skewer<00:05:29.490> into

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
then just nestle your wooden skewer into

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.890 
then just nestle your wooden skewer into
the<00:05:30.060> middle<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:33.530> then<00:05:35.389> disappear<00:05:36.389> but<00:05:36.720> more

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
the middle and then disappear but more

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.770 
the middle and then disappear but more
glue<00:05:37.229> along<00:05:37.889> the<00:05:38.039> edges<00:05:38.490> of<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.970> those<00:05:39.449> two

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
glue along the edges of it those two

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.110 
glue along the edges of it those two
petals<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.590> then<00:05:41.039> just<00:05:41.280> stick<00:05:41.550> your

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
petals and then just stick your

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.360 
petals and then just stick your
remaining<00:05:42.449> petal<00:05:42.900> over<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.770> wooden<00:05:43.979> skewer

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
remaining petal over the wooden skewer

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.409 
remaining petal over the wooden skewer
and<00:05:44.580> to<00:05:44.820> cover<00:05:45.600> that<00:05:45.870> space<00:05:46.289> up<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:48.240> there<00:05:48.360> we

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
and to cover that space up and there we

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.500 
and to cover that space up and there we
go<00:05:48.539> we<00:05:48.780> have<00:05:48.930> our<00:05:49.169> flower<00:05:49.610> yay<00:05:50.610> good<00:05:51.060> job<00:05:51.120> and

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.900 
go we have our flower yay good job and
the<00:05:52.229> easiest<00:05:52.500> way<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.800> live<00:05:53.010> is<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.370> say<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:53.610> feel

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
the easiest way to live is to say I feel

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.550 
the easiest way to live is to say I feel
is<00:05:54.030> just<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.270> police<00:05:54.479> thumb<00:05:54.750> upside<00:05:55.229> down<00:05:55.380> like

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
is just a police thumb upside down like

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.870 
is just a police thumb upside down like
this<00:05:55.740> better<00:05:56.190> just<00:05:56.400> make<00:05:56.520> sure<00:05:56.699> they<00:05:56.850> don't

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
this better just make sure they don't

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.969 
this better just make sure they don't
fall<00:05:57.270> and<00:05:57.330> or<00:05:57.780> move<00:05:58.080> sheep<00:05:58.440> or<00:05:58.590> anything<00:05:58.740> like

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
fall and or move sheep or anything like

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.770 
fall and or move sheep or anything like
that<00:05:59.010> we're<00:05:59.669> never<00:05:59.729> gonna<00:05:59.940> stick<00:06:00.210> a<00:06:00.240> button<00:06:00.660> in

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
that we're never gonna stick a button in

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.939 
that we're never gonna stick a button in
the<00:06:00.870> middle<00:06:01.139> I<00:06:01.260> think<00:06:01.470> this<00:06:01.560> just<00:06:01.650> really

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
the middle I think this just really

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.040 
the middle I think this just really
finishes<00:06:02.220> it<00:06:02.370> off<00:06:02.550> so<00:06:03.300> I've<00:06:03.449> got<00:06:03.630> some<00:06:03.810> rhythm

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
finishes it off so I've got some rhythm

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.810 
finishes it off so I've got some rhythm
buttons<00:06:04.590> and<00:06:04.919> just<00:06:05.130> applying<00:06:05.400> what<00:06:05.639> they're

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
buttons and just applying what they're

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.020 
buttons and just applying what they're
glue<00:06:06.120> into<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:06.690> middle<00:06:06.870> of<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.020> flower<00:06:07.260> and

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
glue into the middle of the flower and

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.350 
glue into the middle of the flower and
just<00:06:09.030> popping<00:06:09.360> that<00:06:10.320> button<00:06:10.940> into<00:06:11.940> the<00:06:11.970> middle

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
just popping that button into the middle

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.330 
just popping that button into the middle
and<00:06:12.570> I<00:06:12.630> just<00:06:12.870> think<00:06:13.110> this<00:06:13.289> really<00:06:13.650> fuzzies<00:06:14.220> the

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
and I just think this really fuzzies the

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.300 
and I just think this really fuzzies the
flowers<00:06:14.639> off<00:06:15.560> you<00:06:16.560> could<00:06:16.710> use<00:06:16.830> any<00:06:17.070> color

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
flowers off you could use any color

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.040 
flowers off you could use any color
buttons<00:06:17.789> I<00:06:17.940> think<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.210> wooden<00:06:18.510> ones<00:06:18.690> give<00:06:18.960> it

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
buttons I think the wooden ones give it

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.490 
buttons I think the wooden ones give it
a<00:06:19.139> really<00:06:19.500> lovely<00:06:20.310> kind<00:06:20.729> of<00:06:20.820> vintage<00:06:21.090> look<00:06:21.570> and

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
a really lovely kind of vintage look and
