the speed to normal speed this is what
it<00:01:38.100> should<00:01:38.130> look<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:42.110> swing<00:01:43.110> your

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it should look like for you swing your

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.719 
it should look like for you swing your
arms<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> even<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.549> in
