00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.240
 I am happy to make a five-strand braid 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.309
 with 2 braids already in the middle 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.109
 so I already report that 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:24.500
 then you make another strict one 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.439
 may three so I end up with five strands 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.610
 make sure the two are braided 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.900
 strict 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.250
 between the 2nd and 3rd strand is like this 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.790
 it out 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:44.949
 you start over underneath 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.949
 over underneath 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.030
 now you start on that side but with 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.290
 the second fight and then you don't go there 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.680
 across 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.479
 but you now understand underneath 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.479
 over underneath 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.390
 then you start on the other side you have to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:09.159
 you also with the second strand and you do 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.159
 underneath again underneath 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:18.680
 a package this strand again the second 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:21.679
 underneath over underneath package this 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.329
 severely below this 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.869
 almost over the bottom 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.249
 end 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.109
 So grab this fight again 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:40.069
 underneath 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:41.149
 over underneath then I just think 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.899
 run once 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:49.030
 will try to get by 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.030
 over and under it 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.389
 my bit tight with an elastic band 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.150
 then you see that middle braid 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 very nice in between 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.020
 so can still choose to get something out 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.740
 pulling each other 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.630
 see it even better i will use this rubber band 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.630
 I will then remove the braids 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.370
 this is the result 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.690
 I have now finished the braid and have it 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.550
 I set up a nice pink so you 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.379
 can't see the elastic 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.050
 nice thing about these braids is that you like him 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.489
 also very nice on the side 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.489
 this side and the other side 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.489
 very nice braid
