00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
this is how the case looks like and then

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.380 
this is how the case looks like and then
like<00:01:20.640> most<00:01:21.240> rubberized<00:01:22.170> cases<00:01:23.329> how<00:01:24.329> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
like most rubberized cases how you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.209 
like most rubberized cases how you
really<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.899> out<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.259> basically<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.829> by

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
really get it out is basically just by

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.889 
really get it out is basically just by
pulling<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> parts<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.689> then

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
pulling one of the parts and then

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.319 
pulling one of the parts and then
pulling<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.289> back<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.039> I<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
pulling it back like this I like to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.580 
pulling it back like this I like to
start<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.049> part<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.469> it's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
start from this part because it's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.289 
start from this part because it's
easiest<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.219> is<00:01:32.280> where<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> pen<00:01:32.909> goes<00:01:33.149> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
easiest this is where the pen goes of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.060 
easiest this is where the pen goes of
course<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.719> the<00:01:33.780> note<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.039> to

course for the note so I'm going to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.639 
course for the note so I'm going to
start<00:01:35.189> right<00:01:35.399> here<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.539> peel<00:01:37.320> each

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
start right here and then just peel each

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.499 
start right here and then just peel each
part<00:01:37.979> back<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.880> kind<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> line<00:01:39.359> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
part back you can just kind of line it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.109 
part back you can just kind of line it
with<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:39.780> fingers<00:01:40.109> and<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:41.009> you'll<00:01:41.789> see<00:01:42.000> as

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
with your fingers and then you'll see as

00:01:42.119 --> 00:02:05.510 
with your fingers and then you'll see as
they<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.570> peel<00:01:42.899> back<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.560> do<00:01:46.560> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.240 

there<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:06.700> go<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:08.770> take<00:02:08.950> off<00:02:09.069> the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
there we go so you take off the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:18.690 
there we go so you take off the
styrofoam<00:02:14.970> all<00:02:15.970> right<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.739> this<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.040> a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
styrofoam all right and so this is a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.580 
styrofoam all right and so this is a
plastic<00:02:19.770> cover<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:21.160> protect<00:02:21.250> your<00:02:21.640> screen<00:02:22.590> did
