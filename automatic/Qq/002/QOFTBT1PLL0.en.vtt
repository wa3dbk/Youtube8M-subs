00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.759
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:26.089
 autumn has come and we will do healing 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.089
 tincture on the very not looking 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.370
 for that I take back and viburnum 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.750
 separate them 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.750
 from stalks 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.440
 pour sugar and fill the most 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:01:00.300
 and since we shared the berries we did 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:00.300
 here is a pound of a three-liter jar 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:24.260
 as one hand is not convenient to growth on 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.260
 now pour 200 grams of sugar 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:41.920
 mix it up a bit and let it stand 23 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.170
 o'clock 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.170
 after two or three hours to fill it with the most 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.000
 It took about two hours 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:02.310
 Colin put down some juice now we 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.310
 let's add the leader to all 1 bet 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:13.210
 and to heighten the flavor, add pioneer 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.210
 other 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.000
 everything 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:24.550
 close the jar and leave to insist 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.760
 on two threads through the day of the week 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:34.970
 if the color is not very red we 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:39.950
 send I think add for karkade 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.629
 red color we will have tincture 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.629
 called viburnum red 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.439
 well now 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.740
 until 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.599
 we will see what happens during 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.599
 two weeks 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.150
 good day 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.870
 Two weeks passed before our feeding 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.459
 settings on your knees so infused 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.620
 it has such a yellow brown color 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:20.620
 in order to make a tincture 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:26.200
 prettier we will use karkade 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:32.840
 tea as when exactly we take and add 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:36.470
 here and the world tea karkade he will give 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:43.160
 red ruby here red 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:47.560
 color and a little bit sourness that 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.560
 our settings won't hurt 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:58.960
 customizable color gives how fast they are 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:05.100
 so tincture will stand another day 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:08.100
 and it will be possible to filter and 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.100
 demonstrate 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.060
 Karkade spent the day gave our color 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:22.419
 Karina became really red 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.419
 Now we are from the holy and Prodi masters 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.009
 so viburnum filtered 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:39.370
 the color is exceptionally beautiful 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:41.610
 ruby red like fingers on 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.539
 full viburnum red 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.539
 Now we will go to the eraser 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.650
 filtered hard but you can 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.550
 filter out 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:05.000
 it can be seen that the transparency is exceptional 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.000
 beautiful color 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:14.780
 the smell has such a slightly pharmacy 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.780
 tinctures on a nice 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:27.859
 it tastes very good 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.859
 the plot is a little bit sour moderately sweet 

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.119
 gives viburnum 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.439
 alcoholic moonshine but so not 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:41.459
 felt that Karina 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.779
 we have medical and yeah so you can 

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:46.409
 cold autumn 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:52.459
 be treated by a glass subjected 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:59.449
 and then three, you can successfully so I 

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:59.449
 You can do all up to the following videos
