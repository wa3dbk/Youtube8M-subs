the many quick white wins in this
variation<00:00:22.939> I've<00:00:23.939> thought<00:00:24.119> very<00:00:24.180> carefully

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
variation I've thought very carefully

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.769 
variation I've thought very carefully
about<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.560> repertoire<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.160> I've<00:00:26.250> selected

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
about the repertoire that I've selected

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.570 
about the repertoire that I've selected
to<00:00:27.779> make<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.080> easy<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.800> learn<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
to make it easy for you to learn and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.020 
to make it easy for you to learn and
easy<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.240> remember<00:00:31.460> against<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> key<00:00:32.759> black

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
easy to remember against the key black

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.569 
easy to remember against the key black
defenses<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.899> propose<00:00:34.739> lines<00:00:35.070> where<00:00:35.399> white

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
defenses I propose lines where white

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.810 
defenses I propose lines where white
plays<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> consistent<00:00:36.480> strategic<00:00:37.260> fashion

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
plays in a consistent strategic fashion

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
plays in a consistent strategic fashion
by<00:00:38.820> exchanging<00:00:39.860> Bishop<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.070> knight<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.430> c6

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
by exchanging Bishop for knight on c6

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.459 
by exchanging Bishop for knight on c6
and<00:00:42.270> crippling<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.200> black<00:00:43.379> pawn<00:00:43.680> structure

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
and crippling the black pawn structure

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
and crippling the black pawn structure
my<00:00:46.469> idea<00:00:46.829> has<00:00:47.160> been<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> show<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.730> key<00:00:48.000> ideas

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
my idea has been to show the key ideas

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.369 
my idea has been to show the key ideas
in<00:00:48.960> each<00:00:49.079> major<00:00:49.350> variation<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:51.050> believe<00:00:52.050> video

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
in each major variation I believe video

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.010 
in each major variation I believe video
is<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> superb<00:00:53.160> medium<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.690> half<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020

need<00:02:06.480> to<00:02:06.630> understand<00:02:07.080> with<00:02:07.260> white<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:08.640> play

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.730 
need to understand with white to play

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.990 
need to understand with white to play
the<00:02:08.910> Bishop<00:02:09.150> b5<00:02:09.480> variation<00:02:10.550> first<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.850> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the Bishop b5 variation first is that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.540 
the Bishop b5 variation first is that
white<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.690> playing<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.320> very<00:02:14.070> rapid

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
white is playing a very rapid

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.820 
white is playing a very rapid
development<00:02:15.120> why<00:02:15.990> it's<00:02:16.140> already<00:02:16.410> ready<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
development why it's already ready to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.740 
development why it's already ready to
castle<00:02:17.340> while<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.270> see<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.570> black

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
castle while you can see that black

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.140 
castle while you can see that black
whose<00:02:19.680> King<00:02:19.920> side<00:02:20.130> pieces<00:02:20.370> are<00:02:20.670> completely

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
whose King side pieces are completely

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.720 
whose King side pieces are completely
unmoved<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:22.110> several<00:02:22.620> moves<00:02:22.830> away<00:02:23.040> from

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
unmoved as several moves away from

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.140 
unmoved as several moves away from
completing<00:02:24.120> as<00:02:24.300> development<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:26.280> second<00:02:26.730> big

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
completing as development the second big

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.130 
completing as development the second big
idea<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.440> white<00:02:28.800> has<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> possibility

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
idea is that white has the possibility
