enemy unknown and the first time I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
played XCOM I remember walking my guys

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.799 
played XCOM I remember walking my guys
off<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.570> dropship<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:59.010> immediately

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
off the dropship and they immediately

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.560 
off the dropship and they immediately
were<00:01:00.809> shot<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.649> died<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.239> thought<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
were shot at and died and I thought that

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.179 
were shot at and died and I thought that
was<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> coolest<00:01:04.350> things<00:01:04.769> I'd<00:01:04.949> seen

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
was one of the coolest things I'd seen

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.429 
was one of the coolest things I'd seen
in<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.000> video<00:01:06.150> game<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> time<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.380> was

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
in a video game at the time it was

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.120 
in a video game at the time it was
brutal<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.189> its<00:01:08.729> difficulty<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.950> was

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
brutal and its difficulty and it was

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060 
brutal and its difficulty and it was
just<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:12.020> unique<00:01:13.020> way<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> playing<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.890> game

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
just a unique way of playing a game

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.270 
just a unique way of playing a game
where<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:15.509> could<00:01:15.750> reload<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.170> game<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.040> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
where you could reload your game but I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.390 
where you could reload your game but I
think<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.720> were<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> real<00:01:19.110> man<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:20.040> let

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
think if you were a real man you let

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.780 
think if you were a real man you let
those<00:01:20.580> guys<00:01:20.790> died

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
different in the way that you play the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.030 
different in the way that you play the
game<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.940> that<00:01:36.120> we<00:01:36.240> feel<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.600> we've

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
game and that we feel like we've

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.590 
game and that we feel like we've
enhanced<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.310> things<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.510> we

liked and remove some of the things that
we<00:01:41.820> didn't<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.420> thought<00:01:42.540> maybe<00:01:42.690> we're<00:01:43.229> t

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
we didn't like and thought maybe we're t

we didn't like and thought maybe we're t
get<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.250> there's<00:01:44.369> lots<00:01:44.550> of<00:01:44.670> different

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
actions that you can do you can move you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.710 
actions that you can do you can move you
can<00:01:47.040> shoot<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.910> aim<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.979> suppress

can shoot you can aim you can suppress

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.700 
can shoot you can aim you can suppress
one<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> cool<00:01:52.050> things<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
one of the cool things is the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
one of the cool things is the
suppression<00:01:53.130> ability<00:01:53.700> which<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.390> do

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
suppression ability which when you do

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.260 
suppression ability which when you do
use<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.110> an<00:01:55.229> alien<00:01:55.460> your<00:01:56.460> character<00:01:56.880> fires

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
use it on an alien your character fires

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
use it on an alien your character fires
at<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.720> alien<00:01:58.080> but<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.290> continues<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:58.950> fire

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
at that alien but it continues the fire

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.969 
at that alien but it continues the fire
on<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> alien<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.030> visually<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> game<00:02:01.140> seems

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
on the alien so visually the game seems

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.830 
on the alien so visually the game seems
like<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.550> takes<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.000> real-time<00:02:04.700> approach

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
like it takes on a real-time approach

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.359 
like it takes on a real-time approach
but<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.350> none<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.590> those<00:02:07.800> shots<00:02:08.130> are

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
but really none of those shots are

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.699 
but really none of those shots are
hitting<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.600> shots<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:09.989> bouncing<00:02:10.619> off

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
hitting but the shots are bouncing off

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.680 
hitting but the shots are bouncing off
of<00:02:10.770> car<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.340> breaking<00:02:11.760> glass<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.600> it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
of car is breaking glass in it and it

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.080 
of car is breaking glass in it and it
really<00:02:12.900> provides<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.590> very<00:02:14.090> action-oriented

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
really provides a very action-oriented

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.190 
really provides a very action-oriented
feel<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> turn-based<00:02:16.020> strategy<00:02:16.230> game<00:02:21.200> it's

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
feel to a turn-based strategy game it's

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.750 
feel to a turn-based strategy game it's
ridiculous<00:02:22.410> what<00:02:23.010> we're<00:02:23.160> able<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.459> do<00:02:23.580> now

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
ridiculous what we're able to do now

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.120 
ridiculous what we're able to do now
compared<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:25.560> things<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.920> we're<00:02:26.040> done

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
compared to the things that we're done

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.680 
compared to the things that we're done
in<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.370> original<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.180> fact<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.480> we're

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
in the original just the fact that we're

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.280 
in the original just the fact that we're
we're<00:02:28.019> 3d<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.880> interactivity<00:02:30.600> with<00:02:31.049> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
we're 3d the interactivity with the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.750 
we're 3d the interactivity with the
environment<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:32.040> far<00:02:32.220> as<00:02:32.340> being<00:02:32.489> able<00:02:32.700> to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
environment as far as being able to

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.509 
environment as far as being able to
climb<00:02:33.090> over<00:02:33.410> climb<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.830> jump<00:02:35.310> through

climb over climb on to jump through

windows kick down doors jump off of
buildings<00:02:39.019> blowing<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.140> holes<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.620> bill

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
buildings blowing the holes in the bill

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.690 
buildings blowing the holes in the bill
there's<00:02:40.920> all<00:02:40.980> these<00:02:41.100> things<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.549> could

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
there's all these things that you could

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.250 
there's all these things that you could
kind<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.090> could<00:02:42.239> do<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> original<00:02:42.840> lex

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
kind of you could do in the original lex

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.650 
kind of you could do in the original lex
come<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:43.830> seems<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.700> much<00:02:44.880> cooler<00:02:45.180> now<00:02:45.480> that

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
come but seems so much cooler now that
