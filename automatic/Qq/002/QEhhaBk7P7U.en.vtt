00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 solemnly swear to do nothing good and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.319
 I started the same video as the new Diego Diego 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.400
 potter observatory for a very 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.710
 Special 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.259
 Today, July 31 is the day of the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.509
 harry potter's birthday and the embassy 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.270
 also from our beloved rowling so 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.220
 I decided to make a special tag of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 harry potter and this tag she is not so 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.230
 so she's already pretty old here in the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.449
 youtube and I decided to answer now 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 who does not answer that time then I 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.969
 I find this absurd my life in 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.960
 steal what you would see in the mirror 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.030
 today 7 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.370
 I have no doubt that when I 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.640
 Look at the mirror of today I surrender 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.860
 Would I see a prince? 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.649
 exactly a prince but so I 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.710
 would be with such a person for a 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 whole life knows I'm very romantic 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.879
 I'm very sentimental if so 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.010
 biggest dream of my life to find 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.020
 someone and spend a lifetime with this 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.539
 Someone would surely be my mirror. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.960
 of today 7 runs bad would be your animal 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.090
 the boss is hamas a cat is not people is 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.240
 a cat I'm extremely passionate 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.360
 by cats because cats are the best animal 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 universe 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.780
 Not that your bogeyman is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.780
 I would change the ball I do not think 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.630
 It would be a plausible fear because my 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.659
 Fears like that, no, it's not things, it's not 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.220
 palpable non fears thus extracted then 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.979
 would not have like my bug after 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.860
 to transform my fears but to 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.380
 to become a terror of mine would be a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.479
 cocky there look gives me even a shiver has 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.950
 fear of hitting disgusting and cheap has 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.960
 I keep imagining a bogeyman 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.900
 great though integrate our go 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.090
 prepare because the mec which smell you 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.990
 I would feel in your potion of bubblegum love 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.729
 tutti frutti and thigh where you 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 I would spend your free time 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.710
 there I would like in the library there those 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.810
 that are banned off are okay at that one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.540
 also in that bathtub where the defendant in 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.200
 April the dragon's neat egg that he leased 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.399
 so the egg us one bathroom and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.210
 sensational and I as a 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.430
 shower 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.290
 I think I'd spend in that bathtub. 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.810
 wonderful companion, what would be your 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.270
 Position of Quidditch My Position Would Be 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.940
 sitting on the bleachers 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.150
 What is your favorite book and movie? 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.300
 favorite book and movie and merge 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.610
 because it's the same I love the last book and 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.220
 Last film about death for reasons 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.680
 obvious is the last one the emotions are 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.860
 skin flower the open stitches are 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.770
 closed wonderfully well and the final 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.480
 of the story is very exciting both the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.760
 death book relics as the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.310
 death relics part 1 and 2 are from 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.800
 profile of the euro what was the book you 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.380
 least liked what I liked best 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.590
 everyone was the secret chamber 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.480
 for me so to the book - legal if it is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.060
 harry potter manages to have a book - 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.290
 cool, it's not even the secret chamber. 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.360
 because it was not a book that I would go 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.459
 excited as the others that I do not know 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.350
 I think the story did not catch me so much. 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.450
 accounts or another comes out in the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.730
 legal or logical is that camera and such 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.709
 between everyone was the least I liked 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.930
 even with the parts of the films and books 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.610
 that made Kim cry 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.730
 I think I cried at the end of everything, huh? 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.549
 in the exciting potter unijuÃ­ think cool 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.459
 of everything but in the last movie I arrived 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.340
 Well, many more deaths 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.400
 that I did not believe I had much 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.500
 end of the epilogue I could not read the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.420
 epilogue of so much that I cried because 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.610
 the tears did not leave even the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.950
 goalkeeper books or was it not roberto carlos 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.140
 but there were many emotions in dung 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.900
 Favorite character joke but I 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.150
 I answer in the snake can snape is the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.609
 best character of all time 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.070
 all times of a lifetime and snake 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.109
 It's amazing the character completes the 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.350
 interesting character character 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:58.350
 courageous act out is the snake people already 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.290
 played one of the video games or be lynched 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.269
 here but I never played won you 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.310
 was happy with the end, I 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.460
 I was extremely happy with the final 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.530
 I stayed 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.490
 held with final because harry potter 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.700
 It was a life for me. I read harry potter. 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.830
 99 and 2000 and the first book and when 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.570
 came out the first movie I had read 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.020
 even the cup of fire 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.630
 so I literally spent 10 11 years 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.930
 reading harry potter knows so it was a 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.870
 life was a very nice phase that 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.870
 incredible feeling to expect from whom 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.630
 write every book I had the feeling 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.520
 to wait for whoever writes each book 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.220
 when it's over 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.530
 Look, I'm going to cry here, man. I feel. 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.270
 exactly the emotion I felt that I 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.460
 I do not have the last book in my 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.070
 emotion I felt reading the last book 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.830
 was a completed stage of a phase of 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.690
 My life has closed the book and I take it. 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.650
 this is so in my heart forever 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.770
 because it wants to be able to really changed lives 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.200
 changed readers and made readers and has a 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.180
 legion even today, this is no small matter. 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.440

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.400
