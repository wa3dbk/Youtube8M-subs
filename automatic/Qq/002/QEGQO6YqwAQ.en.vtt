00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.890
 that's why I like this job she 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.720
 was trying cars in the world 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.290
 full 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:17.300
 look at lunar landscape sum by 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.189
 nas desert bardenas in spain 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.189
 in the presentation of the skoda yeti 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.699
 between the fog the tinÃ©e 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.669
 it feels like you're on the line 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:40.200
 the yeti that is followed by 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.380
 the skoda with followed them his 80 thousand 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 cars in France of 120 miles in 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.980
 2012 80000 2013 it remains quite powerful 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 and they have 2% of the market which is not 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.170
 wrong for skoda should know that these two 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.140
 markets dominated by qashqai and tiguan on 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.520
 is going to say but the good year bad year his 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 happened to place himself because he plays a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.190
 little on all the grounds of both the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.090
 wolf than subjects then from the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.820
 modularity minivan while having some 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.460
 sedan benefits that's what says 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.630
 press service but it's true 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.140
 advantage this car too is it's 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.130
 cut 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.800
 km 22 the very compact it looks 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.770
 big she led what makes that 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.360
 I was going to say his money he was 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.619
 between two segments with the little ones and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.380
 follow compact capture 2008 and the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.210
 tiguan and kashkal kind and his 10 years 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.260
 have found a positioning that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 worried that is interesting 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.180
 So here it is, the new 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 which is very little restyled has lost his 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 little lighthouses then have the big 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.020
 novelty is that there is now a 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.330
 version a bit more what they call 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.740
 here is outdoor 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.030
 yes I will spend a lot of attention but 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.310
 Attac a little leaves e higher degree 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.440
 protective plastic strips on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.680
 the good side his ponette of tic but the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.600
 look changes a bit and back 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.700
 here is there a little more interesting 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.660
 on the on skoda yeti it's by 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.530
 compared to the market which mainly 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.620
 diesel 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.280
 they sell a lot of gasoline believe 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.400
 that it represents almost 20 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.420
 % of mix 30% and then they sell a lot 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.180
 version 4 4 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900
 most people the competitors of the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.799
 two-wheel drive 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.629
 they have more than a third of 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.109
 shopping also that they are four wheels 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.969
 motorists who are only on the 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.310
 110 horsepower 140 horsepower diesel engines 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:49.700
 170 horses here is what proves well 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.439
 we have a rather special public 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.579
 bed 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:57.500
 here I would say almost a peak of two 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.349
 connoisseurs or at least people who 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.760
 scratch their heads down and 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.540
 certainly one of the most 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.540
 cool skoda
