00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 definitely not the game that there 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.040
 it served however at the same time could 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.730
 be it because also the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.390
 the first round we came from a 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.770
 negative period at home against Juve 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.270
 then there was a small turnaround if yes 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.410
 can say so because we have succeeded in 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.910
 equalize 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.489
 obviously it's a difficult game 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.150
 we play against the strongest team 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.940
 of the championship 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.070
 that is our duty at home 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.010
 to try as we have always done 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.120
 as it happened in the first leg as we have 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.730
 done whenever we met 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.030
 great teams we have shown that 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.660
 however when we are fit we are 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.150
 annoying in the sense that we can give 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.820
 us to all the teams so there is 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.699
 we are going to play of course to do 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.190
 a great game to play trying 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.920
 to win or take home a result 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.210
 we really must be perfect not 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.420
 we have nothing wrong 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.190
 and maybe hope they are wrong 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.790
 something is a team built for 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.420
 win so it is normal for there to be 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.640
 top players I like to challenge me with 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:27.220
 with the best because I get involved 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.510
 this does n't scare me 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.900
 I am aware of the fact that it is 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.490
 difficult but maybe it looks like it's done 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.180
 a sentence made however nothing is 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.150
 impossible 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.150
 in the end even with a bit of luck 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.970
 we managed to stop the juve 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.110
 on the way we also propose ourselves 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.280
 right now I'm a player of 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.060
 when he is well he is strong but not me 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.850
 I still feel great or at the top 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.180
 sample with a sample even without 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.310
 big though i'm sure in the end it is 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.290
 what I want and always improve 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.870
 more because I am not satisfied with 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.879
 be so 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.000
 I know I have to improve in so many things e 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.489
 I'm sure I'll do it then 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.040
 and of course I'm a followed player 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.920
 from juve 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.130
 It is obvious that all people 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.480
 will watch this match will concern 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.370
 me with a different eye not with much 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.290
 interest 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.510
 but I think it's the game of 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.600
 stony because there is a series b is right 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.020
 just talk about the zaza that plays against the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.500
 juve would be perhaps also not very respectful 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.870
 in my conversation I talk about my companions because 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.420
 I could not have done without them 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.980
 nothing I could not have had this 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.400
 this change 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.190
 this football change therefore but 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.760
 then fundamentally it's me who doesn't 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.180
 I see I don't live like the game 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.980
 of the year with a match 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.740
 continuity is very important to me 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.990
 which is important to me what many 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.270
 sometimes I missed it so I don't live it 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.560
 so here it is so obsessively 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.560
 this week
