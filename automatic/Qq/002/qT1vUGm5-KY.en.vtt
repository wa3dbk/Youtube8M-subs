the UAD - satellite

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.189 
the UAD - satellite
there's<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.330> duo<00:00:25.480> which<00:00:25.750> is<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:25.990> one<00:00:26.110> I'm

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
there's the duo which is the one I'm

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.350 
there's the duo which is the one I'm
holding<00:00:26.289> here<00:00:26.680> it<00:00:27.130> has<00:00:27.310> two<00:00:27.550> shark<00:00:27.850> processing

holding here it has two shark processing

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.480 
holding here it has two shark processing
chips<00:00:28.600> in<00:00:28.779> it<00:00:28.869> then<00:00:29.380> there's<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.680> quad<00:00:29.920> which

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
chips in it then there's the quad which

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.890 
chips in it then there's the quad which
is<00:00:30.609> virtually<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.029> same<00:00:31.270> except<00:00:31.690> that<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:31.869> has

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
four processing chips in it so you can

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.250 
four processing chips in it so you can
run<00:00:33.940> even<00:00:34.059> more<00:00:34.210> plugins<00:00:34.570> with<00:00:34.870> that<00:00:35.019> version
