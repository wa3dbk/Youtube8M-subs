what could really happen you know in
this<00:01:49.710> situation<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> think

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
this situation because if you think

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.080 
this situation because if you think
about<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.770> can't<00:01:52.979> die<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.880> body

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
about it if you can't die and your body

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060

starts<00:01:54.390> decaying<00:01:54.750> over<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> period<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.829> time

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
starts decaying over a period of time

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.429 
starts decaying over a period of time
because<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.000> got<00:01:57.540> shot<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> head<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.380> you

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
because you got shot in the head and you

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.230 
because you got shot in the head and you
could<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.829> died<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.759> heart<00:02:00.000> stops

could have died and your heart stops

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.639 
could have died and your heart stops
working<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:00.960> body<00:02:01.110> starts<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.500> gain
