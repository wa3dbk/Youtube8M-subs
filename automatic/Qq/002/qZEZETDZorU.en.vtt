00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:26.580
 This is because there was a Hello

 The drill I will introduce today is to step on the ball outside the left foot and actually hit the ball 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 I want to do a drill 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:38.160
 This drill pulls out the left side during swing 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.780
 Or if you can not stand firmly on the left then from impact to follow 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.680
 If the head does not run easily 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.300
 It is a very effective drill for such people 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.110
 By performing the cord reel 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.080
 I will write the ball so the left side is firmly 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:58.480
 book club will run the club head while squeezing the left side by doing so 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:03.460
 Drill is let's take a look at it in the actual drill cultivate such a sense of 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:09.810
 First of all please in per it is the ball comes stance of his left foot in 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:13.330
 And please step on the other side of this ball's left foot on the other side of the arch . 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.660
 It feels like the left foot is slightly crotched by doing so 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.660
 4 and will continue to hit as usual always the address of the street from there 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.450
 I hit as usual but because we are stepping on the ball with his left foot left impact over the co 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.760
 The side gets distorted very tight 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.250
 It feels like the club head is running by doing so 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.610
 I think you feel 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.200
 By all means 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.040
 The left side by swinging as usual while stepping on the ball with everyone's foot 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.900
 To run the foot feeling the kiss of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.830
 Please practice to feel such a sense 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.830
 Then I 'm actually hitting 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.260
 Hmm 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.260
 Hmm 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.980
 Yes, so the drill is actually stepping on the ball with the left foot 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.980
 Please do your best and practice
