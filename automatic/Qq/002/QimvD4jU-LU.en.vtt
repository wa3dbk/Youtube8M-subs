00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
a lil bit extra sodium your muscles is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.000 
a lil bit extra sodium your muscles is
going<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> have<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> whole<00:02:24.349> lot<00:02:24.530> more<00:02:24.709> water

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
going to have a whole lot more water

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.100 
going to have a whole lot more water
retention<00:02:25.340> as<00:02:26.150> well<00:02:26.390> as<00:02:26.480> your<00:02:26.630> joints<00:02:26.959> and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
tendons so I purposefully gained a few

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.540 
tendons so I purposefully gained a few
pounds<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.050> could<00:02:30.230> train<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> bit<00:02:30.650> heavier<00:02:30.980> so

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
pounds so I could train a bit heavier so

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.979 
pounds so I could train a bit heavier so
