00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
with a grin and not lasso right so you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
with a grin and not lasso right so you
stripped<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.330> coating<00:01:12.659> back<00:01:12.869> yep<00:01:13.260> actually

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
stripped the coating back yep actually

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.590 
underneath that and this is quite
important<00:01:29.610> I've<00:01:29.729> tired<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.180> couple<00:01:30.509> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
important I've tired a couple of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260 
important I've tired a couple of
overhand<00:01:31.140> knots<00:01:31.470> within<00:01:31.829> sort<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.280> 15<00:01:32.820> 10<00:01:33.150> or

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
overhand knots within sort of 15 10 or

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
overhand knots within sort of 15 10 or
15<00:01:33.600> mil<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.259> top<00:01:34.470> bait<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
15 mil of the top bait right what that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.399 
15 mil of the top bait right what that
does<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.150> probably<00:01:36.540> guess<00:01:36.869> by<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.079> is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
does is you probably guess by now is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
does is you probably guess by now is
when<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.979> slide<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.490> bottom<00:01:38.640> bait<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
when you slide your bottom bait on it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.969 
when you slide your bottom bait on it
gives<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.689> something<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.079> grip<00:01:40.320> too<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.740> it's

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
gives it something to grip too so it's

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.889 
gives it something to grip too so it's
not<00:01:41.100> sliding<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.820> down<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> hair<00:01:42.299> exactly

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
not sliding up and down the hair exactly

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.149 
not sliding up and down the hair exactly
so<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.079> doesn't<00:01:43.320> end<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.500> getting<00:01:43.799> too<00:01:43.920> close

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
so it doesn't end up getting too close

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.710 
so it doesn't end up getting too close
to<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> exactly<00:01:45.149> stopping<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.570> they're

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
to the exactly stopping so they're

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.480 
to the exactly stopping so they're
locked<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.170> position<00:01:46.320> pretty<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.009> okay<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
locked in position pretty right okay and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.819 
locked in position pretty right okay and
how's<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> hook<00:01:48.060> tied<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.170> hooks<00:01:49.350> tied<00:01:49.590> on

big<00:02:15.510> bit<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.780> putty<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.319> well<00:02:16.470> how'd<00:02:16.709> you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
big bit of putty on as well how'd you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.280 
big bit of putty on as well how'd you
stop<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.220> sliding<00:02:17.519> around<00:02:17.760> what<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.599> do<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:18.959> I

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
stop that sliding around what I do is I

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.170 
stop that sliding around what I do is I
just<00:02:19.349> push<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:20.010> coating<00:02:20.580> back<00:02:20.819> with<00:02:21.090> my

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
just push the coating back with my

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.000 
just push the coating back with my
finger<00:02:21.480> now<00:02:21.629> just<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.110> sort<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.379> ruffles<00:02:22.860> a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
finger now just so it sort of ruffles a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.130 
finger now just so it sort of ruffles a
concertinas<00:02:23.549> it<00:02:23.670> happily<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.870> gives<00:02:25.049> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
concertinas it happily and that gives it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.839 
concertinas it happily and that gives it
some<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.470> perches<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.040> where<00:02:26.489> I'll<00:02:26.670> dit

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
some of the perches to where I'll dit

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.850 
some of the perches to where I'll dit
around<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.269> right<00:02:27.659> and<00:02:27.810> what's<00:02:27.989> why<00:02:28.260> such<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
around that right and what's why such a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.979 
around that right and what's why such a
big<00:02:29.099> bit<00:02:29.310> well<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.120> don't<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.599> I<00:02:30.629> put<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.900> on

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
big bit well I don't know I put it on

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.660 
big bit well I don't know I put it on
all<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.170> my<00:02:31.379> rigs<00:02:31.560> down<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.890> think<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.220> just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
all of my rigs down I think it just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.580 
all of my rigs down I think it just
helps<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.030> pull<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.299> hook<00:02:33.420> down<00:02:33.629> right<00:02:34.200> okay

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
helps to pull the hook down right okay

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.140 
helps to pull the hook down right okay
bit<00:02:34.829> of<00:02:34.860> extra<00:02:35.190> white<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.610> when<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:36.030> go

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
bit of extra white so when you can go
slack<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.930> moment<00:02:37.560> you've<00:02:37.799> always<00:02:37.950> got

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
slack that moment you've always got

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.530 
slack that moment you've always got
something<00:02:38.370> pulling<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.730> pulling<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.090> down<00:02:39.299> all

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
something pulling it pulling it down all

of<00:03:44.519> bottom<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:44.940> wanted<00:03:45.810> something<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.169> was

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
of bottom I wanted something that was

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.140 
of bottom I wanted something that was
more<00:03:46.500> forgiving<00:03:46.980> as<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.129> foam<00:03:47.370> section<00:03:47.879> so<00:03:48.030> it

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
more forgiving as a foam section so it

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.909 
more forgiving as a foam section so it
wouldn't<00:03:48.359> stick<00:03:48.690> heart<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.349> it<00:03:49.440> wasn't<00:03:49.709> bolt

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
wouldn't stick heart so it wasn't bolt

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.770 
wouldn't stick heart so it wasn't bolt
upright<00:03:50.099> at<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.639> bottom<00:03:51.030> then<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.269> was<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.599> bit

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
upright at the bottom then it was a bit

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.089 
upright at the bottom then it was a bit
of<00:03:51.870> weed<00:03:52.019> or<00:03:52.260> something<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.680> wouldn't<00:03:52.829> stick

up<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.549> was<00:03:53.669> still<00:03:53.849> sit<00:03:54.329> down<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:54.840> blend

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
up and it was still sit down and blend

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.259 
up and it was still sit down and blend
in<00:03:55.290> well<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.859> started<00:03:56.099> off<00:03:56.280> using<00:03:56.519> 15<00:03:57.000> pound

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
in well I started off using 15 pound

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.670 
in well I started off using 15 pound
line<00:03:57.449> straight<00:03:57.810> through<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.349> then<00:03:58.410> I

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
line straight through and then I

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.439 
line straight through and then I
realized<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.069> coated<00:03:59.459> section<00:03:59.879> he's<00:04:00.030> even<00:04:00.329> more

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
realized a coated section he's even more

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.780 
realized a coated section he's even more
robust<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.169> tough<00:04:01.349> so<00:04:01.379> right<00:04:01.889> again<00:04:02.519> I've<00:04:02.669> got

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
robust and tough so right again I've got

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.909 
robust and tough so right again I've got

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
pinched on to hold it down right and

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.559 
pinched on to hold it down right and
have<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.769> tried<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.129> hook<00:04:08.340> on<00:04:08.519> well<00:04:09.239> that's

have you tried that hook on well that's

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.180 
have you tried that hook on well that's
that<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.049> just<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.379> very<00:04:10.590> basic<00:04:10.769> simple

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.150 
swivel on there that I take it that's to
counterbalance<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.620> buoyancy<00:04:57.770> air<00:04:58.070> to

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
counterbalance that the buoyancy air to

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.010 
counterbalance that the buoyancy air to
pop<00:04:58.340> up<00:04:58.550> yes<00:04:59.060> that's<00:04:59.270> right<00:04:59.420> yeah<00:04:59.690> a<00:04:59.720> bit<00:04:59.930> of

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
very very slowly right so that whole bit

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.860 
very very slowly right so that whole bit
is<00:05:05.120> off<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.450> bottom

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
is off the bottom

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.360 
is off the bottom
yes<00:05:06.290> that's<00:05:06.530> off<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.770> bottom<00:05:06.980> sorry<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.220> say

out<00:05:19.400> there<00:05:19.580> it's<00:05:19.790> critically<00:05:20.210> balanced<00:05:20.570> the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
out there it's critically balanced the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.240 
out there it's critically balanced the
Fisher<00:05:20.960> mooch<00:05:21.170> and<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.410> were<00:05:21.530> a<00:05:21.590> bit<00:05:21.770> of<00:05:21.890> a<00:05:21.980> team

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
Fisher mooch and I were a bit of a team

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.090 
Fisher mooch and I were a bit of a team
you'll<00:05:22.490> bake<00:05:22.700> and<00:05:23.620> because<00:05:24.620> it's<00:05:24.770> quickly

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
you'll bake and because it's quickly

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.890 
you'll bake and because it's quickly
balanced<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.520> fish<00:05:25.670> comes<00:05:25.940> in<00:05:26.180> obviously<00:05:26.810> all

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
balanced the fish comes in obviously all

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.940 
balanced the fish comes in obviously all
the<00:05:26.990> other<00:05:27.110> baits<00:05:27.380> are<00:05:27.560> heavier

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
the other baits are heavier

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.160 
the other baits are heavier
I<00:05:28.100> mean<00:05:28.760> hook<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.090> was<00:05:29.210> built<00:05:29.480> not<00:05:29.660> phenomenal

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
I mean hook I was built not phenomenal

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.320 
I mean hook I was built not phenomenal
yeah<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:31.160> seems<00:05:31.400> to<00:05:31.460> be<00:05:31.580> working<00:05:31.700> well<00:05:32.090> and

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
yeah it seems to be working well and

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.210 
yeah it seems to be working well and
about<00:05:32.750> half<00:05:32.930> me<00:05:33.140> fish<00:05:33.320> on<00:05:33.440> this<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.830> half<00:05:34.010> on

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
about half me fish on this and half on

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.580 
about half me fish on this and half on
the<00:05:34.250> other<00:05:34.340> presentation<00:05:35.120> I<00:05:35.440> normally<00:05:36.440> you

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
the other presentation I normally you

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.350 
the other presentation I normally you
sort<00:05:36.980> will<00:05:37.100> find<00:05:37.310> out<00:05:37.520> which<00:05:37.670> works<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.120> and

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
sort will find out which works and and

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.120 
sort will find out which works and and
switch<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.840> that<00:05:38.990> yeah<00:05:39.380> at<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:39.710> moment

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
switch to that yeah at the moment

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.400 
switch to that yeah at the moment
they're<00:05:40.910> both<00:05:41.060> working<00:05:41.480> so<00:05:41.630> I<00:05:41.660> think<00:05:41.930> I<00:05:42.140> may

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
they're both working so I think I may

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.150 
they're both working so I think I may
have<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.860> change<00:05:42.890> this<00:05:43.430> evening<00:05:44.860> so<00:05:45.860> that's<00:05:46.010> it

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
have to change this evening so that's it

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.330 
have to change this evening so that's it
they're<00:05:46.550> going<00:05:46.670> to<00:05:46.730> go<00:05:46.820> back<00:05:47.000> out<00:05:47.180> there
