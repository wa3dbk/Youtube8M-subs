towards one week of singles and the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.609 
towards one week of singles and the
reality<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.540> guys<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.140> simply

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
reality is guys it is simply

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
reality is guys it is simply
counterproductive<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.780> unnecessary<00:02:06.780> for

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
counterproductive and unnecessary for

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130 
counterproductive and unnecessary for

you to test your strength because it has

a higher rate of injury because you're

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
things that you actually want to be

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
training yourself to have so guys you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.920 
training yourself to have so guys you
got<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.909> remember<00:02:36.030> there<00:02:36.299> is<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> massive

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
got to remember there is a massive

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.229 
got to remember there is a massive
difference<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.829> I've<00:02:38.519> heard<00:02:38.639> Paul<00:02:38.879> Carter

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
difference and I've heard Paul Carter

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.849 
difference and I've heard Paul Carter
worded<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.629> way<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> massive<00:02:40.709> difference

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
worded this way a massive difference

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.569 
worded this way a massive difference
between<00:02:41.719> building<00:02:42.719> strength<00:02:43.139> and

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
between building strength and

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.789 
between building strength and
demonstrating<00:02:44.579> strength<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:46.379> only<00:02:46.530> time<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
demonstrating strength the only time you

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.289 
demonstrating strength the only time you
should<00:02:46.829> be<00:02:47.040> demonstrating<00:02:47.700> strength<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.150> when

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
should be demonstrating strength is when

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.000 
should be demonstrating strength is when
you're<00:02:48.419> at<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.569> competitive<00:02:49.230> event<00:02:49.620> or<00:02:49.829> you're

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
you're at a competitive event or you're

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.099 
you're at a competitive event or you're

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
recommend you do that if you're an

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.860 
recommend you do that if you're an
athlete<00:02:59.189> because<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.120> just<00:03:00.269> save<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.689> for

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
athlete because you just save that for

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.099 
athlete because you just save that for
the<00:03:00.989> meets<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:03.209> demonstration<00:03:03.840> of

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
the meets and that demonstration of

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.599 
the meets and that demonstration of
strength<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.739> actually<00:03:05.159> going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.489> be<00:03:05.579> a

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
strength is actually going to be a

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.270 
strength is actually going to be a
training<00:03:05.909> session<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.629> which<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:06.959> build<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
training session in which you build the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.929 
training session in which you build the
strength<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.879> build<00:03:09.419> OS<00:03:10.139> muscle<00:03:10.939> so

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
strength that you build OS muscle so

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.789 
strength that you build OS muscle so
keep<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.329> mind<00:03:12.359> that<00:03:12.719> more<00:03:12.900> often<00:03:13.169> that<00:03:13.500> you're

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
keep in mind that more often that you're

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.470 
keep in mind that more often that you're
demonstrating<00:03:14.760> strength<00:03:15.090> instead<00:03:15.389> of

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
demonstrating strength instead of

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.240 
demonstrating strength instead of
building<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.230> slower<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.739> progress<00:03:17.099> is

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
building it the slower your progress is

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.009 
building it the slower your progress is
going<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.519> be<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.780> again<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:20.370> answer<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:21.019> you

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
going to be so again the answer is you

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.469 
going to be so again the answer is you
should<00:03:22.049> test<00:03:23.010> your<00:03:23.220> true<00:03:23.579> maxes<00:03:24.060> when<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.389> are

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
should test your true maxes when you are

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.629 
should test your true maxes when you are
at<00:03:24.629> competition<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.409> competition<00:03:25.530> only<00:03:26.010> and

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
at competition and competition only and

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.490 
at competition and competition only and
if<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.299> don't<00:03:27.540> compete<00:03:27.900> there's<00:03:28.139> no<00:03:28.290> need<00:03:28.470> to

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
if you don't compete there's no need to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.929 
if you don't compete there's no need to
template<00:03:29.189> you<00:03:29.280> compete<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.669> some<00:03:29.819> other

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
template you compete in some other

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.490 
template you compete in some other
sports<00:03:30.239> where<00:03:30.449> you<00:03:30.479> need<00:03:30.689> to<00:03:30.750> get<00:03:30.840> strong<00:03:31.229> you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
sports where you need to get strong you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580 
sports where you need to get strong you
will<00:03:32.069> develop<00:03:32.419> maximum<00:03:33.419> strength<00:03:34.139> on<00:03:34.379> the

will develop maximum strength on the
