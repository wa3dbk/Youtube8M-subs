00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.610 
go to the trading card game mode when
it's<00:05:33.100> loads<00:05:33.310> up<00:05:33.750> so<00:05:34.750> let's<00:05:34.900> go<00:05:35.080> ahead<00:05:35.110> and<00:05:35.260> scan

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
it's loads up so let's go ahead and scan

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:53.010 
it's loads up so let's go ahead and scan
the<00:05:35.830> Red<00:05:36.160> Ranger

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.750 

I

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.920 

so<00:06:01.760> it's<00:06:01.880> gonna<00:06:01.970> do<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.270> same<00:06:02.450> thing<00:06:02.660> what<00:06:02.840> it

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
so it's gonna do the same thing what it

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.690 
so it's gonna do the same thing what it
does<00:06:03.080> in<00:06:03.230> the<00:06:03.290> TCG<00:06:03.800> mode<00:06:03.980> that<00:06:04.190> Gosei<00:06:04.520> Morpher

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
does in the TCG mode that Gosei Morpher

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.980 
does in the TCG mode that Gosei Morpher
so<00:06:05.060> if<00:06:05.150> you<00:06:05.210> want<00:06:05.360> to<00:06:05.390> do<00:06:05.480> all<00:06:05.600> that<00:06:05.720> cool<00:06:05.960> stuff

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
so if you want to do all that cool stuff

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.410 
so if you want to do all that cool stuff
I<00:06:06.440> think<00:06:06.740> this<00:06:06.860> is<00:06:06.920> a<00:06:07.250> better<00:06:07.760> way<00:06:08.030> of<00:06:08.060> doing

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
I think this is a better way of doing

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.390 
I think this is a better way of doing
your<00:06:08.570> power<00:06:08.870> levels<00:06:08.990> how<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:09.740> card<00:06:10.250> game

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
your power levels how the card game

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.400 
your power levels how the card game
mechanic<00:06:10.880> works<00:06:11.090> for<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:11.510> power<00:06:11.720> levels<00:06:12.170> then

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
mechanic works for the power levels then

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.470 
mechanic works for the power levels then
actually<00:06:12.800> putting<00:06:13.010> the<00:06:13.190> cards<00:06:13.520> in<00:06:13.640> risking

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
actually putting the cards in risking

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.720 
actually putting the cards in risking
ruining<00:06:14.870> your<00:06:15.200> holographic<00:06:15.860> cards<00:06:16.310> so<00:06:16.520> you

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
ruining your holographic cards so you

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.850 
ruining your holographic cards so you
got<00:06:16.940> a<00:06:16.970> cell<00:06:17.210> phone<00:06:17.240> iphone<00:06:18.050> android<00:06:18.560> phone

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
got a cell phone iphone android phone

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.040 
got a cell phone iphone android phone
that's<00:06:19.280> getting<00:06:19.580> this<00:06:19.700> to<00:06:20.150> scan<00:06:20.480> the<00:06:20.570> cards<00:06:20.960> so

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
that's getting this to scan the cards so

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.120 
that's getting this to scan the cards so
you<00:06:21.080> don't<00:06:21.290> ruin<00:06:21.410> them<00:06:21.560> or<00:06:21.800> I<00:06:21.830> guess<00:06:22.010> you<00:06:22.100> could

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
you don't ruin them or I guess you could

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.010 
you don't ruin them or I guess you could
just<00:06:22.280> plug<00:06:22.520> in<00:06:22.670> some<00:06:22.820> random<00:06:23.030> crap<00:06:23.420> card<00:06:23.750> and

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
just plug in some random crap card and

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.930 
just plug in some random crap card and
go<00:06:24.590> ahead<00:06:24.740> and<00:06:24.860> plug<00:06:24.950> that<00:06:25.010> baby<00:06:25.370> in<00:06:25.580> so<00:06:25.790> that's

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
go ahead and plug that baby in so that's

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.010 
go ahead and plug that baby in so that's
pretty<00:06:26.120> much<00:06:26.270> it<00:06:26.330> i<00:06:26.630> want<00:06:26.810> to<00:06:26.870> have<00:06:26.960> these
