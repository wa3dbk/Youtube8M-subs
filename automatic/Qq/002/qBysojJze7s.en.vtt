00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.330
 hello everyone if you remember we are in June 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.760
 talked in detail about 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.109
 blackberry q10 but now we are on the show 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.349
 ifa 2013 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.619
 and when they saw three options at once 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.840
 color models and 5 at the company booth 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.430
 black were we could not pass by and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.860
 decided to tell you a little bit of it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.250
 There is such a black model where there is 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.250
 gabelas 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.550
 eg 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.550
 and this is still red 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.550
 This is such a budget option 10 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.750
 if he walks completely plastic 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.660
 very light compact not block lies in 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.739
 zade hand is something 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.739
 something like 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.660
 nokia models probably even 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.719
 who are running windows phone 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 Naturally the same plastic backdrop 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.140
 blackberry logo 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.500
 and ti megapixel camera with 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 the ability to shoot full hd video at 30 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.860
 frames per second from the front 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 2 megapixel camera display 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.880
 3 full one tenths of an inch 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.230
 the resolution is 720 by 720 pixels here 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.310
 standard operating system 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.619
 we are grief 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.540
 we talked about it in detail here 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.950
 there is a quick menu all that stuff 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.550
 As for the text, I certainly can not 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.680
 tell how it will recruit how 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.700
 text will be typed in Russian not 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.219
 Russian 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.950
 but in English or in German we are now 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.640
 try 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.640
 write something 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.220
 , 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.220
 no that's not , 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.700
 Paris called are pressed quite clearly 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.090
 they are really flat 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.060
 but at the same time have a tangible here I am honored 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.069
 pressed very nicely done pretty 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.860
 well worth the dual core 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.430
 the processor become exactly melted by as many as two 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.390
 tenths gigahertz is qualcomm msm8960 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.800
 kind 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.350
 we are preparing the processor more than once 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.550
 told in many phones 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.160
 it is installed 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.530
 reported that this phone can 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.530
 work up to 12 inclined hours in mode 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.450
 talk and up to three hundred and thirty six 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.440
 hours in 3g networks 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.440
 In standby 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.780
 known here there is bluetooth gps wai 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.130
 fay all that stuff is a version from Altai 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.890
 then Russian frequencies are supported 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.620
 so go buy will be very 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.330
 cool 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.239
 but as I said it is more 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.540
 Cheap version q10 let's go compare with 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.380
 another model here she is 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.710
 overall dimensions are similar 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.390
 but 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.460
 here we get an island key 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.240
 here combined in my opinion this 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.240
 even nicer 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.580
 the display is basically the same 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.580
 diagonal 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.730
 bright contrast 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.340
 thickness is about the same location 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.340
 elements are also about the original 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.530
 more budget option 10 on top 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.870
 butt is located audio jack but 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.120
 turn on the second microphone to suppress 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.430
 noise volume control 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.700
 function key on the bottom right 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.860
 second microphone for more precisely 1 microphone 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.080
 for making calls 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.830
 This stub has a card slot. 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.350
 sd and for sim card micro and side by side 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.470
 Card micro usb camera as I said 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.420
 5 megapixel is such a light 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.209
 nice device if you're a fan 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.120
 blackberry and you 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.060
 not a lot of money this moment for 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.970
 shopping something like what 10 or maybe 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.979
 be even z10 want for 10 is not about 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.139
 this is still a qwerty keyboard 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.900
 and this is a certain management style 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.910
 by device 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.430
 good machine 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.250
 cool budget keyboard nick 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.530
 if you still type the text not on 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.830
 the screen using the buttons and from the little thing for 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.830
 you
