everything up and wrap it protect it so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
piece no worse than it is already so we

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.990 
piece no worse than it is already so we

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
today on how to wrap up and prepare the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.130 
today on how to wrap up and prepare the
forks<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> shark<00:00:43.940> for<00:00:44.940> triple<00:00:45.750> clamps

forks and the shark for triple clamps

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680 
forks and the shark for triple clamps
that<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.190> send<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.969> any<00:00:48.270> event<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that you would send off in any event the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.139 
that you would send off in any event the
principles<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> same<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.760> we've

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
principles the same as you can see we've

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.170 
principles the same as you can see we've
got<00:00:51.180> lots<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.600> bubble<00:00:51.899> wrap<00:00:53.030> whenever<00:00:54.030> you're

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
got lots of bubble wrap whenever you're

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.990 
got lots of bubble wrap whenever you're
wrapping<00:00:54.719> forks<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.620> most<00:00:55.860> dangerous<00:00:56.550> area

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
wrapping forks the most dangerous area

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.810 
wrapping forks the most dangerous area
is<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:58.199> lower<00:00:58.500> casting<00:00:59.100> where<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.370> radial

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
is the lower casting where this radial

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.049 
is the lower casting where this radial
breaks<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:01.680> area<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.070> perhaps<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
breaks on up this area is perhaps the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.329 
breaks on up this area is perhaps the
heaviest<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> casting<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
heaviest because of the casting so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
heaviest because of the casting so
whenever<00:01:05.700> you're<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.150> wrap<00:01:06.299> folks<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
whenever you're going to wrap folks you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
whenever you're going to wrap folks you
always<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.470> start<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.860> base<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
always want to start at the base you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.700 
always want to start at the base you
always<00:01:09.420> want<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> also<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:10.200> sure<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
always want to also make sure that the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.789 
always want to also make sure that the
chrome<00:01:10.979> tube<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> exposed<00:01:12.240> piece

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
chrome tube here the exposed piece

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.679 
chrome tube here the exposed piece
should<00:01:13.799> not<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.250> hit<00:01:14.580> by<00:01:14.760> anything<00:01:15.000> else<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.570> if

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
should not be hit by anything else so if

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
should not be hit by anything else so if
you're<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> wrap<00:01:16.320> something<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.310> area

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you're going to wrap something this area

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.510 
you're going to wrap something this area
here<00:01:18.000> has<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> heavier<00:01:18.900> strap<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> if

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
here has to have the heavier strap so if

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.340 
here has to have the heavier strap so if
we<00:01:20.700> start<00:01:20.759> by<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.240> overlaying<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.409> way

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
we start by just overlaying it that way

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.070 
we start by just overlaying it that way
wrap<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.530> underneath<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.790> casting<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
wrap this underneath the casting so

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.550 
wrap this underneath the casting so
we've<00:01:28.259> got<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> start<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:30.350> as<00:01:31.350> we

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we've got to start there and then as we

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.580 
we've got to start there and then as we
roll<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.549> fork<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.780> sure<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.079> tuck<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
roll the fork make sure you tuck it in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.670 
roll the fork make sure you tuck it in
and<00:01:35.450> then<00:01:36.450> start<00:01:36.810> drawing<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> bubble<00:01:37.500> wrap

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and then start drawing the bubble wrap

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.840 
and then start drawing the bubble wrap
up<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> table

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.280 

and<00:01:41.360> you'll<00:01:41.510> find<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:41.900> going<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.080> walk<00:01:42.260> a

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
and you'll find it's going to walk a

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.050 
and you'll find it's going to walk a
little<00:01:42.530> bit<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:43.460> need<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.729> keep<00:01:43.880> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
little bit and so we need to keep it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.539 
little bit and so we need to keep it
going<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.930> wrap<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.470> cover<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.920> top<00:01:46.130> side<00:01:46.369> of

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
going to wrap and cover the top side of

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:56.130 
going to wrap and cover the top side of
the<00:01:46.610> form<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.869> let's<00:01:48.020> bring<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.380> around

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.050 

tension<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.440> again<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:01.250> then<00:02:01.399> tension<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:01.909> one

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
tension it again and then tension it one

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.059 
tension it again and then tension it one
last<00:02:02.270> time<00:02:04.539> so<00:02:07.690> at<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.869> point<00:02:09.170> just<00:02:09.530> visually

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
last time so at this point just visually

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.199 
last time so at this point just visually
looking<00:02:10.429> at<00:02:10.580> what<00:02:10.759> we<00:02:10.910> have<00:02:11.120> here<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.880> major

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
looking at what we have here the major

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.630 
looking at what we have here the major
part<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.870> most<00:02:15.080> important<00:02:15.620> part<00:02:15.800> where<00:02:16.519> all

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
part the most important part where all

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.220 
part the most important part where all
the<00:02:16.730> damage<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:17.510> got<00:02:17.600> lots<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.989> bubble

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
the damage is it's got lots of bubble

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.320 
the damage is it's got lots of bubble
wrap<00:02:18.260> around<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.830> our<00:02:19.010> chrome<00:02:19.430> tube<00:02:19.700> which<00:02:20.150> is

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
wrap around it our chrome tube which is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.259 
wrap around it our chrome tube which is
the<00:02:20.480> most<00:02:20.690> vulnerable<00:02:21.340> has<00:02:22.340> really<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.880> bulk

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
the most vulnerable has really the bulk

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.390 
the most vulnerable has really the bulk
of<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.780> bottle<00:02:24.050> wrap<00:02:24.230> around<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:24.890> then

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
of the bottle wrap around it and then

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.070 
of the bottle wrap around it and then
obviously<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.850> tapers<00:02:26.239> off<00:02:26.390> up<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.870> top<00:02:27.019> of

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
obviously it tapers off up to the top of

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.990 
obviously it tapers off up to the top of
the<00:02:27.260> fork<00:02:27.500> where<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.769> protective<00:02:28.250> cap<00:02:28.489> is<00:02:28.760> now

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
the fork where the protective cap is now

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.390 
the fork where the protective cap is now
if<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:29.690> roll<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.050> like<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.920> only<00:02:31.069> need<00:02:31.340> a

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
if you roll it like this you only need a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.490 
if you roll it like this you only need a
couple<00:02:31.489> pieces<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:32.090> tape<00:02:32.360> we<00:02:32.600> need<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:33.049> here

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
couple pieces of tape we need to here

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.620 
couple pieces of tape we need to here
just<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:34.190> tighten<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.610> bubble<00:02:34.850> wrap<00:02:35.030> up<00:02:35.269> and

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
just to tighten the bubble wrap up and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.300 
just to tighten the bubble wrap up and
then<00:02:36.080> we're<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.260> going<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.620> loop<00:02:36.769> one<00:02:37.010> around

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
then we're just going to loop one around

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:48.440 
then we're just going to loop one around
and<00:02:37.519> down<00:02:37.790> over

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.059 

now<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.510> topside<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.230> fork<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.920> if

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
now the topside of the fork you can if

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.190 
now the topside of the fork you can if
you<00:02:51.190> want<00:02:51.340> fold<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.420> over<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.720> wrap<00:02:52.990> it<00:02:53.140> around

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
you want fold it over and wrap it around

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.410 
you want fold it over and wrap it around
and<00:02:53.620> took<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.910> put<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.120> piece<00:02:55.390> of

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
and took it in you can put a piece of

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.050 
and took it in you can put a piece of
tape<00:02:55.569> around<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.470> top<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.130> area<00:02:57.550> here<00:02:57.850> to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
tape around the top of this area here to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.160 
tape around the top of this area here to
protect<00:02:58.240> it<00:02:58.660> but<00:02:59.350> this<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.980> not<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.850> critical

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
protect it but this is not that critical

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.150 
protect it but this is not that critical
remember<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:02.260> has<00:03:02.410> gone<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.680> quite<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:02.950> big

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
remember this has gone in quite a big

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.730 
remember this has gone in quite a big
box<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:04.180> if<00:03:04.270> you<00:03:04.390> want<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:05.320> go<00:03:05.440> ahead<00:03:05.560> and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
box so if you want just go ahead and

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.350 
box so if you want just go ahead and
make<00:03:05.950> sure<00:03:05.980> it's<00:03:06.310> all<00:03:06.400> secure<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.180> then

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
make sure it's all secure and then

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.880 
make sure it's all secure and then
you'll<00:03:07.510> only<00:03:07.690> need<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.959> real<00:03:08.320> small<00:03:08.620> piece<00:03:08.860> of

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
you'll only need a real small piece of

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.199 
you'll only need a real small piece of
tape<00:03:09.160> around<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.550> top<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.940> fork<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:16.120> we

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
tape around the top of the fork and we

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.030 
tape around the top of the fork and we
got<00:03:16.360> one<00:03:16.540> fork<00:03:16.840> like<00:03:16.989> done<00:03:17.260> will<00:03:17.800> duplicate

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
got one fork like done will duplicate

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.430 
got one fork like done will duplicate
the<00:03:18.550> other<00:03:18.670> fork<00:03:19.000> leg<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.480> then<00:03:20.110> we'll<00:03:20.260> show

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
the other fork leg and then we'll show

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.900 
the other fork leg and then we'll show
you<00:03:20.470> how<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.709> put<00:03:20.980> them<00:03:21.130> in<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.370> box<00:03:21.580> in<00:03:21.820> the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
you how to put them in the box in the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.540 
you how to put them in the box in the
way<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.269> should<00:03:22.690> lay<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.050> out<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:24.220> very

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
way that you should lay it out it's very

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.780 
way that you should lay it out it's very
important<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.300> make<00:03:25.870> sure<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.320> offset<00:03:26.800> so

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
important to make sure that offset so

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.449 
important to make sure that offset so
that<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.600> foot<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:28.840> at<00:03:29.050> one<00:03:29.200> end<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:30.040> foot<00:03:30.310> on

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
that the foot is at one end the foot on

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.390 
that the foot is at one end the foot on
the<00:03:30.610> other<00:03:30.730> leg<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.209> completely<00:03:31.800> opposite<00:03:32.800> you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
the other leg is completely opposite you

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.040 
the other leg is completely opposite you
never<00:03:33.730> want<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.090> have<00:03:34.239> these<00:03:34.390> facing<00:03:34.900> each

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
never want to have these facing each

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.750 
never want to have these facing each
other<00:03:35.260> they're<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.680> two<00:03:35.890> widest<00:03:36.310> part<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.700> the

other they're the two widest part of the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.240 
other they're the two widest part of the
forks<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:38.110> don't<00:03:38.380> want<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.650> bashing<00:03:39.100> into

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
forks and you don't want to bashing into

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.640 
forks and you don't want to bashing into
each<00:03:39.370> other<00:03:39.700> especially<00:03:40.360> as<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.050> chrome<00:03:41.410> tube

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.310 
each other especially as a chrome tube
area<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.190> right<00:03:42.489> next<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.910> them<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.300> if<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:43.690> it

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
area is right next to them so if it's it

moves in shipping this is the heaviest

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.180

and most aggressive piece you don't want
to<00:03:48.250> chip<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.730> chrome<00:03:48.970> tube<00:03:49.209> away<00:03:49.480> so

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
to chip in the chrome tube away so

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.740 
to chip in the chrome tube away so
always<00:03:50.709> ship<00:03:51.160> them<00:03:51.370> completely<00:03:52.000> opposite<00:03:52.570> to

always ship them completely opposite to

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
each other and when you box them we got

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.670 
each other and when you box them we got
a<00:03:55.120> pretty<00:03:55.390> standard<00:03:55.840> box<00:03:56.049> here<00:03:56.380> 36<00:03:57.130> x<00:03:57.370> 12<00:03:57.910> x<00:03:58.000> 12
