00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.239
 inner part because breeding 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.969
 proved that the layout they had in principle 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.059
 just stretching the muscles and increase 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.890
 the volume of the outer part but not 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.300
 inner interior can 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 pump down the hall 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.370
 blocks will not be able to do and up bottom 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.090

 how to make up the house now i will show you 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:08.780
 we will need a couch will have to be with 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.790
 you lie down on the couch to lie down like a treat to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.290
 your shoulder 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:19.290
 it turns out your foot god feet watched 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.020
 circle down you have to lie down like i am but 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.640
 we will need to put a spatula 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.210
 exactly shoulder blade on the sofa should 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.799
 hang down 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.180
 here so here the form of the shoulder hangs down 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.310
 take a dumbbell here shoulder and that shoulder 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.079
 right and left should be almost on one 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.140
 level so the load is much better 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.470
 in order to increase the load like me 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.780
 honestly tell you even wish 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.490
 opportunity favor just a chair chair 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.189
 left a high chair here 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.729
 higher preferably higher in order for you 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.710
 hand not to cling and hold on to 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.680
 keep your balance so you why 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.810
 the belt was level 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.610
 so from the part I will show 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.260
 show without him just gonna hold 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.330
 balance somehow 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:15.470
 how do we all take dumbbell 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.020
 next we will have to lift a dumbbell 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.140
 to the level of your shoulder from the right 7 hectares 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.290
 land of Ooo raised to the level of fact and 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.990
 can be a little higher 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.090
 raised how to do here technically 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.010
 right we need as i said in 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.380
 of all the many exercises where we swing 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.690
 shoulders and chest the shoulder should be lowered and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.330
 do like this if you lift your shoulder 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.740
 up and swing you will swing 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.160
 mostly upper chest and shoulder 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.170
 if you need this internal muscle will 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.150
 time okay if you drop your shoulder to 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.500
 Now do these dreams here with worms and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.480
 here and the fox here these traces 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.340
 leaked everything and lift now 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.030
 shoulders aligned and as i told what 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.510
 load was 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.430
 lingered and lift load 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.010
 crazy goes to the inside 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.459
 breasts are not and beyond middling 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.730
 raised detained lowered raised 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.300
 detained lowered raised ripped out 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.980
 lowered the play and constantly down 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.400
 let down not in terms of what's in there 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.340
 down namely down here if you are standing you 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.840
 stood shoulder down those guys 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.640
 which a long time ago he can my channel they 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.670
 understand very much for saying so here you are 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.410
 should not relax your arm more precisely 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.890
 and itâ€™s not muscle you will 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.630
 Sleeves landlord obtained a lever and 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.120
 pectoral muscles here should be tense 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.330
 even in this position you must clearly 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.530
 straining muscles pectoral mitino move 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.360
 the angle should be something like this 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.500
 I have to straighten my arm completely 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.410
 traumatic up is also done completely 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.120
 the angle of 90 degrees is not worth it 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.910
 the most efficient that will be angle 45 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.130
 degrees between shoulder and forearm times 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.670
 lay down lowered once toasted 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.900
 let go 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.500
 once won lowered delay give away 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.060
 it must be still to load 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.609
 moved more 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.720
 it was in the chest and not much bothered 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.910
 you forearm and hand 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.660
 you want to make a brush like this 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.360
 so and hold back here and so here 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.010
 so raising your hands among you will not 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.080
 load heavily in resource stages and on 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.630
 forearm 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:44.090
 also you are doing on the second shoulder 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:58.550
 laid down took the shoulder stand lowered 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:05:00.930
 showed and you understand put it down put it down 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.520
 how to further complicate this exercise 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:10.380
 you need to relax the brush first thing 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.389
 complexity is just to raise up what 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.460
 glorify and then relax 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.220
 do not completely shine lose hold 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.450
 here I hold it in the palm of my hand and 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.720
 clasp slightly more finger all 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:28.380
 nothing Pushchino he lay kept here not 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.500
 forearm lard helps already brush not 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.919
 take the load does not help forearm 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.289
 and brush 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.169
 so the load will go over 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.570
 pectoral muscles this guys the best 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.890
 exercise at home which 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.440
 you will make the inner part be more 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.260
 drawn more like someone tight 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.350
 Arnold where many were surprised at him 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.060
 that they have breasts like plates and not something 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.400
 it was the spirit of man as they love now 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.620
 bodybuilders tits hang down more 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.020
 there is nothing small such bulging 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.990

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.510
 why is it like that because he is 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.539

 information on the blocks of the lower average under 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.950
