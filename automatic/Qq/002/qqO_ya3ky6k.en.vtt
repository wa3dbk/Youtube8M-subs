00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
loop on the fly okay let's out here's

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.160 
loop on the fly okay let's out here's
what<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.970> air<00:01:55.540> raid

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
volume for that loop only I'm gonna stop

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.190 
volume for that loop only I'm gonna stop
it<00:02:12.400> now<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.090> get<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> drop<00:02:13.570> down<00:02:13.750> menu<00:02:13.989> again

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
it now you get the drop down menu again

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.140 
it now you get the drop down menu again
we<00:02:14.410> got<00:02:14.590> three<00:02:14.860> two<00:02:14.890> one<00:02:15.310> which<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.670> an<00:02:15.850> actual

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
we got three two one which is an actual

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.050 
we got three two one which is an actual
just<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.510> regular<00:02:16.810> drop<00:02:17.670> which<00:02:18.670> sounds<00:02:18.940> like

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
just a regular drop which sounds like

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.949 
just a regular drop which sounds like
this<00:02:21.570> okay<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:24.130> got<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.580> for<00:02:24.760> kicks<00:02:25.000> which<00:02:25.510> is

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
this okay we got just for kicks which is

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.600 
this okay we got just for kicks which is
simply<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> beat<00:02:27.269> looped<00:02:31.320> one<00:02:32.320> two<00:02:32.680> three<00:02:33.160> four

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
simply a beat looped one two three four

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.500 
simply a beat looped one two three four
one<00:02:34.030> three<00:02:34.840> okay<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.489> it's<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.820> basically

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
one three okay so it's like a basically

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.720 
one three okay so it's like a basically
it's<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.750> bass<00:02:38.019> kick<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:39.280> then<00:02:39.400> we<00:02:39.489> got<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
it's a bass kick and then we got the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.289 
it's a bass kick and then we got the
rass<00:02:39.880> horn<00:02:40.209> which<00:02:40.360> sounds<00:02:40.600> like<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:43.000> if

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
rass horn which sounds like this now if

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.100 
rass horn which sounds like this now if
you<00:02:43.510> would<00:02:43.660> like<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.959> add<00:02:44.110> more<00:02:44.680> loop<00:02:45.130> samples

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you would like to add more loop samples

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.080 
you would like to add more loop samples
here<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.410> can<00:02:47.560> do<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.860> right<00:02:48.340> here<00:02:48.640> under

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
here you can do that right here under

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.070 
here you can do that right here under
this<00:02:49.390> tab<00:02:50.070> click<00:02:51.070> on<00:02:51.220> sampler<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.120> here<00:02:52.870> are

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
this tab click on sampler and here are

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.840 
this tab click on sampler and here are
those<00:02:53.470> twelve<00:02:55.380> loop<00:02:56.380> samples<00:02:56.920> with<00:02:57.640> each

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
those twelve loop samples with each

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.940 
those twelve loop samples with each
channel<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.570> can<00:02:58.690> actually<00:02:58.840> control<00:02:59.290> and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
channel so you can actually control and

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.770 
channel so you can actually control and
tell<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.370> what<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.580> want<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.060> volume<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.630> be

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
tell it what you want that volume to be

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.940 
tell it what you want that volume to be
at<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.900> know<00:03:05.019> at<00:03:05.170> all<00:03:05.230> times<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:05.860> forth

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
at you know at all times and so forth

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.440 
at you know at all times and so forth
now<00:03:07.049> if<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.230> want<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.680> actual<00:03:12.280> loop<00:03:13.180> on

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
now if you want the the actual loop on

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.080 
now if you want the the actual loop on
that<00:03:13.510> channel<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.410> loop<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.700> have<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.970> make

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
that channel to loop you have to make

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.930 
that channel to loop you have to make
sure<00:03:16.239> that<00:03:16.390> this<00:03:16.510> says<00:03:16.780> loop<00:03:17.290> okay<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.730> has<00:03:18.910> to

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
sure that this says loop okay it has to

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.490 
sure that this says loop okay it has to
be<00:03:19.500> selected<00:03:20.500> on<00:03:20.650> loop<00:03:20.950> if<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.910> want<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.209> to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
be selected on loop if you want it to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.310 
be selected on loop if you want it to
automatically<00:03:23.760> sync<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.150> actual<00:03:25.720> beat<00:03:26.019> of

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
automatically sync to the actual beat of

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.710 
automatically sync to the actual beat of
the<00:03:27.040> song<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.579> might<00:03:27.760> be<00:03:27.880> playing<00:03:28.150> you

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
the song that you might be playing you

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.240 
the song that you might be playing you
want<00:03:28.900> beat<00:03:29.139> lock<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.829> then<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.040> want<00:03:30.190> to

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
want beat lock on and then you want to

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.500 
want beat lock on and then you want to
sync<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.609> to<00:03:30.639> whatever<00:03:30.910> you

here on number six and this is not going

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.349 
here on number six and this is not going
to<00:04:08.799> be<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> loop<00:04:09.220> it's<00:04:09.400> going<00:04:09.579> to<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.760> just<00:04:09.910> what

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
to be a loop it's going to be just what

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.809 
to be a loop it's going to be just what
they<00:04:10.480> call<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> jingle<00:04:11.370> which<00:04:12.370> is<00:04:12.489> basically

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
they call a jingle which is basically

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.190 
they call a jingle which is basically
the<00:04:12.970> same<00:04:13.120> thing<00:04:13.329> as<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.450> draw<00:04:13.750> okay

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
the same thing as a draw okay

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.680 
the same thing as a draw okay
it<00:04:15.129> doesn't<00:04:15.489> loop<00:04:15.700> over<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.090> over<00:04:16.299> again<00:04:16.389> when

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
it doesn't loop over and over again when

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.449 
it doesn't loop over and over again when
you<00:04:16.750> hit<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:16.930> I'm<00:04:17.590> going<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.799> go<00:04:17.889> over<00:04:18.010> here<00:04:18.250> in

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
you hit it I'm going to go over here in

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.120 
you hit it I'm going to go over here in
seven<00:04:19.150> I'm<00:04:19.269> going<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.449> add<00:04:19.600> another<00:04:19.959> drop<00:04:20.410> and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
seven I'm going to add another drop and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.189 
seven I'm going to add another drop and
the<00:04:21.760> thing<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.090> kind<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.419> stinks<00:04:22.690> about<00:04:23.020> this

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
the thing that kind of stinks about this

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.560 
the thing that kind of stinks about this
program<00:04:23.590> is<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.800> once<00:04:24.130> you<00:04:24.220> load<00:04:24.460> one<00:04:24.570> into

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
program is that once you load one into

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.460 
program is that once you load one into
the<00:04:26.460> into<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.539> know<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.870> channel

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
the into the the you know the channel

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.020 
the into the the you know the channel
will<00:04:29.740> call<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.400> want<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.639> put<00:04:30.789> it<00:04:30.910> on

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
will call it that you want to put it on

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.210 
will call it that you want to put it on
it<00:04:31.600> doesn't<00:04:31.840> default<00:04:32.410> back<00:04:32.740> when<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.039> go<00:04:33.160> to

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
it doesn't default back when you go to

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.890 
it doesn't default back when you go to
add<00:04:33.520> another<00:04:33.850> one<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.419> folder<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.780> were

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
add another one to the folder you were

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.680 
add another one to the folder you were
just<00:04:35.110> in<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:36.310> have<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.550> go<00:04:36.639> clear<00:04:36.910> back<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.389> and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
just in you have to go clear back in and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.080 
just in you have to go clear back in and
search<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.770> find<00:04:39.220> it<00:04:39.340> that's<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:39.789> only<00:04:39.940> thing

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
that kind of stinks alright so we'll put

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.820 
that kind of stinks alright so we'll put
the<00:04:42.130> crowd<00:04:42.520> sound<00:04:42.760> effects<00:04:43.030> here<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.830> number

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
the crowd sound effects here on number

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.920 
the crowd sound effects here on number
seven<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.820> we<00:04:46.000> will<00:04:46.180> loop<00:04:46.479> it's<00:04:46.979> alright<00:04:47.979> and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
seven and we will loop it's alright and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.060 
seven and we will loop it's alright and
it<00:04:49.930> doesn't<00:04:50.169> have<00:04:50.289> to<00:04:50.320> loop<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.830> beat

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
it doesn't have to loop to the beat

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.860 
it doesn't have to loop to the beat
here's<00:04:51.550> what<00:04:51.760> it<00:04:51.849> sounds<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:52.180> when<00:04:52.720> you

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
here's what it sounds like when you

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.510 
here's what it sounds like when you
click<00:04:53.380> on<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:57.750> right<00:04:58.750> so<00:04:58.930> it's<00:04:59.110> it's<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.500> loop<00:04:59.710> or

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
click on it right so it's it's a loop or

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.730 
click on it right so it's it's a loop or
a<00:05:00.700> drop<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.330> it's<00:05:01.630> also<00:05:01.780> here<00:05:02.229> so<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.620> can

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
a drop and it's also here so you can

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.430 
a drop and it's also here so you can
select<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.130> here<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.669> click<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.030> there<00:05:07.440> now

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
select it here and click it there now

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.870 
select it here and click it there now
the<00:05:08.500> only<00:05:08.680> thing<00:05:08.919> is<00:05:08.950> when<00:05:09.280> you're<00:05:09.370> using<00:05:09.580> this

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
the only thing is when you're using this

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.190 
the only thing is when you're using this
and<00:05:10.090> you're<00:05:10.150> not<00:05:10.240> down<00:05:10.570> here<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.930> can<00:05:11.080> only

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
and you're not down here you can only

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.589 
and you're not down here you can only
play<00:05:11.500> one<00:05:11.830> at<00:05:12.130> a<00:05:12.160> time<00:05:12.520> that's<00:05:12.849> the<00:05:13.060> only<00:05:13.330> thing

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
play one at a time that's the only thing

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.260 
play one at a time that's the only thing
about<00:05:14.160> this<00:05:15.160> sampler<00:05:15.580> right<00:05:15.760> here<00:05:15.970> you<00:05:16.150> would

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
about this sampler right here you would

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.700 
about this sampler right here you would
want<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.510> click<00:05:16.690> on<00:05:16.840> this<00:05:16.990> tab<00:05:17.200> and<00:05:17.410> have<00:05:17.500> all

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
want to click on this tab and have all

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.830 
want to click on this tab and have all
these<00:05:17.889> open<00:05:18.039> if<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:18.340> want<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:18.580> overlap<00:05:19.150> more

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
these open if you want to overlap more

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.089 
these open if you want to overlap more
than<00:05:20.020> one<00:05:20.169> of<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.320> time<00:05:20.500> so<00:05:20.680> we<00:05:20.770> can<00:05:20.860> go<00:05:20.950> like

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
than one of the time so we can go like

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.540 
than one of the time so we can go like
this

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
this

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:32.649 
this
and<00:05:22.879> then<00:05:23.180> we<00:05:23.270> can<00:05:23.419> also<00:05:23.539> play<00:05:23.870> some<00:05:24.379> top<00:05:31.659> magic

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
and then we can also play some top magic

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.230 
and then we can also play some top magic
usually<00:05:33.319> broadcast<00:05:33.590> live<00:05:34.280> from<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.729> magic

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
usually broadcast live from the magic

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:49.930 
usually broadcast live from the magic
studio<00:05:46.539> this<00:05:47.539> restart<00:05:48.080> him<00:05:48.550> this<00:05:49.550> one<00:05:49.759> will

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
studio this restart him this one will

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.790 
studio this restart him this one will
end<00:05:50.090> when<00:05:50.389> it<00:05:50.479> gets<00:05:50.629> to<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:50.870> end<00:05:50.990> here<00:05:51.259> it'll

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
end when it gets to the end here it'll

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.870 
end when it gets to the end here it'll
just<00:05:51.979> stop<00:05:52.750> and<00:05:53.750> it's<00:05:54.199> done<00:05:54.379> okay<00:05:55.370> that's

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
just stop and it's done okay that's

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.149 
just stop and it's done okay that's
basically<00:05:56.539> in<00:05:56.840> a<00:05:56.900> nutshell<00:05:57.139> very<00:05:57.860> quickly

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
basically in a nutshell very quickly

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.170 
basically in a nutshell very quickly
that's<00:05:58.639> the<00:05:59.360> loop<00:05:59.659> sampler<00:06:00.199> alright<00:06:01.180> now

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
that's the loop sampler alright now

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.110 
that's the loop sampler alright now
we're<00:06:02.599> going<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:02.900> go<00:06:03.139> into<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.860> effects<00:06:04.400> there

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
we're going to go into the effects there

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.230 
we're going to go into the effects there
is<00:06:05.710> literally<00:06:06.710> a<00:06:06.830> ton<00:06:07.159> of<00:06:07.190> effects<00:06:07.699> on<00:06:07.880> virtual

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
is literally a ton of effects on virtual

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.180 
is literally a ton of effects on virtual
DJ's<00:06:08.539> website<00:06:09.020> I'm<00:06:09.229> going<00:06:09.380> to<00:06:09.530> load<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:09.740> song<00:06:10.009> in

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
DJ's website I'm going to load a song in

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.850 
DJ's website I'm going to load a song in
here<00:06:10.370> so<00:06:10.550> you<00:06:10.639> can<00:06:10.849> hear<00:06:11.449> what<00:06:11.750> some<00:06:12.050> of<00:06:12.199> maybe

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
here so you can hear what some of maybe

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.439 
here so you can hear what some of maybe
one<00:06:13.099> of<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.220> effects<00:06:13.520> would<00:06:13.639> sound<00:06:13.909> like<00:06:14.060> I'll

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
one of the effects would sound like I'll

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.260 
one of the effects would sound like I'll
put<00:06:14.599> a<00:06:14.630> VC<00:06:15.080> in<00:06:15.229> there<00:06:15.349> some<00:06:15.530> Jackson<00:06:16.009> 5<00:06:16.270> play

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
put a VC in there some Jackson 5 play

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.010 
put a VC in there some Jackson 5 play
that<00:06:17.479> all<00:06:18.319> right<00:06:18.699> under<00:06:19.699> effects<00:06:20.000> if<00:06:20.360> you<00:06:20.629> the

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
that all right under effects if you the

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.990 
that all right under effects if you the
backspin<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:21.919> makes<00:06:22.219> it<00:06:22.370> basically<00:06:22.550> just

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
backspin and makes it basically just

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.749 
backspin and makes it basically just
like<00:06:23.150> you<00:06:23.300> would<00:06:23.419> take<00:06:23.599> a<00:06:23.659> vinyl<00:06:24.520> and<00:06:25.520> you<00:06:25.639> were

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
like you would take a vinyl and you were

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:26.920 
like you would take a vinyl and you were
spinnin<00:06:26.150> vinyl<00:06:26.509> and<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:26.719> would<00:06:26.900> just

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
spinnin vinyl and you would just

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.610 
spinnin vinyl and you would just
backspin<00:06:27.560> it<00:06:27.710> so<00:06:27.949> it<00:06:28.039> sounds<00:06:28.250> like<00:06:28.280> this<00:06:29.620> all

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
backspin it so it sounds like this all

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.800 
backspin it so it sounds like this all

you can also that's just one of the

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.870 
you can also that's just one of the
effects<00:06:36.530> let<00:06:37.009> me<00:06:37.099> just<00:06:37.219> play<00:06:37.340> another<00:06:37.580> effect

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
effects let me just play another effect

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.550 
effects let me just play another effect
for<00:06:38.060> it<00:06:38.210> there's<00:06:38.719> tell<00:06:38.870> me<00:06:38.960> if<00:06:39.080> accent<00:06:39.349> like<00:06:39.440> to

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
for it there's tell me if accent like to

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.670 
for it there's tell me if accent like to
go<00:06:39.680> over<00:06:39.830> all<00:06:40.009> these<00:06:40.310> but<00:06:41.090> uh<00:06:41.139> one<00:06:42.139> that<00:06:42.380> I<00:06:42.500> use

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
go over all these but uh one that I use

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.059 
go over all these but uh one that I use
a<00:06:42.710> lot<00:06:42.979> is<00:06:43.250> loop<00:06:43.580> out<00:06:44.529> I'm<00:06:45.529> gonna<00:06:45.650> turn<00:06:45.860> the

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069 
a lot is loop out I'm gonna turn the

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.439 
a lot is loop out I'm gonna turn the
volume<00:06:46.250> down<00:06:46.490> on<00:06:46.639> this<00:06:46.880> channel<00:06:47.120> a<00:06:47.240> little<00:06:47.360> bit

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
volume down on this channel a little bit

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.490 
volume down on this channel a little bit
so<00:06:47.599> you<00:06:47.690> can<00:06:47.719> hear<00:06:47.960> me<00:06:48.080> a<00:06:48.110> little<00:06:48.169> bit<00:06:48.319> better

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
so you can hear me a little bit better

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.570 
so you can hear me a little bit better
but<00:06:49.219> uh<00:06:49.300> I<00:06:50.300> use<00:06:50.930> loop<00:06:51.229> out<00:06:51.409> a<00:06:51.440> lot<00:06:51.770> you<00:06:52.460> can

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
but uh I use loop out a lot you can

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.309 
but uh I use loop out a lot you can
access<00:06:53.029> all<00:06:53.180> of<00:06:53.210> your<00:06:53.360> effects<00:06:53.810> and<00:06:54.110> the

particular effect I want it to sample

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:06.370 
particular effect I want it to sample
out<00:07:03.440> four<00:07:04.190> beats<00:07:04.520> and<00:07:04.880> I<00:07:05.630> want<00:07:05.810> to<00:07:05.990> repeat

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
out four beats and I want to repeat

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.330 
out four beats and I want to repeat
eight<00:07:06.919> times<00:07:07.539> now<00:07:08.539> watch<00:07:09.099> while<00:07:10.099> you<00:07:10.190> turn

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
eight times now watch while you turn

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:21.379 
eight times now watch while you turn
this<00:07:10.490> back<00:07:10.669> up<00:07:10.849> so<00:07:10.940> you<00:07:11.000> can<00:07:11.150> hear<00:07:11.300> it

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.060 

alright<00:07:22.389> that's<00:07:23.050> basically<00:07:23.320> that's<00:07:23.740> not<00:07:23.979> the

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.070 
alright that's basically that's not the

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.930 
alright that's basically that's not the
greatest<00:07:24.630> loop<00:07:25.630> though<00:07:25.870> let<00:07:26.410> me<00:07:26.440> do<00:07:26.590> it

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
greatest loop though let me do it

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:33.570 
greatest loop though let me do it
somewhere<00:07:29.400> one<00:07:30.400> two<00:07:30.910> three<00:07:31.630> four<00:07:32.139> now<00:07:32.590> it's

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:33.580 
somewhere one two three four now it's

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.629 
somewhere one two three four now it's
going<00:07:33.850> to<00:07:33.910> move<00:07:34.600> that<00:07:34.840> over<00:07:34.900> over<00:07:37.290> for<00:07:38.639> four

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:39.639 
going to move that over over for four

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:45.270 
going to move that over over for four
beats<00:07:39.820> that<00:07:40.060> I<00:07:40.150> selected<00:07:41.160> and<00:07:43.889> eight<00:07:44.889> times

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 
beats that I selected and eight times

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.100 
beats that I selected and eight times
it's<00:07:45.940> gonna<00:07:46.090> automatically<00:07:46.660> bring<00:07:46.870> it<00:07:46.960> down

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.110 
it's gonna automatically bring it down

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.080 
it's gonna automatically bring it down
slowly<00:07:47.410> and<00:07:47.850> then<00:07:48.850> stop<00:07:49.419> the<00:07:49.660> song<00:07:49.840> okay<00:07:50.320> so

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.090 
slowly and then stop the song okay so

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.550 
slowly and then stop the song okay so
that's<00:07:52.090> that's<00:07:52.600> what<00:07:52.780> the<00:07:52.900> loop<00:07:53.050> out<00:07:54.180> version

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 
that's that's what the loop out version

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.320 
that's that's what the loop out version
2.0<00:07:56.560> one<00:07:56.979> does<00:07:57.510> there's<00:07:58.510> so<00:07:58.960> many<00:07:59.110> other
