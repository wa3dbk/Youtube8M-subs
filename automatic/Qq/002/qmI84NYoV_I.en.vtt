is find what i like to call the dominant

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.549 
is find what i like to call the dominant
side<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> network<00:00:12.480> port<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.410> dominant

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
side of the network port on the dominant

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.499 
side of the network port on the dominant
side<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.429> side<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.759> will<00:00:14.880> get<00:00:15.030> teleport

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
side is the side you will get teleport

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.390 
side is the side you will get teleport
to<00:00:15.750> when<00:00:15.900> entering<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.529> let<00:00:17.039> me<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.250> show<00:00:17.369> you

to when entering it let me just show you
real<00:00:17.520> quick<00:00:18.439> ok<00:00:19.439> let's<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.800> disable<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
real quick ok let's just disable the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.210 
real quick ok let's just disable the
portal<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.420> now<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.800> by<00:00:22.980> place

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
portal for now you can do this by place

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.679 
portal for now you can do this by place
and<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:23.490> into<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> portal<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.480> quickly

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
and now into the portal then quickly

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.250 
and now into the portal then quickly
removing<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:26.300> ok<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.359> let's<00:00:27.689> take<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.900> look<00:00:28.140> at

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
removing it ok so let's take a look at

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.659 
removing it ok so let's take a look at
the<00:00:28.349> debug<00:00:28.619> screen<00:00:28.769> by<00:00:29.130> pressing<00:00:29.189> Shift<00:00:29.760> +<00:00:29.910> f3

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
the debug screen by pressing Shift + f3

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.950 
the debug screen by pressing Shift + f3
look<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> coordinates<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:33.809> all

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
look at the coordinates they are all

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.110 
look at the coordinates they are all
whole<00:00:34.410> numbers<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.280> due<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> fact

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
whole numbers this is due to the fact

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.060 
whole numbers this is due to the fact
that<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> blocks<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.010> have

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that it is in the blocks that have

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.190 
that it is in the blocks that have
coordinates<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> grid<00:00:39.660> points<00:00:40.050> between

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
coordinates but the grid points between

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.760 
coordinates but the grid points between
them<00:00:41.180> another<00:00:42.180> portal<00:00:42.750> behavior<00:00:43.170> got<00:00:43.440> changed

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
them another portal behavior got changed

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.330 
them another portal behavior got changed
in<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> u.s.<00:00:44.550> 12<00:00:44.850> w<00:00:45.329> 34<00:00:45.870> snapshot<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.070> that's

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
in the u.s. 12 w 34 snapshot so that's

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.110 
in the u.s. 12 w 34 snapshot so that's
why<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.700> polished<00:00:48.329> here

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.569 

okay<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:52.050> smart<00:00:52.379> decided<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.160> smush<00:00:53.430> room

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
okay that's smart decided the smush room

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.310 
okay that's smart decided the smush room
and<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:53.879> back<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> home<00:00:54.360> world

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.840

be real need for that particular trap so
let's<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:09.440> this<00:01:10.440> trap<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.800> very<00:01:10.980> simple<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
let's go this trap is very simple you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
let's go this trap is very simple you
only<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> piece<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.330> TNT<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.530> power

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
only need a piece of TNT and the power

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.040 
only need a piece of TNT and the power
source<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.390> always<00:01:15.390> Cal<00:01:15.570> flint<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.900> steel

source and always Cal flint and steel
which<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.740> when<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.130> into<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.550> nether

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
which you when going into the nether

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.700 
which you when going into the nether
alright<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> idea<00:01:22.470> behind

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
alright so here we are the idea behind

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.680 
alright so here we are the idea behind
the<00:01:22.950> strap<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.370> that<00:01:23.550> we<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.760> prime<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> TNT

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
the strap is that we will prime the TNT

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.230 
the strap is that we will prime the TNT
then<00:01:25.020> quickly<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.530> back<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.160> world<00:01:26.610> that's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
then quickly go back to the world that's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.530 
then quickly go back to the world that's
unloading<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> nether<00:01:28.200> chunks<00:01:29.420> when<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
unloading the nether chunks when the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.960 
unloading the nether chunks when the
chunks<00:01:31.050> get<00:01:31.230> loaded<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.860> next<00:01:32.160> time<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.729> game

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
chunks get loaded the next time the game

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.180 
chunks get loaded the next time the game
will<00:01:33.119> load<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> prime<00:01:33.810> TNT<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.040> did

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
will load the prime TNT and if we did

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.980 
will load the prime TNT and if we did
equality<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.940> will<00:01:36.090> explode<00:01:36.420> almost

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
equality then it will explode almost

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
equality then it will explode almost
immediately<00:01:39.979> all<00:01:40.979> right<00:01:41.130> let's<00:01:41.369> activate<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
immediately all right let's activate the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.139 
immediately all right let's activate the
TNT<00:01:42.300> travel<00:01:42.930> back<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.260> overworld

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.580 

now<00:01:52.149> let's<00:01:52.359> enter<00:01:52.630> again<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.079> as<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.380> can<00:01:53.560> see

now let's enter again and as you can see

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.260 
now let's enter again and as you can see
the<00:01:53.920> TNT<00:01:54.280> blew<00:01:54.429> away<00:01:56.670> let's<00:01:57.670> see<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.969> second

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
the TNT blew away let's see the second

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.859 
the TNT blew away let's see the second
Tramp<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.579> second<00:02:01.000> trap<00:02:01.179> real<00:02:01.390> disciplines

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
Tramp the second trap real disciplines

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.109 
Tramp the second trap real disciplines
lava<00:02:02.079> into<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.469> portal<00:02:02.829> does<00:02:03.369> disabling<00:02:03.909> the

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
lava into the portal does disabling the

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.789 
lava into the portal does disabling the
portal<00:02:04.509> trapping<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.140> player<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.380> another

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
portal trapping the player and another

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.390 
portal trapping the player and another
and<00:02:06.069> do<00:02:06.250> damage<00:02:06.429> to<00:02:06.610> him<00:02:06.880> all<00:02:07.149> her

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.500 

so<00:02:12.400> we<00:02:12.550> will<00:02:12.670> start<00:02:12.910> by<00:02:13.000> temporarily

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
so we will start by temporarily

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.470 
so we will start by temporarily
disabling<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.260> portal<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:15.490> place<00:02:16.210> to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
disabling the portal then place to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.840 
disabling the portal then place to
pressure<00:02:16.750> place<00:02:17.050> here<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.890> really<00:02:18.400> need<00:02:18.550> only

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
pressure place here you really need only

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.580 
pressure place here you really need only
one<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.270> that's<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.750> place<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.440> good

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
one but that's just place to for good

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.550 
one but that's just place to for good
measure<00:02:20.790> back<00:02:21.790> over<00:02:22.090> here<00:02:22.390> put<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.080> dispenser

measure back over here put the dispenser

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.460 
measure back over here put the dispenser
in<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.580> can<00:02:24.820> make<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.630> only<00:02:25.660> disables

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
in it you can make it that only disables

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.070 
in it you can make it that only disables
the<00:02:26.500> portal<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.190> doesn't<00:02:28.060> hurt<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.810> player

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
the portal and doesn't hurt the player

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.630 
the portal and doesn't hurt the player
if<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.680> want<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.130> should<00:02:30.310> place<00:02:30.520> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
if you want that you should place the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.220 
if you want that you should place the
dispenser<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.120> either<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.720> top<00:02:31.900> blocks

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
dispenser in either of the top blocks

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.290 
dispenser in either of the top blocks
you<00:02:32.950> will<00:02:33.100> do<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.400> because<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.730> needs<00:02:34.030> some

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
you will do that because that needs some

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.080 
you will do that because that needs some
more<00:02:34.480> advanced<00:02:34.870> tiring<00:02:35.350> but<00:02:36.220> if<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.520> want<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
more advanced tiring but if you want the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.640 
more advanced tiring but if you want the
player<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.390> be<00:02:37.630> hurt<00:02:37.780> then<00:02:38.230> place<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
player to be hurt then place the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.980 
player to be hurt then place the
dispenser<00:02:39.040> into<00:02:39.310> either<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.970> these<00:02:40.420> four<00:02:40.720> dogs

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
dispenser into either of these four dogs

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.990 
dispenser into either of these four dogs
then<00:02:41.710> just<00:02:42.040> simply<00:02:42.220> buried<00:02:42.640> up<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.820> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
then just simply buried up to the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.390 
then just simply buried up to the
pressure<00:02:43.270> plates<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.650> said<00:02:44.710> he<00:02:45.160> will

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
pressure plates but as I said he will

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.250 
pressure plates but as I said he will
build<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.790> one<00:02:46.270> which<00:02:46.540> doesn't<00:02:46.930> damage<00:02:47.110> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
build it one which doesn't damage the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.660 
build it one which doesn't damage the
player<00:02:47.500> because<00:02:47.920> it's<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.160> little<00:02:48.340> bit<00:02:48.460> more

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
player because it's a little bit more

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.210 
player because it's a little bit more
complicated<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.290> let's<00:02:50.470> place<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.800> dispenser

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
complicated so let's place the dispenser

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.760 
complicated so let's place the dispenser
here<00:02:51.460> not<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.970> eject<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.750> lava<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.320> suck<00:02:53.620> it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
here not to eject the lava and suck it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.920 
here not to eject the lava and suck it
back<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.130> we<00:02:54.760> first<00:02:55.120> need<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.420> power<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
back in we first need to power the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.440 
back in we first need to power the
dispenser<00:02:56.410> with<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.620> lever<00:02:57.240> this<00:02:58.240> will

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
dispenser with the lever this will

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.290 
dispenser with the lever this will
ensure<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.930> dispenser<00:02:59.710> reacts<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.970> every

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
ensure that dispenser reacts to every

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.970 
ensure that dispenser reacts to every
restaurant<00:03:01.420> update<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.290> then<00:03:02.650> we<00:03:02.800> need<00:03:02.950> a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
restaurant update and then we need a

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.460 
restaurant update and then we need a
monostable<00:03:03.310> circuit<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:05.110> what<00:03:05.440> a

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
monostable circuit to so what a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.290 
monostable circuit to so what a
monostable<00:03:05.800> circuit<00:03:06.340> will<00:03:06.490> do<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:07.240> will

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
monostable circuit will do is it will

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.010 
monostable circuit will do is it will
output<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:08.080> specific<00:03:08.650> length<00:03:08.860> pass<00:03:09.430> without

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
output a specific length pass without

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:22.760 
output a specific length pass without
regarding<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.140> original<00:03:11.590> policies<00:03:12.190> length

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.910

let's<00:05:19.410> try<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.770> out<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.190> as<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.730> can<00:05:20.880> see

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
let's try it out and as you can see

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.350 
let's try it out and as you can see
stuff<00:05:21.330> let's<00:05:21.570> boom<00:05:25.430> now<00:05:26.430> our<00:05:26.610> force<00:05:26.940> trap<00:05:27.180> is

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
stuff let's boom now our force trap is

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.600 
stuff let's boom now our force trap is
problem<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.960> simplest<00:05:28.470> of<00:05:28.620> all<00:05:28.860> let's<00:05:29.190> call

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
problem the simplest of all let's call

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.610 
problem the simplest of all let's call
it<00:05:30.030> uses<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:30.450> fact<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.930> we<00:05:31.139> are<00:05:31.169> inside<00:05:31.560> the

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
it uses the fact that we are inside the

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.440 
it uses the fact that we are inside the
air<00:05:31.980> box<00:05:32.340> next<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:32.820> portal<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:33.389> the

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
air box next to the portal on the

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.480 
air box next to the portal on the
dominant<00:05:33.690> side<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:34.620> travel<00:05:35.100> to<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.220> nether

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
dominant side and travel to the nether

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.480 
dominant side and travel to the nether
so<00:05:36.300> we<00:05:36.510> can<00:05:36.630> place<00:05:36.840> cactus<00:05:37.320> lava<00:05:37.740> or<00:05:38.040> even<00:05:38.250> post
