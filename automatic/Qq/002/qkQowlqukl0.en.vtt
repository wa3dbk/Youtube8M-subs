00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hello everyone knows gatien I hope 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.020
 that you are well we end up 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.210
 today for a video rather 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.130
 original this is a top 10 of my 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.599
 Favorite clips of this year 2012 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.080
 I'm going out a little late we are 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.040
 now returned to January 17, 18 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.150
 I could have taken her out a little bit more 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.070
 early but I had more videos 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 important to go out before that's why 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.130
 I apologize for not hitching myself up 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.109
 rather second little thing before 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
 start this top 10 of my favorite clips 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.010
 I'm testing a new setting about 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.689
 my microphone so I think you have 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.920
 clearly seen a difference now to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.150
 you tell me in the comments if 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.230
 you find that it is better or that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.390
 it's not as good as the settings 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.489
 previous without further ado we attack 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.380
 in 10th place with a small rich iott 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.239
 that I put on terminal it's my 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.890
 first tricks is in truth it's 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.160
 why am I enough to make you the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 show 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.440
 you have time to see where was 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 the enemy so he's at the top of the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.770
 escalators so I pick up small 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.579
 colts acquired words and so I go 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.110
 enter this then I guarantee you that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.789
 for my first tricks I was great 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.410
 super happy obviously I had already 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.489
 returned after the small three 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.230
 Caesars scop nothing really 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.460
 impressive this plot is very 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.600
 clean the author tricks will find 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.129
 certainly he's not at the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 height but I was very happy with the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.430
 see coming back to 9th place of this little 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.229
 top 10 so we find ourselves in scrum 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 general on the skid row map and that's 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.340
 so a clip in ffa that's why I l 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 very much appreciates this team enough 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.280
 complicated to put in general scrum and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.080
 I particularly chained his 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 enemies so this is a sequence of 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.060
 five islands with one feed once 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.189
 screen in the eighth place of this little 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.049
 top 10 we find ourselves at the bars on 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.670
 terminal of modane 3 and i'm going to do my 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.680
 first what to feed two weapons 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.210
 I quickly tell you that the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.770
 most of his clips aside from the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.540
 top-10 apart from the tenth forgiveness 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.100
 so you have already seen them on my 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.990
 montage discover that I invite you to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.260
 see or review if it's not already 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.630
 made 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.570
 little exclusivity but basically it's 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.190
 plus a recap of my discover and 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.630
 it allows to see the clips without 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.650
 their correction at idle and that allows 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.480
 to better realize a little bit 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.160
 maybe the difficulty of these 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.960
 last a little more than a quad fidh 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.670
 rather random on chinatown I was very 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.210
 glad to have put it and if I have 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.520
 other clips 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.730
 the same day that I will introduce you by 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.370
 the sequel to the 6th place of my clips 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.229
 favorite so we end up at the 50 a 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.670
 rifle rather difficult to handle on the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.830
 map hat hard and so it'll be 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.770
 a so this magnificent with a 5 fiden 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.960
 screen that appears now here 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.190
 so this is so soon after the end of this little 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.710
 clip that he went pretty fast and 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.320
 I was pretty happy to see her back 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.780
 here is instead number 5 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.850
 so we end up on scrap yards and 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.410
 i'm going to m maybe one of my 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.060
 first 5 pylons screen with bars 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.400
 on modern warfare 2 with a coop bone 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.890
 collateral that happens now four 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.100
 here and I will run respawn value 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.630
 and night to put the fifth so a 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.430
 clip that I was rather happy to have 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.870
 returned I grant you to the fourth 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.280
 place of this little top 10 we find ourselves 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.230
 always in general melee a mode that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.310
 I would have done well a day is 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.470
 not my general mixed joy this year 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.060
 so we're in general scrum on 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.250
 terminal to the intervention I will put 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.690
 a four ends fidh is hot so 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.930
 twice the guts the faithful shot 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.220
 I was rather very happy 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.930
 is already coming to the third 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.040
 place this ranking a clip rather 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.989
 impressive but given that 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.239
 was realized a spot does not belong 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.500
 of flour and is part of the top 3 which 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.780
 so is fine but I have not put 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.050
 first even though it was the closer of 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.150
 2,3 kg discover but serves the 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.290
 small switch and the a5 fidan screen of 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
 weapons that I was very very happy 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.230
 to have returned I can tell you that 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.390
 I have not bad 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.040
 the epic reactions I have not hurt that one 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.620
 true when I go back to the second 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.049
 place a rather random type so put is 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.720
 really so not a spot really 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.640
 feeling as we say it's so I 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.560
 think some people will have recognized a + 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.790
 25 / code 4 that I was very very 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.849
 happy to have returned is my first 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.620
 +25 and I intend to put more 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.450
 dc dc my next editing and I hope 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.370
 that you will be present for my next 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.680
 mounting in the first place of this little 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.450
 appendice we end up with a clip 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.860
 pretty impressive who is going very very 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.940
 quickly and I think we do not have the right 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.530
 time to realize in discover 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.500
 of the difficulty of this one a kill 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.420
 multi he for the a5 faithful screen and 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.650
 yet another one he for the fifth 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.150
 this crime with barrettes on hard hat 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.430
 modern warfare 3 i hope this little 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.859
 top 10 forgive you enjoyed already 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.180
 finished as a reminder these are my clips 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.540
 favorite these are not my best 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.579
 clips 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.739
 I think it almost could have been 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.879
 the top 10 best clips for 2012 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.980
 but the order might have been a 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.510
 little bit different brief with if one 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.919
 would remake the world of I hope this 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.299
 little video will have pleased you to think if he 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.400
 please put a little green thumb 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.380
 do not forget to give me your opinion 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.669
 in the comments 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.660
 for this new mic and I tell you 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.660
 the next by the people
