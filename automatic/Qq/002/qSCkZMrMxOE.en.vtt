00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.120
 hi to all today in cheap andros puntocom we bring you the lg optimus black 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.019
 The phone follows the shaft has been designed for lovers of aesthetics 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.460
 while in the contents of the box 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 I want to explain to you why he thinks that he has designed this terminal 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.659
 the market is currently dotted with high-performance phones mg 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.199
 for it already has its optimus 2x no doubt much more powerful 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.970
 what you intend with this optimus black is to reach an audience that is fixed 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.210
 much more in aesthetics than in the pit 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.370
 it has a thickness of only nine as two millimeters one of the thinnest 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.400
 From the market 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.550
 and also has a 4-inch screen that claims to be one of the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.810
 brighter if not the brightest in the market surpassing even galaxies 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 the face 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.910
 As you can see the exterior design is sober and elegant 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.440
 does not have any detail that is strident and if he knew the tonic 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.400
 general of this phone 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.600
 It has the same four buttons that include many Android terminals 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 The entire front is made of a single layer of glass 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.470
 has front camera the winner 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.420
 in the lower part we only see the tab to remove the lid from the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.350
 drums 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.360
 the sides as they are very clean in this one between the volume buttons 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.480
 and a button 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.360
 chan called g that serves to control advanced functions with the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.770
 phone accelerometer 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.490
 the top has the power button 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.500
 the jack connector 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.580
 kila micro sd input 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.680
 a detail that I liked a lot is the possibility of closing it so they have not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.760
 prospered 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.730
 with this tab 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.820
 a sample of the care that the axis has put in the design of this fact 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.560
 on the back to the camera 5 megapixels with led flash and speaker 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 the lines at the back are also very solid 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.879
 following the general line of the phone 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.879
 as I said the front is a single layer of glass 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.639
 without any bulge 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.449
 kevin hoops now the interior 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.879
 keane does not have anything more remarkable I always like to show him the 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.179
 quality of the mates 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.610
 the back cover in this case 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.949
 similar to any other terminal 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.949
 quite flexible 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.719
 and in the back of the usual thigh 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.719
 what for micro sd card 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.449
 for the sim card 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.219
 the camera with its flash and battery 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.219
 in this case it carries a 1500 migrant battery 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.779
 even though the terminal has one of the brightest screens in the 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:56.400
 market 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.510
 lg ensures that the autonomy of the phone 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.510
 surpasses any other smartphone 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.199
 in terms of the operating system the fsln is not a pending issue in this 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.629
 field 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.699
 the updates are not the strong point of the axis and this terminal as well 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.699
 that the optimus 2x comes from the factory with froyo 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.329
 something totally unjustifiable for a top-level manufacturer as it claims 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.279
 be the axis 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:31.099
 even so the operating system moves quite well thanks to the processor that 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.679
 is finished 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.359
 that I strap a gigahercio and ram memory of 512 megabytes 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:42.119
 the internal memory of 2 gigabytes is expandable through the fact of 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.579
 micro sd cards 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.979
 as I said the one that comes equipped with factory froyo is a very 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.049
 negative 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.079
 the axis of ponte should put special emphasis on improving the collections of 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.629
 its systems that all manufacturers including money in 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.629
 brief 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.630
 as usual 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.200
 I want to talk about the browser one of the strong points in any 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.289
 night 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.340
 in this case the serial browser behaves 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.989
 pretty good as in any other high-end phone and as not 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.759
 could be otherwise 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.220
 let's go into unemployment when I counted on you to see the speed of 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.219
 load 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.199
 we are connected by wi-fi 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.800
 and we can see that the page loads quite fast and without any kind of 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.979
 problem 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.309
 As always, the usual controls in the android browser 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.779
 we have had a point 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.879
 we can move the touch band respond really well 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.860
 we can not forget that it is one of the phones distinguished bird dlg for this 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.610
 season 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.479
 I usually change the keyboard that comes standard but these officials 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.409
 good mind 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.699
 it is very sensitive very easy to write in the vertical situation tank as the 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:01.270
 region 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.339
 imprisoned 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.119
 perhaps church lack of vocation of personalization as the duration of 

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:08.830
 the courses and the long ones 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.580
 but good is a keyboard that to be the basic giving detests is really 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 well compared to some to the competition 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.189
 Although as I told you the most powerful new terminals on the market 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.150
 it is still a malt that will allow you to use it as gps in 3d 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.150
 as is the case of this one continues 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.839
 with the map 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.009
 perfectly fluid as is logical 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:49.499
 we will go as an example silvio 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.979
 regarding the screen 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.979
 the movement 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.580
 comes with weather applications three stops 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.860
 the layer that you put on your terminals comes pretty well in this section 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.949
 we can use it to watch videos 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.430
 problems 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.560
 Despite the fact that, unfortunately, there is no outlet for seremet 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:15.999
 despite not being 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:19.229
 the most powerful of the market does not mean that we can not enjoy 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.509
 Any game 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.979
 clear exception is of those that require platform tegra 2 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.839
 can sound to the camera 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.860
 as I was saying it's 5 megapixels 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.860
 I do not know what belongs to everyone present 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:33.220
 and I add 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.159
 a flash led 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.659
 vessels 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:38.830
 and even though it is not a camera as I always say 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.759
 the digital camera 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.139
 meet suppose before to face between a nickname more than one occasion 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:48.059
 as for the video is that for the next 20 p 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.729
 and that change to the photograph that will serve to save the situation 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:57.729
 where you do not quote this before any cost 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.559
 definitive is a terminal suitable for anyone who thinks more about the 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:03.539
 aesthetic kennedy 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.199
 the power 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.830
 If you are of that type of homeless people, a telephone was operated on a 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.559
 very specialized use 

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:12.939
 the camera 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.239
 greetings to everyone from for your android together with
