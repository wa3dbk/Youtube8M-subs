00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and you can see that on the links of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.359 
and you can see that on the links of
them<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:10.100> this<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:12.920> probably<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
them and this one is probably the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
them and this one is probably the
shortest<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.680> because<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
shortest and because it's the one that

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.800 
shortest and because it's the one that
is<00:01:20.540> fastest<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.780> apply<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.500> think<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:24.540> has<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
is fastest to apply I think and it has a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.480 
is fastest to apply I think and it has a
nice<00:01:25.340> plum<00:01:26.340> color<00:01:26.880> thing<00:01:27.920> which<00:01:28.920> really<00:01:29.400> just

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
nice plum color thing which really just

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.480 
nice plum color thing which really just
matches<00:01:30.150> everything<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.049> makes<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.770> lips<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
matches everything and makes your lips a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.280 
matches everything and makes your lips a
little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.970> darker<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.900> black<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:36.290> then

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
little bit darker but not black and then

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.260
