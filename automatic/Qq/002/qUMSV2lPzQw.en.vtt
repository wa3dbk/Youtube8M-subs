in the open floor he's got a really good
form<00:02:19.390> they<00:02:19.570> said<00:02:19.840> 10<00:02:20.080> z<00:02:20.260> fades<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.709> little<00:02:20.740> bit

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
form they said 10 z fades a little bit

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.120 
form they said 10 z fades a little bit
loses<00:02:21.490> concentration<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.920> think

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
loses concentration and and so I think

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.190 
loses concentration and and so I think
