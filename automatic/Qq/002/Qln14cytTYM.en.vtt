00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 Bachelor's degree is higher from year to year

 different communities 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.290
 what does each country represent their low country 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.689
 will try to go as far as possible 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.340
 while knowing what level do you have in front 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.240
 that level from year to year 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 difficult 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.270
 so we will try to make a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.280
 team based 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.259
 two beats of meeting time

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.100
 far possible while respecting each 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.790
 team in front of us and hoping 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.130

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.910
 us for us and we'll have to 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.950
 confirms since we often come across 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.960
 the last square now the goal is 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.900
 why not dream in the end is 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.290
 even better to win the trophy must 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.690
 fill that it's 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.400

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.870
 to represent my country of origin and 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.190
 able to set up a team 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.929
 more or less of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.490
 binational malian bomber 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.190
 amateurs to cover all the links 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.790
 tears will always be there and seems 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.790
 enough for us 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.170
 world cup 4th edition mauritania

 very close, that is, at the beginning of 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.280
 turn we have the workforce to predict that lasts 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.049
 so if we are after Germany it's 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.280
 that I also hope the evening editors 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.590
 German ie the players 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.470

 say the analysis and after that is the type 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.919
 facing the team of Palestine
