00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.150 
memory and a real-time clock the problem
is<00:00:33.510> after<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.020> many<00:00:34.110> years<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.620> parts<00:00:34.950> run

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is after so many years these parts run

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.799 
is after so many years these parts run
out<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.340> power<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.000> there<00:00:36.329> were<00:00:36.420> certain

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
out of power and there were certain

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.010 
out of power and there were certain
variants<00:00:37.350> such<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> D<00:00:37.950> s<00:00:38.149> 1387<00:00:39.149> that

variants such as the D s 1387 that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
variants such as the D s 1387 that
Dallas<00:00:40.800> no<00:00:40.980> longer<00:00:41.340> produces<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.210> there's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
Dallas no longer produces and so there's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
Dallas no longer produces and so there's
no<00:00:42.600> replacement<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> market<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.010> these

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
no replacement on the market for these

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
no replacement on the market for these
what<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.329> show<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.960> how<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
what I'm going to show you is how to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.590 
what I'm going to show you is how to
rework<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.710> Dallas<00:00:47.250> modules<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.360> they

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
rework your Dallas modules so that they

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
rework your Dallas modules so that they
can<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.930> an<00:00:49.110> external<00:00:49.559> power<00:00:49.710> source<00:00:50.070> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
can use an external power source this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
can use an external power source this
has<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> advantage<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.780> saving<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> money

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
would be on this IC and it turns out

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.319 
would be on this IC and it turns out
that<00:02:40.769> they're<00:02:41.099> just<00:02:41.280> flipped<00:02:41.519> up<00:02:41.730> inside<00:02:42.150> this

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329

I've<00:03:36.180> been<00:03:36.389> whittling<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.109> module<00:03:37.319> for

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
I've been whittling on this module for

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.620 
I've been whittling on this module for
about<00:03:37.859> five<00:03:38.130> minutes<00:03:38.549> now<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:39.120> taking<00:03:39.480> my

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
about five minutes now just taking my

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.930 
about five minutes now just taking my
time<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.049> going<00:03:40.230> slowly<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.919> as<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.519> can<00:03:41.669> see

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
time and going slowly and as you can see

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.120 
time and going slowly and as you can see
there's<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.599> metal<00:03:42.930> terminal<00:03:43.349> in<00:03:43.470> there<00:03:43.680> that

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
there's a metal terminal in there that

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.430 
there's a metal terminal in there that
actually<00:03:44.340> bends<00:03:44.910> over<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.419> leads<00:03:45.840> up<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.319> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
actually bends over and leads up to the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.099 
actually bends over and leads up to the
battery<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.220> inside<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.849> casing<00:03:48.109> what

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
battery that is inside the casing what

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.629 
battery that is inside the casing what
you<00:03:49.230> need<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.620> do<00:03:49.769> with<00:03:50.069> either<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.459> positive

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
you need to do with either the positive

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.400 
you need to do with either the positive
or<00:03:51.060> negative<00:03:51.419> terminal<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.049> think<00:03:52.260> it's

or negative terminal and I think it's

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.809 
or negative terminal and I think it's
easier<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.799> do<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.130> with<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.519> negative

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
easier to do this with the negative

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.339 
easier to do this with the negative

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.860 
might explode or leak and make a mess
and<00:04:07.919> it'll<00:04:08.250> probably<00:04:08.459> blow<00:04:08.849> up<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.239> module<00:04:09.660> -

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
and it'll probably blow up the module -

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.770

the<00:04:10.799> best<00:04:11.009> way<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.280> do<00:04:11.549> that<00:04:11.729> is<00:04:12.539> to<00:04:12.750> use

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
the best way to do that is to use

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.979 
the best way to do that is to use
something<00:04:13.440> like<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:14.160> nail<00:04:14.549> or<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.940> sharp<00:04:15.570> point

something like a nail or a sharp point

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:16.310 
something like a nail or a sharp point
it's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
it's

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.780 
it's

you're done with your soldering what you

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.070 
you're done with your soldering what you
have<00:05:38.009> should<00:05:38.430> look<00:05:39.150> approximately<00:05:39.449> like<00:05:39.900> this

so<00:06:04.979> now<00:06:05.160> it's<00:06:06.000> time<00:06:06.240> to<00:06:06.389> put<00:06:06.539> the<00:06:06.630> batteries<00:06:07.020> in

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
so now it's time to put the batteries in

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.560 
so now it's time to put the batteries in
make<00:06:07.650> sure<00:06:07.680> of<00:06:08.009> course<00:06:08.039> that<00:06:08.280> you<00:06:08.570> observe

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
make sure of course that you observe

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.589 
make sure of course that you observe
polarity<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:11.340> if<00:06:11.849> your<00:06:12.000> batteries<00:06:12.360> don't

polarity and if your batteries don't

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.990 
polarity and if your batteries don't
turn<00:06:12.810> red<00:06:13.080> and<00:06:13.320> nothing<00:06:13.620> goes<00:06:13.770> pop<00:06:14.070> you're

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
turn red and nothing goes pop you're

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.610 
turn red and nothing goes pop you're
ready<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.300> test<00:06:15.539> this<00:06:15.720> thing<00:06:15.990> out<00:06:16.169> and<00:06:16.380> see<00:06:16.530> if
