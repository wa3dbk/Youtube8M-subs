from<00:02:43.980> when<00:02:44.160> when<00:02:44.579> they<00:02:44.760> were<00:02:44.910> installed<00:02:45.420> so

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
from when when they were installed so

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.930 
from when when they were installed so
that<00:02:45.959> looks<00:02:46.200> great<00:02:47.450> all<00:02:48.450> right<00:02:48.629> now<00:02:49.940> let's

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
that looks great all right now let's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.569 
that looks great all right now let's
zoom<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:52.970> these<00:02:53.970> three<00:02:54.390> tiles<00:02:55.250> these<00:02:56.250> three

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
zoom out these three tiles these three

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.970 
zoom out these three tiles these three
sets<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.940> towels<00:02:57.180> were<00:02:57.599> treated<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.680> wet<00:02:58.859> &amp;

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
sets of towels were treated with wet &amp;

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.089 
sets of towels were treated with wet &amp;
Forget<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.609> these<00:03:00.030> three<00:03:00.420> sets<00:03:00.720> were<00:03:01.349> not<00:03:01.590> so

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
Forget in these three sets were not so

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.119 
Forget in these three sets were not so
again<00:03:02.400> let's<00:03:03.090> look<00:03:03.269> at<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:04.079> grout<00:03:04.379> lines<00:03:04.680> over

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
again let's look at the grout lines over

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:12.369 
again let's look at the grout lines over
here<00:03:08.239> again<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.450> can<00:03:09.629> see<00:03:09.870> some<00:03:10.970> more<00:03:11.970> just

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
here again you can see some more just

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.309 
here again you can see some more just
coloring<00:03:13.379> in<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.280> grout<00:03:14.519> lines<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.870> tiles

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
coloring in the grout lines the tiles

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.229 
coloring in the grout lines the tiles
don't<00:03:16.530> look<00:03:16.709> half<00:03:16.950> bad<00:03:19.579> there's<00:03:20.579> maybe<00:03:20.849> only<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
don't look half bad there's maybe only a

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.490 
don't look half bad there's maybe only a
little<00:03:21.569> bit<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.810> soap<00:03:22.019> scum<00:03:22.319> that's

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
little bit of soap scum that's

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.659 
little bit of soap scum that's
accumulated<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.910> non<00:03:24.720> treated<00:03:25.519> wet<00:03:26.519> &amp;

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
accumulated on the non treated wet &amp;

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.370 
accumulated on the non treated wet &amp;
Forget<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:27.239> certainly<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.900> grout<00:03:28.109> lines

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
Forget but certainly the grout lines

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.690 
Forget but certainly the grout lines
look<00:03:28.650> terrible<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.579> then<00:03:30.480> over<00:03:30.750> here<00:03:31.700> you

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
look terrible and then over here you

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.150 
look terrible and then over here you
look<00:03:32.910> great

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
look great

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.220 
look great
look<00:03:35.160> at<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:36.950> now<00:03:37.950> let's<00:03:38.459> zoom<00:03:38.549> out<00:03:39.200> take<00:03:40.200> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
look at that now let's zoom out take a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.490 
look at that now let's zoom out take a
look<00:03:40.470> at<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.680> shower<00:03:40.919> door<00:03:41.630> it's<00:03:42.630> probably

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
look at the shower door it's probably

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.089 
look at the shower door it's probably
hard<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.829> see<00:03:43.950> but<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.209> treated<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.440> right-hand

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
hard to see but I treated the right-hand

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.020 
hard to see but I treated the right-hand
side<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:49.160> treated<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> right-hand<00:03:50.760> side<00:03:51.000> of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
side I treated the right-hand side of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.440 
side I treated the right-hand side of
the<00:03:51.419> glass<00:03:51.720> okay<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.430> left-hand<00:03:53.910> side<00:03:54.030> I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the glass okay and the left-hand side I

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.449 
the glass okay and the left-hand side I
did<00:03:54.660> not<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.970> it's<00:03:56.970> right<00:03:57.269> here<00:03:57.829> this<00:03:58.829> area

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
did not and it's right here this area

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.879 
did not and it's right here this area
right<00:03:59.730> here<00:03:59.790> that's<00:04:00.299> not<00:04:00.480> treated<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.260> it's

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
right here that's not treated and it's

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.059 
right here that's not treated and it's
foggier<00:04:02.730> than<00:04:03.269> this<00:04:03.560> area<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.769> shower

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
foggier than this area of the shower

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.789 
foggier than this area of the shower
glass<00:04:05.879> door<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.449> definitely<00:04:07.440> there<00:04:07.650> was<00:04:07.739> a

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
glass door so definitely there was a

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.539 
glass door so definitely there was a
positive<00:04:08.099> effect<00:04:08.790> by<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.000> wet<00:04:09.299> &amp;<00:04:09.480> Forget<00:04:09.840> and

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
positive effect by the wet &amp; Forget and

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.970 
positive effect by the wet &amp; Forget and
it<00:04:11.549> did<00:04:11.699> a<00:04:11.730> really<00:04:11.819> good<00:04:12.299> job<00:04:12.379> my<00:04:13.379> shower<00:04:13.620> door

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
it did a really good job my shower door

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.260 
it did a really good job my shower door
was<00:04:14.129> already<00:04:14.310> clean

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
was already clean

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.240 
was already clean
there<00:04:15.450> was<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.930> method<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.709> used<00:04:17.010> with

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
there was a method that I used with

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.690 
there was a method that I used with
rain-x<00:04:17.670> that<00:04:18.030> probably<00:04:18.920> prevented<00:04:19.920> it<00:04:20.310> from

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
rain-x that probably prevented it from

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.300 
rain-x that probably prevented it from
getting<00:04:20.850> really<00:04:21.300> bad<00:04:21.690> over<00:04:21.959> time<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:23.100> that's

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
getting really bad over time so that's

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.310 
getting really bad over time so that's
why<00:04:23.430> this<00:04:23.730> doesn't<00:04:24.030> look<00:04:24.150> totally<00:04:24.720> disgusting

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
why this doesn't look totally disgusting

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.390 
why this doesn't look totally disgusting
but<00:04:25.440> again<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:25.950> see<00:04:26.130> there's<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
but again you can see there's a

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.230 
but again you can see there's a
fogginess

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
fogginess

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.390 
fogginess
in<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:28.050> glass<00:04:28.320> door<00:04:28.770> on<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.490> untreated<00:04:30.150> side

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.350 

now<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.900> fourth<00:04:37.260> area<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.070> treated<00:04:38.460> with

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
now the fourth area that I treated with

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360 
now the fourth area that I treated with
wet<00:04:39.720> &amp;<00:04:39.870> Forget<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.500> under<00:04:40.800> here<00:04:41.160> it's

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
wet &amp; Forget is under here it's

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.950 
wet &amp; Forget is under here it's
underneath<00:04:41.730> this<00:04:42.150> bench<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:45.620> this<00:04:46.620> is

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
underneath this bench and this is

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.390 
underneath this bench and this is
interesting<00:04:48.960> because<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.380> would<00:04:49.740> spray<00:04:50.130> it

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
interesting because I would spray it

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.510 
interesting because I would spray it
underneath<00:04:50.940> here<00:04:51.330> underneath<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.620> bench<00:04:52.830> but

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
underneath here underneath the bench but

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.580 
underneath here underneath the bench but
I<00:04:53.580> didn't<00:04:53.910> get<00:04:54.060> this<00:04:54.240> corner<00:04:54.780> with<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.290> spray

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
I didn't get this corner with the spray

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.580 
I didn't get this corner with the spray
and<00:04:55.950> as<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.610> can<00:04:56.790> see<00:04:58.010> it's<00:04:59.010> pretty<00:04:59.460> moldy

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
and as you can see it's pretty moldy

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.850 
and as you can see it's pretty moldy
there<00:05:01.590> in<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.950> corner<00:05:02.490> but<00:05:03.120> just<00:05:03.960> adjacent<00:05:04.380> to

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
there in the corner but just adjacent to

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.860 
there in the corner but just adjacent to
it<00:05:05.600> over<00:05:06.600> here<00:05:06.960> where<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:07.860> could<00:05:07.980> spray<00:05:08.520> it

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
it over here where I could spray it

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.240 
it over here where I could spray it
isn't<00:05:09.870> bad<00:05:10.050> at<00:05:10.290> all

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.910 

okay<00:05:14.870> there's<00:05:15.870> maybe<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.260> little<00:05:16.350> bit<00:05:16.830> of

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
okay there's maybe a little bit of

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.220 
okay there's maybe a little bit of
discoloration<00:05:17.370> in<00:05:18.090> spots<00:05:18.450> where<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.960> spray

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
discoloration in spots where the spray

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.850 
discoloration in spots where the spray
didn't<00:05:19.530> fully<00:05:20.240> penetrate<00:05:21.240> but<00:05:21.540> overall<00:05:21.960> this

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
didn't fully penetrate but overall this

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.490 
didn't fully penetrate but overall this
area<00:05:23.280> is<00:05:23.430> great<00:05:23.850> compared<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.080> corner

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
area is great compared to the corner
