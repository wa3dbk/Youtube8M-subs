the app itself providing you've got

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.960 
the app itself providing you've got
obviously<00:03:14.720> good<00:03:15.319> bandwidth<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.760> can<00:03:16.879> do

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
obviously good bandwidth and you can do

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.390 
obviously good bandwidth and you can do
a<00:03:17.000> whole<00:03:17.269> bunch<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.630> things<00:03:17.930> within<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.130> app

everything that is going on at that
particular<00:03:53.450> time<00:03:53.840> like<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.380> say<00:03:54.560> with<00:03:55.010> very

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
particular time like I say with very

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.870 
particular time like I say with very
minimal<00:03:56.049> latency<00:03:57.049> now<00:03:57.859> once<00:03:58.340> you're<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:58.669> you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
minimal latency now once you're in you

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.309 
minimal latency now once you're in you
get<00:03:59.060> this<00:03:59.150> really<00:03:59.389> incredible<00:03:59.840> little

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
get this really incredible little

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.530 
get this really incredible little
timeline<00:04:00.859> here<00:04:01.160> that<00:04:01.340> gives<00:04:01.549> you<00:04:01.700> all<00:04:02.299> of<00:04:02.329> the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
timeline here that gives you all of the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.210 
timeline here that gives you all of the
things<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.900> might<00:04:03.230> have<00:04:03.410> gone<00:04:03.560> on<00:04:03.709> so<00:04:03.980> if

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
things that might have gone on so if

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.460 
things that might have gone on so if
there<00:04:04.400> was<00:04:04.549> some<00:04:05.060> kind<00:04:05.269> of<00:04:05.359> noise<00:04:05.599> detected<00:04:06.349> it

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
there was some kind of noise detected it

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.990 
there was some kind of noise detected it
would<00:04:06.590> automatically<00:04:07.130> take<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.400> snapshot<00:04:07.760> of

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
would automatically take a snapshot of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.659 
would automatically take a snapshot of
that<00:04:08.299> or<00:04:08.569> maybe<00:04:09.200> some<00:04:09.530> motion<00:04:09.919> detection<00:04:10.250> and

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
that or maybe some motion detection and

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.030 
that or maybe some motion detection and
they<00:04:10.880> also<00:04:11.030> have<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.630> ability<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.049> throw<00:04:12.859> up

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
they also have the ability to throw up

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.400 
they also have the ability to throw up
notifications<00:04:13.910> as<00:04:14.030> well<00:04:14.209> based<00:04:14.510> upon<00:04:14.900> those

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
notifications as well based upon those

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.789 
notifications as well based upon those
particular<00:04:16.070> triggers<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:17.780> if<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:18.289> want<00:04:18.680> to

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
particular triggers so if you want to

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.890 
particular triggers so if you want to
get<00:04:18.889> notifications<00:04:19.669> based<00:04:19.880> around<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.539> fact

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
get notifications based around the fact

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.420 
get notifications based around the fact
that<00:04:20.959> maybe<00:04:21.229> there's<00:04:21.469> a<00:04:21.530> loud<00:04:21.739> noise<00:04:22.039> or<00:04:22.400> a

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
that maybe there's a loud noise or a

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.730 
that maybe there's a loud noise or a
bang<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.180> can<00:04:23.330> do<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.719> you<00:04:24.110> can<00:04:24.229> also<00:04:24.380> get<00:04:24.680> a

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
bang you can do that you can also get a

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.330 
bang you can do that you can also get a
notification

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
notification

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.760

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
if there's any kind of motion as well

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.980 
if there's any kind of motion as well
now<00:04:28.490> within<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.940> app<00:04:29.030> itself<00:04:29.210> like<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.690> say<00:04:29.930> it

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
now within the app itself like I say it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.480 
now within the app itself like I say it
detects<00:04:30.410> all<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.680> these<00:04:30.800> things<00:04:31.010> takes<00:04:31.370> a
