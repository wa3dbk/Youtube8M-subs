00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.209 
and continue external damage they also
hit<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.600> all<00:01:59.810> three<00:02:00.049> combat<00:02:00.350> cells<00:02:00.619> so

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
hit in all three combat cells so

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.789 
hit in all three combat cells so
basically<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.060> can't<00:02:02.360> predict<00:02:02.930> against<00:02:03.560> them

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
basically you can't predict against them

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.249 
basically you can't predict against them
so<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:04.430> better<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.909> use<00:02:05.030> soulsplit<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:06.049> heal

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
so it's better to use soulsplit to heal

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.550 
so it's better to use soulsplit to heal
a<00:02:06.469> few<00:02:07.100> Life<00:02:07.280> Points<00:02:07.660> they<00:02:08.660> are<00:02:08.810> also<00:02:08.959> immune

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
a few Life Points they are also immune

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.130 
a few Life Points they are also immune
to<00:02:09.770> poison<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.399> reflect<00:02:11.120> damage<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.690> even

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
to poison and reflect damage and even

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.870 
to poison and reflect damage and even
variance<00:02:12.770> doesn't<00:02:13.220> actually<00:02:13.370> work

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
variance doesn't actually work

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.180 
variance doesn't actually work
on<00:02:13.970> them<00:02:14.210> their<00:02:14.990> common<00:02:15.350> root<00:02:15.560> don't<00:02:15.920> really

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
on them their common root don't really

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.190 
on them their common root don't really
worth<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:17.270> are<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.540> lucky<00:02:17.690> get<00:02:18.020> one

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
worth it but if you are a lucky get one

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.380 
worth it but if you are a lucky get one
of<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.500> new<00:02:18.530> rare<00:02:19.040> loot<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:19.730> definitely

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
of the new rare loot it's definitely

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.390 
of the new rare loot it's definitely
worth<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:21.140> at<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.680> moment<00:02:21.710> they<00:02:22.130> sell

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
worth it because at the moment they sell

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.760 
worth it because at the moment they sell
for<00:02:22.850> around<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.330> hundred<00:02:23.720> million<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.500> peace

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
for around the hundred million the peace

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.040 
for around the hundred million the peace
killing<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.880> lamas<00:02:26.150> track<00:02:26.390> your<00:02:26.570> arms<00:02:26.870> I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
killing the lamas track your arms I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.200 
killing the lamas track your arms I
think<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.770> challenge<00:02:28.160> because<00:02:28.490> there<00:02:29.090> are

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
think it's a challenge because there are

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.900 
think it's a challenge because there are
high-level<00:02:29.510> monsters<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.890> high<00:02:31.220> Slayer

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
high-level monsters with a high Slayer

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.880 
high-level monsters with a high Slayer
level<00:02:32.420> requirement<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.140> also<00:02:33.710> they<00:02:33.860> are

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
level requirement and also they are

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.070 
level requirement and also they are
located<00:02:34.340> in<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.490> wilderness<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.690> it's<00:02:35.900> really

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
located in the wilderness so it's really

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.140 
located in the wilderness so it's really
