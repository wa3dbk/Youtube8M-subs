00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.139
 Where is 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.620
 good kids follow 2014 welcome to the 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.610
 bag with the value also today we are in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.010
 a review the review of our three 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.439
 microphone stacks our new microphone 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.869
 that we recently uploaded the inbox the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.020
 unboxing and well let's make the mix 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.720
 review where we're going to compare there 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.809
 the helmets there that we have in the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.129
 wall the cam in particular let's continue with 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.809
 our our microphone here and 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.580
 well you can also compare if you want 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.670
 the microphone lied using now I come 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.470
 that the microphone of the cam of the cee the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.720
 310 and well let's move on to the review 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.940
 good kids right now we are 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.030
 using the microphone this here not 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.100
 I know how it will be listening more or less 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.900
 well it's not like the one on the cam 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.059
 I prefer myself much more of the field was 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.850
 apart you hear much louder in case 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.130
 call it and well let's do three 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.530
 small tests we will do the test 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.740
 of the time the pop also call them 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.920
 the English pop is the sound that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.200
 makes the microphones on the phone 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.930
 in the voice because the p is a one word 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.950
 that the truth is quite strong and makes 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.100
 pretty strong then 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.750
 the microphone is saturated so to call it 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.540
 it is saturated and it is much more 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.210
 much stronger and a 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.420
 audio distortion okay let's do 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.890
 that of the p we are going to do the one of the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.040
 blowing 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.830
 and let's go I do not know we could also talk 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.560
 a little bit good and we're going to do the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.380
 first test that will be the one of the p 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.950
 let's say daddy pipe 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.950
 pp 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.310
 more or less you can take a little more 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.039
 or less what we're going to see we're going to do 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.330
 now the sound I do not know if it will be 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.540
 listening to the sound the truth but 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.540
 good 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.840
 we have already done that and more or less 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.740
 I had heard and I think that with 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.740
 that would be left over 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.340
 right now I'm listening to 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.390
 microphone I do not know if you're listening 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.520
 well the first time the good yes 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:44.320
 well let's do 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.320
 The potato type pp test 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.650
 that's going pretty good 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.650
 that's going pretty good 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.689
 well let's do the blow 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.819
 it seems to be good that I think that if 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.959
 will listen well 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.959
 and well this is the review 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.830
 either 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.920
 how it goes to the microphone the truth that I 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.500
 I think it goes pretty well in addition to 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.200
 clear it gave me much better than the others 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.610
 that get into the sound see 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.770
 the environment I believe that only the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.300
 sound the environments and those things and 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.860
 Well I hope you liked everyone and 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.010

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.010
 then 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.090
