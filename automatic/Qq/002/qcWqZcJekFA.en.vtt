spacebar now these right here are your
shields<00:01:31.090> one<00:01:32.090> two<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.020> number<00:01:33.319> three

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
shields one two this is number three

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.719 
shields one two this is number three
number<00:01:34.069> four<00:01:34.250> year<00:01:34.819> your<00:01:35.390> four<00:01:35.690> shields<00:01:36.350> and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
basically you hide behind them now every

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.580 
basically you hide behind them now every
time<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.880> men<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.450> enemy<00:01:41.810> gets<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.319> the<00:01:42.409> end

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
time the men the enemy gets to the end

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.690 
time the men the enemy gets to the end
of<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.800> row<00:01:42.950> approximately<00:01:43.759> here<00:01:44.240> or<00:01:44.899> over<00:01:45.409> here

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
of a row approximately here or over here

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.609 
of a row approximately here or over here
they<00:01:46.700> drop<00:01:46.969> down<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.570> they<00:01:47.659> certainly<00:01:47.869> faster

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
they drop down and they certainly faster

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.980 
they drop down and they certainly faster
and<00:01:48.890> faster<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.880> becomes<00:01:50.180> more<00:01:50.360> difficult<00:01:50.869> so

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
and faster it becomes more difficult so

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.810 
and faster it becomes more difficult so
you<00:01:51.020> want<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.380> kill<00:01:51.560> them<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.340> want<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.579> do<00:01:52.670> it

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
you want to kill them you want to do it

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
you want to kill them you want to do it
row<00:01:53.060> by<00:01:53.329> row<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.950> they<00:01:55.700> don't<00:01:55.880> get<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.719> the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
row by row so that they don't get to the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.719 
row by row so that they don't get to the
end<00:01:57.049> where<00:01:57.500> they<00:01:57.619> drop<00:01:57.829> down<00:01:58.039> to<00:01:58.219> start<00:01:58.430> moving

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
end where they drop down to start moving

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.230 
end where they drop down to start moving
quicker

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
quicker

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.630 
quicker
alright<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.110> let's<00:02:00.320> let's<00:02:00.710> continue<00:02:01.039> now<00:02:01.369> and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
alright so let's let's continue now and

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.539 
alright so let's let's continue now and
let's<00:02:02.000> take<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.390> look<00:02:02.689> at<00:02:02.930> exactly<00:02:03.490> how<00:02:04.490> the

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
let's take a look at exactly how the

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:53.160 
let's take a look at exactly how the
game

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:04:30.150 

you'll<00:02:54.170> see<00:02:54.470> here

let's<00:04:31.160> see<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:31.430> we<00:04:31.550> quickly<00:04:32.150> gonna<00:04:32.930> stop<00:04:33.410> I

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
let's see if we quickly gonna stop I

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.590
