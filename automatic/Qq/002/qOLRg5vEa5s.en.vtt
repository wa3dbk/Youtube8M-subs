00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
you know the idea of the beginning of

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.379 
you know the idea of the beginning of
the<00:03:41.109> beginning<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.739> 20th<00:03:42.519> century<00:03:42.549> then

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
the beginning of the 20th century then

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.710 
the beginning of the 20th century then
that<00:03:44.379> that<00:03:44.739> sound<00:03:45.099> had<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.609> know<00:03:45.729> that<00:03:46.030> this

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
that that sound had you know that this

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.270 
that that sound had you know that this
kind<00:03:47.049> of<00:03:47.169> same<00:03:47.379> approach<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:47.919> was<00:03:48.010> really

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
kind of same approach it was really

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.030 
kind of same approach it was really
messy<00:03:48.669> but<00:03:48.940> then<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.870> was<00:03:50.019> really<00:03:50.440> like<00:03:50.739> you

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
messy but then it was really like you

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.309 
messy but then it was really like you
know<00:03:51.190> in<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.489> one<00:03:51.669> big<00:03:52.120> hall<00:03:52.479> with<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.079> one

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
know in a one big hall with a one

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.649 
know in a one big hall with a one
microphone<00:03:53.979> and<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.430> whole<00:03:54.609> band<00:03:54.879> just<00:03:55.419> yeah

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
microphone and the whole band just yeah

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.599 
microphone and the whole band just yeah
coming<00:03:56.019> through<00:03:56.139> it<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.409> that<00:03:56.829> was<00:03:56.979> you<00:03:57.519> know

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
coming through it and that was you know

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.629 
coming through it and that was you know
the<00:03:57.790> kind<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.120> approach<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.229> probably<00:03:59.889> not

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
the kind of a approach to probably not

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.379 
the kind of a approach to probably not
being<00:04:01.239> so<00:04:01.599> uptight<00:04:02.260> about<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:03.010> know<00:04:03.129> how

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
being so uptight about you know how

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.460 
being so uptight about you know how
performance<00:04:04.389> is<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.079> know<00:04:05.169> it's<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.909> drum

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
performance is you know it's like a drum

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.469 
performance is you know it's like a drum
single<00:04:08.470> drumbeat<00:04:08.829> know<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:09.970> time<00:04:10.180> which<00:04:10.449> of

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479 
single drumbeat know in time which of

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:14.490 
single drumbeat know in time which of
course<00:04:10.659> they<00:04:11.079> are<00:04:11.290> but<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.970> know<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:14.379> I

course they are but you know and and I
know<00:04:14.739> yeah<00:04:15.159> it<00:04:15.489> was<00:04:15.609> such<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.060> relaxed

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
know yeah it was such a relaxed

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.629 
know yeah it was such a relaxed
experience<00:04:17.289> for<00:04:17.500> us<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.130> was<00:04:18.310> kind<00:04:18.579> of

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
experience for us so that was kind of

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.189 
experience for us so that was kind of
inspiring<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.419> itself<00:04:19.690> just<00:04:20.169> the

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
inspiring in itself just the

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.110 
inspiring in itself just the
environments<00:04:20.829> like<00:04:21.010> very<00:04:21.519> dictated<00:04:22.030> the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
environments like very dictated the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.519 
environments like very dictated the
sounds<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.419> everything<00:04:22.719> well<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.229> record

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:23.529 
sounds of everything well the record

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.230
