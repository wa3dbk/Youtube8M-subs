00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:03.280 
plug in it so if you have a sonos bridge
which<00:04:02.389> actually<00:04:02.569> this<00:04:02.810> will<00:04:02.959> come<00:04:03.139> with<00:04:03.259> a

the wall no need to connect there
there's<00:04:10.639> also<00:04:10.819> interestingly<00:04:11.150> enough

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
there's also interestingly enough

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.750 
there's also interestingly enough
a little<00:04:13.140> mounting<00:04:13.650> port<00:04:14.099> there<00:04:14.280> as<00:04:14.370> well<00:04:14.580> so

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
a little mounting port there as well so

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.240 
a little mounting port there as well so
you<00:04:14.819> can<00:04:15.030> use<00:04:15.270> these<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:16.500> mount<00:04:16.739> wall<00:04:17.010> mount

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
you can use these to mount wall mount

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.099 
you can use these to mount wall mount
them<00:04:17.459> or<00:04:17.730> mouth<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.150> want<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.299> stands<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.959> use

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
there you can see on the inside you've

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.580 
there you can see on the inside you've
got<00:04:29.160> basically<00:04:29.460> two<00:04:29.910> speakers<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:30.479> there<00:04:30.660> and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
got basically two speakers in there and

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.469 
got basically two speakers in there and
this<00:04:32.100> should<00:04:32.220> create<00:04:32.490> some<00:04:32.669> nice<00:04:32.880> sounds<00:04:33.180> and

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
this should create some nice sounds and

I what you want to do is basically take
your<00:04:34.860> AC<00:04:34.979> adapter<00:04:35.610> you're<00:04:35.790> just<00:04:36.120> looking<00:04:36.870> in

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
your AC adapter you're just looking in

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.629 
your AC adapter you're just looking in
here<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:38.340> shove<00:04:38.639> it<00:04:38.790> into<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.060> bottom<00:04:40.639> like

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
here you shove it into the bottom like

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.010 
here you shove it into the bottom like
so<00:04:42.710> wall<00:04:43.710> then<00:04:44.430> all<00:04:45.300> you're<00:04:45.510> gonna<00:04:45.600> have<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.870> do

play/pause button at the same time and

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.030 
play/pause button at the same time and
that'll<00:04:51.389> put<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:51.810> in<00:04:51.930> pairing<00:04:52.380> mode<00:04:52.410> that

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
that'll put it in pairing mode that

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.770 
that'll put it in pairing mode that
allows<00:04:53.160> us<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.430> pair<00:04:53.639> up<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.940> sonos<00:04:54.210> app<00:04:54.389> so

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
allows us to pair up to the sonos app so

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.110 
allows us to pair up to the sonos app so
again<00:04:55.020> this<00:04:55.290> will<00:04:55.590> access<00:04:56.040> music<00:04:56.490> from<00:04:56.700> music

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
again this will access music from music

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.850 
again this will access music from music
