00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.310
 hello if the professor today 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.979
 tell you how using modern 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:06.899
 achievements of science and technology you can 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.179
 save your money 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.709
 take the usual light bulb its power 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.129
 makes 100 watts 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.900
 and only 5 percent of this power goes 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.240
 to produce light 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.280
 the remaining 95 percent is converted to heat 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.339
 and your electricity billboards 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.319
 don't believe let's spend a little 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.319
 experiment take an ordinary light bulb 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.009
 and energy-saving lamps 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.860
 there 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 now connected to electricity 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.580
 take two ordinary transparent glass 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.650
 and main component 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 fresh chicken eggs 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.360
 love is decided 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360
 Now let's try a special city 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.540
 tula 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 let's start the experiment 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.250
 immersed 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 our samples are in solution 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
 Let's go 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.769
 Well, we estimate the result of our 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.589
 experiment 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.840
 Havana light bulb practical 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.659
 normal court will decide 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 you can even try it 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.559
 energy saving left eggs liquid 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.599
 but all such schnitzel distribute petit not 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.389
 looks like in a griddle here 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.599
 so leave the main light bulbs 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.579
 occupation shine 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.749
 and 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.749
 spend energy as it should be warm 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.859
 well, that's all for today 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.229
 you were with simplists to new 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.309
 meeting 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.309
 with me 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:04.609
 at
