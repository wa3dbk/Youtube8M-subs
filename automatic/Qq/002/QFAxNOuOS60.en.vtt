00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
get a list - something like this so what

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.160 
get a list - something like this so what
we<00:00:38.540> can<00:00:38.660> do<00:00:38.809> is<00:00:39.520> click<00:00:40.520> on<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.170> important

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
we can do is click on the important

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.740 
we can do is click on the important
updates<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.210> review<00:00:44.210> them<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.540> see<00:00:44.720> if

there's<00:00:45.020> any<00:00:45.199> that<00:00:45.680> we<00:00:45.829> want<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.780> unselect<00:00:47.780> or

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
there's any that we want to unselect or

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.189 
there's any that we want to unselect or
that<00:00:48.650> we<00:00:48.739> want<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:49.010> select<00:00:49.720> in<00:00:50.720> this<00:00:50.989> case

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
that we want to select in this case

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.569 
that we want to select in this case
three<00:00:51.559> of<00:00:51.650> them<00:00:51.769> are<00:00:51.920> unselected

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
three of them are unselected

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.040 
three of them are unselected
automatically<00:00:53.269> will<00:00:53.750> leave<00:00:53.900> those

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
automatically will leave those

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.259 
automatically will leave those
unselected<00:00:54.829> because<00:00:55.579> there's<00:00:55.790> probably<00:00:56.180> a

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
unselected because there's probably a

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.069 
unselected because there's probably a
reason<00:00:56.329> why<00:00:57.400> Microsoft<00:00:58.400> did<00:00:58.579> this<00:00:59.079> generally

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
reason why Microsoft did this generally

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.790 
reason why Microsoft did this generally
you'll<00:01:00.440> find<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.920> all<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:02.800> important

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
you'll find that all the important

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.160 
you'll find that all the important
updates<00:01:04.129> are<00:01:04.369> selected<00:01:04.910> so<00:01:05.539> these<00:01:05.720> three<00:01:06.050> are

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
updates are selected so these three are

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.980 
updates are selected so these three are
probably<00:01:06.410> best<00:01:06.920> done<00:01:07.220> as<00:01:07.550> a<00:01:08.270> separate<00:01:08.780> group

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
probably best done as a separate group

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.529 
probably best done as a separate group
so<00:01:09.470> we'll<00:01:09.950> let<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.250> happen<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.850> just<00:01:11.270> do<00:01:11.390> the

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
so we'll let that happen and just do the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.480 
so we'll let that happen and just do the
others<00:01:11.780> for<00:01:12.020> now<00:01:12.140> but<00:01:12.950> if<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:13.100> click<00:01:13.399> on

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
others for now but if we click on

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.600 
others for now but if we click on
optional<00:01:14.119> here<00:01:14.420> we'll<00:01:15.320> see<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:15.590> we<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:16.340> one

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
optional here we'll see that we have one

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.450 
optional here we'll see that we have one
optional<00:01:17.210> update<00:01:17.600> now<00:01:18.410> this<00:01:18.619> is<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.039> Bing

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
that I want showing up later when I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.400 
that I want showing up later when I

check for updates at another time so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.940 
check for updates at another time so
what<00:01:30.590> I'm<00:01:30.679> going<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.860> do<00:01:31.039> is<00:01:31.850> right<00:01:32.330> click<00:01:32.360> and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
what I'm going to do is right click and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.930 
hide update
now<00:01:36.150> generally<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.520> permanently<00:01:38.520> hide

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
now generally that will permanently hide

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.120 
now generally that will permanently hide
an<00:01:39.119> update<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.200> found<00:01:40.440> that<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
an update but I have found that with the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.190 
an update but I have found that with the
Bing<00:01:41.369> desktop<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.090> particular<00:01:42.600> tends<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:43.049> keep

Bing desktop in particular tends to keep
showing<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:44.310> assuming<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
showing up I'm assuming that this is a

thing<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.290> watch<00:02:13.470> for<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.660> some<00:02:15.660> updates

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
thing to watch for is that some updates

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.710 
thing to watch for is that some updates
require<00:02:16.470> interaction<00:02:17.240> sometimes<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.630> a

response from you otherwise also keep in
mind<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.520> when<00:03:12.150> your<00:03:12.390> updates<00:03:12.750> are<00:03:12.959> complete

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380

mind that when your updates are complete
the<00:03:13.890> computer<00:03:14.340> will<00:03:14.790> often<00:03:15.180> want<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.480> restart

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
the computer will often want to restart

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.280 
the computer will often want to restart
so<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.190> won't<00:03:17.400> do<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:18.170> automatically

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
so it won't do that automatically

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.430 
so it won't do that automatically
if<00:03:19.500> you've<00:03:19.770> manually<00:03:20.220> started<00:03:20.790> your<00:03:20.910> updates

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
if you've manually started your updates

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.949 
if you've manually started your updates
it<00:03:22.440> will<00:03:22.650> prompt<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.820> let<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.630> know<00:03:24.750> that

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it will prompt you and let you know that

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.199 
it will prompt you and let you know that
it<00:03:25.080> wants<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.470> restart<00:03:25.830> if<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.820> computer

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
it wants to restart if the computer

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.520 
it wants to restart if the computer
doesn't<00:03:27.450> tell<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.140> wants<00:03:28.410> to

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
doesn't tell you that it wants to

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.760 
doesn't tell you that it wants to
restart<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.780> don't<00:03:30.930> have<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.440> can<00:03:31.590> just

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
restart you don't have to you can just

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.330 
restart you don't have to you can just
keep<00:03:31.890> on<00:03:32.070> working

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340
