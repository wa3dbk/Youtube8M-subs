00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
are so it was it wasn't too bad it's

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.130 
are so it was it wasn't too bad it's
kind<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.269> nerve-wracking<00:02:08.869> trying<00:02:09.080> to

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
kind of nerve-wracking trying to

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.860 
kind of nerve-wracking trying to
remember<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.649> mean<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:09.860> was<00:02:10.009> young<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.489> was<00:02:11.150> 19

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
remember it I mean I was young I was 19

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.020 
remember it I mean I was young I was 19
so<00:02:12.170> it's<00:02:12.530> trying<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.830> trying<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.760> remember

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
so it's trying to trying to remember

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.900 
so it's trying to trying to remember
what<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.450> honks<00:02:14.860> wearing<00:02:15.860> stuff<00:02:16.130> but<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.340> yeah

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
what the honks wearing stuff but so yeah

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.360 
what the honks wearing stuff but so yeah
that's<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.560> then<00:02:21.709> what<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.980> got<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.250> do

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
that's that so then what you got to do

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.819 
that's that so then what you got to do
is<00:02:24.310> after<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.760> do<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:26.470> he's<00:02:27.470> going<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.650> have

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
is after you do that he's going to have

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.819 
is after you do that he's going to have
you<00:02:27.980> pull<00:02:28.190> over<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:29.350> he's<00:02:30.350> going<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.530> tell<00:02:30.680> you

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
you pull over and he's going to tell you

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.819 
you pull over and he's going to tell you
I<00:02:31.010> want<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.340> see<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.640> do<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.850> full<00:02:32.360> circle<00:02:32.829> full

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
I want to see you do a full circle full

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.920 
I want to see you do a full circle full
circle<00:02:34.610> going<00:02:34.820> left<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.269> full<00:02:35.480> circle<00:02:35.750> going

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
circle going left a full circle going

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.920 
circle going left a full circle going
right<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.320> a<00:02:36.380> figure<00:02:36.620> eight<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:38.150> pretty<00:02:38.780> much

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
right and a figure eight so pretty much

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.400 
right and a figure eight so pretty much
what<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.560> means<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.109> a<00:02:42.140> full<00:02:42.410> circle

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
what that means this is a full circle

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.220 
what that means this is a full circle
let<00:02:45.410> me<00:02:45.500> do<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.799> other<00:02:45.829> way<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.989> okay<00:02:47.989> so

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
let me do it the other way so okay so

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.870 
let me do it the other way so okay so
basically<00:02:49.010> what<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.340> did<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.640> went<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.850> a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
basically what I did is I went to a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.259 
basically what I did is I went to a
parking<00:02:50.269> lot<00:02:50.329> and<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:51.470> started<00:02:52.070> out<00:02:52.190> here<00:02:52.489> and

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
parking lot and I started out here and

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.780 
parking lot and I started out here and
you<00:02:53.420> come<00:02:53.630> across<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.160> turn<00:02:55.579> and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
you come across and you just turn and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.039 
you come across and you just turn and
you<00:02:55.880> try<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.120> stay<00:02:56.329> in<00:02:56.540> between<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:58.609> lines

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
you try to stay in between the lines

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.090 
you try to stay in between the lines
like<00:03:00.049> that<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:00.560> got<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.769> be<00:03:00.829> a<00:03:00.859> full

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
like that and it's got to be a full

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.569 
like that and it's got to be a full
circle<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:03.049> boom<00:03:03.440> you're<00:03:03.829> done<00:03:03.950> that's<00:03:04.340> one

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
circle and boom you're done that's one

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.900 
circle and boom you're done that's one
that's<00:03:04.820> circle<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.600> left

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
that's circle to the left

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.910 
that's circle to the left
oh<00:03:07.740> we<00:03:08.740> got<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.890> student<00:03:09.460> driver<00:03:09.760> coming<00:03:10.270> here

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.210 

that's<00:03:14.920> how<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.130> practice<00:03:15.580> for<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.530> now<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:18.100> do

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
that's how I practice for it now to do

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.460 
that's how I practice for it now to do
it<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.550> right<00:03:18.960> pretty<00:03:19.960> much<00:03:20.050> all<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.320> do

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
it to the right pretty much all you do

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.600 
it to the right pretty much all you do
is<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.620> just<00:03:20.740> kind<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:20.980> pull<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.340> your<00:03:21.460> cuts

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
is you just kind of pull in your cuts

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.370 
is you just kind of pull in your cuts
you<00:03:21.760> kind<00:03:21.940> of<00:03:22.000> half<00:03:22.150> clutch<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.570> out<00:03:22.720> when<00:03:23.320> you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
you kind of half clutch it out when you

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.200 
you kind of half clutch it out when you
want<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.560> make<00:03:23.710> the<00:03:23.800> turn<00:03:24.010> all<00:03:24.700> right<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.090> now

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
want to make the turn all right so now

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.030 
want to make the turn all right so now
you<00:03:25.540> do<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> same<00:03:25.930> thing<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.680> right<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:26.950> got

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
you do the same thing the right you got

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.920 
you do the same thing the right you got
to<00:03:27.130> do<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> full<00:03:27.610> complete<00:03:28.180> circle<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.690> try

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
to do a full complete circle and I try

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.540 
to do a full complete circle and I try
to<00:03:28.960> stay<00:03:29.110> in<00:03:29.380> between<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.710> parking<00:03:30.100> lot<00:03:30.250> space

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
to stay in between the parking lot space

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.960 
to stay in between the parking lot space
so<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.510> come<00:03:31.690> up<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:36.370> just<00:03:36.580> kind

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
so you come up like this you just kind

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.050 
so you come up like this you just kind
of<00:03:37.030> turn<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.510> kind<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.470> keep<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.830> keep<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.310> give

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
of turn it kind of keep it keep it give

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.610 
of turn it kind of keep it keep it give
it<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.240> little<00:03:40.360> gas<00:03:40.570> straighten<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.500> out<00:03:41.560> a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
it a little gas straighten it out a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.720 
it a little gas straighten it out a
little<00:03:41.770> bit<00:03:42.010> turn<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.790> little<00:03:42.970> bit<00:03:43.120> more<00:03:44.730> there

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
little bit turn a little bit more there

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.240 
little bit turn a little bit more there
you<00:03:45.850> go<00:03:45.970> there's<00:03:46.720> your<00:03:46.840> right-hand<00:03:47.230> turn<00:03:47.620> so

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
you go there's your right-hand turn so

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.310 
you go there's your right-hand turn so
now<00:03:48.400> after<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:49.270> have<00:03:49.480> completed<00:03:49.630> those<00:03:50.080> and

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
now after you have completed those and

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.790 
now after you have completed those and
he<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.620> happy<00:03:51.220> with<00:03:51.450> those<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:53.140> have<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.350> do<00:03:53.560> a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
he is happy with those you have to do a

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.180 
he is happy with those you have to do a
figure<00:03:54.340> eight<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.870> was<00:03:56.200> probably<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.680> thought

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
figure eight this was probably I thought

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.500 
figure eight this was probably I thought
the<00:03:57.310> easiest<00:03:57.460> I<00:03:57.790> thought<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.090> full<00:03:58.270> turns

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
the easiest I thought the full turns

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.110 
the easiest I thought the full turns
were<00:03:58.720> kind<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:58.960> hard<00:03:59.400> but<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.460> did<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> sign<00:04:00.940> on<00:04:00.970> a

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
were kind of hard but I did a sign on a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.910 
were kind of hard but I did a sign on a
dual<00:04:01.360> sport<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.050> gearing<00:04:02.470> was<00:04:02.680> kind<00:04:02.860> of

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
dual sport and the gearing was kind of

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.920 
dual sport and the gearing was kind of
choppy<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.460> this<00:04:03.610> makes<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.940> lot<00:04:04.030> nicer<00:04:04.240> but

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
choppy so this makes a lot nicer but

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.370 
choppy so this makes a lot nicer but
when<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.140> do<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.290> figure<00:04:05.530> eight<00:04:05.710> just<00:04:07.380> alright

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
when you do a figure eight just alright

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
can you can get it no problem it's

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.820 
can you can get it no problem it's
pretty<00:04:44.190> easy<00:04:44.340> stuff<00:04:44.699> just<00:04:45.690> like<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.229> said<00:04:46.289> go<00:04:46.770> to

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
pretty easy stuff just like I said go to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.059 
pretty easy stuff just like I said go to
a<00:04:46.919> parking<00:04:47.340> lot<00:04:47.580> practice<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.620> give<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.800> try

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
a parking lot practice it give it a try

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.430 
a parking lot practice it give it a try
just<00:04:50.430> try<00:04:50.759> to<00:04:50.879> stay<00:04:51.090> between<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.479> space<00:04:52.259> that

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
just try to stay between the space that

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.559 
just try to stay between the space that
cars<00:04:52.680> drive<00:04:52.979> for<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.250> parking<00:04:53.669> lot<00:04:53.819> that's

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
cars drive for the parking lot that's

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.240 
cars drive for the parking lot that's
that's<00:04:54.960> what<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.139> how<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.470> practice<00:04:55.860> for<00:04:56.190> it

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
that's what I how I practice for it

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.740 
that's what I how I practice for it
because<00:04:56.370> then<00:04:56.550> what<00:04:57.120> they<00:04:57.240> do<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.449> they<00:04:57.569> take

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
because then what they do is they take

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.930 
because then what they do is they take
you<00:04:57.930> on<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> big<00:04:58.409> road<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.129> the<00:04:59.190> roads<00:04:59.430> wider

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
you on a big road and the roads wider

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.119 
you on a big road and the roads wider
than<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:00.750> pullin<00:05:01.169> section<00:05:01.560> right<00:05:01.710> here<00:05:01.740> so

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
than this pullin section right here so

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.529 
than this pullin section right here so
you<00:05:02.490> have<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.669> huge<00:05:02.969> amount<00:05:03.090> but<00:05:03.389> if<00:05:03.449> you

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
you have a huge amount but if you

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.950 
you have a huge amount but if you
practice<00:05:03.750> on<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.139> on<00:05:04.469> a<00:05:04.770> smaller<00:05:05.490> area<00:05:05.960> that

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
practice on a on a smaller area that

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.200 
practice on a on a smaller area that
when<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.710> go<00:05:07.889> to<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.069> actual<00:05:08.219> big<00:05:08.580> areas<00:05:08.940> it's

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
when you go to the actual big areas it's

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.119 
when you go to the actual big areas it's
like<00:05:09.539> it's<00:05:09.840> like<00:05:09.930> cake<00:05:10.259> it's<00:05:10.530> like<00:05:10.710> easy<00:05:10.919> you

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
know you get all this room to do it and

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.189 
know you get all this room to do it and
it<00:05:14.129> makes<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.490> really<00:05:14.610> easy<00:05:14.780> other<00:05:15.780> than<00:05:16.050> that

here<00:05:49.469> it's<00:05:49.650> an<00:05:49.740> automatic<00:05:50.219> failure<00:05:50.460> so<00:05:50.849> just

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
here it's an automatic failure so just

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.300 
here it's an automatic failure so just
really<00:05:51.659> practice<00:05:52.199> if<00:05:52.349> you<00:05:52.440> have<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:52.830> start<00:05:53.130> off

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
really practice if you have to start off

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.610 
really practice if you have to start off
wide<00:05:53.669> and<00:05:54.029> as<00:05:54.719> you<00:05:54.870> get<00:05:54.990> more<00:05:55.110> comfortable<00:05:55.319> the

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
wide and as you get more comfortable the

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.709 
wide and as you get more comfortable the
bike<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:55.979> can<00:05:56.159> narrow<00:05:56.759> it<00:05:56.909> narrow<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.479> turns

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
bike you can narrow it narrow the turns

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:59.689 
bike you can narrow it narrow the turns
down<00:05:58.020> until<00:05:58.409> I<00:05:58.590> mean<00:05:59.009> you<00:05:59.250> could<00:05:59.400> be<00:05:59.490> like

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
down until I mean you could be like

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.309 
down until I mean you could be like
stunt<00:06:00.090> guys<00:06:00.300> and<00:06:00.599> you<00:06:00.659> could<00:06:00.779> have<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:00.960> spinning

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
stunt guys and you could have a spinning

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.640 
stunt guys and you could have a spinning
circle<00:06:02.069> nah<00:06:02.340> I<00:06:02.669> don't<00:06:03.029> do<00:06:03.150> that<00:06:03.389> but<00:06:03.930> just

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
circle nah I don't do that but just

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.800
