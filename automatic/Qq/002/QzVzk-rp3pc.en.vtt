00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.050
 road safety is important for 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.559
 everyone including for small ones 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.560
 passengers during the international test 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.779
 adac together with clarine's pin we 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.340
 tested 28 child car seats 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.070
 most of our trials are based 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:32.110
 on existing standards for example 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.790
 frontal collision we conduct by 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.320
 analogies with the obligatory test for 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.360
 certification car seats 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.500
 however do it at a higher 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.110
 speeds beyond that we always experience 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.940
 baby car seats and side impact a 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.890
 according to new standards such 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.190
 the test becomes mandatory already 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.810
 with certification we also check 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.270
 how comfortable the chair is to use 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.860
 and service and assess risk 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.060
 wrong installation of the chair in 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.920
 car since 2011 we are checking 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.619
 car seats and the maintenance of harmful 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 substances for this we take samples from 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.979
 plating and analysis in the laboratory 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.409
 based on the results of all these checks 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:19.659
 adac final grade calculated 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.300
 This test 18 seats received total 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.549
 rating is good rating is very good 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.979
 got the only child car seat 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.110
 recaro previa with isofix base 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.100
 it is not only easy and reliable but also 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.150
 easy to use did not pass the test 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.979
 chair about father design risus 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.900
 this chair does not meet the requirements 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.640
 in frontal and side collisions 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.740
 the test also shows that the content 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.520
 harmful substances in chairs in general has become 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.979
 below at the beginning of the test we checked the chair 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.200
 Type A and says this model has passed 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.409
 certification for the new European 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.939
 standard number 129 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.700
 since last summer there 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.200
 new european standard number 129 in 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.450
 regarding child seats 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.509
 it acts in parallel with the already known 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.849
 standards number 44 new so-called 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.650
 and the rate and says we can learn about this 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.970
 character 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.249
 if such a character is placed as 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.720
 child seat and in the car they 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:24.080
 fully compatible 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.540
 but the stand with the new one is also something that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.180
 children under 15 months should sit in this 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.010
 chair against the movement of the car is 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.740
 mean that only older children can 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.510
 look ahead 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.220
 adac advises when buying a new chair 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.440

 to operate and fasten properly 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.250
 baby during each trip 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.870
 be careful with cheap or ex 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.090
 used car seat me 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.980
