massive amount of camera on the nose and
tail<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.980> provides<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.610> lot<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.059> pop<00:00:57.300> when

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
tail really provides a lot of pop when

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
tail really provides a lot of pop when
you<00:00:57.660> want<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> ollie<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> provides<00:00:58.829> tons

to<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:14.970> there's<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.320> fluctuating<00:01:16.320> kind<00:01:16.619> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to now there's a fluctuating kind of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
to now there's a fluctuating kind of
fluctuates<00:01:17.340> between<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.700> 5<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> 7<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> shorter

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
fluctuates between a 5 and 7 the shorter

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
fluctuates between a 5 and 7 the shorter
versions<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> radish<00:01:20.310> choice<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.759> gonna

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
versions of the radish choice are gonna

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.450 
versions of the radish choice are gonna
have<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> 5<00:01:21.930> flex<00:01:22.259> rating<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
have a about a 5 flex rating and the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
have a about a 5 flex rating and the
taller<00:01:23.759> versions<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> longer<00:01:24.930> versions

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
taller versions or the longer versions

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.300 
taller versions or the longer versions
will<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.439> about<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> 7

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
will have about a 7

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.429 
will have about a 7
now<00:01:26.759> overall<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> whole<00:01:28.140> line

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
now overall I think the whole line

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.700 
now overall I think the whole line
probably<00:01:28.950> has<00:01:29.400> about<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.270> 6<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.990> seems<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
probably has about a 6 it seems to be a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
probably has about a 6 it seems to be a
really<00:01:32.100> snappy<00:01:32.520> board<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:34.020> that's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
really snappy board and I think that's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.179 
really snappy board and I think that's
because<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.939> asymmetrical<00:01:36.770> ap1<00:01:37.770> wood

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
because of the asymmetrical ap1 wood

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.100 
because of the asymmetrical ap1 wood
core<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:38.759> inside<00:01:39.150> that's<00:01:39.390> Aspen<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
core that's inside that's Aspen and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.440 
core that's inside that's Aspen and
Polonia<00:01:40.950> wood<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.790> reason<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> there

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
Polonia wood and the reason that there

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.910 
Polonia wood and the reason that there
is<00:01:42.509> an<00:01:42.630> asymmetrical<00:01:43.200> wood<00:01:43.380> core<00:01:43.649> there's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
is an asymmetrical wood core there's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.490 
is an asymmetrical wood core there's
softer<00:01:44.490> or<00:01:44.520> harder<00:01:44.700> woods<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.360> each<00:01:45.899> rail<00:01:46.229> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
softer or harder woods on each rail is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.289 
softer or harder woods on each rail is
because<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.280> board<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.759> has<00:01:48.119> an

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
because the board actually has an

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.389 
because the board actually has an
asymmetrical<00:01:49.020> shape<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:50.009> means<00:01:50.220> there's

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
asymmetrical shape that means there's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.190 
asymmetrical shape that means there's
actually<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.030> heel<00:01:51.600> side<00:01:51.810> edge<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
actually just one heel side edge and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.740 
actually just one heel side edge and
there's<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:52.829> toe<00:01:53.130> side<00:01:53.430> edge<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.420> heel<00:01:54.600> side

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
there's one toe side edge the heel side

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.179 
there's one toe side edge the heel side
edge<00:01:54.810> actually<00:01:55.140> has<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> tighter<00:01:55.860> sidecut

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
edge actually has a tighter sidecut

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.429 
edge actually has a tighter sidecut
radius<00:01:56.610> than<00:01:56.909> toe<00:01:57.119> side<00:01:57.360> edge<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.170> are

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
radius than toe side edge so if you are

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.080 
radius than toe side edge so if you are
a<00:01:58.740> regular<00:01:58.979> footed<00:01:59.310> rider<00:01:59.549> you're<00:01:59.790> gonna<00:01:59.880> ride

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
a regular footed rider you're gonna ride

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.940 
a regular footed rider you're gonna ride
the<00:02:00.240> deck<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> direction<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> roofy

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the deck that direction and if you roofy

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.800 
the deck that direction and if you roofy
footed<00:02:02.219> rider<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:02.880> gonna<00:02:03.030> ride<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
footed rider you're gonna ride it that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.560 
footed rider you're gonna ride it that
way<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.259> that's<00:02:04.530> because<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.850> your<00:02:06.240> body's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
way and that's because the your body's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.719 
way and that's because the your body's
designed<00:02:06.960> asymmetrically<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.190> take<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
designed asymmetrically like you take it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
designed asymmetrically like you take it
takes<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.149> different<00:02:09.569> muscles<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.110> get<00:02:10.200> on

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
takes a lot different muscles to get on

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.080 
takes a lot different muscles to get on
your<00:02:10.470> toe<00:02:10.619> side<00:02:10.770> edge<00:02:10.830> than<00:02:11.400> does<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.849> get<00:02:11.940> on

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
your toe side edge than does to get on

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.490 
your toe side edge than does to get on
your<00:02:12.209> heel<00:02:12.450> side<00:02:12.660> edge

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
your heel side edge

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.050 
your heel side edge
with<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> tighter<00:02:13.980> sidecut<00:02:14.280> radius<00:02:14.790> you'll<00:02:14.940> be

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
with a tighter sidecut radius you'll be

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.580 
with a tighter sidecut radius you'll be
able<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.270> rip<00:02:15.510> those<00:02:15.690> heel<00:02:15.870> side<00:02:16.080> turns<00:02:16.110> with

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
able to rip those heel side turns with

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.590 
able to rip those heel side turns with
no<00:02:16.920> problem<00:02:17.370> whatsoever

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
no problem whatsoever

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.230 
no problem whatsoever
of<00:02:19.110> course<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> decks<00:02:19.770> gonna<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.400> man

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
of course the decks gonna have a man

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.290 
of course the decks gonna have a man
attraction<00:02:21.920> edges<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.310> are<00:02:23.370> serrated<00:02:24.060> knife

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
attraction edges that are serrated knife

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.390 
attraction edges that are serrated knife
like<00:02:24.540> edges<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.020> bite<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.980> hard<00:02:26.070> on

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
like edges that bite down really hard on

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.820 
like edges that bite down really hard on
snow<00:02:26.760> if<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.020> read<00:02:28.140> from<00:02:28.380> stone<00:02:28.680> like

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
snow if you if you read from stone like

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.650 
snow if you if you read from stone like
I<00:02:28.920> do<00:02:28.980> here<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.550> Midwest<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
I do here in the Midwest the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.530 
I do here in the Midwest the
magnatraction<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> dream<00:02:31.830> come<00:02:31.860> true<00:02:32.540> if

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
magnatraction is a dream come true if

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.390 
magnatraction is a dream come true if
you<00:02:33.690> haven't<00:02:34.260> ridden<00:02:34.470> an<00:02:34.650> attraction<00:02:34.980> before

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
you haven't ridden an attraction before

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.790 
you haven't ridden an attraction before
I<00:02:35.430> highly<00:02:36.090> suggest<00:02:36.330> doing<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.200> one<00:02:37.650> other

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
I highly suggest doing it and one other

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.190 
I highly suggest doing it and one other
great<00:02:38.040> thing<00:02:38.250> about<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.880> edges<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
great thing about the edges is that the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.290 
great thing about the edges is that the
board<00:02:40.410> doesn't<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.830> 360<00:02:41.550> wrap<00:02:41.760> steel<00:02:42.120> edge

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
board doesn't have a 360 wrap steel edge

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.960 
board doesn't have a 360 wrap steel edge
the<00:02:43.110> edges<00:02:43.500> actually<00:02:43.680> end<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.520> past<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the edges actually end just past the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.490 
the edges actually end just past the
contact<00:02:45.510> points<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.990> board<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.440> it

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
contact points of the board and it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.199 
contact points of the board and it
reduces<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.160> overall<00:02:47.580> amount<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:48.030> weight

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
reduces the overall amount of weight

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.270 
reduces the overall amount of weight
that<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.540> board<00:02:48.780> will<00:02:48.930> actually<00:02:48.990> have<00:02:49.590> now

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
that the board will actually have now

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.010 
that the board will actually have now
the<00:02:50.340> riders<00:02:50.670> choice<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.420> beefy<00:02:51.810> jack

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
the riders choice is a is a beefy jack

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.510 
the riders choice is a is a beefy jack
you<00:02:52.200> know<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.680> strong<00:02:52.980> because<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
you know it's strong because of the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.160 
you know it's strong because of the
ultra-high<00:02:54.030> molecular<00:02:54.090> weighted<00:02:54.660> sidewall

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
ultra-high molecular weighted sidewall

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.740 
ultra-high molecular weighted sidewall
and<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:56.160> sandwich<00:02:56.490> construction<00:02:57.090> now<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
and the sandwich construction now the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.120 
and the sandwich construction now the
deck<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.050> gonna<00:02:58.230> stay<00:02:58.470> fast<00:02:58.680> because<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
deck is gonna stay fast because of the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.680 
deck is gonna stay fast because of the
sintered<00:02:59.490> base<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.970> course<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.420> gonna<00:03:00.540> be

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
sintered base of course it's gonna be

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.050 
sintered base of course it's gonna be
it's<00:03:01.590> gonna<00:03:01.680> absorb<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.130> lot<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.340> Wax<00:03:02.580> it's<00:03:02.940> a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
it's gonna absorb a lot of Wax it's a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.320 
it's gonna absorb a lot of Wax it's a
it's<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:04.080> die<00:03:04.260> cut<00:03:04.500> base<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.940> course<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
it's a die cut base so of course the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.690 
it's a die cut base so of course the
graphics<00:03:06.510> gonna<00:03:06.900> pop<00:03:07.140> but<00:03:07.770> um<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.340> know<00:03:08.400> other

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
graphics gonna pop but um you know other

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.910 
graphics gonna pop but um you know other
than<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.360> rad<00:03:09.810> looking<00:03:10.410> deck<00:03:10.680> and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
than that this is a rad looking deck and

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.820 
than that this is a rad looking deck and
it's<00:03:11.040> an<00:03:11.100> amazing<00:03:11.430> riding<00:03:12.060> deck<00:03:12.450> as<00:03:12.690> well<00:03:13.140> um

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
it's an amazing riding deck as well um

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.800 
it's an amazing riding deck as well um
the<00:03:14.459> reason<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.910> it's<00:03:15.120> won<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.600> many<00:03:15.690> awards

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
the reason that it's won so many awards

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.440 
the reason that it's won so many awards
is<00:03:16.200> because<00:03:16.500> well<00:03:16.770> it's<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.180> feels

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
is because well it's a it just feels

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.180 
is because well it's a it just feels
good<00:03:18.660> underneath<00:03:18.989> your<00:03:19.200> feet<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.860> if<00:03:20.010> you're<00:03:20.160> a
