00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.580 
compact semi-automated chicken-and-egg
bomb<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.460> created<00:00:09.080> there's<00:00:10.080> other<00:00:10.410> ones

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
bomb that I created there's other ones

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.589 
bomb that I created there's other ones
out<00:00:10.920> there<00:00:11.190> but<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.550> feel<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.120> one's<00:00:12.360> got<00:00:12.570> some

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
out there but I feel this one's got some

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.799 
out there but I feel this one's got some
benefits<00:00:13.349> over<00:00:13.559> those<00:00:13.820> this<00:00:14.820> one's<00:00:15.030> really

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
benefits over those this one's really

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.099 
benefits over those this one's really
compact<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.680> only<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.070> three<00:00:17.670> wide<00:00:17.970> by<00:00:18.779> five

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
compact it's only a three wide by five

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.120 
compact it's only a three wide by five
long<00:00:19.439> by<00:00:19.800> six<00:00:20.279> hi<00:00:21.260> it's<00:00:22.260> ty<00:00:22.439> label<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.100> you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
long by six hi it's ty label so you

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.370 
long by six hi it's ty label so you
could<00:00:23.539> basically<00:00:24.539> build<00:00:24.750> an<00:00:24.869> array<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.170> these

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
could basically build an array of these

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.189 
could basically build an array of these
next<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> each<00:00:25.949> other<00:00:26.220> side<00:00:26.550> by<00:00:26.760> side<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:28.080> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
next to each other side by side so that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.929 
next to each other side by side so that
you<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.470> improve<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:28.980> collection<00:00:29.460> time<00:00:29.730> if

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
you can improve your collection time if

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.470 
you can improve your collection time if
you<00:00:30.060> want

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you want

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.470 
you want

a clock when you flip this lever that's
gonna<00:01:21.840> dispense<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> eggs<00:01:22.740> out<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.850> you'll

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
gonna dispense the eggs out which you'll

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.969 
gonna dispense the eggs out which you'll
get<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> Chance<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.439> those<00:01:25.590> turning

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
get at one and a Chance of those turning

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.090 
get at one and a Chance of those turning
into<00:01:26.130> chicks<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.420> water<00:01:28.140> stream<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.860> will

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
into chicks the water stream here will

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
into chicks the water stream here will
carry<00:01:29.340> them<00:01:29.579> forward<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.180> fall<00:01:30.420> down<00:01:30.630> into

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
me show you how to build this thing

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.289 
me show you how to build this thing
pretty<00:03:22.440> simple<00:03:22.889> we're<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:23.910> going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.120> start

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
pretty simple we're just going to start

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.150 
pretty simple we're just going to start
off<00:03:24.419> by<00:03:24.480> placing<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:25.049> block<00:03:25.169> there<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:26.129> a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
off by placing a block there with a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.740 
off by placing a block there with a
lever<00:03:26.430> we'll<00:03:26.819> go<00:03:26.910> ahead<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.120> turn<00:03:27.419> that<00:03:27.690> off

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
lever we'll go ahead and turn that off

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.250 
lever we'll go ahead and turn that off
for<00:03:28.139> now<00:03:28.459> torch<00:03:29.459> on<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.790> side<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.419> with<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
for now torch on the side of that with a

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.050 
for now torch on the side of that with a
repeater<00:03:32.389> going<00:03:33.389> into<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> block<00:03:34.049> here<00:03:34.470> and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
repeater going into a block here and

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.920 
repeater going into a block here and
then<00:03:36.060> we're<00:03:36.209> going<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.359> place<00:03:36.540> some<00:03:36.569> redstone

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
then we're going to place some redstone

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.800 
then we're going to place some redstone
dust<00:03:37.440> right<00:03:37.859> next<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.220> block<00:03:38.810> turn

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
dust right next to that block turn

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.719 
dust right next to that block turn
around<00:03:40.109> face<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> repeater<00:03:40.949> back<00:03:41.220> into<00:03:41.549> the

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
around face a repeater back into the

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:45.170 
around face a repeater back into the
block<00:03:41.970> with<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.349> lever<00:03:43.349> on<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.680> give<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.430> two

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
block with the lever on it give it a two

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.740 
block with the lever on it give it a two
tick<00:03:45.419> delay<00:03:47.000> okay<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.180> that's<00:03:48.419> gonna

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
tick delay okay and that's gonna

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.559 
tick delay okay and that's gonna
basically<00:03:48.989> just<00:03:49.379> create<00:03:49.709> your<00:03:49.739> clock<00:03:50.389> you<00:03:51.389> see

you know place that dispenser on top of

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.990 
you know place that dispenser on top of
that<00:04:12.620> torch<00:04:13.099> that's<00:04:13.310> on<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.580> side<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.790> that

that torch that's on the side of that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.960 
that torch that's on the side of that
block<00:04:14.650> can<00:04:15.650> be<00:04:15.799> a<00:04:15.829> bit<00:04:16.010> tricky<00:04:16.190> there<00:04:16.970> we<00:04:17.090> go

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
want to do on this block right here is

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:04.999 
want to do on this block right here is
put<00:04:56.039> a<00:04:56.069> sign<00:04:56.340> down<00:05:02.960> grab<00:05:03.960> your<00:05:04.199> water<00:05:04.500> bucket

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
put a sign down grab your water bucket

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.180 
put a sign down grab your water bucket
and<00:05:05.960> we'll<00:05:06.960> put<00:05:07.169> our<00:05:07.289> water<00:05:07.560> at<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.979> back

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
and we'll put our water at the back

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.920 
and we'll put our water at the back
there<00:05:08.520> right<00:05:08.759> in<00:05:08.909> front<00:05:08.970> of<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.360> dispenser

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
there right in front of the dispenser

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.600 
there right in front of the dispenser
and<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.740> sign<00:05:10.979> should<00:05:11.129> hold<00:05:11.370> it<00:05:11.490> from

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
and that sign should hold it from

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.100 
and that sign should hold it from
falling<00:05:11.819> down<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:13.639> then<00:05:14.639> we<00:05:14.729> can<00:05:14.880> put<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.210> roof

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
falling down and then we can put a roof

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.649 
falling down and then we can put a roof
on<00:05:16.349> that<00:05:16.740> just<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.550> make<00:05:17.729> sure<00:05:17.759> the<00:05:18.449> chicken

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
on that just to make sure the chicken

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.270 
on that just to make sure the chicken
doesn't<00:05:19.229> get<00:05:19.500> out<00:05:19.680> when<00:05:20.099> it's<00:05:20.250> fires<00:05:22.280> all

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
doesn't get out when it's fires all

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.860 
doesn't get out when it's fires all
right<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.699> then<00:05:23.909> we<00:05:24.030> can<00:05:24.180> test<00:05:24.389> that<00:05:24.539> real

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
right and then we can test that real

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.809 
right and then we can test that real
quick

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
quick

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.820 
quick
you<00:05:26.819> should<00:05:26.970> hear<00:05:27.240> your<00:05:27.500> dispenser<00:05:28.500> firing

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
you should hear your dispenser firing

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.040 
you should hear your dispenser firing
perfect<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:33.300> then<00:05:33.419> we're<00:05:33.539> just<00:05:33.569> gonna<00:05:33.719> create

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
perfect and then we're just gonna create

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:44.679 
perfect and then we're just gonna create
a<00:05:34.110> little<00:05:34.199> drop<00:05:34.650> for<00:05:35.190> these<00:05:35.340> guys<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:40.340> do<00:05:41.340> that

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.559 

okay<00:05:45.699> and<00:05:46.699> then<00:05:46.849> of<00:05:46.939> course<00:05:47.149> we're<00:05:47.299> gonna<00:05:47.389> have

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
okay and then of course we're gonna have

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.469 
okay and then of course we're gonna have
to<00:05:47.689> encase<00:05:47.989> this<00:05:48.259> and<00:05:48.589> before<00:05:49.069> we<00:05:49.219> do<00:05:49.489> get<00:05:50.360> in

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
to encase this and before we do get in

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:59.829 
to encase this and before we do get in
place<00:05:50.749> a<00:05:52.719> dispenser<00:05:53.719> right<00:05:56.199> there<00:05:58.629> okay<00:05:59.629> now

00:05:59.829 --> 00:05:59.839 
place a dispenser right there okay now

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:06.189 
place a dispenser right there okay now
look<00:06:00.259> at<00:06:00.409> the<00:06:00.499> case<00:06:00.679> it<00:06:00.889> all<00:06:01.039> the<00:06:01.189> way<00:06:05.019> there<00:06:06.019> we

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
look at the case it all the way there we

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:06.579 
look at the case it all the way there we
go

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
go

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:10.029 
go
so<00:06:07.219> now<00:06:07.399> there's<00:06:07.759> a<00:06:07.929> tube<00:06:08.929> basically<00:06:09.559> that

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
so now there's a tube basically that

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.919 
so now there's a tube basically that
they<00:06:10.189> fall<00:06:10.610> down<00:06:10.789> into<00:06:11.149> and<00:06:11.419> they<00:06:11.479> can't<00:06:11.749> get

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:11.929 
they fall down into and they can't get

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:15.999 
they fall down into and they can't get
out<00:06:12.039> you<00:06:13.039> can<00:06:13.159> see<00:06:13.339> them<00:06:13.459> through<00:06:13.610> there<00:06:15.009> and

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
out you can see them through there and

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.939 
out you can see them through there and
then<00:06:16.189> also<00:06:16.309> we<00:06:16.459> have<00:06:16.579> to<00:06:16.669> do<00:06:16.879> is<00:06:17.119> add<00:06:17.360> a

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
then also we have to do is add a

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.529 
then also we have to do is add a
redstone<00:06:18.949> torch<00:06:19.249> to<00:06:19.869> behind<00:06:20.869> this<00:06:21.019> dispenser

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
redstone torch to behind this dispenser

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.809 
redstone torch to behind this dispenser
and<00:06:23.539> we<00:06:23.719> can<00:06:23.869> then<00:06:24.050> put<00:06:24.319> our<00:06:24.529> lava<00:06:25.339> bucket<00:06:25.699> in

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:25.819 
and we can then put our lava bucket in

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:32.859 
and we can then put our lava bucket in
there<00:06:30.279> okay<00:06:31.279> and<00:06:31.519> then<00:06:32.360> just<00:06:32.569> to<00:06:32.629> put<00:06:32.779> a<00:06:32.809> button

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:32.869 
there okay and then just to put a button

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:34.600 
there okay and then just to put a button
below<00:06:33.349> that<00:06:33.469> and<00:06:33.949> we'll<00:06:34.129> test<00:06:34.369> that<00:06:34.579> out

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
below that and we'll test that out

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.350 
below that and we'll test that out
obvious<00:06:35.329> fit<00:06:35.689> out<00:06:35.839> and<00:06:36.079> suck<00:06:36.409> right<00:06:36.619> back<00:06:36.800> in

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
obvious fit out and suck right back in

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.259 
obvious fit out and suck right back in
that<00:06:38.360> seems<00:06:38.719> good<00:06:39.019> and<00:06:39.759> then<00:06:40.759> you'll<00:06:40.939> need<00:06:41.149> to

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:41.269 
that seems good and then you'll need to

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:46.449 
that seems good and then you'll need to
just<00:06:41.539> grab<00:06:41.809> yourself<00:06:42.759> some<00:06:43.759> chicken<00:06:44.239> eggs<00:06:45.459> put

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:46.459

just grab yourself some chicken eggs put
them<00:06:46.549> in<00:06:46.669> the<00:06:46.759> dispenser<00:06:47.299> here<00:06:48.129> and<00:06:49.129> we<00:06:49.339> will

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:49.519 
them in the dispenser here and we will

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:51.239 
them in the dispenser here and we will
turn<00:06:49.699> on<00:06:49.879> the<00:06:49.909> clock

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:51.249 
turn on the clock

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:55.049
