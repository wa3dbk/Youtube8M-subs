ready

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.470 

choose<00:01:00.070> one<00:01:01.110> proof<00:01:02.640> okay<00:01:03.670> these<00:01:04.180> night

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
choose one proof okay these night

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.390 
choose one proof okay these night
nothing<00:01:05.320> up<00:01:05.500> in<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:06.100> few<00:01:06.840> seconds<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:09.100> fire

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
nothing up in a few seconds on fire

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.140 
nothing up in a few seconds on fire
cause<00:01:09.790> I'm<00:01:09.940> dying

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:23.360 

all<00:01:13.600> right<00:01:15.510> takes<00:01:16.510> about<00:01:19.740> 117<00:01:21.090> blue<00:01:22.090> less<00:01:22.330> to

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
all right takes about 117 blue less to

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:49.580 
all right takes about 117 blue less to
cue<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.610> single<00:01:25.950> let's<00:01:26.950> test<00:01:27.160> it<00:01:27.340> again

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.510 

it<00:01:50.590> takes<00:01:51.130> less<00:01:51.660> ten<00:01:52.660> bullets<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:54.190> which<00:01:54.340> means

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
it takes less ten bullets so which means

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.510 
it takes less ten bullets so which means
do<00:01:54.820> you<00:01:54.910> need<00:01:55.210> one<00:01:55.930> minute<00:01:56.050> or<00:01:56.320> not<00:01:56.500> click<00:01:59.250> OK

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
do you need one minute or not click OK

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.960 
do you need one minute or not click OK
so<00:02:02.180> this<00:02:02.600> problem<00:02:03.049> is<00:02:03.350> enough<00:02:03.950> talk<00:02:04.579> to<00:02:04.820> me

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
so this problem is enough talk to me

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.780 
so this problem is enough talk to me
provide<00:02:05.360> proof<00:02:05.570> if<00:02:06.350> we<00:02:06.649> explode<00:02:07.189> I'll<00:02:07.490> take

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
provide proof if we explode I'll take

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.839 
provide proof if we explode I'll take
shit<00:02:08.149> too<00:02:08.360> much<00:02:08.630> of<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> let's<00:02:10.640> take<00:02:10.819> a

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
shit too much of that so let's take a

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.479 
shit too much of that so let's take a
look<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.900> next<00:02:12.230> weapon<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.709> got<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.860> tas<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.310> it

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
look the next weapon we got a tas of it

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.870 
look the next weapon we got a tas of it
and<00:02:16.489> now<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:18.319> next<00:02:18.590> weapon<00:02:18.769> we're<00:02:19.550> going<00:02:19.790> to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
and now the next weapon we're going to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.550 
and now the next weapon we're going to
test<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.450> yes<00:02:20.959> salt<00:02:21.349> shotgun<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:23.000> looks<00:02:23.239> cool

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.630 
okay let's go then okay I think I could
not<00:02:32.300> take<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.630> position<00:02:33.040> just<00:02:34.040> shooting<00:02:34.459> at

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
not take the position just shooting at

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.350

this car
thank<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:36.080> okay<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:38.060> ready<00:02:38.330> let's<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.560> this

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.089 

Watkins<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.409> I<00:02:54.219> just<00:02:54.609> used<00:02:54.879> for<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.629> flat<00:02:55.900> plate

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
Watkins and I just used for a flat plate

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.360 
Watkins and I just used for a flat plate
already

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
already

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.170 
already
all<00:02:57.549> effect<00:02:58.859> which<00:02:59.859> means<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.340> only<00:03:00.489> takes

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
all effect which means it only takes

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.110 
all effect which means it only takes
about<00:03:01.829> positive<00:03:02.829> for<00:03:03.189> normal<00:03:03.639> clips

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
about positive for normal clips

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.970 
about positive for normal clips
maybe<00:03:04.959> two<00:03:05.889> extended<00:03:06.700> clip<00:03:07.109> blow<00:03:08.109> up<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.500> single

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
maybe two extended clip blow up a single

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.809 
maybe two extended clip blow up a single
are<00:03:09.299> common<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.569> Roma<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.829> let's<00:03:12.549> try<00:03:12.760> this

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
are common to Roma so let's try this

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:13.259 
are common to Roma so let's try this
again

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
again

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.659 
again
just<00:03:13.689> like<00:03:13.930> what<00:03:14.409> I<00:03:14.439> did<00:03:14.560> with<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:15.310> counter

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
just like what I did with the counter

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:24.900 
just like what I did with the counter
end

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.880 

yeah<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.870> like<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.290> same

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:38.339 

around<00:03:29.790> 20<00:03:30.390> more<00:03:30.630> rounds

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.970 

so<00:03:39.349> far<00:03:39.620> I've<00:03:39.859> used<00:03:40.069> around<00:03:41.060> 14<00:03:41.810> -<00:03:42.739> that's

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
so far I've used around 14 - that's

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.370 
so far I've used around 14 - that's
already<00:03:43.159> and<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:45.109> on<00:03:45.349> fire

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
already and this is on fire

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.310 
already and this is on fire
which<00:03:48.220> means<00:03:48.490> is<00:03:49.000> quite<00:03:49.330> deadly<00:03:50.850> they<00:03:51.850> are

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
which means is quite deadly they are

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.710 
which means is quite deadly they are
gonna<00:03:53.320> even<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.970> sharp<00:03:55.300> thing<00:03:55.390> is<00:03:56.250> very<00:03:57.250> death

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
gonna even the sharp thing is very death

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.200 
gonna even the sharp thing is very death
even<00:03:58.720> it's<00:03:58.870> really<00:03:59.200> only<00:03:59.940> it's<00:04:00.940> got<00:04:01.090> to

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
even it's really only it's got to
