00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.300
 and we give you download everything 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.510
 we open it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.330
 I believe I will tell you that you do not give 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.100
 yes 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.810
 after they have downloaded it 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.810
 take to your folder 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.170
 all right 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.170
 in one case on the disk 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.340
 here 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.070
 we have the image 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.790
 in leaving in the heap of the description 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.320
 of the video so they can mount slogans 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.680
 virtual devices discs on discs 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.680
 in a bunch 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.710
 and looking do not have the image 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.339
 and as they say from a record of 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.339
 but not now 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.750
 the give adjusts to the author 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.309
 this has not changed 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.309
 [Music] 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.320
 here I will leave a page 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.320
 where they are inferior 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.920
 not only that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.119
 and in a new establishment 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.430
 but they have to copy 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.130
 we go 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.590
 for me 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.090
 well this must be a trick and fast 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.090
