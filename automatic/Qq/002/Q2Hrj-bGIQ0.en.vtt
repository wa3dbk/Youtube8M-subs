00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
what do you think is the single most

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.360 
what do you think is the single most
important<00:02:38.670> asset<00:02:39.209> or<00:02:39.870> advantage<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
important asset or advantage that the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.610 
important asset or advantage that the
Philippines<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:42.030> capitalize<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.500> know

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
Philippines can capitalize on you know

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.400 
Philippines can capitalize on you know
in<00:02:43.830> further<00:02:44.760> growing<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.450> BPO<00:02:45.750> industry<00:02:45.810> here

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
in further growing the BPO industry here

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.509 
in further growing the BPO industry here
I<00:02:47.310> think<00:02:48.299> probably<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.530> most<00:02:50.070> important

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
I think probably the most important

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.150 
I think probably the most important
thing<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:50.959> not<00:02:51.959> necessarily<00:02:52.079> an<00:02:52.560> asset<00:02:52.950> there

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
thing of not necessarily an asset there

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.690 
thing of not necessarily an asset there
maybe<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.200> attitude<00:02:55.250> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
maybe just the attitude and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.770 
maybe just the attitude and
parrot<00:02:57.390> nests<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:58.200> change<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.280> look<00:02:59.910> at<00:03:00.120> new

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
parrot nests to change and look at new

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.559 
parrot nests to change and look at new
industries<00:03:01.379> ago<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.069> think<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:03.000> know<00:03:03.120> where<00:03:03.360> as

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
industries ago I think you know where as

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.530 
industries ago I think you know where as
places<00:03:04.379> like<00:03:04.410> South<00:03:04.860> Africa<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.849> been<00:03:06.180> kind

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
places like South Africa have been kind

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.390 
places like South Africa have been kind
of<00:03:06.690> they've<00:03:07.620> developed<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.160> sort<00:03:08.340> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
of they've developed a sort of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.580 
of they've developed a sort of

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.750 
want to do it you know I think India has
really<00:04:00.390> mastered<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.049> art<00:04:01.079> of<00:04:01.760> software

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
really mastered the art of software

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.940 
really mastered the art of software
development<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.420> know<00:04:03.510> remote<00:04:03.840> delivery<00:04:04.410> of

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
development you know remote delivery of

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.370 
development you know remote delivery of
application<00:04:05.639> development<00:04:05.670> okay<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.260> I

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
application development okay and and I

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.470 
application development okay and and I
don't<00:04:07.440> see<00:04:07.889> the<00:04:08.250> Philippines<00:04:08.730> really<00:04:09.120> kind<00:04:09.359> of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
don't see the Philippines really kind of

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.180 
don't see the Philippines really kind of
going<00:04:09.900> down<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.380> route<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.920> know<00:04:11.069> it

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
going down that route you know it

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.400 
going down that route you know it
definitely<00:04:11.519> seems<00:04:11.730> much<00:04:11.940> more<00:04:12.180> focused<00:04:12.569> on<00:04:12.690> IT

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
definitely seems much more focused on IT

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.789 
definitely seems much more focused on IT
enabled<00:04:14.069> services<00:04:14.790> here

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
enabled services here

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.099 
enabled services here
so<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:17.060> know<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.180> don't<00:04:17.419> think<00:04:17.479> that<00:04:17.690> number

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
so you know I don't think that number

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.930 
so you know I don't think that number
one<00:04:18.139> you<00:04:18.470> need<00:04:18.979> to<00:04:19.100> compare<00:04:19.489> yourself<00:04:19.639> to

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
one you need to compare yourself to

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.730 
one you need to compare yourself to
India<00:04:20.389> yes<00:04:20.720> but<00:04:21.350> secondly<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:24.320> be<00:04:24.440> able<00:04:24.530> to

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
India yes but secondly to be able to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.510 
India yes but secondly to be able to
capture<00:04:25.009> some<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.520> that<00:04:25.639> global<00:04:26.270> BPO<00:04:26.870> market

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
capture some of that global BPO market

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.499 
capture some of that global BPO market
it's<00:04:28.520> definitely<00:04:29.120> feasible<00:04:29.300> because<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.930> think

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
it's definitely feasible because I think

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.730 
it's definitely feasible because I think
you<00:04:32.509> know<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.690> experience<00:04:33.169> of<00:04:33.320> talking<00:04:33.500> to

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.469 
you know the experience of talking to
some<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:34.009> the<00:04:34.070> Philippine<00:04:34.490> companies<00:04:34.970> over

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
some of the Philippine companies over

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.570 
some of the Philippine companies over
the<00:04:35.570> past<00:04:35.810> couple<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.139> days<00:04:36.289> has<00:04:36.830> been<00:04:36.860> you

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the past couple of days has been you

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.189 
the past couple of days has been you

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
by some of them so you know I think that

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.900 
by some of them so you know I think that
if<00:04:41.870> they<00:04:42.020> can<00:04:42.050> just<00:04:42.199> raise<00:04:42.590> their<00:04:43.009> brand
