 I take the goalie of half exit and as 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.500
 you see the typical fouls of fifa the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.500
 goalkeeper would stay half out 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.300
 uy that center 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.300
 down 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.720
 well come on guys a corner is coming 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.720

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.490
 uy what closed what a bad company very bad 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.490
 and company 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.209
 and mikel goal another play has 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.340
 stayed and only the truth is that it is 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.690
 playing very well he and I am playing 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.700
 pretty bad the truth is not going to me 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.220
 very well the players notice them as very 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 slow at the time of giving the passes and everything 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.580
 that is also that the one who is playing 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.470
 well not but I'm very, very slow to the 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.569
 time to make the plays and all that 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.100
 to turn around and all that about 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.840
 all noticing much with omen about 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.280
 everything that I do a lot of play to give me 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.270
 the return with water and such and I notice it as 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.270
 very slow to turn around 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.750
 good guys ends the second part or 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.430
 be the first part sorry the truth is 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.080
 I'm playing pretty bad, you see 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.400
 that I did not throw anything at the door I had a 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.880
 little more position but throws very little 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.230
 to door 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.550
 well I have not thrown basically though 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.740
 good if you strip any shot because he has 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.330
 there were several a couple of corners and everything 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.250
 that but good the game already you know that to 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.510
 Sometimes, mark what you want to mark is 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.920
 for example he has thrown a lot more than 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.930
 four times but good you're not me 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.130
 doing a good game as I say do not 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.110
 It goes great player he is 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.580
 playing better than me is noticing and 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.380
 we can try to see if in the second 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.500
 in the second time we can do 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.120
 Anything more than one we're going to give you 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.930
 to see how 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.930
 Let's go there 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.570
 my mother I do not lack today bases what 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.570
 they remove and lack that you do not know either 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.729
 it's a bit far to throw away I'm going to 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.729
 make the play to see if I get 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.710
 for the game out of play that happened 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.300
 many times he stays and goes in said 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.690
 the player tries to get the pass but 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.050
 He can not but it's a good move that's 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.410
 a pretty good move that usually 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.410
 work pretty 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.119
 I've already toured very weak very weak 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:52.949
 weakly follows to throw there to break that 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:54.389
 I just wanted to throw to break the 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.749
 I would have done something else but it pulls very 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.749
 weak 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:02.319
 let's go balls and let's go to them and honey there 

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.969
 it is done is that where it was said 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.439
 I had to have changed it to the 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.589
 right and you have gotten in there with the 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:10.780
 inside too but good nothing happens 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:14.070
 It has been my mistake and the truth 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.070
 same gives my defense 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.319
 come on yesterday or what a bad 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.599
 worth a lamb we are going to perform for 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.400
 that does not mark us of corners that already 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.460
 you know that the cuts are pretty 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.430
 sitting this year 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.889
 a game and ruth and it's worth a good stop 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.389
 courtois let's do it again it's going to 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.800
 make that play that this girl is already 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.880
 you know that I have a tutorial where 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.850
 see the front voucher 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.529
 and front and another corner that weighed with 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.270
 the balls over there 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.849
 good does not happen na 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.320
 now yes side time to center 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.000
 worthless 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.810
 very good match the truth is that 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.730
 pretty good match of mikel 20 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.130
 I think he's played a lot better than me 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.620
 this game the truth I think the 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.120
 first part played very well the 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.010
 second I have improved and a little has 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.350
 some times not many but they have 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.860
 some and well, that sums up a 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.590
 good level match I think mikel 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.870
 it's a good level 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.460
 and that I could have won in this 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.930
 party like I can win another match 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.820
 if I play against him I think there's a 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.470
 good level between the two and that nothing that 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.030
 go through your channel leave them your 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.010
 like leave a comment telling him 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.510
 what fellaini will catch you another day and 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.190
 nothing guys that we see in another video 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.190
 so it's worth nothing alone and goodbye
