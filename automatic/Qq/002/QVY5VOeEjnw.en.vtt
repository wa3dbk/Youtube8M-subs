00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
easy for you guys to do but for me I had

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.769 
easy for you guys to do but for me I had
trial<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.680> error<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.580> had<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.970> try<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.300> over

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
trial and error and I had to try it over

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
and over to finally get it right and I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.870 
and over to finally get it right and I
guess<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.380> wasn't<00:00:31.710> too<00:00:32.099> patient<00:00:32.340> enough

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
guess I just wasn't too patient enough

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.870 
guess I just wasn't too patient enough
you<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.170> far<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.680> blending<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you know as far as blending all the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.340 
you know as far as blending all the
ingredients<00:00:36.000> together<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:36.960> waiting<00:00:37.290> on

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
ingredients together and just waiting on

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.049 
ingredients together and just waiting on
it<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:38.600> get<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> little<00:00:39.960> bit<00:00:40.079> thicker<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.850> first

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
it to get a little bit thicker the first

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.910 
it to get a little bit thicker the first
time<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.390> asked<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> try<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:42.920> buttercream

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
time I asked to try this buttercream

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.740 
time I asked to try this buttercream
recipe<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:45.649> didn't<00:00:46.649> melt<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> sugar<00:00:47.750> long

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
recipe I didn't melt the sugar long

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.549 
recipe I didn't melt the sugar long
enough<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.449> came<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.840> soupy<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
enough so you know it came out soupy and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.529 
enough so you know it came out soupy and
then<00:00:53.039> after<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.910> could<00:00:54.090> taste<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
then after that you could taste the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.380 
then after that you could taste the
sugar<00:00:55.530> grains<00:00:55.890> inside<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> buttercream

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
sugar grains inside of the buttercream

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.580 
sugar grains inside of the buttercream
which<00:00:57.600> wasn't<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:59.390> Pleasant<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.989> gave

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
which wasn't really Pleasant so I gave

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.310 
which wasn't really Pleasant so I gave
it<00:01:01.920> another<00:01:02.190> try<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.080> actually

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
it another try and this one actually

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.730 
it another try and this one actually
seemed<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:06.090> wasn't<00:01:06.450> gonna<00:01:06.900> pull<00:01:07.260> through

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
seemed like it wasn't gonna pull through

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.920 
seemed like it wasn't gonna pull through
because<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.670> butter<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.450> egg<00:01:09.540> whites

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
because the butter and the egg whites

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.070 
because the butter and the egg whites
and<00:01:10.020> sugar<00:01:10.170> star<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.860> kind<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.220> separate<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
and sugar star just kind of separate and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.810 
and sugar star just kind of separate and
I<00:01:13.080> was<00:01:13.229> losing<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.710> hope<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.729> was

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
I was losing all hope but then I was

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
I was losing all hope but then I was
like<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.299> better<00:01:15.509> stick<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.049> it
