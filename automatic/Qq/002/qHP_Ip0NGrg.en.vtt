to the table and I really enjoyed that
program<00:03:49.360> actually<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:49.840> mean<00:03:50.080> it's<00:03:50.290> my<00:03:50.440> first

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
program actually I mean it's my first

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.920 
program actually I mean it's my first
time<00:03:50.920> seeing<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.549> have<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.940> really<00:03:52.540> commend

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.990

the<00:03:53.080> authenticity<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.040> choreography<00:03:54.760> I

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
the authenticity of the choreography I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.050 
the authenticity of the choreography I
think<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:56.260> particular<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:57.549> stationary

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
think in particular the stationary

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.770 
think in particular the stationary
sections<00:03:58.480> were<00:03:58.660> very<00:03:58.930> effective<00:04:00.390> but<00:04:01.390> more<00:04:01.599> so

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
sections were very effective but more so

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.170 
sections were very effective but more so
than<00:04:01.930> ever<00:04:02.019> these<00:04:02.290> two<00:04:02.530> can<00:04:02.769> really<00:04:03.190> have<00:04:04.150> a

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
than ever these two can really have a

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.990 
than ever these two can really have a
story<00:04:04.510> they<00:04:05.230> can<00:04:05.410> really<00:04:05.709> carry<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:06.099> themes<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
story they can really carry a themes and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.220 
story they can really carry a themes and
they're<00:04:07.180> very<00:04:07.420> committed<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:08.079> their

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
they're very committed to their

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.110 
they're very committed to their
characters<00:04:08.709> whatever<00:04:08.980> they<00:04:09.340> might<00:04:09.519> be<00:04:09.760> so

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
characters whatever they might be so

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.240 
characters whatever they might be so
they<00:04:10.690> certainly<00:04:10.930> haven't<00:04:11.379> lost<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.769> quality

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
they certainly haven't lost that quality

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.100 
they certainly haven't lost that quality
through<00:04:12.849> their<00:04:13.090> technique<00:04:13.480> continues<00:04:13.930> to

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
take a look here at this opening puzzle

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.740 
take a look here at this opening puzzle
sequence<00:04:41.720> a<00:04:42.610> little<00:04:43.610> bit<00:04:43.760> scratchy<00:04:44.090> from<00:04:44.420> Luca

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
sequence a little bit scratchy from Luca

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.210 
sequence a little bit scratchy from Luca
again<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.110> see<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.380> snow<00:04:45.560> flying<00:04:45.830> a<00:04:45.980> little

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
again you see the snow flying a little

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.370 
again you see the snow flying a little
bit<00:04:46.370> but<00:04:46.640> he<00:04:47.270> continued<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.750> travel<00:04:48.110> across

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
bit but he continued to travel across

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.550 
bit but he continued to travel across
the<00:04:48.710> ice<00:04:48.830> so<00:04:49.010> that<00:04:49.160> would<00:04:49.310> only<00:04:49.430> affect<00:04:49.730> the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
the ice so that would only affect the

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
that click footwork on the second half

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.730 
that click footwork on the second half
of<00:05:17.699> the<00:05:17.849> foot<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.569> same<00:05:18.779> step<00:05:19.169> that<00:05:19.409> crossed

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
of the foot the same step that crossed

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.559 
of the foot the same step that crossed
behind<00:05:19.949> for<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.370> man<00:05:20.610> in<00:05:20.819> the<00:05:20.909> textbook<00:05:21.270> is

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
behind for the man in the textbook is

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.129 
behind for the man in the textbook is
actually<00:05:22.020> written<00:05:23.009> as<00:05:23.360> quarter<00:05:24.360> quarter<00:05:24.990> it's

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
actually written as quarter quarter it's

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.779 
actually written as quarter quarter it's
not<00:05:25.319> a<00:05:25.349> whole<00:05:25.620> beat<00:05:25.830> it's<00:05:26.099> not<00:05:26.279> a<00:05:26.310> half<00:05:26.550> feet

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
not a whole beat it's not a half feet

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.480 
not a whole beat it's not a half feet
it's<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.479> quarter<00:05:27.870> of<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.110> beat<00:05:28.349> so<00:05:29.039> for<00:05:29.249> him<00:05:29.400> to

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
it's a quarter of a beat so for him to

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.089 
it's a quarter of a beat so for him to
have<00:05:30.090> performed<00:05:30.599> it<00:05:30.719> so<00:05:30.870> cleanly<00:05:31.169> is<00:05:31.439> quite

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
have performed it so cleanly is quite

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.489 
have performed it so cleanly is quite
impressive<00:05:32.759> and<00:05:33.060> even<00:05:33.719> more<00:05:33.900> impressive<00:05:34.110> than

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:34.499 
impressive and even more impressive than

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.830 
impressive and even more impressive than
that<00:05:34.529> is<00:05:34.889> this<00:05:35.129> split<00:05:35.939> lift<00:05:36.180> at<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.509> end<00:05:36.659> again

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
that is this split lift at the end again

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.659 
that is this split lift at the end again
finding<00:05:37.349> a<00:05:37.409> new<00:05:37.560> variation<00:05:37.889> with<00:05:38.279> that<00:05:38.460> arch

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
finding a new variation with that arch

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.719 
finding a new variation with that arch
that<00:05:38.939> makes<00:05:39.180> it<00:05:40.129> something<00:05:41.129> that<00:05:41.340> you<00:05:41.520> haven't

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
that makes it something that you haven't

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.640 
that makes it something that you haven't
seen<00:05:41.909> before<00:05:42.419> and<00:05:42.569> again<00:05:42.659> that's<00:05:42.960> not<00:05:43.139> easy<00:05:43.409> to

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
seen before and again that's not easy to

00:05:43.650 --> 00:06:14.060 
seen before and again that's not easy to
do<00:05:43.830> in<00:05:44.009> dance<00:05:44.219> these<00:05:44.460> days<00:05:44.759> very<00:05:46.639> well<00:05:47.639> done

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.910 

so<00:06:15.070> he's<00:06:15.220> 69<00:06:15.850> point<00:06:16.540> 88<00:06:16.990> a<00:06:17.170> new<00:06:17.320> personal<00:06:17.860> best

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
so he's 69 point 88 a new personal best

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.740 
so he's 69 point 88 a new personal best
an<00:06:18.370> international<00:06:19.000> competition<00:06:19.180> for

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
an international competition for

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.950 
an international competition for
capellini<00:06:20.440> and<00:06:20.740> Lynott<00:06:21.160> a<00:06:21.340> of<00:06:21.520> italy<00:06:21.960> easily

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
capellini and Lynott a of italy easily

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.230 
capellini and Lynott a of italy easily
has<00:06:23.200> them<00:06:23.500> in<00:06:23.680> first<00:06:24.190> place<00:06:24.430> through<00:06:24.850> seven

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
has them in first place through seven

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.010 
has them in first place through seven
couples<00:06:25.450> with<00:06:26.260> one<00:06:26.560> yet
