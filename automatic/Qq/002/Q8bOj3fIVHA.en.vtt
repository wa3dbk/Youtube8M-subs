00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.410
 the cod is the preserved cod 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.450
 under salt 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.420
 these are pancakes made with 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.030
 a very thick batter taken from 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
 Ligurian tradition 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 these are the ingredients and the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.500
 portions are calculated as an appetizer 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.789
 if you have to use it as a second course 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 year doubled 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.410
 two days before frying the cod 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.410
 it must be placed in running water 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.779
 one or two days I'd say maybe one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.910
 day and a half two is the ideal time 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 put it under running water 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.469
 obviously you can't keep two 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 days under with with the water that runs 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.829
 just change the water occasionally when 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.940
 once you're ready 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.910
 so that the cod and been dumped 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.680
 in the water three hours before frying 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 so maybe in the morning if you do it 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.940
 twelve o'clock 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.030
 prepare the batter by adding in a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.030
 white with flour as I am doing here 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 a very thick batter must come 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:14.189
 as we shall see, non-corporate incorporated 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.590
 well the wine then add the oil 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:23.720
 extra virgin olive oil of the doses 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.720
 indicate sparkling water at the beginning 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.240
 incorporated well don't worry if you 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:41.130
 they form lumps then letting it rest 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.130
 it recovers everything mix well well 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.180
 I always use sourdough yeast 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.950
 dried you can use the yeast of 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.280
 beer maybe caught a little in the water 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.110
 rather than that yeast used 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.720
 doses that are expressed at the beginning are 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.390
 for the powdered sourdough go 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:10.780
 recalculated if you use another type of 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:13.110
 yeast, however, mix well a little 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.110
 salt 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.260
 this must be the consistency of the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:34.760
 then batter rather like a glue 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.680
 thick let stand for three hours 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:44.540
 close so don't let it sit for 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:45.920
 three hours after releasing the rest 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.230
 batter for at least three hours 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.270
 the oil must be heated to 170 degrees 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.600
 chop the parsley and prepare the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.470
 pancakes then we take the cod 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:05.780
 soaked in water the weight you express 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:08.140
 at the beginning and of the cod before being 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.140
 put in the water 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.670
 take it or dry it well and then 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.540
 we pull the skin away so we need a 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.959
 filleting knife hold the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.959
 skin 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.260
 I was filleted, I was stuck with a 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.260
 bit we don't recover immediately 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.250
 apart from the pieces of 34 cm so 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.670
 chop the parsley that you will go then it is 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.240
 add the batter 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.910
 washed and chopped 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.330
 obviously the washing phase is not 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.750
 I never show up but it's obvious that it goes 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.750
 washed 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.480
 add the parsley the batter 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.140
 jumbled up 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.910
 the video is accelerated and I'm not like that 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:32.360
 fast and then ready to fry then 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.900
 take a piece I turn very well 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.310
 inside the batter you see how sticky 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.980
 this is leavened even a little bit already 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:47.150
 with it will avoid even inside the 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:51.700
 fryer to be really nice 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.210
 covered with batter and at this point 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.210
 totti for frying 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.229
 here's the temperature of 170 degrees 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:10.110
 oil someone fridge in oil of 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:14.849
 olive I eventually prefer the oil of 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.190
 peanut seeds all in all oil 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.419
 olive has a too strong taste too 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.460
 if you take the light one 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.750
 I prefer it that way but of course you 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.750
 do as you wish 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:34.849
 let them hold up well mastella sticks 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.849
 a little on the grill 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:50.750
 when they have taken on color mix on 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.750
 plate with absorbent paper 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.960
 here it is 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.439
 and here are your cod fritters 

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:11.439
 hello to everyone next time
