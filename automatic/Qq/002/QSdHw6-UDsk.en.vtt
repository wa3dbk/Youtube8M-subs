00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.990
 in a comment on you tube and a lot 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.800
 intelligently I was made 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.099
 note that the battery was at 49 per 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.360
 hundred so I went right away I had 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.990
 assumed that he did not have a 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.850
 circuit that is being produced again 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.010
 generation we mean it did not have 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.220
 losses with the battery drop in 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.809
 performance terms instead is or 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:49.320
 inner reason to reject this 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:54.409
 product av pink 2000 mm x 18 6 50 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.409
 fully charged let's enter it 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:10.250
 let's turn it on to the roms it lights up 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.770
 I think almost kay high school we push it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:29.110
 at most, however, and let's see 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:37.479
 what happens ok 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:43.200
 power 11 10 battery 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 40 still turned around 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:04.630
 existence always 4.7 10 9 9 watts 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.850
 I wanted to go about the bacteria where he invites the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:24.280
 3.8 3.8 voltage as you have seen 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.280
 we can see it again here 3.84 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:43.520
 ok if we go up instead rex ok 101 99 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.740
 something now proves that also a 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.900
 hundred percent battery let's say 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:54.640
 which it is 100 100 100 percent battery 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.640
 the situation does not change much
