hey guys and welcome this video is on
the<00:00:13.380> plugin<00:00:13.679> power<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.130> pickles<00:00:14.519> player

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the plugin power of pickles player

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.790 
the plugin power of pickles player
hoppers<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.020> plug-in<00:00:16.230> does<00:00:16.590> is

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
hoppers and what this plug-in does is

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.439 
hoppers and what this plug-in does is
give<00:00:16.980> hoppers<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.550> ability<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> teleport

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
give hoppers the ability to teleport

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.810 
give hoppers the ability to teleport
players<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> create<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.340> all<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.699> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
players so to create one all you do is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.790 
players so to create one all you do is
place<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> load<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.449> hoppers<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> row<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
place a load of hoppers in a row and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.950 
place a load of hoppers in a row and
whatever<00:00:22.980> way<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> hopper<00:00:23.580> bottom<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.210> facing

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
whatever way the hopper bottom is facing

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.210 
whatever way the hopper bottom is facing
is<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.170> way<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> player<00:00:25.949> will<00:00:26.130> be

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
is the way that the player will be

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.189 
is the way that the player will be
teleported<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.750> start

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
teleported so this one is the start

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.349 
teleported so this one is the start
point<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> finish<00:00:29.580> point<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.240> if

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
point and this is the finish point so if

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.510 
point and this is the finish point so if
I<00:00:30.449> jump<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.560> see<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.800> teleports<00:00:32.130> me<00:00:32.309> across

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
I jump in and see it teleports me across

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.090 
I jump in and see it teleports me across
really<00:00:32.850> quickly<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> last<00:00:33.600> block<00:00:34.100> so

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
really quickly to the last block so

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.470 
really quickly to the last block so
there's<00:00:35.340> lots<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> implications<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.360> do

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
there's lots of implications you can do

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
there's lots of implications you can do
with<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.719> plug-in<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.079> could<00:00:37.290> build<00:00:37.590> tons

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
with this plug-in you could build tons

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
with this plug-in you could build tons
of<00:00:38.250> things<00:00:38.399> best<00:00:39.090> thing<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
of things best thing I can think of is a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.080 
of things best thing I can think of is a
train<00:00:40.469> system<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.160> obviously<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.850> them<00:00:42.000> at

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
train system so obviously have them at

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.400 
train system so obviously have them at
your<00:00:42.180> spawn<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.750> go<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:43.020> different

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
your spawn and they go all different

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.650 
your spawn and they go all different
areas<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.579> instance<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.510> go

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
areas so for instance this one you go

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
areas so for instance this one you go
across<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.230> down<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.640> hop<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.969> this

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
across and then down so if I hop in this

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.639 
across and then down so if I hop in this
one<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.899> teleports<00:00:49.200> me<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
one you can see it teleports me to the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.490 
one you can see it teleports me to the
bottom<00:00:49.950> block<00:00:50.570> next<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.079> I've<00:00:52.260> got<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
bottom block next one here I've got a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
bottom block next one here I've got a
ring<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> goes<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.520> way<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.820> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
ring so it goes all the way around so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.910 
ring so it goes all the way around so
this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.570> endless<00:00:54.840> circle<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.770> hop

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this is an endless circle so if I hop

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.330 
this is an endless circle so if I hop
into<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.430> whoops<00:00:57.300> sorry<00:00:57.510> hop<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.170> this

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
into this whoops sorry hop into this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.319 
into this whoops sorry hop into this
teleports<00:00:59.340> me<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.730> around<00:01:00.030> just

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
teleports me all the way around just

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
teleports me all the way around just
keep<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.379> until<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.739> press<00:01:01.920> shift<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.820> then

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
keep going until I press shift and then

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
keep going until I press shift and then
I<00:01:02.969> press<00:01:03.149> shift<00:01:03.180> where<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.019> off

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
I press shift where I want to get off

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.230 
I press shift where I want to get off
and<00:01:04.920> obviously<00:01:05.220> hops<00:01:05.489> off<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> could<00:01:06.119> have

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and obviously hops off so you could have

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.730 
and obviously hops off so you could have
this<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> way<00:01:06.900> around<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.350> spawn<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
this all the way around your spawn and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
this all the way around your spawn and
go<00:01:07.860> into<00:01:07.979> different<00:01:08.070> areas<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.729> players

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
go into different areas and players

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.109 
go into different areas and players
could<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.049> hop<00:01:10.170> off<00:01:10.350> wherever<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.799> like

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
could just hop off wherever you like

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.550 
could just hop off wherever you like
next<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.540> quite<00:01:12.780> big<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.140> off<00:01:13.290> setup

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
next one this is quite big one off setup

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.340 
next one this is quite big one off setup
over<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.939> what<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
over here and what this one is is if you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
over here and what this one is is if you
hop<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> top<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.400> it'll<00:01:17.939> teleport

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
hop in at the top here it'll teleport

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
hop in at the top here it'll teleport
you<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.110> around<00:01:19.409> take<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.549> down

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
you all the way around take you down

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.850 
you all the way around take you down
across<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> wall<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.409> back<00:01:22.619> out

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
across through a wall and then back out

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
across through a wall and then back out
the<00:01:23.040> other<00:01:23.070> end<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.090> one's<00:01:24.360> quite<00:01:24.570> good

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the other end so that one's quite good

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.039 
the other end so that one's quite good
as<00:01:24.869> well

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
as well

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
as well
and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> final<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.460> I've<00:01:26.670> got<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.119> just

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and then the final one I've got is just

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
and then the final one I've got is just
adding<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> ability<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.220> well<00:01:29.400> as

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
adding the ability to go up as well as

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.660 
adding the ability to go up as well as
down<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> all<00:01:31.290> I've<00:01:31.500> got<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.189> go<00:01:32.460> down

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
down so all I've got is one here go down

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
down so all I've got is one here go down
across<00:01:33.210> through<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> wall<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> land

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
across through a wall and then you land

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
across through a wall and then you land
in<00:01:34.650> some<00:01:34.829> water<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:35.310> takes<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
in some water which takes you up so this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
