00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240 

I<00:00:02.720> find<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:03.780> sometimes<00:00:04.080> people<00:00:04.710> aren't<00:00:04.980> as

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
I find that sometimes people aren't as

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.789 
I find that sometimes people aren't as
committed<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.180> necessarily<00:00:07.049> adopting<00:00:07.649> and

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
committed to necessarily adopting and

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.290 
committed to necessarily adopting and
yoga<00:00:08.069> practices<00:00:08.610> they<00:00:08.760> might<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:09.120> there

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
yoga practices they might be there

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.320 
yoga practices they might be there
running<00:00:09.660> routine<00:00:10.019> or<00:00:10.349> their<00:00:10.530> weight<00:00:10.740> training

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
running routine or their weight training

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.020 
running routine or their weight training
but<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.710> think<00:00:13.710> it's<00:00:13.860> because<00:00:14.009> they<00:00:14.490> they<00:00:14.759> want

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
but I think it's because they they want

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.029 
but I think it's because they they want
to<00:00:15.120> lose<00:00:15.269> weight<00:00:15.599> or<00:00:15.839> they<00:00:16.650> want<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.949> get

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to lose weight or they want to get

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.439 
to lose weight or they want to get
really<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.490> fit<00:00:17.789> they<00:00:18.000> don't<00:00:18.150> think<00:00:18.330> that

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
really really fit they don't think that

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.300 
really really fit they don't think that
yoga<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.990> give<00:00:19.439> them<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.130> there's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
yoga can give them that but there's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400 
yoga can give them that but there's
another<00:00:20.609> way<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.660> Yoga<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
another way to look at that Yoga is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.220 
another way to look at that Yoga is
amazing<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.430> reducing<00:00:23.910> stress<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:25.109> of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.220 
the things that often impedes people
from<00:00:26.880> achieving<00:00:27.180> their<00:00:27.420> goals<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.869> terms<00:00:28.050> of

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
things like weight loss is stress and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
hormones in the body that are actually

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.120

breath<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.220> breath<00:01:47.250> actually<00:01:48.000> moves<00:01:48.299> through

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
breath the breath actually moves through

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
breath the breath actually moves through
the<00:01:48.720> back<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> throat<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the back of the throat now I know that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.859 
the back of the throat now I know that
that's<00:01:50.189> probably<00:01:50.640> tricky<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.210> confusing<00:01:51.720> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that's probably tricky and confusing so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
that's probably tricky and confusing so
don't<00:01:52.020> worry<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.070> right

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
don't worry if you don't get it right

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.039 
don't worry if you don't get it right
away<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:53.939> give<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.450> try<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.899> you're

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
away but give it a try so you're

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.660 
away but give it a try so you're
breathing<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.470> through<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> nose<00:01:55.890> it'll

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
breathing in through the nose it'll

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.719 
breathing in through the nose it'll
sound<00:01:56.909> sort<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> like<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.070> through<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
sound sort of like so it's through the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
sound sort of like so it's through the
nose<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> nose<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> passageway

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
nose but the nose is just the passageway

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.929 
nose but the nose is just the passageway
the<00:02:04.740> air<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.040> moving<00:02:05.219> through<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.700> throat

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
the air is moving through the throat

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.700 
the air is moving through the throat
again<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.689> trying<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.170> you'll<00:02:07.439> you'll

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
again just trying it you'll you'll

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.160 
again just trying it you'll you'll
figure<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> out<00:02:08.160> soon<00:02:08.459> enough<00:02:08.629> so<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:09.810> hand<00:02:10.050> we

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
figure it out soon enough so one hand we

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.330 
figure it out soon enough so one hand we
care<00:02:10.349> one<00:02:10.470> hand<00:02:10.679> here<00:02:10.800> we're<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> be

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
care one hand here we're going to be

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.869 
care one hand here we're going to be
inhaling<00:02:12.080> starting<00:02:13.080> from<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> belly<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.310> you

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
inhaling starting from the belly and you

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.630 
inhaling starting from the belly and you
want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.209> continue<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.379> inhale<00:02:17.040> until<00:02:17.370> you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
want to continue to inhale until you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.089 
want to continue to inhale until you
bring<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.270> breath<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.810> into<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.440> chest<00:02:19.470> and

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
bring the breath up into the chest and

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.650 
bring the breath up into the chest and
then<00:02:20.550> when<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.819> exhale<00:02:21.209> you're<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.510> to

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
then when you exhale you're going to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.990 
then when you exhale you're going to
exhale<00:02:21.810> from<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.680> chest<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.069> then<00:02:23.520> bring<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
exhale from the chest and then bring the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.470 
exhale from the chest and then bring the
breath<00:02:24.209> down<00:02:24.569> into<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:25.140> belly<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.670> inhaling

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
breath down into the belly so inhaling

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.780 
breath down into the belly so inhaling
really<00:02:27.780> fully<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.230> exhaling<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.489> find

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
really fully and exhaling if you find

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.759 
really fully and exhaling if you find
you<00:02:29.970> start<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.390> breathe<00:02:30.599> in<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:31.530> breath

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
you start to breathe in and your breath

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.180 
you start to breathe in and your breath
gets<00:02:32.069> trapped<00:02:32.519> here<00:02:33.090> or<00:02:33.300> maybe<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.040> it's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
gets trapped here or maybe here and it's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.770 
gets trapped here or maybe here and it's
certainly<00:02:35.519> not<00:02:35.790> reaching<00:02:36.420> here<00:02:36.599> than<00:02:36.750> that

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
certainly not reaching here than that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.770 
certainly not reaching here than that
might<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> good<00:02:38.610> indication<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.269> you

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
might be a good indication that you

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.540 
might be a good indication that you
really<00:02:40.140> could<00:02:40.379> benefit<00:02:40.800> from<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.160> you're

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
really could benefit from this you're

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.280 
really could benefit from this you're
probably<00:02:41.819> stressed<00:02:42.390> you're<00:02:42.569> probably<00:02:42.780> tight

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
probably stressed you're probably tight

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.860 
probably stressed you're probably tight
you're<00:02:44.099> probably<00:02:44.310> not<00:02:44.700> breathing<00:02:45.300> most<00:02:45.690> of

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
you're probably not breathing most of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.150 
you're probably not breathing most of
the<00:02:45.989> time<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.379> you<00:02:46.410> don't<00:02:46.530> even<00:02:46.709> realize<00:02:46.980> it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the time and you don't even realize it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.920 
the time and you don't even realize it
or<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.459> least<00:02:47.610> you're<00:02:47.790> you're<00:02:48.330> only<00:02:48.510> breathing

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
or at least you're you're only breathing

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.869 
or at least you're you're only breathing
with<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> very<00:02:49.739> small<00:02:49.860> portion<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.580> your<00:02:50.700> lung

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
with a very small portion of your lung

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.339 
with a very small portion of your lung
capacity<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.660> will<00:02:51.840> help<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.170> increase

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
capacity so this will help to increase

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.250 
capacity so this will help to increase
the<00:02:53.250> capacity<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:53.970> your<00:02:54.239> lungs<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.690> again

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
the capacity of your lungs and again

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.780 
the capacity of your lungs and again
really<00:02:55.620> calm<00:02:56.239> your<00:02:57.239> calm<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.790> one

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
really calm your calm you down so one

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.580 
really calm your calm you down so one
hand<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.150> one<00:03:00.330> hint<00:03:00.540> here<00:03:00.750> I'm<00:03:01.200> gonna<00:03:01.319> sound

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
hand to one hint here I'm gonna sound

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:40.350 
hand to one hint here I'm gonna sound
and<00:03:02.040> look<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.400> little<00:03:02.489> bit<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:02.790> this

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.380 

you<00:03:41.360> can<00:03:41.540> also<00:03:41.720> as<00:03:42.170> you're<00:03:43.130> breathing<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.670> push

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
you can also as you're breathing in push

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.320 
you can also as you're breathing in push
in<00:03:44.630> push<00:03:44.720> down<00:03:45.680> as<00:03:46.040> you're<00:03:46.730> breathing<00:03:46.820> in<00:03:47.150> and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
as you're breathing out push it down so

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.450 
as you're breathing out push it down so

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
your body where you want the breath to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.870 
your body where you want the breath to
move<00:03:59.090> can<00:03:59.330> be<00:03:59.360> helpful<00:03:59.780> with<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.820> again<00:04:01.820> I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
move can be helpful with that again I

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.060 
move can be helpful with that again I
would<00:04:02.420> suggest<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.080> try<00:04:03.590> doing<00:04:03.710> this

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
would suggest that you try doing this

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.430 
would suggest that you try doing this
for<00:04:04.370> 2<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.940> 3<00:04:04.970> minutes<00:04:05.180> now<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.570> just<00:04:05.900> did<00:04:06.110> three

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
for 2 to 3 minutes now I just did three

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.310 
for 2 to 3 minutes now I just did three
breaths<00:04:06.920> three<00:04:07.430> cycles<00:04:07.730> it's<00:04:08.570> like<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:09.110> might
