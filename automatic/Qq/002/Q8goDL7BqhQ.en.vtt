there's<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:55.200> different<00:03:55.530> few<00:03:56.040> different<00:03:56.310> kinds

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
there's a different few different kinds

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.400 
there's a different few different kinds
of<00:03:56.760> fake<00:03:57.030> giveaways<00:03:57.480> but<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.139> one<00:03:58.380> of

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
of fake giveaways but this is one of

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.309 
of fake giveaways but this is one of
them<00:03:58.620> unfortunately<00:03:59.150> so<00:04:00.150> I'm<00:04:00.600> never<00:04:00.989> going<00:04:01.290> to

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
them unfortunately so I'm never going to

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.340 
them unfortunately so I'm never going to
see<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:02.069> penny<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:03.180> reward<00:04:03.359> money<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.139> I

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
see a penny of the reward money and I

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.530 
see a penny of the reward money and I
doubt<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.160> people<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.700> won<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.030> second<00:04:06.450> and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
doubt the people that won the second and

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.379 
doubt the people that won the second and
third<00:04:06.569> place<00:04:06.930> are<00:04:07.139> either<00:04:07.910> but<00:04:08.910> that's<00:04:09.120> just

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
third place are either but that's just

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.990 
third place are either but that's just
the<00:04:09.569> way<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.870> life<00:04:10.079> goes<00:04:10.319> sometimes<00:04:11.000> what

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
the way that life goes sometimes what

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.259 
the way that life goes sometimes what
does<00:04:12.299> surprise<00:04:12.750> me<00:04:12.780> though<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.500> why<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:15.150> would

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.060

try<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.569> scam<00:04:15.989> someone<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.590> has<00:04:16.739> more
