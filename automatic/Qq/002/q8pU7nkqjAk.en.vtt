 festona b &amp; b via georgetown am which reflects the pure graphics of the 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:17.650
 fortune 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.989
 and then. means to say in Arabic 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.039

 sports car of the highest level together with enthusiasts 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.409
 match cutter is a company we say a bit like us 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.270
 but they do everything except 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.859
 let's say the body is style 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 engineering then what she lacked ice cream 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.870
 when this wonderful system that can bring this car to be emitted less 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.700
 of a scooter 60 degrees per kilometer 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.860
 2 liters per 100 kilometers mentioned this data is essential for me 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 fact that then makes 350,000 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.060
 man with cape cod your press office 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.600
 in regards to a line that has followed a giugiaro design for many years 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.350
 this path of ecology because when the few spoke of ecology Puglia 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.310
 times that doctor call just one of once you are clear of 92 we must 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.009
 to be 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.130
 I'm always ready for new technologies. of codana to seek to propose 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.840
 perugia with the firefly 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.180
 that 92 brands cannot happen 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.830
 there was no need to think 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.799
 something of the general 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.180
 very curious 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.380
 now this is a tarfly 10 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.260
 for practically ten 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.479
 if the world has moved 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.400
 elk. peter s also on your part on this than on light 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 this is our 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.580
 bringing forward new ideas has happened. provocateur maybe not completely 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.220
 capita 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.050
 exotic adventures that may seem a little 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.880
 road right now 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.930
 times that slow boxwood very discus 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.200
 so we are 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.470
 external success 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.370
 here is our angel even a model I'm afraid of this inversion reading 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.910
 challenger click 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.580
 thanks because now doing computer simulations and what 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.130
 actually result of the performance 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.280
 we realize that it might be ready to explain 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.569
 social &amp; gt 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.579
 the best cars 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.359
 from competition then 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.239
 making a simulation had the computer said it was fashion would do 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.169
 the ride in a 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.689
 minutes and 50 seconds we compare it to 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.789
 cebe reading the championship gt and we are exactly 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:30.019
 revealed little 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.019
 here is this car in sauna centers small production hands siena pass but 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.430
 that is to say at the moment one thing to you 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.580
 of nothing more is our pride 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.729
 them and we also hope a little ours 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.209
 and on what 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.869
 what does it mean 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.259
 the future of technology 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:53.069
 ellen sensors for them are prepared to address this is is 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.569
 design hybrid cars we are ready to think 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.199
 from fubiz stylists 2 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.829
 is 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.750
 ditek is the particular gel the ciabot the two companies propose for 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.229
 think about the future 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.159
 I do not believe that by choice examination 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.769
 old-fashioned 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.220
 autolettura maybe make some exemplary star bikers
