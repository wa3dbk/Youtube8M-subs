of softest sound and the model that's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
of softest sound and the model that's
where<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.939> will<00:01:24.030> spend<00:01:24.180> monster<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.900> time<00:01:25.110> and

where we will spend monster for time and
then<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.159> shared<00:01:26.430> file<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
then we have the shared file that's the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
then we have the shared file that's the
coach<00:01:27.450> shared<00:01:27.930> between<00:01:28.140> both<00:01:28.619> declined<00:01:29.430> and

coach shared between both declined and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
coach shared between both declined and
the<00:01:30.060> server<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.570> there's<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.439> really<00:01:31.500> much

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the server and there's not really much

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
the server and there's not really much
we<00:01:31.920> after<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.759> only<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.259> in

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
we after there only I think it's in

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.899 
we after there only I think it's in
episode<00:01:34.860> 2<00:01:35.070> where<00:01:35.400> we're<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> play

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
episode 2 where we're going to play

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
episode 2 where we're going to play
around<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.570> spawning<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> money<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
around with the spawning of money so to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.640 
around with the spawning of money so to
spawn<00:01:38.549> inside<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.210> printer<00:01:39.409> but<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.500> going

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
spawn inside the printer but I'm going

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.410 
spawn inside the printer but I'm going
to<00:01:40.740> open<00:01:40.829> these<00:01:41.100> files<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:41.790> sublime<00:01:42.240> text

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
to open these files up with sublime text

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.230 
to open these files up with sublime text
2<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:43.829> we're<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> start<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.850> any

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.340 
define the model path whoops let's close
that<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.060> go<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.360> game<00:02:00.570> open<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.229> your

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that you have to go in game open up your

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.840 
that you have to go in game open up your
Q<00:02:01.590> menu<00:02:01.770> front<00:02:02.670> appropriate<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:04.340> most<00:02:05.340> people

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
Q menu front appropriate and most people

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.710 
Q menu front appropriate and most people
use<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.659> default<00:02:07.069> 100<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.489> three<00:02:09.149> ones<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
use the default 100 these three ones I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.880 
use the default 100 these three ones I
think<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.229> also<00:02:11.190> some<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.459> them<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:11.790> here

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
think so also some of them down here

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.950 
think so also some of them down here
but<00:02:13.490> yeah<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.420> right-click<00:02:14.690> on

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
but yeah you just have to right-click on

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.559 
but yeah you just have to right-click on
the<00:02:15.080> model<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.560> copy<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.430> clipboard<00:02:16.550> now<00:02:17.480> you

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
the model and copy to clipboard now you

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.020 
the model and copy to clipboard now you
can<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:17.840> go<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.170> here<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.590> paste<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.340> but

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
can just go in here and paste it in but

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.540 
can just go in here and paste it in but
I'm<00:02:20.120> going<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.330> use<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.690> default<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.860> default

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
I'm going to use the default the default

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.190 
I'm going to use the default the default
model<00:02:23.030> here<00:02:23.240> so<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:23.569> easier<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.050> me<00:02:24.170> to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
model here so it's easier for me to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.309 
model here so it's easier for me to
design<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.310> for<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.270> next<00:02:26.390> thing<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.959> if

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
design it so for the next thing is if

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.260 
design it so for the next thing is if
you<00:02:27.440> want<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.770> disable<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.459> sound<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:29.120> can

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
you want to disable the sound you can

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.300 
you want to disable the sound you can
just<00:02:29.450> go<00:02:29.600> ahead<00:02:29.720> here<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.290> comment<00:02:31.190> these

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
just go ahead here and comment these

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.390 
just go ahead here and comment these
lines<00:02:31.640> out<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:33.380> now<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.680> will<00:02:33.770> not<00:02:33.980> make<00:02:34.190> any

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
lines out so now it will not make any

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.910 
lines out so now it will not make any
sounds<00:02:35.020> it's<00:02:36.020> kind<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.320> knowing<00:02:36.440> with<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.800> new

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
sounds it's kind of knowing with the new

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.770 
sounds it's kind of knowing with the new
printers<00:02:37.280> they<00:02:37.520> kind<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.060> make<00:02:38.209> quite<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.570> lot

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
printers they kind of make quite a lot

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.309 
printers they kind of make quite a lot
of<00:02:38.900> noise<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.470> might<00:02:40.130> like<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.550> might<00:02:40.790> not

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
of noise you might like it you might not

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.660 
of noise you might like it you might not
also<00:02:42.319> if<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.470> remove<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.010> side<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.370> can<00:02:43.459> also

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
also if you remove the side you can also

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.820 
also if you remove the side you can also
just<00:02:43.910> remove<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:45.200> not<00:02:45.380> really<00:02:45.650> needed

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
just remove this it's not really needed

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.040 
just remove this it's not really needed
just<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.850> comment<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.239> out<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.780> we<00:02:47.870> still

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
just going to comment it out so we still

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.040 
just going to comment it out so we still
update<00:02:48.440> function<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:50.360> now<00:02:50.390> for<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.870> first

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
update function so now for the first

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.410 
update function so now for the first
thing<00:02:51.440> we're<00:02:51.709> going<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.040> edit<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.459> amount<00:02:52.519> the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
thing we're going to edit the amount the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.660 
thing we're going to edit the amount the
printer<00:02:53.690> spawns<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:55.040> you'll<00:02:55.190> find<00:02:55.459> this

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
printer spawns and you'll find this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.660 
printer spawns and you'll find this
around<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.720> think<00:02:57.320> it's<00:02:57.470> yeah<00:02:58.040> right<00:02:58.280> here<00:02:58.489> in

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
around I think it's yeah right here in

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.449 
around I think it's yeah right here in
the<00:02:58.850> create<00:02:59.360> money<00:02:59.600> back<00:02:59.840> function<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.370> you

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
the create money back function and you

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.250 
the create money back function and you
can<00:03:01.610> see<00:03:01.760> down<00:03:02.060> here<00:03:02.090> there<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.630> an<00:03:02.780> EM<00:03:02.900> mount

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
can see down here there is an EM mount

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.590 
can see down here there is an EM mount
if<00:03:04.100> you're<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:04.459> going<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.700> use<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.060> config

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
if you're not going to use the config

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.720 
if you're not going to use the config
file<00:03:05.810> that's<00:03:06.230> just<00:03:06.590> too<00:03:06.769> much<00:03:06.950> work<00:03:07.010> for<00:03:07.459> us<00:03:07.550> so

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
file that's just too much work for us so

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.350 
file that's just too much work for us so
you're<00:03:08.600> just<00:03:08.750> going<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.019> delete<00:03:10.120> these<00:03:11.120> noise

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
you're just going to delete these noise

you're just going to delete these noise
I'm<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.989> going<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.170> define<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.500> new<00:03:12.620> value<00:03:13.160> for

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
I'm just going to define a new value for

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.069 
I'm just going to define a new value for
amount<00:03:14.209> you're<00:03:14.780> going<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:15.019> do<00:03:15.140> local<00:03:15.670> amount

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
amount you're going to do local amount

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.060 
amount you're going to do local amount
and<00:03:18.079> then<00:03:18.230> we<00:03:18.380> could<00:03:18.500> just<00:03:18.620> going<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.890> type<00:03:19.040> in

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
and then we could just going to type in

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.039 
and then we could just going to type in
the<00:03:19.400> amount<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.670> money<00:03:19.880> back<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.329> want<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.750> to

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
the amount of money back you want it to

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.509 
the amount of money back you want it to
spawn<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:21.680> I'm<00:03:21.799> going<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.010> make<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:22.310> phone

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
spawn so I'm going to make is phone

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.590 
spawn so I'm going to make is phone
every<00:03:23.140> spawn<00:03:24.140> $500<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:26.030> now<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.209> can<00:03:26.390> just

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
every spawn $500 and now we can just

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.560 
every spawn $500 and now we can just
remove<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.079> if<00:03:27.799> statement<00:03:28.180> yeah<00:03:29.180> now<00:03:29.510> we

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.699 
remove this if statement yeah now we
want<00:03:30.340> $500<00:03:31.340> every<00:03:31.549> time<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:32.350> every<00:03:33.350> time<00:03:33.500> the

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
want $500 every time it every time the

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.449 
want $500 every time it every time the
timer<00:03:34.130> run<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.230> next<00:03:36.410> kind<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.040> big<00:03:37.190> thing

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
timer run so the next kind of big thing

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.090 
timer run so the next kind of big thing
we<00:03:37.730> need<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:37.970> change<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.690> timers<00:03:39.200> or<00:03:39.410> the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
we need to change is the timers or the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.789 
we need to change is the timers or the
time<00:03:40.310> between<00:03:40.519> each<00:03:40.910> bomb<00:03:41.299> so<00:03:42.230> there's<00:03:42.470> two

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
time between each bomb so there's two

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.410 
time between each bomb so there's two
things<00:03:42.829> you<00:03:43.160> can<00:03:43.370> do<00:03:43.459> here<00:03:43.489> either<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.269> can

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
things you can do here either you can

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.160 
things you can do here either you can
have<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.630> random<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.739> it's<00:03:46.040> like<00:03:46.670> between<00:03:47.170> 100

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
have a random so it's like between 100

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.940 
have a random so it's like between 100
and<00:03:48.200> 300<00:03:48.620> 50<00:03:49.280> seconds<00:03:49.930> or<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.170> can<00:03:51.380> just

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
and 300 50 seconds or you can just

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.130 
and 300 50 seconds or you can just
specify<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.989> second<00:03:53.989> second<00:03:54.860> value<00:03:55.480> I've<00:03:56.480> got<00:03:57.110> a

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
specify a second second value I've got a

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.560 
specify a second second value I've got a
I<00:03:57.650> don't<00:03:57.950> know<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.250> just<00:03:58.459> going<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:58.970> go<00:03:59.209> with<00:03:59.390> the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
I don't know I just going to go with the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.539 
I don't know I just going to go with the
static<00:03:59.900> value<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.470> we're<00:04:00.650> going<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.340> change

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
static value so we're going to change

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.690 
static value so we're going to change
this<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.790> like<00:04:02.560> every<00:04:03.560> 1<00:04:03.739> minute<00:04:04.040> or<00:04:04.220> let's

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
this to like every 1 minute or let's

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.180 
this to like every 1 minute or let's
just<00:04:04.880> set<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.180> 30<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:05.989> every<00:04:06.410> 30<00:04:06.739> seconds

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
just set it to 30 so every 30 seconds

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.080 
just set it to 30 so every 30 seconds
then<00:04:08.859> that's<00:04:09.859> way<00:04:10.130> easier<00:04:10.160> for<00:04:10.640> me<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:10.760> can

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
then that's way easier for me so can

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.520 
then that's way easier for me so can
test<00:04:11.299> but<00:04:11.540> if<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:11.780> wanted<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.109> use<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> random

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
test but if you wanted to use a random

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.220 
test but if you wanted to use a random
value<00:04:12.799> you<00:04:13.160> could<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:13.549> change<00:04:13.850> these<00:04:14.299> two<00:04:14.600> so

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
value you could just change these two so

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.759 
value you could just change these two so
like<00:04:15.410> this<00:04:15.910> doe<00:04:16.910> so<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.419> between<00:04:17.840> 100<00:04:18.320> seconds

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
like this doe so is between 100 seconds

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.849 
like this doe so is between 100 seconds
and<00:04:18.979> 350<00:04:19.640> seconds<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.560> yeah<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:21.680> can<00:04:21.799> just

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
and 350 seconds and yeah you can just

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.220 
and 350 seconds and yeah you can just
delete<00:04:22.310> that<00:04:22.490> every<00:04:22.820> face<00:04:23.030> up<00:04:23.240> with<00:04:23.270> a

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
delete that every face up with a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.720 
delete that every face up with a
seconds<00:04:25.800> value<00:04:26.190> or<00:04:26.750> integer<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.490> in

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
seconds value or integer and that is in

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.500 
seconds value or integer and that is in
seconds<00:04:30.390> so<00:04:30.570> just<00:04:30.990> going<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.200> use<00:04:31.320> 30<00:04:31.800> seconds

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
seconds so just going to use 30 seconds

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.120 
seconds so just going to use 30 seconds
this<00:04:33.510> will<00:04:33.660> run<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.080> print<00:04:34.380> more<00:04:34.650> function

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
this will run the print more function

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.760 
this will run the print more function
and<00:04:35.670> we<00:04:35.790> can<00:04:35.820> pound<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.150> down<00:04:36.480> here<00:04:36.810> that

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
and we can pound that down here that

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.650 
and we can pound that down here that
will<00:04:37.980> then<00:04:38.100> run<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.550> create<00:04:38.910> money<00:04:39.150> function

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
will then run the create money function

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.090 
will then run the create money function
and<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.140> see<00:04:40.260> down<00:04:40.440> here<00:04:40.500> in<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.920> bottom

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
and you can see down here in the bottom

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.880 
and you can see down here in the bottom
there<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.820> new<00:04:42.120> timer<00:04:42.450> well<00:04:43.080> then<00:04:43.320> again<00:04:43.560> run

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
there is a new timer well then again run

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.060 
there is a new timer well then again run
this<00:04:44.070> print<00:04:44.400> more<00:04:44.900> function<00:04:45.900> so<00:04:46.590> we<00:04:46.680> also<00:04:46.860> need

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
this print more function so we also need

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.300 
this print more function so we also need
to<00:04:47.220> change<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.580> down<00:04:47.700> here<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.440> you

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
to change it down here and you and you

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.060 
to change it down here and you and you
should<00:04:50.610> make<00:04:51.060> this<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.570> same<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:52.710> kind<00:04:52.950> of

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
should make this the same it's kind of

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.620 
should make this the same it's kind of
stupid<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.700> make<00:04:53.850> it<00:04:54.000> two<00:04:54.210> different<00:04:54.540> values

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
stupid to make it two different values

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.560 
stupid to make it two different values
but<00:04:55.280> just<00:04:56.280> change<00:04:56.550> that<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.150> same<00:04:57.330> like

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
but just change that to the same like

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.570 
but just change that to the same like
you<00:04:57.600> did<00:04:57.900> before

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
you did before

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.880 
you did before
so<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.700> just<00:04:59.790> can<00:04:59.970> change<00:05:00.240> this<00:05:00.420> to<00:05:00.660> 30<00:05:01.050> so<00:05:01.530> 30

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
so it just can change this to 30 so 30

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.150 
so it just can change this to 30 so 30
seconds<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:04.080> should<00:05:04.320> pretty<00:05:04.860> much<00:05:05.010> be

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
seconds and that should pretty much be

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.870 
seconds and that should pretty much be
it<00:05:05.580> so<00:05:06.360> now<00:05:06.510> we<00:05:06.570> changed<00:05:06.960> or<00:05:07.890> you<00:05:08.490> could<00:05:08.730> have

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
it so now we changed or you could have

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.900 
it so now we changed or you could have
changed<00:05:09.060> or<00:05:10.050> disabled<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.710> sound<00:05:11.010> you<00:05:11.610> change

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
changed or disabled the sound you change

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.590 
changed or disabled the sound you change
the<00:05:12.300> printer<00:05:12.810> time<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.470> printer<00:05:13.890> amount

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
the printer time and the printer amount

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.570 
the printer time and the printer amount
so<00:05:15.600> now<00:05:15.720> let's<00:05:15.960> go<00:05:16.200> ahead<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.830> add<00:05:16.980> this<00:05:17.190> here

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
so now let's go ahead and add this here

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.900 
so now let's go ahead and add this here
to<00:05:17.880> again<00:05:18.090> so<00:05:18.450> open<00:05:19.140> up<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:20.070> file<00:05:20.550> right<00:05:20.850> here
