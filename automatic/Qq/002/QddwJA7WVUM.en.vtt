several variations on this operation

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.319 
several variations on this operation
today<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.100> many<00:01:38.369> more<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.000> partial

today we do many more of the partial
abdominal<00:01:39.960> classes<00:01:40.380> along<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.340> a

we<00:01:57.549> can<00:01:57.759> do<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.119> next<00:01:58.420> step<00:01:58.570> along<00:01:59.020> with<00:01:59.229> that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
we can do the next step along with that

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.990 
we can do the next step along with that
which<00:01:59.649> is<00:01:59.679> removing<00:02:00.310> some<00:02:00.490> skin<00:02:00.789> and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
which is removing some skin and

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.760 
which is removing some skin and
tightening<00:02:01.359> the<00:02:01.450> muscles<00:02:01.810> adjust<00:02:02.140> up<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.649> the

belly button another variation which is

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.509 
belly button another variation which is
called<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.750> float<00:02:08.170> operation<00:02:08.800> we<00:02:09.009> remove

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
called the float operation we remove

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.460 
called the float operation we remove
some<00:02:09.759> skin<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.330> there's<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.599> scar<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.899> shorter

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
some skin so there's a scar a shorter

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.059 
some skin so there's a scar a shorter
scar<00:02:11.739> down<00:02:12.150> way<00:02:13.150> low<00:02:13.360> down<00:02:13.599> we<00:02:14.440> lift<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.860> skin

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
scar down way low down we lift the skin

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.270 
scar down way low down we lift the skin
up<00:02:15.930> get<00:02:16.930> underneath<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.530> belly<00:02:17.680> button<00:02:17.920> so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
up get underneath the belly button so

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.949 
up get underneath the belly button so
now<00:02:18.489> we<00:02:18.549> can<00:02:18.819> tighten<00:02:19.180> up<00:02:19.269> even<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.750> skin

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
now we can tighten up even the skin

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.390 
now we can tighten up even the skin
above<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.410> belly<00:02:20.620> button<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.129> still
