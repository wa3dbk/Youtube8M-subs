00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.280
 Registered in a candidate list of over 20 people 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.619
 Showed a strong desire to 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.860
 Expectations and unrest enter high level 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.200
 A set of four major players from a series of members playing in the new world 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.829
 Asked for 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.279
 Among them, people who reduce the light from the center back after hearing the light 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.279
 It is still unstable 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.290
 The worries appear soon after the game starts 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.160
 Only 28 seconds started 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.840
 Topped right and fell 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.170
 Decided to open to the Kawasaki sales floor team in Florida 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 It has ended 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.430
 Suddenly, there is a history of disapproving 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.430
 I lose my second point from a pass miss 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 1r 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.020
 Many supporters watched aluminum welding in Niigata 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.560
 To the product of Kawasaki where the amount of exercise fell 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.350
 Takes some meaning slow 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.860
 From vista through path 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 It sets a great goal 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.520
 The second half is a side attack with a characteristic taste and I'm going to go after deferment 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.040
 But 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
 I did not talk in the opening match victory by all means 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.580
 The first match that Kurosaki Shin directed 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.340
 The challenge for aluminum 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 It was 29 days 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.560
 to the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.530
 A project that can be done through oil and oil 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.560
 First day of 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.649
 Japan Oyamagata of the book in the second round in a very nice form 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.120
 7th victory with a 0-1 adjustment 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.650
 But that's kinda 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.320
 If it's too good, it won't go well 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.969
 Doing 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.969
 I made a strong move without submitting an application 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.209
 It is analyzed that the yen appreciation has a break in Matsui dollar 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.279
 I'm doing with the mistake of Brazilian df 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.709
 2020 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.259
 In short
