00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hi, what are we going to do today? 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.210
 it's recycled paper we take the container 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.210
 with water 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.480
 we will have made with the scissors shavings 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.340
 of paper 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.230
 we put enough chips 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.770
 because like this then it becomes soft 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.770
 with water 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.150
 you can add more water plus paper 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.250
 depending on what you want to use and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.850
 this should be left to rest near 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.940
 23 hours after the time of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 paper in the water we will take the blender and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.690
 we will beat everything well now we will take 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.500
 the frame we have made a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.500
 small frame 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 improvised with staples and what 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.560
 we will introduce inside the container 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.590
 we will try to put 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.060
 as much as possible 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.190
 the paper inside what is the frame 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.060
 we will shake it 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.180
 and it will be full of paper 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.680
 now let's remove this a little bit 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.380
 and we are going to make the press 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.810
 improvised 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.940
 the home company we take a piece of 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.380
 plastic so as not to stain anything 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.380
 we put kitchen paper 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.200
 so that they absorb the excess water 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.850
 when we do the pressing 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 we put a piece of cotton cloth 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.630
 and now we take the frame 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.630
 and we put it on top of the cloth 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.640
 then we put another piece of cloth this one 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.800
 we will fold it and put it inside the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.800
 frame because we have a gap 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.780
 we will lend 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.289
 we will do the same with the kitchen paper 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.470
 so that it absorbs the excess water 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.470
 and then we put the plastic again 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.190
 we can fold it more times if you want 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.190
 and then the improvised press is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.000
 a couple of pretty thick books 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.560
 to make you press 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.239
 to think well the paper 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.800
 and that all the water that is 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.530
 let the paper 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.260
 elapsed then the 24 hours more 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.450
 or less we can take out the paper once 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.790
 dry and already use it for what 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.070
 We want to use both paper 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.360
 make an invitation to wrap a 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.460
 package depending on how big what 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.860
 do then we can use for a 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.000
 thing or another the paper was by far 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.680
 watch out 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 and we will try to take out the paper 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.510
 we keep tapping so that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.510
 can go out better 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.360
 let's fall the role of more real and each 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.920
 possible mind 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.599
 as we see it is still a little wet 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.900
 This should be the result of 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.900
 paper
