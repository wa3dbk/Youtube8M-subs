00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
opportunity but there's a new doorway

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.799 
opportunity but there's a new doorway
that's<00:01:02.129> opening<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> fresh

new doorway so the potential is there to

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.920 
new doorway so the potential is there to
expand<00:01:11.159> upon<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.670> or<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.450> expand

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
expand upon this or for this to expand

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.980 
expand upon this or for this to expand
upon<00:01:13.200> itself<00:01:13.820> but<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.299> new<00:01:15.630> this

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
upon itself but there is this new this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.170 
upon itself but there is this new this
new<00:01:16.350> energy<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.100> comes<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.850> beginning
