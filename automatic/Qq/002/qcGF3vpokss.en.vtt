leaving a server and then trying to
connect<00:01:08.850> again<00:01:08.970> would<00:01:09.390> cause<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:09.960> crashes

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
some crashes if you use fireworks

some crashes if you use fireworks
without<00:01:16.409> firework<00:01:17.009> stars<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:17.880> keep<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.180> mind

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
without firework stars now keep in mind

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.030 
without firework stars now keep in mind
you<00:01:18.570> could<00:01:18.750> probably<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> these<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
you could probably do all of these to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.270 
you could probably do all of these to
crash<00:01:20.280> servers<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.180> either<00:01:21.960> exploit<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.890> or

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
crash servers so either exploit that or

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.999 
crash servers so either exploit that or
don't<00:01:23.549> exploit<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.689> toots<00:01:25.049> just

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
don't exploit that if you toots just

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.789 
don't exploit that if you toots just
putting<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.229> last<00:01:28.470> clap

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
putting it out there now the last clap

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.039 
putting it out there now the last clap
crashbug<00:01:29.610> i<00:01:30.090> will<00:01:30.299> save<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:30.720> i<00:01:30.840> actually

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
crashbug i will save because i actually

Spencer<00:02:12.959> let's<00:02:13.469> try<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.950> oh<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.849> need<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.239> go

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
Spencer let's try that oh I need to go

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.440 
Spencer let's try that oh I need to go
into<00:02:15.450> survival<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.560> let's<00:02:16.769> do<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.329> that<00:02:18.329> was

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
into survival so let's do that that was

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.130 
into survival so let's do that that was
a<00:02:18.480> good<00:02:18.629> test<00:02:18.900> here<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:19.620> go<00:02:22.099> no<00:02:24.140> everything

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
a good test here we go no everything

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.229 
a good test here we go no everything
seems<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.500> be<00:02:25.590> here<00:02:25.890> still<00:02:26.189> maybe<00:02:26.909> it<00:02:27.060> doesn't

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
seems to be here still maybe it doesn't

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.360 
seems to be here still maybe it doesn't
work<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.599> bucket<00:02:27.930> but<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.709> was<00:02:28.829> a<00:02:28.859> nice<00:02:29.069> test

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
