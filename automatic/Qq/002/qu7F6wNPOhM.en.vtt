made the mistake of putting these ones
in<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:08.330> because<00:05:09.330> i<00:05:09.870> haven't<00:05:10.470> used<00:05:11.310> these<00:05:11.610> ones

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
in and because i haven't used these ones

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.580 
in and because i haven't used these ones
in<00:05:12.210> like<00:05:12.800> half<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.919> year<00:05:14.250> or<00:05:14.580> something<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:15.590> so

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
in like half a year or something and so

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.020 
in like half a year or something and so
they<00:05:16.770> were<00:05:16.830> sitting<00:05:17.100> in<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.370> same<00:05:17.550> saline

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
they were sitting in the same saline

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.170

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
solution for like half a year and so i

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.120
