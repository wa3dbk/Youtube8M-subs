to say week doesn't feel quite as solid
as<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.189> could<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> hinge<00:01:24.200> moves<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.470> little

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
as it could be the hinge moves a little

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.270 
as it could be the hinge moves a little
bit<00:01:25.770> left<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.700> given<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> nudge

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
bit left and right when given a nudge

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
bit left and right when given a nudge
bone<00:01:29.280> kind<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> feels<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.750> bit<00:01:30.930> hollow<00:01:31.229> -

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
bone kind of feels a little bit hollow -

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.870 
bone kind of feels a little bit hollow -
I<00:01:31.860> mean<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.310> always<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.640> bad<00:01:32.729> thing

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
I mean that's not always a bad thing

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.999 
I mean that's not always a bad thing
it's<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> way<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.659> feels<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.560> mean<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it's just the way it feels I mean I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
it's just the way it feels I mean I
expect<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.790> they'll<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.479> reasonably<00:01:36.900> solid

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
expect that they'll be reasonably solid

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.310 
expect that they'll be reasonably solid
but<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.270> am<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.630> bit<00:01:39.840> worried<00:01:40.079> about<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
but I am a little bit worried about that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.039 
but I am a little bit worried about that
hinge<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.070> looks<00:01:41.250> beepy<00:01:41.640> enough<00:01:41.869> but<00:01:42.869> there's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
hinge it looks beepy enough but there's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.700 
hinge it looks beepy enough but there's
a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.530> too<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:43.770> good<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.220> my<00:01:44.340> liking

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710

1980s so it's catching up still got a
ways<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.400> go<00:04:20.579> but<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.239> definitely<00:04:21.959> getting

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
ways to go but it's definitely getting

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.249 
ways to go but it's definitely getting
better<00:04:22.259> looking<00:04:23.900> look<00:04:24.900> here<00:04:25.110> at<00:04:25.169> the

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
better looking look here at the

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.439 
better looking look here at the
connections<00:04:25.710> screen<00:04:26.039> you<00:04:26.190> can<00:04:26.310> see<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.520> not

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
connections screen you can see that not

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.270 
connections screen you can see that not
only<00:04:27.509> does<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.930> pearl<00:04:28.650> flip<00:04:28.830> support

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
only does the pearl flip support

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.430 
only does the pearl flip support
bluetooth<00:04:29.669> but<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:29.970> also<00:04:30.090> supports<00:04:30.660> Wi-Fi<00:04:30.990> and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
bluetooth but it also supports Wi-Fi and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.170 
bluetooth but it also supports Wi-Fi and
since<00:04:31.650> this<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:31.949> t-mobile<00:04:32.400> device<00:04:32.940> with

since this is a t-mobile device with
Wi-Fi<00:04:33.919> also<00:04:34.919> means<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.250> supports<00:04:35.699> you<00:04:36.449> MA<00:04:36.840> you

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
Wi-Fi also means it supports you MA you

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.650 
Wi-Fi also means it supports you MA you
can<00:04:37.590> see<00:04:37.800> right<00:04:37.979> here<00:04:38.430> open<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.360> corner

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
can see right here open the corner

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.390 
can see right here open the corner
instead<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:40.020> seeing<00:04:40.259> a<00:04:40.440> GSM<00:04:40.979> indicator

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
instead of seeing a GSM indicator

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.249 
instead of seeing a GSM indicator
because<00:04:41.639> the<00:04:41.940> phone's<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.449> quad-band<00:04:42.690> gsm

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
because the phone's a quad-band gsm

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.529 
because the phone's a quad-band gsm
phone<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:44.280> can<00:04:44.400> see<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> um<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:45.030> indicator

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
phone you can see a um a indicator

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.080 
phone you can see a um a indicator
instead<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.440> little<00:04:47.009> Wi-Fi<00:04:47.460> strength<00:04:47.820> there

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
instead a little Wi-Fi strength there

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.330 
instead a little Wi-Fi strength there
because<00:04:48.690> instead<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.320> connecting<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.919> GSM

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
because instead of connecting to the GSM

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.040 
because instead of connecting to the GSM
network<00:04:50.370> we're<00:04:50.849> actually<00:04:50.970> connected<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.599> the

there<00:04:55.949> instead<00:04:56.400> it's<00:04:57.330> great<00:04:57.930> for<00:04:58.050> dealing

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
there instead it's great for dealing

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.810 
there instead it's great for dealing

it automatically turns one of those

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.530 
it automatically turns one of those
spaces<00:05:35.220> into<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.610> period

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:54.309 

see<00:05:40.530> again<00:05:42.590> thi<00:05:43.760> s<00:05:44.760> this<00:05:45.720> is<00:05:46.940> a<00:05:50.420> test

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.649 

and<00:05:54.860> there<00:05:54.979> we<00:05:55.069> have<00:05:55.099> it<00:05:55.279> again<00:05:55.509> works<00:05:56.509> pretty

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
and there we have it again works pretty

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.559 
and there we have it again works pretty
well<00:05:56.779> it's<00:05:56.960> not<00:05:57.050> as<00:05:57.199> easy<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:58.639> use<00:05:58.879> as<00:05:59.059> a<00:05:59.089> full

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
well it's not as easy to use as a full

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:02.920 
QWERTY keyboard but for device like this
it<00:06:02.059> makes<00:06:02.180> a<00:06:02.270> lot<00:06:02.360> more<00:06:02.419> sense

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
it makes a lot more sense

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.209 
it makes a lot more sense
you<00:06:03.169> wouldn't<00:06:03.379> be<00:06:03.439> really<00:06:03.680> be<00:06:03.860> able<00:06:03.919> to<00:06:04.039> get<00:06:04.189> a

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:27.589 
looks like a magnifying glass so if we
