fixed now but it's like the game is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.839 
fixed now but it's like the game is
super<00:00:27.300> laggy<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.869> when<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:29.519> look<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:29.730> my

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
super laggy like when I go to look at my

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.400 
super laggy like when I go to look at my
own<00:00:30.000> titles<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.570> emblems<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.140> look<00:00:31.260> right

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
own titles or my emblems and look right

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.720 
own titles or my emblems and look right
there<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.980> saw<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.399> know<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
there you just saw that I know I'm a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.030 
there you just saw that I know I'm a
little<00:00:32.850> late<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.360> if<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:33.930> back<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.559> couple

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
little late but if you go back a couple

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.530 
little late but if you go back a couple
seconds<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.700> see<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.420> look

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
seconds you can see up there it look

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.389 
seconds you can see up there it look
like<00:00:36.750> two<00:00:36.960> little<00:00:36.989> nukes<00:00:37.500> instead<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.190> what<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
like two little nukes instead of what it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.090 
like two little nukes instead of what it
was<00:00:38.550> supposed<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> UAV<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.930> know<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
was supposed to be the UAV I know that

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.040 
was supposed to be the UAV I know that
just<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:41.940> that's<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> default

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
just I think that's just like a default

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.840 
just I think that's just like a default
image<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> texture<00:00:44.550> doesn't

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
image they have when the texture doesn't

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.270 
image they have when the texture doesn't
load<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> UAV<00:00:45.930> um<00:00:46.140> I've<00:00:46.710> seen<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
load in for the UAV um I've seen that in

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
load in for the UAV um I've seen that in
theatres<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:48.450> happening<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
theatres but I'm happening and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
theatres but I'm happening and
multiplayer<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.430> crazy<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
multiplayer I think this is crazy it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
multiplayer I think this is crazy it
shouldn't<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.449> happening<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.350> really

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
shouldn't be happening and I really

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.270 
shouldn't be happening and I really
don't<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> deal<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.180> um<00:00:55.280> yeah

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

don't know what the deal is but um yeah
I<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.489> don't<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> loss<00:00:57.960> for

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I I don't really know I'm at a loss for

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
I I don't really know I'm at a loss for
words<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.670> making<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.030> video

saying<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.480> don't<00:01:03.750> think<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.110> my<00:01:04.320> disk<00:01:04.589> my

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
saying I don't think it's my disk my

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.679 
saying I don't think it's my disk my
disk<00:01:05.100> doesn't<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.640> any<00:01:05.760> scratches<00:01:06.479> no

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.300 
disk doesn't have any scratches no
fingerprints<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.560> anything<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.130> not

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
fingerprints or anything it's not

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
fingerprints or anything it's not
cracked<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.570> take<00:01:10.110> care<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.439> my<00:01:10.560> disks<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
cracked I take care of my disks and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.149 
cracked I take care of my disks and
stuff<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.970> can't<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.890> doesn't

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
stuff so it can't be that and it doesn't

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.620 
stuff so it can't be that and it doesn't
happen<00:01:14.280> every<00:01:14.640> game<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:14.939> sometimes<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.570> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
happen every game but sometimes when I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.539 
happen every game but sometimes when I
try<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.869> look<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.170> people's<00:01:16.409> emblems<00:01:16.950> or<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
try and look at people's emblems or you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.700 
try and look at people's emblems or you
know<00:01:17.670> their<00:01:17.850> titles<00:01:18.299> nothing<00:01:18.900> loads<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.530> it's

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
know their titles nothing loads in it's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.830 
know their titles nothing loads in it's
just<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> Treyarch<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.759> logo<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
just that Treyarch little logo with the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.340 
just that Treyarch little logo with the
loading<00:01:22.590> symbol<00:01:23.159> thingy<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
loading symbol thingy on it I think it's

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.960 
loading symbol thingy on it I think it's
just<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.680> laggy<00:01:25.890> game<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> know
