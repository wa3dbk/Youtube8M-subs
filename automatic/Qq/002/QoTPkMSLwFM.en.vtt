00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.010 
space and everything I know that doesn't
even<00:01:56.369> sound<00:01:56.520> all<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.060> specials<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.840> what

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
even sound all that specials like what

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.539 
even sound all that specials like what
have<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.200> never<00:01:58.320> seen<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.829> story<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.219> anime

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
have we never seen this story in anime

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.490 
have we never seen this story in anime
before<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> fact<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.140> being<00:02:01.320> done

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
before but the fact that it's being done

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080 
before but the fact that it's being done
by<00:02:01.649> bones<00:02:01.890> animation<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.759> makes<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
by bones animation I think makes it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.630 
by bones animation I think makes it
worth<00:02:03.210> looking<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.619> next<00:02:04.920> show<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.399> I'm

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
they're like earlier students they're

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.490 
they're like earlier students they're

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
just look so cute and bubbly and that's

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.400 
just look so cute and bubbly and that's
not<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.580> say<00:04:24.759> that<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:25.300> characters<00:04:25.660> in<00:04:25.690> Soul

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
not to say that the characters in Soul

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.990 
not to say that the characters in Soul
Eater<00:04:26.560> don't<00:04:26.860> look<00:04:27.009> that<00:04:27.130> way<00:04:27.310> sometimes<00:04:27.729> but

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
Eater don't look that way sometimes but

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.909 
Eater don't look that way sometimes but
it<00:04:28.600> just<00:04:28.750> looks<00:04:28.840> completely<00:04:29.350> different<00:04:29.650> from

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
it just looks completely different from

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.260 
it just looks completely different from
some<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.250> stuff<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.490> I've<00:04:30.729> seen<00:04:30.970> from

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
some of the stuff that I've seen from

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.390 
some of the stuff that I've seen from
soul<00:04:31.539> eater<00:04:31.660> before<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.380> that's<00:04:33.220> really

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
soul eater before and that's really

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.100 
soul eater before and that's really
interesting<00:04:33.639> because<00:04:33.910> soul<00:04:34.300> eater<00:04:34.479> can<00:04:34.720> go<00:04:35.050> to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
interesting because soul eater can go to

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.010 
interesting because soul eater can go to
some<00:04:35.380> surprisingly<00:04:36.039> dark<00:04:36.280> places<00:04:36.639> but<00:04:37.539> I<00:04:37.750> want

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
some surprisingly dark places but I want

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.810 
some surprisingly dark places but I want
to<00:04:38.050> see<00:04:38.199> where<00:04:38.350> it's<00:04:38.440> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.590> go<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:39.070> might
