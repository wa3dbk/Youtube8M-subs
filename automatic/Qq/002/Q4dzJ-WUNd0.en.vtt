00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.720
 hello everyone today at 1 by smoothing frizzy hair there 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.720
 be aware that a little before listing your hair you must not have 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.780
 properly fed having made a deal for the channels as I wanted 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.190
 already shown I'm going to make a little video for all the skeptics so 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.330
 who leaves us full of comments on my video she is wise hair in 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.489
 wondering if I thought my hair was really here 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.800
 so here I want to clarify that this idea with the estimated percent 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.779
 almost three days after 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.380
 and therefore jonquiÃ¨re 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.060
 but I'm actually repeating no more 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.180
 and so if I had been in your place and watched this video 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.710
 coming from a third person I would have exactly the same question as you 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 so I wanted to restore you true the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.090
 if you want it 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.570
 change in kind somehow the opposite of the wheels at least the ideas 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.970
 that you could have 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.800
 to be made in 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.670
 looking at this video so I do not look at me end the flaw on this 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.730
 video is the soundtrack I recorded kills our tape are not 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.600
 what I was much too vindictive the during long extracts 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.080
 video so I changed my speech a bit 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.880
 % and so 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.979
 gentlemen 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.090
 the young and smooth 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.530
 after a flood and having properly fed school I read them some sites 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.170
 they are much more beautiful so you can see it on the video I think 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.060
 that they are religious shakes their heads many times to show that they do not 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.650
 are not static and motion tyson 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.160
 to the hairstyle and a very retro hairstyle that's why it is 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.509
 a lot of volume 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.509
 I like when my players have volume even when they are alive 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.920
 why I put them never read m 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.120
 in a move to make them believable 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.220
 I always make a curvy% because downhill standing shot I do not know 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.650
 how to say that 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.770
 it ends the bible of babble what I use which act and broken 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.280
 natural curls and my hair 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.200
 and not then the high school students were then so I offered myself that's me 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.160
 cost about 35 euros 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.940
 % estimating that up to 230 degrees and for those who at a button to choose 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.850
 an average temperature besides the pressure at both 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.580
 om it also has a button for to block the two frame in the process of 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.580
 peace is that as a baker you spoil your ceramic plates 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.670
 so to you can see my hair from 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.340
 if I estimate are in contention I it's not at what degree of 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.929
 at what degree of olive dahan you would expect it to be I would like to 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:28.609
 specify that they are natural 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.779
 so I'm going to show you some pictures that was summer 2009 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.799
 so the hair is well anchored over the curl 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.510
 and that's the message that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.239
 in e2 after the video 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.419
 who was studying ideals by the way that I spend that until now because 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.879
 I think a lot of you are intrigued 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.430
 so we see the hair very important and all that it will go then series will have 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.569
 so summer will have again summer 2009 or hours 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:00.569
 a misdeed before and when it is indeed after year the coloring makes that one has 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.619
 the impression that I know albino 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:06.589
 oh yes so you wear well everyone whose courage to all those and 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:11.499
 those who have exams I kiss you very strong to see what 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.299
 Goodness greeted
