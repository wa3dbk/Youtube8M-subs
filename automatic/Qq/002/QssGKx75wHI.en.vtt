Jory: (in monotone for intro only) Hello, this is "Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?" I'm 
Jory Caron, and I'm your host. They say, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away."

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.379
I'll bet an apple that's on fire will really make sure that doctor 
 never comes knockin'! So, let's go try and catch it on fire!

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.385
*theme song plays*

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.453
Jory: Let's go roast some nuts!

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.409
Jory: I wonder how long I should put it in there? Three minutes? Okay!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.957
Jory: Ventilation is key!

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.425
Jory: Oh, jeez!

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.425
Jory: Oh, jeez!

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:28.994
Jory: Safety is our number-one concern.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.428
Jory: Yeah, I think it's just gonna catch fire.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.030
Jory: 'Cause nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.832
Jory: Definitely a good idea!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.133
Jory: Stopping, stopping!

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:37.248
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:51.971
Let's go find out! Here at the Jory Caron Laboratory, Part II, safety is our number-one concern. We have a 
 tin foil shield here, so we don't roast our nuts... Look up here! 'Cause nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:52.886 --> 00:01:04.886
Jory: We also have two fans, not really sufficient, just showin' off. We have two fans, 
it's pretty cool. And, as always, our Sharp microwave, still singed from the last experiment.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:22.866
Jory: And there's also burnt ink! That's exciting! So, in goes the apple. We even left the 
 sticker on! Okay, so I wonder how long we should put this one in there for?

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.550
Jon: Four minutes.

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.885
Jory: Four minutes? Sounds like a good idea!

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.288
Jory: Go, go, go!

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.926
Jon: Alright, Jory, what do you think's gonna happen this time?

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:45.062
Jory: I hope what will happen is that it'll look like one of those slow-motion apple-getting-shot-by-a-bullet videos, 
where it just kinda blows up. That probably won't happen, but that's what I HOPE...

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.040
Jory: Oh! It just rolled over. It just kinda exploded over. Something happened.

00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:54.430
Ezra: When life gives you apples, make applesauce!

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.520
Jory: Something must've happened, because it wouldn't have just rolled over on its side.

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:59.380
Jon: When life gives me a microwave, I stick an apple in it!

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:10.560
Jory: Oh! It's definitely smoking out of the bottom. I think it split. It's probably gonna 
 smell a whole lot better in there, that's for sure. 'Cause nature can't hurt ya!

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.370
Jory: Yeah, it's definitely foaming around that cut.

00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:17.050
Ezra: Grizzly bears are from nature, and they can definitely hurt you, Jory!

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.140
Jory: Uh, not Smokey! He wouldn't hurt you!

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:26.040
Jon: Yeah, it's, like, foaming at the cut.

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:33.680
Jory: Yeah, it's definitely foaming at the cut. Applesauce is definitely 
coming out of that! That's probably how they do it.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:39.620
Ezra: Do you think you could make apple pie by cooking the apples in 
 the microwave first, and then slicing them up when they're already cooked?

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.630
Jory: That'd save time, that'd save time!

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.460
Ezra: It might be a good idea!

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:49.530
Jory: And if you use it with the soy sauce already in 
there, you probably don't have to use cinammon. Soy sauce, cinnamon?

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.370
Ezra: That's gross!

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.270
Jory: It's an Asian method!

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.740
Ezra: (laughs) They don't know [beep] about apple pie over there!

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.780
So now, let's go and see what we've just created. I'm 
betting a little bit of a steam type of deal.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:23.320
Jory: Wow! It has age spots on it, actually! And it 
looks almost like... Ooh, yeah! It's like a baked potato!

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.040
Jon: Touch it, Jory! Aw, man, that thing just split open!

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:27.170
Jory; Okay, let's scoop that onto the tray.

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:39.640
Jon: Alright! Look at that! This is our victim's tray we're bringing 
 in now. We're gonna unload the latest one, Mr. Apple.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:46.550
Jory: Oh, nice, nice! Maybe if it's an especially cold day...

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.560
Ezra: That's softer than (mumbles)...

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:55.930
Jon: Wow! That's still comin' off steam, too! It's like a baked 
 potato! The skin of the apple acts like tin foil.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.540
Jory: I'm not gonna try it, but...

00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:00.700
Ezra: I'LL try it!

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.770
Jory: Oh, my God!

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.680
Jon: (to Ezra) You'd probably burn your tongue, dude. That thing's still smokin'.

00:04:05.017 --> 00:04:18.020
Honestly, I really didn't see any negative effects from that. There weren't any flames, no smoke, no explosions. It's pretty 
safe for you to do. If you're making applesauce, it's, like, one step ahead of you. It's already warm.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:32.360
So, is it a good idea to microwave this? Absolutely! It depends what you're doing, of course, but yeah! Well, that's it for "Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?" I'm Jory Caron.

00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:37.740
