00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.099
 hello everyone and welcome to another 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.619
 analysis of adventure time theories 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.449
 for the fans of theories I find myself 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.489
 with some setbacks and I could not 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.650
 finish reviewing all theories 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:22.840
 of the previous video so I do not know 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.790
 despair will come out as a special where 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.529
 I will announce the 10 best and 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.410
 I will also make a mention of 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.300
 those very crazy and good so 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.129
 after the announcement now we will see this 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.899
 theory and I do not mean the theory of 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.120
 lemon hope becomes 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.010
 prism nor that this arm is that of 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.440
 end much less will we talk about end 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.620
 morton's alternating clear that not today 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.270
 we will see 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.270
 the lost arm of the end 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.950
 since the grass sword episode 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.960
 we see that end is cursed with the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.210
 power of it in addition to always 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.940
 It is trying to get rid of it this 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.250
 it ends returning according to the magician of 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.540
 grass the sword is cursed and will be 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.540
 united to end forever 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.460
 if we take this part as true that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.650
 means that when end it lost its 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.570
 arm the remaining body of the grass 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.060
 takes a semi human form which 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.160
 retains the arm of its carrier even 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.870
 I could say that he is looking for 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.510
 return to him I have come to the conclusion 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.180
 that the grass sword is looking for 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.430
 so the sword is wandering in the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.640
 space waiting to find an end and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.100
 join him again so the sword 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.229
 of grass to be detached from end is 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.270
 Look for a way to return your carrier 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.460
 you may meet her when 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.320
 appear again his father the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.420
 which one I still say is a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.130
 kind of space pirate which 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 will come to today's world maybe it will 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.180
 unleash a great war 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.399
 -clearly- we still have to see what happens 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.740
 with the new end arm which seems 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.860
 be only temporary as well as your desire to 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.720
 Revenge remember friends and subscribers 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.399
 that this is just another theory that 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.350
 can be denied in any 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.420
 moment I just hope that troll hangs 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.250
 guard stop discarding all theories 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.250
 and at least let's hit something 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.850
 do not 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.799
 do not 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.099
 to
