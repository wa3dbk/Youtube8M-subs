dollar twenty per set of lashes in a box

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.960 
dollar twenty per set of lashes in a box
I<00:02:29.959> mean<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.220> much<00:02:31.489> more<00:02:31.549> affordable

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
I mean that is so much more affordable

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.199 
I mean that is so much more affordable
than<00:02:32.299> like<00:02:32.989> 350<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.310> four<00:02:34.549> dollars<00:02:34.880> for<00:02:35.180> a

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
than like 350 and four dollars for a

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.800 
than like 350 and four dollars for a
pair<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.510> lashes<00:02:35.739> um<00:02:36.739> because<00:02:37.730> they<00:02:38.690> are

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
pair of lashes um because they are

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.110 
pair of lashes um because they are
synthetic<00:02:39.319> they<00:02:39.500> do<00:02:39.560> not<00:02:40.010> curl<00:02:40.459> quite<00:02:40.730> as<00:02:40.880> well

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
synthetic they do not curl quite as well

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.250 
synthetic they do not curl quite as well
as<00:02:41.480> regular<00:02:43.269> natural<00:02:44.269> hair<00:02:44.450> glasses<00:02:44.690> and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
as regular natural hair glasses and

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.130 
as regular natural hair glasses and
they're<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.190> little<00:02:46.400> more<00:02:46.519> stiff<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.540> if<00:02:47.810> you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
they're a little more stiff but if you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.140 
they're a little more stiff but if you
just<00:02:48.440> do<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.010> inchworm<00:02:49.459> thing<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.940> I'll<00:02:50.000> show

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
just do the inchworm thing and I'll show

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.759 
just do the inchworm thing and I'll show
you<00:02:50.180> what<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.390> mean<00:02:50.480> by<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.840> by<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.410> inch<00:02:51.620> worm

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
you what I mean by that by the inch worm

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.690 
you what I mean by that by the inch worm
thing<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:53.030> bend<00:02:53.540> your<00:02:53.930> band<00:02:54.739> back<00:02:55.489> and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
thing is you bend your band back and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.069 
thing is you bend your band back and
forth<00:02:55.910> like<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:57.519> I'm<00:02:58.519> this<00:02:59.000> specific<00:02:59.540> set

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
forth like so I'm this specific set

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.110 
forth like so I'm this specific set
which<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.620> 40<00:03:02.470> 40<00:03:03.470> these<00:03:04.280> ones<00:03:04.430> aren't<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.820> stiff

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
which is 40 40 these ones aren't a stiff

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.190 
which is 40 40 these ones aren't a stiff
so<00:03:05.329> these<00:03:05.450> ones<00:03:05.630> are<00:03:05.750> actually<00:03:05.840> already

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
so these ones are actually already

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.460 
so these ones are actually already
really<00:03:06.950> flexible<00:03:07.340> but<00:03:08.060> like<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.390> 44's<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.350> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
really flexible but like the 44's in the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.560 
really flexible but like the 44's in the
19-teens<00:03:09.920> or<00:03:10.220> 19<00:03:10.820> tees<00:03:11.090> they're<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.420> little

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
19-teens or 19 tees they're a little

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.569 
19-teens or 19 tees they're a little
more<00:03:11.690> stiff<00:03:12.079> so<00:03:12.709> if<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:12.859> just<00:03:13.040> do<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.370> with<00:03:13.549> a

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
more stiff so if you just do this with a

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.319 
more stiff so if you just do this with a
band<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.239> will<00:03:14.630> help<00:03:15.910> make<00:03:16.910> them<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> little

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
band it will help make them a little

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.360 
band it will help make them a little
more<00:03:17.450> flexible<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.019> easier<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.470> apply<00:03:18.680> so

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
more flexible and easier to apply so

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.569 
more flexible and easier to apply so
it's<00:03:19.730> really<00:03:19.970> not<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.299> big<00:03:20.420> deal<00:03:20.750> definitely

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
it's really not a big deal definitely

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.750 
it's really not a big deal definitely
worth<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:24.079> money<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:25.130> you'll<00:03:25.280> spend<00:03:25.609> on

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
worth the money that you'll spend on

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.599 
worth the money that you'll spend on
them<00:03:26.200> or<00:03:27.200> with<00:03:27.319> a<00:03:27.440> little<00:03:27.769> amount<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.459> money

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
them or with a little amount of money

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.220 
them or with a little amount of money
that<00:03:28.700> you'll<00:03:28.970> spend<00:03:29.239> on<00:03:29.390> them<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:33.079> other

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
that you'll spend on them the other

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.960 
that you'll spend on them the other
thing<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:33.980> not<00:03:34.069> really<00:03:34.400> an<00:03:34.489> issue<00:03:34.609> because

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
thing it's not really an issue because

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.670 
thing it's not really an issue because
some<00:03:35.359> people<00:03:35.600> have<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:36.049> trim<00:03:36.350> their<00:03:36.500> lashes

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
some people have to trim their lashes

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.490 
some people have to trim their lashes
anyways<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:38.170> that<00:03:40.660> not<00:03:41.660> all<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.019> lashes<00:03:42.350> are

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
anyways is that not all the lashes are

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.860 
anyways is that not all the lashes are
like<00:03:42.620> this<00:03:42.769> but<00:03:43.010> some<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:44.030> them<00:03:44.180> are<00:03:44.359> a<00:03:44.420> lot<00:03:44.840> of

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
like this but some of them are a lot of

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.740 
like this but some of them are a lot of
them<00:03:45.079> are<00:03:45.290> they<00:03:45.889> have<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.160> little<00:03:49.480> they<00:03:50.480> have<00:03:50.720> a

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
them are they have a little they have a

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.809 
them are they have a little they have a
little<00:03:52.840> thick<00:03:53.840> like<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.260> little<00:03:54.680> catch<00:03:55.340> on<00:03:55.639> the

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
little thick like a little catch on the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.759 
little thick like a little catch on the
end<00:03:55.970> that's<00:03:56.780> not<00:03:56.959> really<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.290> big<00:03:57.470> deal<00:03:57.500> because

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
end that's not really a big deal because

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.670
