much was watching it it made a very

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.480 
much was watching it it made a very
strong<00:02:52.250> statement<00:02:52.610> on<00:02:54.040> where<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.160> country

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
strong statement on where the country

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.540 
strong statement on where the country
could<00:02:55.700> potentially<00:02:56.330> go<00:02:56.540> or<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:58.100> know<00:02:58.220> it

could potentially go or you know it

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.330 
could potentially go or you know it
definitely<00:02:59.230> states<00:03:00.230> two<00:03:00.590> ways<00:03:00.800> this<00:03:01.040> is<00:03:01.190> how

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
definitely states two ways this is how

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.520 
definitely states two ways this is how
is<00:03:01.670> how<00:03:01.880> things<00:03:02.090> can<00:03:02.300> work<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.380> this

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
is how things can work this is this

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.380 
is how things can work this is this
movie<00:03:03.830> bipartisan<00:03:04.430> or<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.790> lefty<00:03:05.270> or

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
the political dialogue was a little bit

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.110 
the political dialogue was a little bit
tedious<00:03:56.170> it's<00:03:56.590> slow<00:03:56.920> where<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.730> needs<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:58.030> be

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
tedious it's slow where it needs to be

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.510 
tedious it's slow where it needs to be
but<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:58.900> really<00:03:59.110> it's<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.739> very<00:04:00.040> well<00:04:00.310> put

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520
