00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:10.570
 Nice to meet you school teacher 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:15.190
 I hate words that are catcher sensitivity is pta Thank you 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:21.669
 I think that greeting how everyone I to say that had the teacher era 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.820
 Even longer Hey teachers there but it is hope ended in early really I I talk of the principal teacher 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.970
 I'm thinking 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.310
 Please once Hey, look at each one face of the teacher 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.820
 I want hordes of ship laugh because we are dead as great 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:40.550
 The meaning is also true, but it is my partner 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:46.820
 The principal once talks completely with the story in the staff room 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:51.300
 Nenehana I can use my own story and try it before it can be used in front of you 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:56.850
 It's because I'm crawling, it's our second time talking about that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.290
 I combed'm want to say this in one shot first in the vibrato to what is I really ne another political party 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.399
 Rub with us 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:07.570
 Would say was Choi I ride tone ne ne in the zone with the other constraints 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.990
 I go made to be quiet I know are talking Hi bottom 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.420
 The principal should be the quietest 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.420
 And just please laugh at us 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.020
 I love the principal 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.750
 I also said that I was seated in the staff room I sat facing each other teacher 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.770
 That 's why it's awkward to meet eyes , so I'm making a wall 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.460
 I wonder if the textbook Toka problem Collection Toka national language of the Handbook 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.460
 I before I physical education teacher but I'm so that can not see the face in 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 It also Naa I's right 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.049
 That's why I think that the eyes of the physical education system that meet the eye look at the eyes unique to run and talk 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.200
 You 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.039
 I want you to put in a ball or something 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.149
 A soccer ball floats in the pool and a ball to Nepal on the ceiling of the gymnasium 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.720
 It will come out 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.620
 It would be nice if you got lots of muscles 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.690
 I 'm feeling fine- oh 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:08.890
 Well I say so live, but it is a teacher all day long jersey 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:13.810
 How are you in the jersey or team jersey? 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.620
 You What do you break through the first round jersey Championship 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.620
 It is not such 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.950
 I love carpenter teachers 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.760
