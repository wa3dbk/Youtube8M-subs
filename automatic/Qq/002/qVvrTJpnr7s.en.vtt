00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.110 

we<00:01:44.159> could<00:01:44.400> bring<00:01:44.850> Google<00:01:45.180> Maps<00:01:46.220> okay<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.280> we

we could bring Google Maps okay so we

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.060 
we could bring Google Maps okay so we
got<00:01:48.270> two<00:01:48.570> things<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.080> each<00:01:49.200> side<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.950> know

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
got two things on each side you know

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.070 
got two things on each side you know
it's<00:01:50.310> cool<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.180> we've<00:01:51.390> seen<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:51.840> before

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
it's cool but we've seen this before

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.580 
it's cool but we've seen this before
right<00:01:52.530> let's<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.700> couple<00:01:54.300> more

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
right let's go for a couple more

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
right let's go for a couple more
quadrants<00:01:55.590> all<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.510> can<00:01:57.659> even<00:01:57.750> put

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
quadrants all right so you can even put

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.830 
quadrants all right so you can even put
more<00:01:58.350> things<00:01:58.710> here

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.559 

so<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.229> four<00:02:07.860> quadrants<00:02:08.700> happening<00:02:09.300> here

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
so we have four quadrants happening here

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.479 
so we have four quadrants happening here
this<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.080> only<00:02:10.259> tabla<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.979> world<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
this is the only tabla in the world that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.420 
this is the only tabla in the world that
