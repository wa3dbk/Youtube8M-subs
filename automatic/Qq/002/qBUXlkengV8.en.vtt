00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
hi this is Joe Delaney from digit tech

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.789 
hi this is Joe Delaney from digit tech
and<00:00:05.819> we're<00:00:05.940> here<00:00:06.089> at<00:00:06.210> NAMM<00:00:06.450> 2015<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.620> have<00:00:07.740> a

and what we're calling it it's a band
creator<00:00:19.350> now<00:00:20.160> when<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.640> say<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.500> it's<00:00:22.500> very

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
creator now when we say that it's very

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.330 
creator now when we say that it's very
simple<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.000> use<00:00:24.029> piece<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:25.019> very<00:00:25.529> complex<00:00:26.189> in

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
simple to use piece but very complex in

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.560 
simple to use piece but very complex in
the<00:00:26.430> engineering<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.000> went<00:00:27.150> into<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the engineering that went into it

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.439 
the engineering that went into it
basically<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.010> plug<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> guitar<00:00:29.519> into<00:00:30.269> this

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
basically if you plug a guitar into this

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.080 
basically if you plug a guitar into this
and<00:00:30.920> let's<00:00:31.920> say<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.130> play<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.730> chord

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and let's say you play a chord

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.910 
and let's say you play a chord
progression<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.870> whatever<00:00:34.110> tempo<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
progression and whatever tempo that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.910 
progression and whatever tempo that
you're<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.730> you're<00:00:35.880> playing<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.920> it'll

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
you're that you're playing it in it'll

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.700 
you're that you're playing it in it'll
intuitively<00:00:38.700> learn<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.989> played<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
intuitively learn what you played and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.639 
intuitively learn what you played and
then<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.430> bass<00:00:41.700> player<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> drummer<00:00:42.649> will

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
then a bass player and a drummer will

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.010 
then a bass player and a drummer will
kick<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> play<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> mean

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
kick in and play with you so I mean

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.520 
kick in and play with you so I mean
really<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:47.450> Malia's<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> band<00:00:48.870> creator<00:00:49.320> and

getting a rhythm section with your
guitar<00:00:52.860> playing<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.940> got<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> guitar<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
guitar playing it's got a guitar in it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.260 
guitar playing it's got a guitar in it
also<00:00:55.379> has<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> control<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.820> expand
