00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.110
 many 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.500
 the materials that are used to 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.960
 as the same seen previously 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.960
 It is stainless steel 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.010
 the lady speaks and has 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.850
 different types of steel 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.850
 this 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:02.610
 this is the ideal 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.610
 this is the way you do not speak 316 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.670
 we have the 304 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:20.570
 3 0 4 and 0 3 0 4 these two materialize 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.880
 the ideal to generate hydrogen 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.229
 I explain myself 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.229
 can be used 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.030
 the first option is between 16 do not know 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.960
 get in tradition that takes to the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.350
 304 if you do not get 304 then there's 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 what to improvise 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.220
 and any other type 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.200
 this is important that you have in 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.229
 account 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.670
 the material that is too flexible does not 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.600
 it serves 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.130
 reasons why it's because the plates 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.130
 they have to be kept close 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.920
 and flexibility sometimes brings what 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.080
 called the curvature this material after 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.399
 that curves there is no one to bring it to 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.500
 behind 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.989
 you can use of course that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.870
 material and can be assumed try to see 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.709
 how they keep it 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.870
 separated from each other but you can not 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.870
 count because if you count this was created 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.180
 a way to identify 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.590
 Stainless steel is very important 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.000
 because many times the body suddenly 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.470
 if you do not get in 30 304 can 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.940
 get any other time that if 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.780
 there are people who shorten mold making 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.080
 people 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.590
 has disarmed this portal of 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.540
 refrigerators makes different types of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.160
 things but I really do not have the least 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.170
 idea of ​​what kind is what materials 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.830
 it is known perhaps negotiable but it is not 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.290
 knows what it is 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.780
 then the important way to identify 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.850
 it is 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.640
 but still this is previously a 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:10.840
 application and this is a magnet 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.840
 and the piece is made of common metal 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.480
 there was a closing 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.480
 it does not stick 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.060
 that's the way to look 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.630
 if it sticks it does not work 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.080
 in common 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:47.710
 then magnet to know what it is to do 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.650
 speed there are many people who have 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:56.220
 spent trying and calling me and telling me 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.220
 inside does not work well 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.790
 it's here on the plates and then they tell me 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.450
 nothing like that I found that the big plates 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.670
 so good what they are going to 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.560
 improvise aggravation encourage and seek 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.659
 can find trays can 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.419
 find a way to make a city 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.680
 double doors real refrigerators 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.700
 different kinds of things 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.430
 I do not recommend that 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.830
 If they work with stainless steel they use 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.300
 gloves because the sedena always has 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.240
 a lot of edge 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.650
 do not forgive 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.710
 when it enters the short meat and with the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.670
 ruin 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.360
 so if they are going to cut with scissors or what 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.710
 let it be remembered good 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.710
 and he cut me a glove 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.620
 if he had not had leather gloves what 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.620
 completely cut 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.340
 then any material that go to 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.130
 use 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.440
 remember if you are going to cut it with scissors 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.340
 I would recommend that you look for some 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.289
 kind of 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.960
 of business such as a tournament 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.169
 or some place of metals that would 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.370
 cut because honestly 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.370
 It is very hard 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.340
 the lord and if he breaks me I said break 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.340
 It breaks wick when it is 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.260
 then we have already gone through the 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.450
 most important things the matter of the 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.640
 basics security and now we're going 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.280
 then to compensate to start with a 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.240
 armed 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.240
 of a cell
