00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.240
 because an amateur 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.890
 the trauma program is on and so 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.470
 his drums sound created then had 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.050
 the possibility of a big one 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.780
 studio also he has a good sounding 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.330
 Drum played by a super in 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.900
 a nice room with a 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.910
 abundance of supermicros the man 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.520
 tried a while before getting it right 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.710
 It's a luxury to go to 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.630
 home in the cellar studio does not have and the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.780
 you just by the ramadan at home too 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.780
 Has 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.020
 So the reason why like acrylic 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.000
 just because of that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.770
 we special in Jamaica 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.540
 It had to be the prerequisites 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.520
 Introduce microphones in their 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.770
 characteristic and and their characteristics 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.000
 and accordingly we have, of course 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.759
 known from the outset 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.799
 there is no signal processing after 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.810
 the recording so no colleagues no 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.670
 com pressing nothing in between 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.560
 that means we need from the beginning 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.729
 very clean ground sound and one 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.350
 homogeneous reason 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.789
 and that is why we have chosen us 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.170
 Acrylic decided because it is simply the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:02:00.920
 optimal conditions for this 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:02.420
 brings the cardinal error in 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.149
 your microphone is that most 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.890
 people do not trust their ears but 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.560
 they say okay this is a drums 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.870
 Microphone that belongs to the teams 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.160
 that's why it was for the teams 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.930
 They would not think about it 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.340
 that you can plug into the kick drum 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.340
 or to try vocal 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.909
 I like to keep my headphones on 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.250
 I agree because then I just higher what 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:31.120
 over the microphone comes over signal 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.370
 and that is often amazing how 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.980
 different that is one has one 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.900
 experience a sound experience at the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.540
 drum itself then about that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.540
 microphone completely different comes over 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.470
 if I did drums receiving then 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.599
 I like to take the xy microphone honoring 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.879
 as a basis I have with the 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.349
 Beatles looked 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.239
 which is synonymous with dynamic micros 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.579
 have taken for the overheads and 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.930
 That's why I like to try that first 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.910
 traditional that I have a big one 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.980
 membrane-take and then I change the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.680
 mikros and stick some dynamic 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.879
 microphones and to watch which 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.879
 Sound impression I like better 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.190
 it's really about it 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.770
 Concrete microphones to check out and that 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.750
 I find that particularly interesting because that 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.300
 just one possibility is the one 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.550
 otherwise not so often you have limited 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.740
 from a microphone the choice and has 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.300
 Just keep that what you have what you have 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.100
 and I have to use that, too 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.510
 and here I can really say 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.550
 Okay, I have one or two now 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.500
 the other micro with exactly the same 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.440
 signal I find that special 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.420
 Interestingly easy to determine that 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.160
 There are also huge differences 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.460
 effective and that's not just magic 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.460
 is
