00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.110
 Let me ask you a question you Crisis 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.480
 I would be surprised if I told you that the army 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.379
 who has attributed 960 deaths 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.379

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.680
 you think you could see or do things 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.220

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.220

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.770

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.080
 of worrying you can pass 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 I'm looking forward to meet my creator 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.300
 and answer for each of my shots 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.170
 do not take that 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.230

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.619
 good 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.649

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.649
 people that I have not been able to heal 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 and see what happens to my daughter 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.680
