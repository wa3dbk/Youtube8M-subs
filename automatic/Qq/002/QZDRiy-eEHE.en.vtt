 It is a corner of the research institute that taught me well started 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.520
 8 This is a corner This is an answer to questions asked by viewers 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.320
 Though it is 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.410

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:36.500
 It's not that mania, but there is something else &amp; cheap 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.920
 Since Masu Mr. adult's point of view 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.000

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:50.930

 8 Ne google 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.790

 Already 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.040
 Oh dear 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.870
 I'm wondering if it's about the title 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.050
 If this is it, though 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.590
 Both first and last 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.140
 Kedomo Are there Toka sea Mara cover that person who does not come out 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:41.990
 I will come out at the end of the side step 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:48.590
 What say Fu, such that in the final to knit in the battle of Shah Noah 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:54.619
 I will answer myself in the final round when I ask myself 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:59.539
 Apparently, rather than the view that biased AMRO man 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:02.010
 How does the place where people say changes 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.820
 Or do not change how 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.170
 Is it good? 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.430
 I'm thinking about something like a financial drummer 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.500
 Nechotto You know me in that Daite You know who 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.330
 I say tell me I'm say cool it that 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:26.030
 I don't want to admit it, I say something that is bothering because it is young 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.910
 Vinegar miso also Kedomo'm a man Do you I say words that he set up in such a little oblique 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.990
 That again 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:37.210
 Kedomo each music pacific saury is I think that can be seen if you watch it 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:40.080
 It's Kore when Shaa stands on that kind of slant and says serif 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.850
 We always went to his 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.000
 You've been entered into their own 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:51.060
 But there is also a place where it is a famous star that's why it's a little demand because it's a boy 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.200
 Since this also will go to their own 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.100
 Where to cut 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.040
 I think that drum Gundam series drama 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.910
 k deep that 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.480
 It is that I wonder I'm such thing 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.610
 I can understand and understand 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.880
 Sleep even if you understand it to children 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.870
 It is impossible 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.730
 Story What Dema of the adults of that point of view 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.710
 I because I'm a colleague Rep. 2 children 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.240
 But that of my wife's eyes 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.460
 Because making a drama 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.410
 Also say I Toka cool with screws are sound is to understand Do not unreasonable all the little ne children 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.750
 That's good, but 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:35.660
 But the main thing of that story is not that place 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.290
 Hey kid 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.650
 I wonder if 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.650
 I think a bit like that, but I feel like that
