trying to protect something apparently
attack<00:00:25.890> gear<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.210> sides<00:00:27.599> into<00:00:28.250> one<00:00:29.250> thing

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
attack gear so two sides into one thing

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.069 
attack gear so two sides into one thing
get<00:00:30.570> four<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.349> make<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> car<00:00:32.540> hit<00:00:33.540> do

get four of them and make a car hit do
in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> W<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> balanced<00:00:36.030> type<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.280> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
in the W this is a balanced type so that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.229 
in the W this is a balanced type so that
means<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:38.870> video<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:41.329> shaped<00:00:42.379> for<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:44.239> power

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
means so video is shaped for like power

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.610 
means so video is shaped for like power
and<00:00:45.450> speed<00:00:47.059> here's<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.480> parts<00:00:48.809> all

life more rigid yo can kill someone fit
okay<00:01:08.130> let's<00:01:08.909> assemble<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.500> what's<00:01:10.650> going

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
okay let's assemble this so what's going

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
okay let's assemble this so what's going
to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.040> put<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> axle<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to do is put the axle first and then you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200 
to do is put the axle first and then you
combine<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.369> big<00:01:14.549> wheel<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
combine it to the big wheel and you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.260 
combine it to the big wheel and you
screw<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> tack<00:01:16.189> counterclockwise<00:01:17.270> remember

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
screw the tack counterclockwise remember

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.700 
screw the tack counterclockwise remember
it's<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.900> righty-tighty

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it's not righty-tighty

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.030 
it's not righty-tighty
but<00:01:19.830> counterclockwise<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> way<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> go

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
but counterclockwise is the way to go

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.570 
but counterclockwise is the way to go
dang<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.409> black<00:01:25.740> wheel<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.490> like
