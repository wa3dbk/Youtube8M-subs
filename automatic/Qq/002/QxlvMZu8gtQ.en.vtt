coach<00:02:18.880> recommended<00:02:19.390> i<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:19.510> i<00:02:19.870> am<00:02:20.740> getting<00:02:20.980> to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
coach recommended i do i am getting to

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.949 
coach recommended i do i am getting to
like<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> 45<00:02:21.760> degree<00:02:21.850> angle<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.360> top<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:22.810> i<00:02:22.840> do

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
like a 45 degree angle the top so i do

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.650 
like a 45 degree angle the top so i do
have<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.260> watch<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.770> bit<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:25.480> make

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
have to watch that a bit and just make

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.570 
have to watch that a bit and just make
sure<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.810> stay<00:02:25.900> more<00:02:26.320> parallel<00:02:26.709> but<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.459> most

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
sure I stay more parallel but the most

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.400 
sure I stay more parallel but the most
important<00:02:28.030> part<00:02:28.239> with<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.540> exercise<00:02:29.110> I'm

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
important part with this exercise I'm

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.070 
important part with this exercise I'm
noticing<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:30.070> letting<00:02:30.670> yourself<00:02:31.239> get<00:02:31.450> back<00:02:31.810> to

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
noticing is letting yourself get back to

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.040 
noticing is letting yourself get back to
parallel<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.739> stretch<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.640> lats<00:02:34.050> so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
parallel and stretch in the lats so

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.930 
parallel and stretch in the lats so
let's<00:02:35.200> check<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.590> out<00:02:35.800> here<00:02:36.070> I'll<00:02:36.250> normally

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
let's check this out here I'll normally

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.640 
let's check this out here I'll normally
when<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.090> do<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.239> barbell<00:02:37.660> row<00:02:37.840> I'll<00:02:38.080> keep<00:02:38.410> my

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
when I do a barbell row I'll keep my

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.560 
when I do a barbell row I'll keep my
shoulder<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.100> super<00:02:39.400> retracted<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.060> low<00:02:40.300> and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
shoulder is super retracted and low and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.620 
shoulder is super retracted and low and
here<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.440> almost<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> half<00:02:42.850> dead<00:02:43.330> lift

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
here it's almost like a half dead lift

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.479 
here it's almost like a half dead lift
to<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.019> shrub<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> row<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.250> I'm<00:02:45.340> going<00:02:45.459> to

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
to a shrub to a row so I'm going to

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.790 
to a shrub to a row so I'm going to
perfect<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:47.019> do<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.290> how<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.440> feel

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
perfect this and just do it how I feel

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.340 
perfect this and just do it how I feel
is<00:02:47.950> best<00:02:48.190> but<00:02:49.030> when<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.330> add<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.600> couple

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
is best but when you add that couple

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.470 
is best but when you add that couple
inches<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.739> range<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.370> stretches<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.239> hell

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
inches of range it stretches the hell

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.170 
inches of range it stretches the hell
out<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.780> your<00:02:52.989> lower<00:02:53.140> lash<00:02:53.440> your<00:02:53.739> upper<00:02:53.980> back

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
out of your lower lash your upper back

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.000 
out of your lower lash your upper back
everything<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.480> give<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.959> shot<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.440> do

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
everything so give it a shot and do

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.800 
everything so give it a shot and do
tailor<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.489> your<00:02:57.610> body<00:02:57.910> because<00:02:58.450> if<00:02:58.720> you

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
tailor it to your body because if you

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.449 
tailor it to your body because if you
have<00:02:58.930> super<00:02:59.170> short<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.769> strong<00:02:59.950> arms<00:03:00.310> of

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
have super short and strong arms of

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.070 
have super short and strong arms of
pilot<00:03:00.850> defending<00:03:01.269> someone<00:03:01.450> with<00:03:01.630> long<00:03:01.900> and

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
pilot defending someone with long and

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.570 
pilot defending someone with long and
weak<00:03:02.200> arms<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:03.150> assuming

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
weak arms just assuming

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.390 
weak arms just assuming
but<00:03:05.450> I'm<00:03:05.600> after<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.110> second<00:03:06.440> exercise<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:07.160> was

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
but I'm after that second exercise I was

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.480 
but I'm after that second exercise I was
ten<00:03:07.700> sets<00:03:07.970> deep<00:03:08.270> um<00:03:08.510> er<00:03:09.380> like<00:03:09.710> nine<00:03:09.950> sets<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
ten sets deep um er like nine sets the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.490 
ten sets deep um er like nine sets the
excluding<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.330> warm-ups<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:11.870> decided<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.470> just

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
excluding the warm-ups I decided to just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.620 
excluding the warm-ups I decided to just
throw<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.860> 225<00:03:13.490> on<00:03:13.700> there<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.060> go<00:03:14.210> for<00:03:14.240> five

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
throw a 225 on there and go for five

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.760 
throw a 225 on there and go for five
sets<00:03:14.960> of<00:03:15.050> 12<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.190> 15<00:03:16.550> as<00:03:16.730> fast<00:03:17.000> as<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.300> could<00:03:17.770> um

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
sets of 12 to 15 as fast as I could um

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.370 
sets of 12 to 15 as fast as I could um
the<00:03:19.040> first<00:03:19.280> two<00:03:19.550> sets<00:03:19.880> I<00:03:20.180> got<00:03:20.450> 15<00:03:20.840> reps<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.290> i

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
the first two sets I got 15 reps and i

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.870 
the first two sets I got 15 reps and i
knew<00:03:21.590> i<00:03:21.620> wasn't<00:03:21.860> able<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.280> keep<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.520> up<00:03:22.670> in<00:03:22.760> my

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
knew i wasn't able to keep it up in my

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.330 
knew i wasn't able to keep it up in my
set<00:03:23.060> took<00:03:23.180> like<00:03:23.330> four<00:03:23.600> minute<00:03:23.810> breaks<00:03:24.050> so<00:03:24.950> i'm

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
set took like four minute breaks so i'm

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.610 
set took like four minute breaks so i'm
gonna<00:03:25.460> put<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.850> in<00:03:25.940> ten<00:03:26.240> times<00:03:26.540> speed<00:03:26.870> sets<00:03:27.260> two

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
gonna put it in ten times speed sets two

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.170 
gonna put it in ten times speed sets two
through<00:03:27.950> five<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.550> you'll<00:03:28.670> see<00:03:28.850> how<00:03:28.970> quickly

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
through five and you'll see how quickly

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.510 
through five and you'll see how quickly
i<00:03:29.330> do<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:30.440> took<00:03:30.590> me<00:03:30.740> like<00:03:30.890> don't<00:03:31.250> think

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.890 
the shrugs i decided to get into a
little<00:04:18.830> bit<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.040> rowing<00:04:19.489> uh<00:04:19.640> something<00:04:20.630> i'm

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
little bit of rowing uh something i'm

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.230 
little bit of rowing uh something i'm
really<00:04:20.959> good<00:04:21.440> at<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.830> i<00:04:21.859> like<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.250> lot<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:23.180> i

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.360 
really good at and i like a lot but i
haven't<00:04:23.450> been<00:04:23.540> doing<00:04:23.630> much<00:04:23.750> up<00:04:24.140> so<00:04:25.040> I<00:04:25.070> figured

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
haven't been doing much up so I figured

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.430 
haven't been doing much up so I figured
I<00:04:25.430> would<00:04:25.550> just<00:04:25.580> warm<00:04:26.240> up<00:04:26.360> work<00:04:26.900> up<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.140> two

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
I would just warm up work up to two

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.930 
I would just warm up work up to two
working<00:04:27.800> sets<00:04:28.010> with<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.190> hundred<00:04:28.430> pounds<00:04:28.790> which

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
working sets with a hundred pounds which

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.390 
working sets with a hundred pounds which
felt<00:04:29.180> really<00:04:29.360> heavy<00:04:29.800> because<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:30.980> was<00:04:31.100> rowing

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
felt really heavy because I was rowing

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.580 
felt really heavy because I was rowing
it<00:04:31.520> pretty<00:04:31.970> fast<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.690> as<00:04:32.960> hard<00:04:33.020> as<00:04:33.320> i<00:04:33.410> could

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
it pretty fast and as hard as i could

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.500 
it pretty fast and as hard as i could
not<00:04:33.860> like<00:04:34.160> really<00:04:34.430> concentrating<00:04:35.270> too<00:04:35.480> much

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
not like really concentrating too much

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.390 
not like really concentrating too much
on<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.020> lab<00:04:36.200> just<00:04:36.470> really<00:04:36.770> putting<00:04:37.160> power
