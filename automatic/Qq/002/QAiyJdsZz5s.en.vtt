00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.930
 today I'm going to prepare some chops 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.460
 Lamb with yogurt and mint sauce 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.670
 The ingredients we need are 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.920
 some lamb chops a yogurt 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.439
 natural that is creamy medium 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.260
 teaspoon ginger one teaspoon 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.800
 of sweet paprika a teaspoon of 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.040
 cumin a teaspoon of seeds 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.559
 cilantro a pair of garlic mint or 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.559
 mint olive oil salt and pepper 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 The first thing we are going to do is in a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.370
 mortar put the garlic and all the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.370
 spices 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.480
 or less 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.720
 free 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.980
 and the paprika 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.540
 and let him out until well 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.540
 well undone everything 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.620
 once it is well crushed you see 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.910
 what I'm going to do is 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.910
 take a splash of oil 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.950
 and we remove well for what 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.090
 of oil 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.330
 in the great 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.230
 and now this 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.010
 let's throw it on the chops 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:00.490
 we are going to value the well wet them well 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.490
 counted the sides 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.780
 with both sides well 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.420
 and we are going to do it with all the units 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.280
 and once we have them all we are going to 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.580
 leave them macerating at least half 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.580
 hour 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.390
 The next thing we're going to do is put 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.510
 a pan to the fire with a couple of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.189
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.170
 and we're going to be asking for the chops 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.170
 until we are left halfway 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.950
 while I 'm not in two chops 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.840
 let's go preparing the sauce you are going to 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.510
 see that it is very simple 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.370
 we have the creamy yogurt put in a 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.040
 bowl 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.850
 I will add 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.570
 peppermint 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.570
 chopped 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.110
 pretty salt 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.840
 Pepper 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.720
 and we are going to move 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.720
 that I am well 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.640
 and does little that left here what 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.640
 we will have grown to decorate 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.770
 and we would have our sauce ready 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.770
 yogurt 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.240
 we already have a list of our chops 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.370
 with yogurt and mint sauce 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.200
 a recipe a little more elaborate but 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.900
 with the almost certain that you are going to surprise 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.900
 try it and you'll tell me soon
