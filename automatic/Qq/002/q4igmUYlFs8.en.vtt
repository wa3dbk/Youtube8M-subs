something so we built that the ice
mansion<00:00:33.760> look<00:00:34.760> at<00:00:34.910> it<00:00:35.060> I'll<00:00:35.540> glorious<00:00:36.200> glow

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
mansion look at it I'll glorious glow

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.700 
mansion look at it I'll glorious glow
it's<00:00:37.580> look<00:00:37.940> at<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:38.180> through<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.390> walls<00:00:38.710> cuz

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
it's look at it through the walls cuz

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:48.640 
it's look at it through the walls cuz
you<00:00:39.800> can't<00:00:39.980> see<00:00:40.160> ice<00:00:40.370> through<00:00:40.700> ice<00:00:40.880> oh<00:00:41.800> oh<00:00:47.650> we

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
you can't see ice through ice oh oh we

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.020 
you can't see ice through ice oh oh we
were<00:00:48.739> thinking<00:00:48.829> originally<00:00:49.220> doing<00:00:49.700> it<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.850> lot

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
were thinking originally doing it a lot

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.729 
were thinking originally doing it a lot
of<00:00:50.180> ice<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:50.540> you<00:00:50.630> can<00:00:50.780> see<00:00:51.050> that<00:00:51.079> all<00:00:51.440> through

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
of ice so you can see that all through

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.940 
of ice so you can see that all through
the<00:00:51.860> walls<00:00:52.040> but<00:00:52.880> then<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:54.260> we<00:00:54.410> realized<00:00:54.770> that

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
the walls but then then we realized that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.080 
the walls but then then we realized that
it's<00:00:55.040> not<00:00:55.100> gonna<00:00:55.310> look<00:00:55.430> good<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.820> doesn't<00:00:55.970> look

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
it's not gonna look good it doesn't look

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.610 
it's not gonna look good it doesn't look
like<00:00:56.300> anything's<00:00:56.630> not<00:00:56.870> going<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:57.110> form<00:00:57.500> of

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
like anything's not going to form of

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.170 
like anything's not going to form of
like<00:00:57.770> pattern<00:00:58.250> behind<00:00:58.399> it<00:00:58.730> there's<00:00:58.910> not<00:00:59.030> gonna

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
like pattern behind it there's not gonna

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.280 
like pattern behind it there's not gonna
be<00:00:59.300> any<00:00:59.510> structural<00:01:00.250> lines<00:01:01.250> to<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.600> got

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
be any structural lines to it so got

that glow stone does not does not melt

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.269 
that glow stone does not does not melt
snow<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.139> will<00:01:39.289> melt<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.619> ice<00:01:39.799> but<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.189> will

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:40.279 
snow it will melt the ice but it will

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:42.219

not<00:01:40.429> melt<00:01:41.029> the<00:01:41.179> snow<00:01:41.240> box<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:41.899> place

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
not melt the snow box that you place

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.800 
not melt the snow box that you place
down<00:01:42.529> so<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.369> can<00:01:43.700> add<00:01:43.849> lighting<00:01:44.119> here<00:01:44.509> i<00:01:44.539> just

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
down so you can add lighting here i just

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.349 
down so you can add lighting here i just
decided<00:01:45.109> not<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:46.340> make<00:01:46.490> sure<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
decided not to just make sure the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.929 
decided not to just make sure the
lighting<00:01:47.749> is<00:01:48.109> far<00:01:48.619> off<00:01:48.859> away<00:01:49.219> from<00:01:49.249> the<00:01:49.490> ice<00:01:49.549> I

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
lighting is far off away from the ice I

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.669 
lighting is far off away from the ice I
think<00:01:50.329> it's<00:01:50.420> like<00:01:50.569> three<00:01:50.929> blocks<00:01:51.079> right<00:01:51.439> here

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
think it's like three blocks right here

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.709 
think it's like three blocks right here
three<00:01:51.889> or<00:01:52.009> four<00:01:52.429> something<00:01:53.090> L<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.420> see<00:01:53.569> this

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
three or four something L you see this

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.929 
three or four something L you see this
when<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.899> hear<00:01:54.079> it's<00:01:54.200> three<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.889> don't<00:01:55.459> know<00:01:55.520> oh<00:01:55.670> I

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
when I hear it's three I don't know oh I

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.269 
when I hear it's three I don't know oh I
know<00:01:56.090> how<00:01:56.240> much<00:01:56.389> it<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.599> oh<00:01:56.779> well<00:01:57.200> then<00:01:57.380> has<00:01:58.159> at

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279 
know how much it is oh well then has at

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.339 
know how much it is oh well then has at
least<00:01:58.399> like<00:01:58.609> a<00:01:58.639> two<00:01:58.880> blocks<00:01:59.450> between<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.229> ice

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
least like a two blocks between the ice

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.769 
least like a two blocks between the ice
in<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.679> glowstone<00:02:01.219> I<00:02:01.549> guess<00:02:02.770> yeah<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.009> um

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:04.779 
in the glowstone I guess yeah so um

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:06.969 
in the glowstone I guess yeah so um
let's<00:02:05.779> see<00:02:05.959> we<00:02:06.049> got<00:02:06.079> walls<00:02:06.439> going<00:02:06.740> all<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.889> way

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
let's see we got walls going all the way

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.069 
let's see we got walls going all the way
around<00:02:07.099> it<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.939> what<00:02:08.239> I<00:02:08.269> was<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.720> back

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
around it is what I was like in the back
