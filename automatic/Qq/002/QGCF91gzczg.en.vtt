00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.909
 Then I'm glad I'm here again. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.370
 as usual 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.909
 and how normal 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.429
 all this joked that something 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.629
 This time unfortunately it was me. 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.849
 neighbors 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.599
 Amazingly 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.879
 Look I had washed him but he already dealt with the sus you give himself 

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.640
 cliff 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.399
 as he already walks with the actor awards 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.399
 destroy deita interim cd poet land 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.220
 as usual this mania that endured 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.280
 everything I did did not break a single piece 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.800
 All right, tactically. 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.230
 which always gives problem in the electrical part 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.560
 and this time it was the same thing 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.280
 because the tradition 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.850
 only they are fried 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.170
 Thank God, my escape goes on. 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.110
 the mayor 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.540
 I even have to open here to connect 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.450
 just the saw 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.230
 Take milk and take it to the car too. 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 Cony that has here already started the Iraqi 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.130
 So 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.410
 servo in the direction of the miner was the original 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.410
 and honestly, I'll buy another source 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.740
 anyone else is on the team did not last long 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.740
 and he is waterproof in India is one more thing 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.190
 Listen, I think another cheap one will also be approved soon. 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.520
 just do not know if I'm going to buy it by the next I have yet lets it 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.910
 nobody 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.080
 same size and box here 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.890
 only on the bottom 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.390
 this here reads me bigger 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.060
 is higher alias 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.450
 so this is what this line is 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.000
 this pity that is normal only the ps that comes up here 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.770
 so it gets completely crooked 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.730
 become selfless discards one to the other 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.440
 generic other marking 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.360
 I'll even search the original tracks 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.090
 I just want to say yes 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.320
 he is not broke any bad 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.090
 except for sure only that for me the saw is electrical part 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.100
 it remains firm and strong without any breaks 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.440
 in eight months light alloy spar to avoid turmoil 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.779
 the jeans 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.699
 abu zeid helinho 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.779
 today with the one that I only on the dirt track there jundiaÃ­ 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.379
 he even has another video that shows him with you the funds that 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.679
 identified that they are not 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.879
 nor near the loudest that I did there after I stopped recording
