00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.800
 because I see it all perfect there 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.180
 who in the game a little faster 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.460
 it reads a little slower is your 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.100
 computer is low-income 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.510
 they simply close the program and then 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.090
 when they will open again you will 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.400
 lyttle left click right sorry 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.409
 properties of lower compatibility and you 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.760
 will give to execute a resolution of 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:06.260
 640 x 480 p I'm not going to do it because 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.049
 I do not need to protect it if they give 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.799
 apply and accept and the game will run 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.769
 more faster as you can see 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.019
