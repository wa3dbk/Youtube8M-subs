00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.200
 looking at the sky at night we think that everything is calm 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.350
 that tranquility reigns up there 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.470
 nothing more far from the reality to thousands of light years there explosions 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.799
 cataclysmic that leads more energy than millions of hydrogen bombs 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.079
 together 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.919
 the sun is the example that is closest to us 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.050
 for this crime 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.289
 Endesa and the sun 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.300
 exponents the mass of hydrogen atoms becomes elekta mind 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 aten energy 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 the unprecedented social action of this energy that people are the ones that allow 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.100
 there is life on earth 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.050
 without this wonderful source of energy that is the sun 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.179
 our life would be very boring law 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.179
 in fact we would not be here 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.300
 it is the largest star in the solar system and the closest to the earth 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.220
 it was formed about 4.5 billion years ago from the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.780
 waste of previous stars and it is estimated that it is right in the middle of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.660
 your pib 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.330
 when that's because its hydrogen reserves will become a giant 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.590
 red x expand to engulf all the planets of the solar system 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 designs c 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.050
 although it seems strange but this is only a very modest energy producer 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.280
 the boss compared to the multitude of phenomena that still more energetic 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.770
 and exotic that are seen in the most extreme objects of the universe 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.400
 objects and stones 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.690
 both issues are cosmic objects that retain much greater energy than the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.580
 of hundreds of galaxies together 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.100
 quasars have been discovered at 12 billion light years from Earth 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.570
 this is more or less the age of the universe observing these objects one 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.570
 can see the first years of life of the cosmos 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.360
 the sound we really do not know which is the most powerful energy source of 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.410
 all but surely this think luya elements like the stars of 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.170
 neutrons 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.360
 black holes and other exotic objects are unethical collapse of the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 central regions and supernovas 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.049
 the supernova occur when giant stars much larger than 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:58.909
 our sun 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.509
 they collapse and explode they can release in a moment the energy of 100 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.820
 one billion soles 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.559
 supernovas emit neutron stars 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.919
 after the explosion it has a compact core 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.009
 iron and other metals is inconvenient if heating 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:18.209
 the electrons do not support the pressure is in pushed towards the core 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.289
 becoming the country 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:24.379
 the result is so dense that a single pulse of this matter would be made 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.389
 millions of tons 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.029
 but without neutron star and convenience or more the result would be 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.579
 so dense that not even light could escape its gravitational force 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.129
 then we would have a black hole 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.359
 we know that in the center of our galaxy there is a black hole whose mass 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.999
 it's like two million times the mass of the sun 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.749
 we will also continue its effects on the environment and the types of radiation 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.749
 high energies matches miki 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.089
 the strength of the black holes reside a small point located inside 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.319
 there the gravitational forces space and time become 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.439
 undefined 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.599
 we do and perhaps the most extreme example is the gamma ray bursts 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.000
 that promise high-energy pythons like light or consists but with a 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.230
 incredible energy if you choose high because it takes place on time scales 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.250
 incredibly short and in huge amounts costs
