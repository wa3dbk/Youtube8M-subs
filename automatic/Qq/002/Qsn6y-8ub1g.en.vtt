00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.570
 at first with minced onions 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.860
 this is for the marinade to make 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:41.950
 marinate pieces of salt meat 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.950
 depending on how much meat you have 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.000
 seen vinegar 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.110
 then the vinegar is used to soften 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.310
 the absence and stone also allow the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:01.780
 spices of well infiltrated the flesh and I 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.470
 am going to add comrades to is like 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.660
 his name says it's a composition 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.370
 herbs spices and condiments 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:17.710
 so we go slowly I'm fine 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:22.930
 mix the meat with the onion and the 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:25.150
 canada ideally you have to leave 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.970
 marinate all this for at least two 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.760
 hours 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.680
 but before we cover the meat with a 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.330
 food film and we place it at 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 refrigerators and let it marinate 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:43.420
 cool I go back to the onion we go 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.110
 place the onion in a pot 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.020
 to make it fall 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.720
 and here I am going to use a combination 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.800
 of two vegetable oils olive oil 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.800
 and sunflower oil 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:14.030
 I class tognon le quÃ©bec hui tajine 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.980
 or like that in a marie he cooks with 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.690
 a lot of nuances so he's really 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.900
 it is still reduced 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.190
 of course that is to say that I do not 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.959
 not going to add back to the preparation 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.340
 but there must be many Donnio 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.890
 for letting his son 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.890
 finally abdou with a little bit of grass 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.319
 students chosen to see the dish and the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.780
 parsley I took a little boot of 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:52.450
 parsley that I have sliced â€‹â€‹and I'm going 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.450
 add to spel union 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.560
 and I'm sweating the onion for a 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.130
 ten to fifteen minutes to 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:18.010
 covered and over low heat before him 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:21.100
 incorporate the yellow marinated meat into 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.210
 I knew well and let cook as I 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.010
 explained it over low heat and covered 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.010
 I'm going to add the marinated meat 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:40.300
 this is where we are, we like it 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.100
 well-cooked meat or medium then 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.310
 will say but not bleeding 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.030
 then at home you will do like 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:54.060
 you like cooking meat 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.060
 so the day cover and continue 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.080
 last little touch for quebec and 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.190

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.660

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.660
 rancid butter with quebec 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.640
 but if you do not like the need 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.229

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.490
 to be but I like it and I'm going 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.490

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.629
