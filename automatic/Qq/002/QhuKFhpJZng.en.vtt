00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.880

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
bolt and try to explain it would make a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.590 
bolt and try to explain it would make a
lot<00:00:37.309> of<00:00:37.370> sense<00:00:37.519> when<00:00:37.699> you<00:00:37.820> actually<00:00:37.940> see<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.559> so
