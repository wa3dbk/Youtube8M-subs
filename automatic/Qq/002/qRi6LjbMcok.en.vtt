00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.969
 who is always there even when the paris 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.559
 saint-germain loses a lot of 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.299
 frustration tonight how to explain this 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.920
 first set first defeat of the 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.480
 season 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.820
 oh yes France and it's a bit of 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.680
 frustrations it's true it's true that 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.320
 the page of the courtyard in two and we had to 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.529
 players that's true but hey there are some 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.640
 episodes a bit that are unclear 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.779
 it is not possible before their expulsion 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 like that I think he did there but 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.519
 I think 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.560
 the game is red because then 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.760
 that's the rule and it's like that and 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.780
 I think that bastia me I can 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.090
 help him but break his head 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.989
 after ten minutes and the arrival nothing and 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.410
 so you have to be two foix is ​​good I 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.270
 do not know but said health holds they are 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.370
 like that they are ready for all sadi 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.570
 Saint-Etienne already led us salvatore 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.700
 holy was to lead already before 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.010
 the exclusion that saint-etienne led 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.930
 already 1-0 before the exclusion but it's 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.250
 it's okay you can lead a serum to it 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.750
 still missing in five minutes 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.610
 that's not it there are episodes of 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.530
 always who are not clear and that 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.940
 that 's embarrassing a bit a buzz it's going 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.390
 pass tomorrow but it's normal that they 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.399
 have sagem 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.520
 they do not put deserved to win 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.380
 tonight but I think we did not play 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.060
 we had to play but I wanted to see 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.500
 a led game 1 0 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.899
 twenty five minutes and in the end we get 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.979
 so happy that the matches it was 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.979

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.500
 beat paris saint-germain here 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.119

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.020

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.580

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.280
 more water than that so in any case 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.580
