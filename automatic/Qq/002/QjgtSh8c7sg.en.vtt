00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.400
 and then guys daniela for another video 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.860
 the top on tv 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.220
 today we will talk about test of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.650
 curves and cpu temperature 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 So here we are, the program is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 ask a fan and we will do it 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 some dissipation efficacy tests 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.669
 some cures you'll see 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.590
 Next 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.160
 good guys 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:44.370
 We're running here with the machine. 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:47.930
 that is a cost benefit with 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.410
 this cs card with fx processor 4 100 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.780
 km from here comes the cost-effective ae 1 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.579
 560 that this board that we already 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.340
 present in other videos are watching the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.989
 videos on the screen and if you 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 want to have a look at the talking boxes 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.400
 A little where we talk a little bit 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.380
 of them is a legal processor of the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.240
 black edition if you are interested in 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.700
 overclock 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.840
 this card allows this processor to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.630
 in the case is that we will make a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.939
 the most basic test showing the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.170
 starting temperature 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.790
 so, what I asked was that it's a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.390
 program is more or less 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.630
 complete to show the details there 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.040
 speed temperature 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.000
 reading fan he's giving 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 here for us the video card is not 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.750
 focus now but you can see the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.500
 four hd reading cores and the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.350
 temperatures it has to read 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.759
 near the core of the heatsink 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.979
 processor 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.549
 then this temperature rhodan if in 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.689
 open with the original cooler 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.490
 We're going to run another one now. 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.259
 program that is the core of maggi is a 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.500
 program indicates that we have found and 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.799
 you generate it is a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.239
 stress test of plays 100% capacity 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.250
 processing 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.370
 Let's take a look and follow 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.890
 I'm opening the maggi core here. 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.250
 it's a free program as I said 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.370
 and you open it already starts rolling 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.250
 so we look here as the guest 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.950
 fans have jumped to the maximum always use 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 this here all the most of this little arrows 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.080
 here when he's blue for 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.030
 when it was cold it was below normal 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.960
 we'll start to see you soon 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.820
 They do not change the changes there and she has already 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.760
 this mark with an optimum temperature 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.920
 as soon as you hit red or from there 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.620
 he already starts to change pro until promotion 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.450
 a flame icon is because it is 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.180
 climbing very fast 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.490
 beyond what is normal we also see the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.220
 fan sound here increasing or r 12 rms and 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.230
 so we usually test this 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.110
 take a little longer than we do 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.960
 about 5 to 10 minutes running this 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.390
 stress to see the limit that it arrives if 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.610
 it does not if the machine does not fall 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.080
 so we'll show you a 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.620
 little else there for you 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.900
 going back to iv you are seeing on screen 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 the first temperature and on fire already 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.180
 we are reaching almost 60 degrees 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.020
 we are a little over seven 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.420
 minutes of burning and concord maggi 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.140
 so it's interesting to see it here 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.470
 this is the processor clock 3.6 gates 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.070
 which is the fx 4 100 and the optimal temperature 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.570
 of them turns around 61 champion in 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.380
 some places he says that he arrives almost 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.350
 70 but we keep it for a while 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.400
 some great up to 60 and 65 degrees in the 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.459
 maximum 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.040
 so we're there with 18 minutes of 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.750
 and we see that the temperature is 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.720
 arriving here at 59 to almost 4 thousand 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.510
 We're going to close now to see until 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.229
 to see how it quickly lowers 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.190
 numbers and then we'll go 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.600
 do the same thing with 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.020
 the bigger gurus do not feel contests 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.960
 it 's interesting that you see 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.730
 here that this calculation is normal to give x 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.790
 it already comes with the copper conductor for 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.940
 improve and that was his performance 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:47.170
 that is 77 8 minutes he held on 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.420
 60 degrees is almost interesting to note 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.250
 cabinet he has a 20mm fan 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.370
 in front of us we tested with the 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.710
 lid closed and was a bit better 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.270
 the test he arrives he got almost five 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.520
 degrees colder 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.490
 it is interesting to note also that people 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.190
 not loading the gpu on the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.870
 so this video is not only a test for 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.430
 show the effectiveness of the cure 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.070
 as everyone knows the heat is 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.980
 extremely harmful to electronic and 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.780
 let's move on to the next tests 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.740
 good staff continuing with our 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:24.100
 cooler tests you saw the test there 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.230
 original spoon of the ex 400 and now the 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.240
 people are with what gives you more 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.370
 martinuccio is a much larger audience if 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.750
 You see, the staff is fine. 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.310
 Nice, he's got six daddy pee de Copper 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.340
 In fact, he thinks snakes are 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.640
 aluminum by the color here and the sinks 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.040
 aluminum is very extensive is just down 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.250
 We're going to take the test now. 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.050
 temperature using fan speed that you 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.520
 saw how we are using the 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.350
 temperatures starting here at 31 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.120
 here you have the fan speed is that 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.850
 he is giving another knife reading 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.230
 in fact the ufam occurs back here 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.520
 that we had added 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:09.960
 previously we are going to color the night and 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.960
 Let's see how he does it. 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.840
 You have already seen and already jumped 100% to cp 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.590
 We're going to start seeing people or not. 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.390
 temperatures then rising to 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.100
 people is a test like you saw in the 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.350
 first time it was up to seven minutes 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.470
 It's half an eight minutes for us to have a 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.450
 measure a little more faithful, ie the 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.390
 people keep a little time to burn to 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.770
 see if it gives a peak if it's for what 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.810
 happens to him 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.810
 We'll be back in a bit. 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.310
 the staff came back to us with six 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.700
 minutes in me we came back to a 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.900
 almost one minute before the test of 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.280
 original cooler 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.710
 even because we see that we do not 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.600
 is having more change we had 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.700
 here the temperature one that was in 5 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.980
 was to 32 but this was already expected to 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.310
 I was not without load on the processor 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:04.150
 here at temperature 3 she climb 1 something in 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:06.280
 around 2 to 3 from 3 to 4 degrees but has already 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.260
 to see that the cure was effective 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.070
 very nice 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:14.770
 the fan went up something around 150 rpm to 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.290
 but it's very small 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.500
 We expected something similar because 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.750
 the one is a big colleague is a knife 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.500
 large set with a good sink 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.380
 great 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:30.700
 and the result is more or less there 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:33.040
 for you to see the dollar comparison come back 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:37.630
 In the video we saw you arrived 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.160
 to almost 60 or the undo temperature with 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.229
 original, then you can have a sense of 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.289
 that this is a course is aimed at who 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.340
 works overclock also remembering that 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:48.250
 We were walking with the machine. 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.650
 open okay if this case has a lid 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.840
 with a fan of mine it confuses to diminish more 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.150
 still in fact even closed she stays 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.350
 even lower did before hung up 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.410
 This funk behind you does not 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:01.630
 influenced the result is this is a fan 

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.539
 very good spoon for who 

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.340
 there was exchange or a very effective power 

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:08.740
 for those who work normally 

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.030
 You like a jewel sign up for the 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.380
 channel that we will do more tests 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.310
 with other clubs 

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.310
 That's it, thank you
