00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.390
 good 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.390
 get it out 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.480
 they take it from above 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.330
 take out the one below 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.969
 now the reverse process how to place them 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.570
 tilting the jonquil slightly 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.570
 inland 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.969
 and hitting on one end 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.940
 inside 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.250
 the same tilting the and from a 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.790
 extreme towards the other side is worth these 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.960
 they hit 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.090
 in the case that they are long 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 and cost 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.200
 there is a trick 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.870
 is that someone holds him in the end 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.330
 that is not being introduced such that 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.240
 slightly separated 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.810
 and the other and the other assistant put it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.810
 under 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.830
 it's easy enough more skill than strength 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.670
 always start one end towards another no 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.850
 try to put it flat 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.840
 if not start at one end and 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 take it to the other
