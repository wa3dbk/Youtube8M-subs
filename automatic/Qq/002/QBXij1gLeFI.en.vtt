is a wash bar so that was the second

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.550 
is a wash bar so that was the second
thing<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.829> built<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.540> stick<00:02:26.019> that<00:02:26.170> over<00:02:26.230> here

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
thing I built so stick that over here

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.870 
thing I built so stick that over here
for<00:02:26.769> now<00:02:28.920> here's<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.130> wash<00:02:30.310> bar<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.790> I

for now here's the wash bar that I

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.710 
for now here's the wash bar that I
designed<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.959> sit<00:02:32.290> inside<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.799> bucket<00:02:33.720> so

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
designed to sit inside this bucket so

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.520 
designed to sit inside this bucket so
now<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.620> you've<00:02:35.829> got<00:02:36.010> your<00:02:36.040> hopper<00:02:36.940> built

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
now that you've got your hopper built

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.589 
now that you've got your hopper built
what<00:02:38.530> I've<00:02:38.650> taken<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.370> some<00:02:40.090> 3/4<00:02:40.720> inch

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
what I've taken is some 3/4 inch

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.300 
what I've taken is some 3/4 inch
three-quarter<00:02:43.599> inch<00:02:43.750> tubing<00:02:47.040> you'll<00:02:48.040> see

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
three-quarter inch tubing you'll see

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.309 
three-quarter inch tubing you'll see
down<00:02:48.700> this<00:02:48.879> at<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.540> bottom<00:02:49.720> here<00:02:50.079> and<00:02:50.109> there's

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
then you've got some parts here and some

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.180 
then you've got some parts here and some
tubing<00:02:59.200> makes<00:02:59.859> an<00:03:00.040> L<00:03:01.030> goes<00:03:01.900> into<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> ball<00:03:03.160> valve

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
tubing makes an L goes into a ball valve

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.220 
tubing makes an L goes into a ball valve
here<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.180> control<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.750> speed<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.139> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
here this is to control the speed of the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.420 
here this is to control the speed of the
water<00:03:06.930> keeps<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.260> water<00:03:08.530> continues<00:03:09.069> on<00:03:09.220> up

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
water keeps the water continues on up

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.110 
water keeps the water continues on up
through<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.639> ball<00:03:09.850> valve<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.450> then<00:03:12.120> spreads

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
through the ball valve and then spreads

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.819 
through the ball valve and then spreads
out<00:03:13.329> into<00:03:13.720> two<00:03:13.900> different<00:03:14.049> sides<00:03:14.470> here<00:03:16.829> goes

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
out into two different sides here goes

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.039 
out into two different sides here goes
into<00:03:18.130> your<00:03:18.220> wash<00:03:18.489> bars<00:03:18.849> these<00:03:19.540> are<00:03:19.599> again<00:03:20.019> a

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
into your wash bars these are again a

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.270 
into your wash bars these are again a
3/4<00:03:20.709> inch<00:03:21.269> PVC<00:03:22.269> pipe<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.200> then<00:03:23.889> I've<00:03:24.040> cut

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
3/4 inch PVC pipe and then I've cut

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.490 
3/4 inch PVC pipe and then I've cut
holes<00:03:25.079> about<00:03:26.079> every<00:03:26.410> inch<00:03:27.840> down<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.079> side<00:03:29.319> of

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
holes about every inch down the side of

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.509 
holes about every inch down the side of
the<00:03:29.650> wash<00:03:29.980> bar<00:03:30.280> on<00:03:30.459> both<00:03:30.669> sides<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.980> again

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
the wash bar on both sides and again

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.120 
the wash bar on both sides and again
none<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.299> needs<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.720> be<00:03:34.840> glued<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.380> lot<00:03:36.099> of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
none of this needs to be glued a lot of

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.500 
none of this needs to be glued a lot of
people<00:03:36.430> say<00:03:36.579> they<00:03:36.730> like<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.910> glue<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.269> stuff

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
people say they like the glue to stuff

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.120 
people say they like the glue to stuff
but<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.870> like<00:03:38.169> to<00:03:38.260> be<00:03:38.380> able<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.560> adjust<00:03:38.680> these

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
but I like to be able to adjust these

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.309 
but I like to be able to adjust these
these<00:03:39.609> bars<00:03:39.940> by<00:03:40.209> moving<00:03:40.569> them<00:03:40.690> around<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.230> if

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
these bars by moving them around so if

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.569 
these bars by moving them around so if
they're<00:03:41.440> glued<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.739> there<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.980> can't<00:03:42.250> do<00:03:42.400> that

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
they're glued in there you can't do that

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.210 
they're glued in there you can't do that
but<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.930> stuff<00:03:44.169> won't<00:03:44.410> leak<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.859> won't<00:03:45.040> come

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
but this stuff won't leak it won't come

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.339 
but this stuff won't leak it won't come
apart<00:03:45.549> you<00:03:45.849> push<00:03:46.419> it<00:03:46.569> together<00:03:46.690> really<00:03:46.989> tight

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
apart you push it together really tight

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.409 
apart you push it together really tight
it<00:03:47.950> stays<00:03:48.280> pretty<00:03:48.549> good<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.180> don't<00:03:49.269> need

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
it stays pretty good and you don't need

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:49.590 
it stays pretty good and you don't need
to

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
to

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.420 
to
blew<00:03:49.690> any<00:03:49.870> of<00:03:49.990> this<00:03:50.080> stuff<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.620> then<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.220> can

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
blew any of this stuff and then you can

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.860 
blew any of this stuff and then you can
take<00:03:51.580> it<00:03:51.700> apart<00:03:51.910> whenever<00:03:52.210> you<00:03:52.270> want<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.660> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
take it apart whenever you want to and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.650 
take it apart whenever you want to and
readjust<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.800> or<00:03:54.120> however<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.300> want<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.570> do

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
readjust it or however you want to do

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.920 
readjust it or however you want to do
that<00:03:55.890> put<00:03:56.890> your<00:03:57.010> backpack

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
that put your backpack

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.140 
that put your backpack
so<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.080> basically<00:04:00.480> will<00:04:01.480> just<00:04:01.510> sit<00:04:01.930> right<00:04:03.150> in

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
so this basically will just sit right in

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.790 
so this basically will just sit right in
on<00:04:04.960> top<00:04:05.020> of<00:04:05.500> your<00:04:05.710> hopper<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:08.470> kind<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.740> a

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
on top of your hopper just kind of a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:21.630 
on top of your hopper just kind of a
side<00:04:09.040> view<00:04:09.070> of<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:19.110> so<00:04:20.110> there<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.380> go<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:21.489> you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
side view of it so there you go and you

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.580

hook<00:04:21.820> your<00:04:22.140> half<00:04:23.140> inch<00:04:23.350> tube<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.600> your

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
hook your half inch tube to that your

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.680 
hook your half inch tube to that your
tube<00:04:26.860> then<00:04:27.130> can<00:04:27.430> go<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:29.880> pump<00:04:30.880> this<00:04:31.390> is<00:04:31.450> a

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
that the bigger stuff all washes off and

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.780 
that the bigger stuff all washes off and
the<00:05:02.020> little<00:05:02.110> stuff<00:05:02.470> goes<00:05:02.710> inside<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.640> hopper

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
the little stuff goes inside the hopper

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.260 
the little stuff goes inside the hopper
and<00:05:04.180> goes<00:05:04.750> into<00:05:05.170> your<00:05:05.380> sluice<00:05:06.100> box<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:06.640> your

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
and goes into your sluice box so your

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.480 
and goes into your sluice box so your
basic<00:05:07.600> setup<00:05:08.850> looks<00:05:09.850> just<00:05:10.060> like<00:05:10.270> this

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.670 

so<00:05:15.490> tube<00:05:15.850> runs<00:05:16.090> in<00:05:16.270> there<00:05:16.480> washes<00:05:17.350> your<00:05:17.440> water

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
so tube runs in there washes your water

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
into air the water comes out the bottom

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.240 
into air the water comes out the bottom
of<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.780> bucket<00:05:20.140> here<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:20.380> goes<00:05:20.800> will<00:05:20.950> close

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
of the bucket here and goes will close

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.100 
of the bucket here and goes will close
over<00:05:21.520> top<00:05:21.700> of<00:05:21.730> riffles<00:05:22.270> of<00:05:22.720> course<00:05:22.990> you're

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
over top of riffles of course you're

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.770 
over top of riffles of course you're
going<00:05:23.200> to<00:05:23.260> have<00:05:23.410> this<00:05:23.620> at<00:05:23.800> an<00:05:23.890> angle<00:05:24.100> like<00:05:24.310> this

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
going to have this at an angle like this

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.310 
going to have this at an angle like this
and<00:05:26.670> that's<00:05:27.670> basically<00:05:28.540> it<00:05:28.780> something

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
and that's basically it something

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.110 
and that's basically it something
another<00:05:29.650> simple<00:05:30.100> simple<00:05:30.700> idea

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
another simple simple idea

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.290 
another simple simple idea
