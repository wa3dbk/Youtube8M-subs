00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
highlights that they talked about in the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.700 
highlights that they talked about in the
packaging<00:01:09.810> let's<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.260> guys<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.439> take

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
packaging let's see if you guys can take

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.330 
packaging let's see if you guys can take
a<00:01:10.740> look<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
a look at that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.649 
a look at that
all<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.439> lower<00:01:13.439> profile<00:01:14.040> more<00:01:15.000> flexible

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
all right lower profile more flexible

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 
all right lower profile more flexible
and<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.439> breathable<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.159> those<00:01:17.490> things

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and more breathable all those things

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.450 
and more breathable all those things
that<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> card<00:01:18.299> said<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.810> 100%<00:01:19.229> true<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:20.430> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that that card said are 100% true one of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.039 
that that card said are 100% true one of
the<00:01:20.580> main<00:01:20.790> differences<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.750> pulled

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the main differences I know so I pulled

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.980 
the main differences I know so I pulled
these<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.380> are<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.490> low<00:01:23.700> profile<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
these out are the low profile if you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.590 
these out are the low profile if you
look<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:26.130> thin<00:01:26.580> these<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.570> are

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
look at it how thin these are these are

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.289 
look at it how thin these are these are
really<00:01:28.409> low<00:01:28.770> profile<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.520> they're<00:01:29.729> maybe

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
really low profile so they're maybe

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.210 
really low profile so they're maybe
about<00:01:30.479> half<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.990> thin<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> D<00:01:31.650> flex<00:01:31.920> padding

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
about half as thin as the D flex padding

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.789 
about half as thin as the D flex padding
before<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:33.390> covers<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.170> wider<00:01:34.200> range

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
before it also covers a much wider range

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.039 
before it also covers a much wider range
it's<00:01:35.549> still<00:01:35.850> flexible<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> couple<00:01:37.020> reasons

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
it's still flexible for a couple reasons

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's still flexible for a couple reasons
you<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.950> these<00:01:38.130> bends<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.030> would

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you see all these bends in here I would

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.300 
you see all these bends in here I would
say<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> other<00:01:40.439> ones<00:01:40.710> were<00:01:40.860> more

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
say that the other ones were more

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.300 
say that the other ones were more
flexible<00:01:41.880> though<00:01:42.799> just<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.860> terms<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
flexible though just in terms of the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190 
flexible though just in terms of the
padding<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.780> bend<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
padding because these can bend in a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.510 
padding because these can bend in a
multitude<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.560> ways<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.280> hugged

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
multitude of ways so they really hugged

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.620 
multitude of ways so they really hugged
your<00:01:47.670> body

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
your body

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.109 
your body
these<00:01:48.990> ones<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.979> still<00:01:50.250> great<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.729> flexible

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
these ones are still great and flexible

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.760 
these ones are still great and flexible
but<00:01:51.240> they're<00:01:51.360> not<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.020> flexible

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
but they're not going to be as flexible

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
but they're not going to be as flexible
in<00:01:53.070> terms<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.369> padding<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.240> still<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
in terms of the padding but it's still a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.649 
in terms of the padding but it's still a
more<00:01:55.140> flexible<00:01:55.320> short<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.130> general<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.119> I'll

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
more flexible short in general and I'll

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.260 
more flexible short in general and I'll
cover<00:01:57.899> off<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:59.009> bit<00:01:59.270> this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
cover off that in a little bit this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.749 
cover off that in a little bit this
padding<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.810> also<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.469> memory<00:02:01.860> foam<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
padding is also like a memory foam you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.999 
padding is also like a memory foam you
see<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.240> push<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.439> how<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.770> has<00:02:04.890> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
see if you push in it see how it has to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.410 
see if you push in it see how it has to
come<00:02:05.189> back<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.060> already<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
come back you can already see the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.839 
come back you can already see the
wrinkles<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.079> what<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.860> does<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.550> know

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
wrinkles and what that does is you know

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.820 
wrinkles and what that does is you know
my<00:02:08.970> finger<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.420> actually<00:02:09.720> push<00:02:09.929> into<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
my finger can actually push into the to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.650 
my finger can actually push into the to
the<00:02:10.920> phone<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.760> what<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.090> does<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.300> actually

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the phone so what that does is actually

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.090 
the phone so what that does is actually
allows<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.170> when<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.379> put

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
allows it when you put

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.650 
allows it when you put
and<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.490> put<00:02:14.640> your<00:02:14.670> pants<00:02:15.060> over<00:02:15.270> any<00:02:15.390> pull

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and you put your pants over any pull

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.540 
and you put your pants over any pull
them<00:02:15.780> tight<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.470> know<00:02:16.560> really<00:02:16.920> moles<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.430> your

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
them tight you know really moles to your

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.520 
them tight you know really moles to your
body<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.030> that's<00:02:18.630> where<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.990> add<00:02:19.080> additional

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
body and that's where the add additional

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.350 
body and that's where the add additional
flexibility<00:02:20.220> comes<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.670> because<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.180> like

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
flexibility comes in because it is like

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.240 
flexibility comes in because it is like
a<00:02:21.390> second<00:02:21.870> skin<00:02:21.960> where's<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.890> other<00:02:23.040> where

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
a second skin where's the other where

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.010 
a second skin where's the other where
it's<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:23.520> exactly<00:02:23.820> like<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> second<00:02:24.690> skin<00:02:24.870> it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
it's not exactly like a second skin it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.930 
it's not exactly like a second skin it
just<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.740> know<00:02:25.860> folds<00:02:26.310> around<00:02:26.490> your<00:02:26.610> body

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
just you know folds around your body

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.910 
just you know folds around your body
this<00:02:27.060> one<00:02:27.330> actually<00:02:27.720> molds<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.230> your<00:02:28.440> body<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
this one actually molds to your body and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.740 
this one actually molds to your body and
I<00:02:29.190> really<00:02:29.460> like<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.820> about<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.720> other

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I really like that about it the other

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.290 
I really like that about it the other
thing<00:02:30.990> with<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.770> it's<00:02:32.370> low-profile

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
thing with this is that it's low-profile

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.140 
thing with this is that it's low-profile
down<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.740> hard<00:02:34.950> plate<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.820> is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
down here with the hard plate this is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.210 
down here with the hard plate this is
extremely<00:02:36.750> low<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> hard<00:02:37.740> plate<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
extremely low with the hard plate and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.330 
extremely low with the hard plate and
this<00:02:38.520> combined<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.900> low<00:02:40.290> profile<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
this combined it is a low profile so the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.620 
this combined it is a low profile so the
reason<00:02:41.580> why<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:41.790> about<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.090> hard<00:02:42.300> place<00:02:42.450> is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
reason why it's about the hard place is

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.080 
reason why it's about the hard place is
I'm<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> DV<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.380> don't<00:02:43.650> need<00:02:43.770> running<00:02:44.190> back<00:02:44.400> you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
I'm a DV I don't need running back you

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.210 
I'm a DV I don't need running back you
know<00:02:45.210> that<00:02:45.510> has<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.170> stick<00:02:46.530> out<00:02:46.710> I<00:02:47.070> don't

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
know that has that stick out I don't

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.980 
know that has that stick out I don't
need<00:02:47.490> any<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.480> know<00:02:48.600> about<00:02:48.750> would

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
need any of that you know about would

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.870 
need any of that you know about would
like<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.380> protection<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.310> now<00:02:50.490> with<00:02:50.700> this

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880

mean I show this to someone running back
to<00:02:54.210> my<00:02:54.330> team<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.600> they're<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:54.990> is<00:02:55.200> that

going to be thick enough and I'm like
yes<00:02:57.120> because<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.500> hard<00:02:58.770> like<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.400> can

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
yes because this is hard like you can

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.730 
yes because this is hard like you can
hear<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.880> how<00:03:00.030> hard<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:01.020> it's<00:03:01.170> also<00:03:01.290> so

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
hear it how hard it is but it's also so

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.830 
hear it how hard it is but it's also so
thin<00:03:02.010> they're<00:03:02.580> not<00:03:02.760> removable<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.540> stitched

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
thin they're not removable it's stitched

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.470 
thin they're not removable it's stitched
in<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.830> had<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.220> moldable<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:06.360> know

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
in and you had this moldable you know

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.060 
in and you had this moldable you know
that<00:03:06.660> kind<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.080> dash<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.440> your<00:03:07.470> body<00:03:07.740> as<00:03:07.920> well

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
that kind of dash to your body as well

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.190 
that kind of dash to your body as well
when<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.280> put<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.490> up<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.750> we've<00:03:09.870> got<00:03:09.990> more

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
when you put it up so we've got more

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.990 
when you put it up so we've got more
coverage<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.890> thigh<00:03:11.070> you've<00:03:11.640> got<00:03:11.790> better

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
coverage on the thigh you've got better

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.430 
coverage on the thigh you've got better
protection<00:03:12.600> on<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> thigh<00:03:12.960> than<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.290> old

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
protection on the thigh than the old

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.040 
protection on the thigh than the old
ones<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.770> even<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.550> hard<00:03:14.790> plate<00:03:14.970> itself<00:03:15.540> see

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
ones and even the hard plate itself see

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.280 
ones and even the hard plate itself see
how<00:03:16.170> its<00:03:16.350> molded<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:17.280> even<00:03:17.820> fits<00:03:18.630> better<00:03:18.990> on

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
how its molded it even fits better on

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.340 
how its molded it even fits better on
your<00:03:19.500> leg<00:03:20.030> then<00:03:21.030> let's<00:03:21.330> go<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.780> tailbone

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
your leg then let's go to the tailbone

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.560 
your leg then let's go to the tailbone
pad<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> little<00:03:24.120> bit<00:03:24.210> more<00:03:24.330> coverage

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
pad this is a little bit more coverage

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.240 
pad this is a little bit more coverage
as<00:03:24.810> well<00:03:24.990> than<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> past<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.830> it's<00:03:25.980> got<00:03:26.130> that

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
as well than the past and it's got that

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.790 
as well than the past and it's got that
same<00:03:26.520> thin<00:03:26.940> moldable<00:03:27.630> pattern<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.740> to

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
same thin moldable pattern it's going to

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.590 
same thin moldable pattern it's going to
be<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> little<00:03:29.490> bit<00:03:29.580> more<00:03:29.700> comfortable<00:03:30.030> these

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
be a little bit more comfortable these

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.870 
be a little bit more comfortable these
are<00:03:30.870> one<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.470> most<00:03:31.620> comfortable<00:03:32.070> shorts

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
are one of the most comfortable shorts

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.060 
are one of the most comfortable shorts
I've<00:03:33.030> put<00:03:33.300> on<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.750> definitely<00:03:34.620> close<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.920> Nike

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
I've put on so definitely close to Nike

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.070 
I've put on so definitely close to Nike
for<00:03:35.220> all<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> technology<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:36.180> would<00:03:36.780> say<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
for all the technology I would say the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.410 
for all the technology I would say the
number<00:03:37.440> one<00:03:37.470> thing<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.790> really<00:03:39.210> liked

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
number one thing that I really liked

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.260 
number one thing that I really liked
about<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.200> I'll<00:03:41.190> show<00:03:41.460> you<00:03:41.520> before<00:03:41.820> this

about this and I'll show you before this
came<00:03:42.540> out<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.750> actually<00:03:42.990> bought<00:03:43.290> something<00:03:43.530> let

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
came out I actually bought something let

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.160 

so<00:03:50.220> my<00:03:50.490> whole<00:03:50.760> thing<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:51.510> year<00:03:51.570> was<00:03:52.020> about

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
so my whole thing this year was about

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.860 
so my whole thing this year was about
speed<00:03:52.680> right<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.360> because<00:03:55.550> as<00:03:56.550> um<00:03:57.270> let<00:03:57.600> me<00:03:57.630> tell

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
speed right so because as um let me tell

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.200 
speed right so because as um let me tell
you<00:03:57.990> why<00:03:58.220> why<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> bought<00:03:59.580> this<00:03:59.730> before<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.060> can

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
you why why I bought this before I can

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.190 
you why why I bought this before I can
show<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.600> I'm<00:04:00.690> going<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.870> tell<00:04:00.990> you<00:04:01.050> why

show it to you I'm going to tell you why
I<00:04:01.230> bought<00:04:01.440> it

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
I bought it

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.760 
I bought it

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
so these shorts right here when you talk

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.730 
so these shorts right here when you talk
about<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.370> know<00:04:05.490> breathability<00:04:06.350> these<00:04:07.350> are

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
about you know breathability these are

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.640 
about you know breathability these are
not<00:04:08.640> as<00:04:08.910> breathable<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.840> know<00:04:10.140> they're<00:04:10.410> dry

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
not as breathable you know they're dry

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.250 
not as breathable you know they're dry
fit<00:04:10.950> their<00:04:11.190> sweat<00:04:11.460> wicking<00:04:11.670> but<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.930> does<00:04:13.110> not

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
fit their sweat wicking but it does not

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.290 
fit their sweat wicking but it does not
allow<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> lot<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:13.860> air<00:04:14.100> flow<00:04:14.160> through<00:04:14.880> here<00:04:15.090> and

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
allow a lot of air flow through here and

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.849 
allow a lot of air flow through here and
when<00:04:15.810> you're<00:04:15.930> talking<00:04:16.109> about<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.710> know

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
when you're talking about you know

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.270 
when you're talking about you know
wearing<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:18.210> know<00:04:18.239> compression<00:04:19.160> pants<00:04:20.160> or

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
wearing you know compression pants or

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.250 
wearing you know compression pants or
shorts<00:04:20.520> underneath<00:04:21.270> that<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.750> then<00:04:21.960> wearing

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
shorts underneath that and then wearing

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.420 
shorts underneath that and then wearing
the<00:04:22.320> padding<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.800> then<00:04:22.919> wearing<00:04:23.130> your<00:04:23.220> pants

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
the padding and then wearing your pants

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.430 
the padding and then wearing your pants
s<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:23.790> many<00:04:23.940> layers<00:04:24.210> but<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.169> right<00:04:25.380> here

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
s so many layers but this right here

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.820 
s so many layers but this right here
allows<00:04:26.040> you

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
allows you

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.820 
allows you
to<00:04:26.979> really<00:04:27.310> breathe<00:04:27.819> this<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> mesh<00:04:28.830> the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
to really breathe this is a mesh the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.679 
to really breathe this is a mesh the
other<00:04:29.919> ones<00:04:30.069> are<00:04:30.159> not<00:04:30.280> mesh<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:30.759> you<00:04:30.849> get<00:04:31.240> tons

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
other ones are not mesh so you get tons

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.529 
other ones are not mesh so you get tons
of<00:04:31.960> airflow<00:04:32.460> breathability<00:04:33.460> it's<00:04:33.970> still<00:04:34.240> dry

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
of airflow breathability it's still dry

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.279 
of airflow breathability it's still dry
fit<00:04:34.900> but<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.800> whole<00:04:36.069> entire<00:04:36.639> short

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
fit but the whole entire short

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.189 
fit but the whole entire short
everything<00:04:38.580> everything<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.789> mesh<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:40.689> that's

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
everything everything is mesh and that's

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.119 
everything everything is mesh and that's
going<00:04:41.379> to<00:04:41.439> really<00:04:41.650> aid<00:04:41.919> in<00:04:42.099> that

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
going to really aid in that

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.390 
going to really aid in that
breathability<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:44.500> way<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.979> won't<00:04:45.219> have

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
breathability so that way I won't have

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.659 
breathability so that way I won't have
to<00:04:45.610> wear<00:04:45.729> this<00:04:46.000> which<00:04:46.990> is<00:04:47.110> what<00:04:47.289> I<00:04:47.319> bought

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
to wear this which is what I bought

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.070 
to wear this which is what I bought
before<00:04:48.669> because<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.090> know<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:49.629> needed<00:04:49.960> that

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
before because you know I needed that

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.200 
before because you know I needed that
extra<00:04:50.110> air<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.770> breathability<00:04:51.159> so<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.909> won't

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
extra air and breathability so I won't

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.330 
extra air and breathability so I won't
have<00:04:52.449> to<00:04:52.569> wear<00:04:52.719> this<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.229> guys<00:04:53.620> won't<00:04:53.949> see<00:04:54.189> me

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
have to wear this you guys won't see me

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
additional breathability now in terms of

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.809 
additional breathability now in terms of
sizing<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.840> know<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:07.990> wore<00:05:08.409> a<00:05:08.770> large<00:05:09.310> in<00:05:09.639> this

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
sizing you know I wore a large in this

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.959 
sizing you know I wore a large in this
because<00:05:10.240> of<00:05:10.360> Nike<00:05:10.719> Nikes<00:05:11.469> pants<00:05:12.340> tend<00:05:12.699> to<00:05:12.789> run

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
because of Nike Nikes pants tend to run

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.209 
because of Nike Nikes pants tend to run
a<00:05:13.000> little<00:05:13.090> small<00:05:13.539> so<00:05:14.169> these<00:05:14.349> are<00:05:14.620> size<00:05:14.889> large

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
a little small so these are size large

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.730 
a little small so these are size large
and<00:05:15.550> they<00:05:15.610> fit<00:05:15.819> perfectly<00:05:16.360> these<00:05:17.169> are<00:05:17.469> size

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
and they fit perfectly these are size

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.879 
and they fit perfectly these are size
large<00:05:18.129> and<00:05:18.460> they<00:05:18.759> actually<00:05:19.090> run<00:05:19.539> a<00:05:19.750> little<00:05:20.469> big

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
large and they actually run a little big

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.769 
large and they actually run a little big
just<00:05:21.159> that<00:05:21.340> they<00:05:21.460> work<00:05:21.669> but<00:05:22.240> they're<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.479> little

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:22.779 
just that they work but they're a little

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.140 
just that they work but they're a little
big<00:05:23.229> so<00:05:23.590> ideally<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.490> probably<00:05:24.909> would<00:05:25.120> have

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
big so ideally I probably would have

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.369 
big so ideally I probably would have
went<00:05:25.330> with<00:05:25.389> a<00:05:25.479> medium<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:25.960> if<00:05:26.020> you're<00:05:26.139> used<00:05:26.289> to

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
went with a medium so if you're used to

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.860 
went with a medium so if you're used to
wearing<00:05:26.529> Nike<00:05:26.800> compression<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.520> would<00:05:27.849> say<00:05:28.120> try

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819
