00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi now i wanted to see one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.810
 the important feature is also the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.500
 biology problem as you know miur il 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.960
 what ministry of education does 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 just a program for them 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.770
 medicino also matthew online to see 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.600
 the program to take a look at 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.480
 in description because I put the links 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 then the program of short-sighted of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.630
 already what beer provides provides 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 these points the chemistry of the living 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.250
 cell bioenergetics reproduction 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.230
 age of Italy to inheritance and eternity 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.140
 environment that can then be so high 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.239
 as genetic anatomy and physiology 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.920
 precisely of the animals of the place that nina 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.899
 general then what needs to be remembered 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.250
 we must remember and this is the first 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.110
 point ie the clinic treats 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.770
 essentially of the general structures 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.920
 precisely which go to make up the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.949
 organisms that is chemistry , atoms, le 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.110
 molecules like this are organized and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.539
 then the main features e 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 fundamental moon launches as the basis of the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.890
 life is concerned with studying the cell 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.359
 how it was discovered how it reproduces 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.370
 what are its main structures 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.870
 that constitute it 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.130
 the skeptical venier about who at all 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.410
 reactions that take place in the body 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.550
 therefore the metabolism was therefore on the era 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.650
 just how metabolism works that 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.690
 what is catabolism and wool bullying e 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.970
 just like the reactions interact 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.770
 between them as regards 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.120
 reproduction of italietta remembered 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.440
 precisely that in general we talk about 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.500
 what the material is 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.180
 genetic then dna the other types of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.840
 then nucleic acids will also make them 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.000
 etc 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 how these come precisely to interact 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.290
 therefore protein synthesis between them 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.480
 how they are transmitted by cell 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.580
 organism cell as it is 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.340
 they organize precisely within the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.740
 cell and above all the accounts you go 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.380
 also to see how often you can 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.000
 alter as it is carried in the material 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.560
 genetic so this is the thing 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.330
 important because very often to the test 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.950
 there are so many questions of genetics 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.780
 as regards anatomy la 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.400
 physiology remember that you go to 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.770
 study the structure with anatomy 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.420
 of the organism with the asiva physi 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.520
 instead study the function 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.750
 of the organism remembered precisely i 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.179
 organizational levels 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.700
 this is a very important thing in the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.280
 chemistry is essentially studied 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.530
 violent in the molecules the level 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.489
 next to the element the molecule is the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.650
 cell and then later it goes to 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.959
 just to the north with other suns that way 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.900
 away then in nature he will care that you do 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.000
 lives more advanced 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.590
 so this is very important 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.989
 basically there are the points here 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.709
 main to remember for the test 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.689
 always remember a lot of advice 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.069
 quick to always be general that is 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.250
 useless that you know maybe perfectly 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.329
 chemistry you can not know anything about friends 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.799
 I already have to have an overview 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.510
 of all topics 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.909
 once done everything in general can 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.010
 begin to investigate this the line 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.920
 so this is the general program 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.720
 miur biology for that is all 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.280
 sign up for Christmas because you make videos 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.690
 so the mines always updated are you 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.420
 minutes per cent me which I like not 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.639
 it costs nothing to visit my channels from 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.290
 facebook and ceri with barney the schizo 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.290
 hi klinger beds soon
