00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.640
 past course also already taught 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.460
 argumentative now we will see from the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.660
 spelling the previous me 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.480
 we saw the appearance of the facade 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.980
 as well we saw the revised essay from 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.750
 the facade or outside look by itself if 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.240
 I have read before it is properly 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.450
 the essay that is what is voting now 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.290
 let's see an aspect of the spelling 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.789
 I have always commented that the 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.400
 spelling now the facade and the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.960
 respect in this first part and after 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.059
 the spelling are the ones that are the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.250
 most important issues at the time of 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.989
 perform an essay and precisely to 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.089
 Sometimes all the questions are the most 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.530
 elementals of course you see are the 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.260
 issues where we least pay attention 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.989
 and that's why sometimes the qualification in 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.730
 this essay is not approving but for 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.250
 that we are seeing calmly 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.579
 in several considerations right now from 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.070
 the look the spelling let's zoom 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.680
 so that they can realize what 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.970
 what else is voting 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.560
 in this same essay we are 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.790
 well reviewing the trial of 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.790
 stagnation of Mexican soccer 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.090
 remember thought of the spelling in 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.090
 first place we put in the spelling 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.370
 second when there is a word 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.220
 that accent is put good what 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.690
 we point or vice versa equal capitals and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.760
 lowercase is about to be capitalized 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.440
 when one should or with lowercase as 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.600
 from uppercase before also what 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.670
 we point here when you need some 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 point and followed when you need a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.940
 point and apart I fulfilled a coma or two much 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.350
 followed a comma or a script that is 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.380
 some word that is written with c 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.289
 when it should be with s and so on 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.140
 let's try not to try to put as many 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.509
 issues the review but the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.510
 main in the spelling these are 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.400
 The main 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.830
 I highly recommend watching the video that 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.810
 we go up on the accentuation that 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.510
 remember what else they are going to review us 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.010
 the essay is in addition to the facade that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.380
 see in writing that it is also distributed 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.430
 the essay before reading it access before 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.200
 of properly reviewing trial first 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.800
 they will check if the written 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.840
 person that I will review 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.040
 the competent authority that is going to 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.750
 review the essay first thing they're going to 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.060
 to do is if it is well written if it has 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.830
 an organization the trials are not very 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.390
 not too small if you're 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.140
 well distribute the sheets should 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.090
 take advantage of spaces 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.220
 immediately after and as set 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.570
 Let's see the essay 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.270
 first thing you will do is see if they are 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.770
 well written with spelling with 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.190
 uppercase or lowercase with acceptance 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.330
 we have made a video about accentuation 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.250
 that says all the accentuation rules 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.350
 of the Spanish does not escape nor a there 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.530
 no exception that we have not 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.620
 addressed then watch this video is very 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.930
 short is very easy to understand so that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.450
 have all the skills that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.380
 can they will understand and they will know 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.480
 to accentuate perfectly and they will always 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.190
 they will never be wrong because they are going to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.740
 realize that this spelling of the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.500
 situation is something very ear the passage 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.420
 when you put a word they go to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.330
 know perfectly how it's going to accentuate 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.370
 because more more than memorizing they 're going to 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.440
 listen to that word and they will be the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.820
 environment is very simple remember that 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.319
 the orthographic rules a high return 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.680
 as economic 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.680
 They try to explain or try to accentuate 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.920
 rather the least the least amount of 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.370
 possible words 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.159
 in the situation this essay 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.159
 young has this lack 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.879
 several accentuation errors 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.430
 let's see it quickly so that 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.620
 can realize at the moment from the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.239
 yourselves in the first essay in the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.189
 first video that we saw of that same 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.739
 soccer training test and 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:11.099
 cancer they realize that there are errors of 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:15.120
 situation and that gave him a loud voice and I tried 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.100
 to read it out loud and not point out 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.590
 mistakes that there were but then later then 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.320
 they voted there are words for example that 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.630
 they are accented 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.040
 and suddenly that same word is not 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.250
 accented after for example here 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.060
 football then a serious word 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.139
 here is accented in the title 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.249
 and here I do not accept it 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.659
 the words the letters even if they are with 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.659
 capital letters are accented 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.900
 with uppercase or lowercase but always 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.490
 they have to have the regulations that 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.380
 says the guide 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.610
 well they teach us what we are doing 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.830
 basically right now the errors of 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.690
 accentuation see again capitalized 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.020
 of others from the others is that 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.230
 aspects not words that are good 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.230
 written 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.060
 you have to see today is to point out what is 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:16.100
 bad is that but also what is good 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:20.710
 there is good management of others 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.710
 points of the other population see how 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.970
 as there are many spelling errors 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.150
 we articulate them when there are three errors 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.180
 in the same porthole we put a 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.610
 circle to emphasize a little more 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.400
 that the person realizes that it is there 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.000
 where is failing more and finally the 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.080
 last porthole 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.880
 again this accentuation program 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.200
 accentuates that word and suddenly to 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.590
 next line 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.960
 already stops accentuating the then 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.090
 great care 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.530
 this is sometimes for not reviewing our 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.949
 misspellings is because no 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.319
 we review the essay and in the end that is 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.150
 to give a quick review to see 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.240
 it is well spirit and above all accents 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.150
 that maybe the accentuation is the most 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.520
 important together for calligraphy 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.590
 at the time of writing your message 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.879
 it's something very simple really not 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.879
 we are seeing nothing for the other world 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.800
 it's a look a little panoramic see 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.880
 how much is charged to this aspect of the 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.860
 situation 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.520
 it is well written in general terms 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.190
 this essay but this lack of 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.800
 our lack of situation these faults 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.960
 orthographic if they weigh a lot at the moment 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.100
 to qualify your exam then have 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.720
 be very careful because it is very simple 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.580
 you can understand watching this video 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:50.129
 what I told you 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.929
 the accentuation and dance of the other side 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.179
 next we will see this same 

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:56.719
 trial but from the perspective of the 

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:56.719
 shape
