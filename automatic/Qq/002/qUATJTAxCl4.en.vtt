00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
thinking Sasuke has been through a lot

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.310 
thinking Sasuke has been through a lot
of<00:04:15.490> betrayal<00:04:15.940> shit<00:04:16.270> in<00:04:16.390> this<00:04:16.540> life<00:04:16.750> too<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.020> he

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
of betrayal shit in this life too and he

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.390 
of betrayal shit in this life too and he
seems<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.950> have<00:04:17.980> turned<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.210> new<00:04:19.390> leaf<00:04:20.160> no<00:04:21.160> pun

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
seems to have turned a new leaf no pun

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.770 
seems to have turned a new leaf no pun
intended<00:04:21.489> be<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.120> they<00:04:22.240> are<00:04:22.450> from<00:04:22.750> the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
intended be that they are from the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.140 
intended be that they are from the
hidden<00:04:23.350> leaf

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
hidden leaf

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.020 
hidden leaf
and<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:26.010> two<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.310> them<00:04:26.490> get<00:04:26.670> back<00:04:26.790> together

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
and so the two of them get back together

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.170 
and so the two of them get back together
and<00:04:27.570> their<00:04:27.930> fire<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.620> his<00:04:29.040> blue<00:04:29.700> lightning

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
and their fire and his blue lightning

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.780 
and their fire and his blue lightning
purple<00:04:30.510> lightning<00:04:30.660> makes<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.320> face<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.860> unity

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
purple lightning makes a face of unity

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.780 
purple lightning makes a face of unity
to<00:04:33.000> ban<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:34.020> stand<00:04:34.320> against<00:04:34.740> Obito<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.430> think

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
to ban and stand against Obito I think

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.340 
to ban and stand against Obito I think
it's<00:04:35.940> cool<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.690> think<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.080> fact<00:04:37.290> that

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
it's cool I think the fact that

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.610 
it's cool I think the fact that
Orochimaru<00:04:38.190> was<00:04:38.970> fighting<00:04:39.480> on<00:04:39.660> alongside<00:04:40.230> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
Orochimaru was fighting on alongside the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.230 
Orochimaru was fighting on alongside the
Allied<00:04:40.920> forces<00:04:41.130> everybody<00:04:41.670> is<00:04:42.030> together

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
Allied forces everybody is together

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.930 
Allied forces everybody is together
because<00:04:42.780> they<00:04:42.900> do<00:04:42.960> not<00:04:43.260> want<00:04:43.560> someone<00:04:44.400> to

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
because they do not want someone to

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.610 
because they do not want someone to
dictate<00:04:45.420> how<00:04:45.600> they<00:04:45.810> should<00:04:46.020> live<00:04:46.200> their<00:04:46.230> life

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
dictate how they should live their life

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.180 
dictate how they should live their life
and<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.160> think<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:48.300> perfect<00:04:49.020> it's<00:04:49.470> perfect

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
and I think it's perfect it's perfect

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.330 
and I think it's perfect it's perfect
and<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:51.960> just<00:04:52.320> sits<00:04:52.650> well<00:04:53.660> ok<00:04:54.660> with<00:04:55.620> how

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
and it and it just sits well ok with how

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.580 
and it and it just sits well ok with how
the<00:04:56.400> world<00:04:56.820> needs<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.450> be<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:58.350> know<00:04:58.440> they're

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
the world needs to be you know they're

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.170 
the world needs to be you know they're
