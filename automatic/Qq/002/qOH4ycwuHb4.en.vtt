00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 We put three men tied to the fire 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.799
 to three men and hold on I see 44 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.599
 untied who walk in the middle of 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.639

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.889
 you of the son of God the king of 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.260
 Chaldeans has erected a statue for 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.840
 that the nations prostrate themselves before her 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.270
 we have decided not to contaminate 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.029
 us with the king's food or customs 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.310
 outsiders has issued a mandate dictated by 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 the king that who does not worship the statue will 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.439
 He will see it with the one who does not obey 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.110
 be thrown into a blazing furnace 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.120
 still I refuse because I said is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.430

 heavens and on earth I am jehovah you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850

 of the hunter and that always goes with you 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.280
 as a powerful giant and I will not leave you 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.940

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.039
 death with you I will be him when they hear 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.470

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.720
 musicals will get on their knees 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.540
 in the golden statue that is before 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.390
 you all who do not kneel and 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.650
 adore the statue will be thrown 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.800
 immediately to word not understood that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.440
 tell the king for days have sounded the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.090
 kitchens everyone is prostrating in front 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.660
 of the statue but when you want it not 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.850
 make 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.860
 there are three whose knees before you go what 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.930
 double three faithful men who do not 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.240
 matter that they threaten you are willing 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.130
 to die for the sake of the gospel to die in 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.200
 Christ is profit but nobody wants 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.850
 do it no matter how much we suffer not 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.740
 matter how much we cry any 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.260
 tribulation will prevent us from reaching the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.840
 It is true that you did not worship 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.060
 my golden statue is true his majesty 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 we can not serve the gods that 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.030
 kneel to worship no other 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.729
 God save the god of the always come 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.440
 that the furnace turned on unless 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.490
 you kneel and worship the iata 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.360
 because I have risen they will be burned alive 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.180
 they understand 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.440
 Of course we understand but know or king that 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.080
 the god to whom the abyss can 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.000
 get rid of your hand and if it does not free us 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.490

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.900
 King has given an order that has warmed 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.510
 the oven seven times more than 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.550

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.890

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.750

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.120
