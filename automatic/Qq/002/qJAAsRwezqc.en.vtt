you<00:00:15.630> know<00:00:15.750> hold<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.139> hard<00:00:16.410> team<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.670> we

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
you know hold on a hard team but if we

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.700 
you know hold on a hard team but if we
win<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.300> breathing<00:00:18.660> space<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.470> true

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
win we have breathing space it's true

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.200 
win we have breathing space it's true
we'll<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> lot<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.400> breathing<00:00:20.760> space<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
we'll have a lot of breathing space and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.730 
we'll have a lot of breathing space and
we<00:00:21.630> should<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.900> beaten<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.320> will<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> don't

play amazing yeah they can and teams

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.960 
play amazing yeah they can and teams
down<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.840> part<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.829> league<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.820> this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
down that part is the the league at this

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.609 
down that part is the the league at this
time<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> season<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.140> sometimes<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
time of the season is it sometimes you

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.020 
time of the season is it sometimes you
went<00:01:40.770> off<00:01:40.860> playing<00:01:41.009> me<00:01:41.189> table<00:01:41.520> teams<00:01:41.700> go<00:01:41.850> now

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
went off playing me table teams go now

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.609 
went off playing me table teams go now
only<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:43.140> they<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.470> nothing

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
only I think because they have nothing

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.679 
only I think because they have nothing
to<00:01:43.890> people<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.549> think<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.329> mid-table

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
to people so I think they mid-table

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.149 
to people so I think they mid-table
teams<00:01:46.079> much<00:01:46.350> easier<00:01:46.710> than

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
teams much easier than

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.029 
teams much easier than
in<00:01:47.249> for<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.820> relegation<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:49.049> yeah<00:01:49.679> when<00:01:49.859> they're

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
in for a relegation or yeah when they're

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.410 
in for a relegation or yeah when they're
threatened<00:01:50.219> by<00:01:50.399> litigation<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.999> problem<00:01:51.329> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
threatened by litigation is a problem I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.209 
threatened by litigation is a problem I
agree<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.319> think<00:01:52.590> we're<00:01:52.799> gonna<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.069> fine

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219

agree but I think we're gonna be fine
and<00:01:53.460> um<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.539> think<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.350> keep<00:01:55.590> certain
