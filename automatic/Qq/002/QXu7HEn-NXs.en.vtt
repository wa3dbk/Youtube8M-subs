have toughness tak mass and dexterity

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.570 
have toughness tak mass and dexterity
dexterity<00:00:26.789> because<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.240> assault<00:00:27.539> rifle<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
dexterity because it's assault rifle and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.120

if you guys don't know dexterity helps I
believe<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.579> reduces<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.390> pull<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
believe it reduces your pull up and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.319 
believe it reduces your pull up and
shoot<00:00:34.050> time<00:00:34.649> by<00:00:35.489> thirty<00:00:36.030> three<00:00:36.300> percent

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
shoot time by thirty three percent

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.819 
shoot time by thirty three percent
something<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.200> that's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.680> high

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
something like that that's a really high

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.319 
something like that that's a really high
percentage<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> guys<00:00:38.700> don't<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.149> that's

like an SMG an SMG assault rifle hybrid
its<00:00:59.489> movement<00:00:59.969> speed<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.480> set

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
its movement speed is now set

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
its movement speed is now set
ninety-seven<00:01:01.680> percent<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> guys<00:01:02.489> didn't

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
know it um it was ninety-five percent

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.940 
know it um it was ninety-five percent
originally<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.229> ninety-seven

originally but now it's ninety-seven

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.280 
originally but now it's ninety-seven
percent<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> put<00:01:09.600> stock<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
percent and when you put stock on it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.039 
percent and when you put stock on it
pretty<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:10.710> turns<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.280> submachine<00:01:11.850> gun

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
pretty much turns into a submachine gun

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
pretty much turns into a submachine gun
it<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.290> has<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> little<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:13.890> better<00:01:14.040> range

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it just has a little bit better range

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
it just has a little bit better range
and<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:16.020> honest<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and to be honest I really like to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
and to be honest I really like to
accuracy<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.909> gun<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.689> almost<00:01:18.810> feels

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
accuracy on this gun it almost feels

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.440 
accuracy on this gun it almost feels
like<00:01:19.820> trying<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> gun<00:01:21.299> that's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
like trying to think of a gun that's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.999 
like trying to think of a gun that's
very<00:01:21.659> similar<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.820> like<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.750> tar-21<00:01:25.380> for

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
very similar on like the the tar-21 for

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.950 
very similar on like the the tar-21 for
modern<00:01:26.250> warfare<00:01:26.400> two<00:01:26.990> or<00:01:28.189> something<00:01:29.189> like

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
modern warfare two or something like

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.330 
modern warfare two or something like
maybe<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.229> something<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> ACR

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
maybe even something like the ACR

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.030 
maybe even something like the ACR
probably<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> bad<00:01:33.210> ACR<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.040> really

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
probably not that bad ACR it's really

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
probably not that bad ACR it's really
ridiculously<00:01:35.610> accurate<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:37.189> but<00:01:38.189> um<00:01:39.049> I've

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
off the radar so it's very very very

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.449 
off the radar so it's very very very
dead<00:02:09.030> very<00:02:09.479> deadly<00:02:09.810> class<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.009> don't<00:02:11.250> like

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
dead very deadly class if you don't like

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.500 
dead very deadly class if you don't like
that<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:12.000> i<00:02:12.030> recommend

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that then i recommend

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.130 
that then i recommend
and<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.780> red<00:02:13.080> dot<00:02:13.319> silencer<00:02:14.040> because<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:15.510> don't

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and a red dot silencer because I don't

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.809 
and a red dot silencer because I don't
know<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.620> iron<00:02:16.799> sights<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.340> silencer<00:02:17.790> I
