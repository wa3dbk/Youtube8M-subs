00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.509
 with a small box inc hour yes like 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.380
 it is easy to see here it works 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.630
 is back to jackie chan today and that is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.640
 today again something from him appeared 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 police story one and two so that 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.390
 again a very short unspectacular 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.040
 unboxing as I said the amaras more than 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.219
 info the movies are out I got them 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.059
 brought 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.129
 in content I have the right time 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.379
 I can not see much anymore 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.960
 I say you both found that I think so 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.190
 pretty good 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.600
 I think so the second better than the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.640
 first but I'm really not there 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.309
 more sure it always comes now 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.699
 again from this filth Ã©ditions new 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.649
 things out master of all classes and 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.379
 something of the city hunter I still have 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.180
 it's coming next month 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.070
 police story but already if you 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.580
 Jackie Chan definitely speaks 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.510
 classic of him 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.070
 I'm curious how that with the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.070
 picture quality looks like that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.600
 ever worth it on blu ray 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.680
 so I'm not sure that it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.110
 here is somehow blu ray hd material 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.670
 well mission eagle was worth it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.259
 I've never seen such a cool horny 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.299
 I was satisfied 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.770
 whether that is worthwhile in comparison 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.360
 I can not say to the dvd though 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.900
 the dvds are similar to those of the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.950
 You have to go to the magnifier here 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.329
 grab it yes 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.369
 Of course, nothing spectacular here 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:45.799
 promotional card by blended yeah like 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.929
 at the god thing these purposes 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.420
 editions so I find it relatively 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.960
 ugly yes nice that there is no fsk here 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.649
 But there are more bottles with them 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.500
 that has already scenes from the film 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:05.380
 believes bonus material is needed too 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.269
 a lot of bonus material on it anyway 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.069
 and the second part again pro forma 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.410
 I will write below 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.400
 Of course the technical data like 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.079
 always and then I still put them both 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.610
 are the same times in the blu ray player 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.349
 a little bit by watching me that 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.620
 here an extra imprint included 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.849
 German theatrical version do not know exactly 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.130
 that's probably how it is 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.360
 just a fully fully seconded one 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.900
 the version was here on this one 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.739
 longer version on it the normal 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.450
 Cantonese-making and there are there 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.860
 some do not sync 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.170
 as I understand it 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.489
 but unfortunately I still have to god once 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.870
 not seen in the case so that the case 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.239
 his here is complete 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:50.109
 synced yes too here too 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.109
 Find 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.650
 not much is happening even up to the 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.970
 the fsk bottles disappear that bin 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.670
 I look so cool a bit 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.870
 ace attorney moderately made of objects 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.870
 that was it the objection had seen 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.130
 how the quality is so the film can 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.109
 I said not much anymore 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.569
 say she has really cool 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.549
 memories were still seen on tv 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.989
 I do not know which one was 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.260
 was captured and had 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.329
 somehow in the shoe such a telegraph 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.920
 or so moser apparaten with it 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.700
 communicates with his territory and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.599
 his partners 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.810
 I mean that was the second part of that 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.109
 So there is action pure hong kong action like 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.609
 They should be modern Hong Kong action 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.410
 just once on it to check windows 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.989
 have important award both now 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.770
 between ten and twelve euros depending on 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.120
 where to order 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.170
 I do not know how it is now 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.000
 amazon is i have as i have her 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.840
 yet they were both for 999 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.670
 in amazon in it 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.930
 The price has risen, I think 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.120
 now at 11 91 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.440
 Just look in anyway fair 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.510
 prices I want to say are already 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.510
 Classics that 's it from me again
