fund Terry animation a second time

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710 
fund Terry animation a second time
because<00:01:43.890> governments<00:01:44.729> these<00:01:44.880> days<00:01:45.090> they're

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
because governments these days they're

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359 
because governments these days they're
selfish<00:01:46.170> they<00:01:46.409> want<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> keep<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.100> their

money they didn't want to risk it or

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.429 
money they didn't want to risk it or
spend<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:51.450> keep<00:01:51.750> their<00:01:52.020> money

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439

spend it so they will keep their money
and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.009> doubt<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.430> will<00:01:53.549> fund<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.119> second

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and I doubt they will fund a second

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
and I doubt they will fund a second
series<00:01:54.990> however<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.619> may<00:01:55.770> fund<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.250> second

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
series however they may fund a second

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.609 
series however they may fund a second
