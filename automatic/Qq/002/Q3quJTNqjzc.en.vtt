you can also use fishing line or you
could<00:00:18.609> use<00:00:18.760> regular<00:00:18.970> beading<00:00:19.510> wire<00:00:19.630> but<00:00:20.350> it

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
could use regular beading wire but it

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.259 
could use regular beading wire but it
will<00:00:20.590> show<00:00:20.890> up<00:00:21.100> as<00:00:21.279> you<00:00:21.519> make<00:00:21.699> your<00:00:21.730> project

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
you have larger hold beads you may want

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.060 
you have larger hold beads you may want
to<00:00:42.940> use<00:00:43.090> two<00:00:43.300> by<00:00:43.480> two<00:00:43.539> crimp<00:00:44.050> tubes<00:00:44.289> but<00:00:44.890> know

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
to use two by two crimp tubes but know

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.740 
to use two by two crimp tubes but know
that<00:00:45.100> they<00:00:45.489> will<00:00:45.699> be<00:00:45.730> more<00:00:46.000> obvious<00:00:46.390> as<00:00:46.539> you

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
that they will be more obvious as you

that they will be more obvious as you
make<00:00:46.930> your<00:00:47.079> necklace<00:00:47.410> so<00:00:48.039> I'm<00:00:48.100> going<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.340> start

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
make your necklace so I'm going to start

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
make your necklace so I'm going to start
off<00:00:48.670> by<00:00:48.969> putting<00:00:49.929> a<00:00:49.989> crimp<00:00:50.230> tube<00:00:50.289> on<00:00:50.710> my<00:00:50.920> cord

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
off by putting a crimp tube on my cord

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.450 
off by putting a crimp tube on my cord
and<00:00:53.230> I'm<00:00:53.320> going<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.559> leave<00:00:53.710> myself<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.280> couple

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
and I'm going to leave myself a couple

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.069 
and I'm going to leave myself a couple
of<00:00:54.670> inches<00:00:54.820> for<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.359> tail<00:00:55.570> so<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:55.989> will

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
of inches for the tail so that it will

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.540 
of inches for the tail so that it will
be<00:00:56.170> easier<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:56.559> finish<00:00:56.829> my<00:00:56.980> necklace<00:00:57.339> when<00:00:57.519> I

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
be easier to finish my necklace when I

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.369 
be easier to finish my necklace when I
get<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:57.910> point<00:00:58.149> and<00:00:58.750> I'm<00:00:58.870> just<00:00:59.050> gonna<00:00:59.140> go

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
get to that point and I'm just gonna go

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.189 
get to that point and I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:00:59.500> and<00:00:59.649> crimp<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:04.660> I'm<00:01:04.780> gonna<00:01:04.900> put<00:01:05.170> on

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
ahead and crimp it then I'm gonna put on

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.660 
ahead and crimp it then I'm gonna put on
my<00:01:05.320> first<00:01:05.800> bead<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.290> slide<00:01:09.010> it<00:01:09.189> down<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.549> my

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
my first bead and slide it down to my

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.149 
my first bead and slide it down to my
crimp<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.090> then<00:01:13.990> I'm<00:01:14.110> going<00:01:14.290> to<00:01:14.320> slide<00:01:14.979> on

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
crimp and then I'm going to slide on

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.450 
crimp and then I'm going to slide on
another<00:01:15.400> one<00:01:15.880> by<00:01:16.030> one<00:01:16.240> crimp<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:17.380> put<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.369> up

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
another one by one crimp and put it up

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.510 
another one by one crimp and put it up
against<00:01:18.790> my<00:01:18.820> bead<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.710> crimp<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:24.159> can<00:01:24.310> see

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
against my bead and crimp it you can see

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.780 
against my bead and crimp it you can see
that<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:24.880> bead<00:01:25.119> isn't<00:01:25.630> going<00:01:25.840> anywhere<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
that this bead isn't going anywhere and

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.660 
that this bead isn't going anywhere and
I'm<00:01:27.909> gonna<00:01:28.000> continue<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.689> do<00:01:28.840> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
I'm gonna continue to do that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.429 
I'm gonna continue to do that
for<00:01:30.670> all<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.970> these<00:01:31.090> beads<00:01:31.390> on<00:01:31.600> my<00:01:31.630> cord<00:01:32.079> and

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
for all of these beads on my cord and

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.630 
for all of these beads on my cord and
then<00:01:32.560> once<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.829> finish<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.280> I'll<00:01:33.430> show<00:01:33.610> you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
then once I finish that I'll show you

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.950 
then once I finish that I'll show you
how<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.880> finish<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.360> thing<00:01:34.540> that<00:01:34.689> can<00:01:34.840> be

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
how to finish the thing that can be

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.350 
how to finish the thing that can be
tricky<00:01:35.229> with<00:01:35.740> this<00:01:35.950> necklace<00:01:36.399> is<00:01:36.610> figuring

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
tricky with this necklace is figuring

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.420 
tricky with this necklace is figuring
out<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.630> spacing<00:01:38.110> between<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.530> beads<00:01:38.710> so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
out the spacing between the beads so

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.789 
out the spacing between the beads so
typically<00:01:39.820> what<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.090> do<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:40.990> will<00:01:41.170> leave<00:01:41.380> my

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
typically what I do is I will leave my

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.679 
typically what I do is I will leave my
necklace<00:01:42.219> on<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.670> bead<00:01:42.820> board<00:01:42.850> as<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.450> make<00:01:43.659> it

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
necklace on the bead board as I make it

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.050 
necklace on the bead board as I make it
and<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.409> will<00:01:44.469> slide<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.829> crimp<00:01:45.070> on<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.579> then

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
and I will slide a crimp on and then

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.209 
and I will slide a crimp on and then
gently<00:01:46.540> grab<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.049> with<00:01:47.229> my<00:01:47.259> pliers<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.039> that<00:01:48.070> I

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
gently grab it with my pliers so that I

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.679 
gently grab it with my pliers so that I
can<00:01:48.430> move<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:48.820> where<00:01:49.119> I<00:01:49.149> feel<00:01:49.390> like<00:01:49.450> it

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
can move it to where I feel like it

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.260 
can move it to where I feel like it
needs<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.990> be<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.500> then<00:01:51.039> crimp<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.549> you<00:01:52.090> want

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
needs to be and then crimp it you want

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.760 
needs to be and then crimp it you want
to<00:01:52.360> keep<00:01:52.479> in<00:01:52.600> mind<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:53.259> you<00:01:53.350> don't<00:01:53.560> want<00:01:53.710> to
