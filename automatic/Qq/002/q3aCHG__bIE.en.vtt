00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.710
 grilled chicken breast fillets 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.360
 with lemon sauce the ingredients that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.210
 we will need are the following 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.910
 breast I'll leave a link below 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.090
 in the description 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.650
 a green pepper cut in squares 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.570
 a well chopped white onion 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.840
 10 tablespoons of strained lemon juice 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.470
 6 tablespoons olive oil 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.170
 Salt 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.600
 and ground pepper the first thing we have 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 What to do is mix 3 tablespoons of the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.430
 we have with oil lemon juice 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.180
 and we mix it well then 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.120
 we put the previously washed fillets 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:05.300
 and dried in an airtight container 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.300
 we add the oil and lemon mixture 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.630
 and we are going to close it, we are going to leave it 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.880
 macerate for about 10 minutes in the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.800
 fridge if you like more lemon can you 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.840
 leave us a half hour but I'm going to 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.730
 leave 10 minutes while the chicken is 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.070
 macerated in the fridge in a pan 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.320
 we put a spoonful of oil what 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.090
 we put on a high heat and wait until 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.710
 that is hot when the oil is already 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.710
 is hot we add the onion 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.590
 and the pepper 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.930
 the models and cups 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.520
 and we lower the fire to medium-high and go 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.620
 to let it watered well for about 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.720
 minutes once we have the vegetable 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.720
 sofrito let's add salt 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.710
 and pepper 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.510
 how to see it 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.920
 we put out the fire and remove it 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.130
 once we have set aside the vegetables 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.140
 from the pan we toss them in a little dish and 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.600
 As ten minutes have passed, we take 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.850
 the marinated meat of the novelty we have 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.860
 put all the oil that we have left 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.260
 in the pan and we have put it back to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.230
 strong fire so let's go pulling 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.020
 the fillets of the marinade and draining 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.490
 how well 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.490
 and we put them in the pan 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.990
 and so we will do with the four steaks 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.810
 then let's go down to 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.220
 feed you the steaks and add a 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.220
 little is recorded by customers 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.879
 we are living 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.640
 and we're going to wait until it's golden 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.490
 this side once the steaks already 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.020
 are golden , we turn it around and 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.020
 we let them come in on the other side 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.200
 once the fillets to found 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.780
 little things on both sides we turn off the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.030
 fire where we got the phrase and we're going 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.040
 to remove the steaks on a plate we have already 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.680
 removed the steaks from the pan and let's go 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.660
 to leave the oil that has remained 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.050
 we remove the pan from the fire and we're going 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.240
 to add 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.710
 the juice of the lemon with the oil that 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.500
 we have used to marinate our 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.950
 steaks we put back a game 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.130
 high heat let's add a little 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.250
 of salt you try it until it is well 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.600
 seasoned for you and let's leave 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.600
 let it boil for a while 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.790
 and yellow so as we already have about 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.070
 the ingredients of our dish we're going 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.560

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.280
 in a separate container gives us the 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.470
