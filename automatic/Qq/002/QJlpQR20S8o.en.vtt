00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
kind of struggling with that because I

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.759 
kind of struggling with that because I
haven't<00:04:16.590> tried<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.920> ton<00:04:17.400> of

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
products from every single brand so I

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.059 
products from every single brand so I
would<00:04:19.900> buy<00:04:20.049> some<00:04:20.379> products<00:04:20.680> from<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.889> brand

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:21.069 
would buy some products from the brand

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:22.200 
would buy some products from the brand
and<00:04:21.190> try<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.430> but<00:04:21.639> I<00:04:21.669> feel<00:04:21.849> like<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.030> need<00:04:22.180> a

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
and try it but I feel like you need a

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.820 
and try it but I feel like you need a
little<00:04:22.479> more<00:04:22.720> than<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.930> week<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.410> try<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.650> out

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
little more than a week to try it out

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.710 
little more than a week to try it out
before<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.340> do<00:04:24.490> like<00:04:24.729> a<00:04:24.759> favorites<00:04:25.270> video<00:04:25.419> on

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
before you do like a favorites video on

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.450 
before you do like a favorites video on
it<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.319> I<00:04:26.379> am<00:04:26.650> going<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.979> continue<00:04:27.129> my

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460

a<00:04:32.830> video<00:04:33.069> on<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:33.759> just<00:04:33.849> going<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.120> be

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
a video on it so it's just going to be

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.270 
a video on it so it's just going to be
completely<00:04:34.690> scattered<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.650> whole<00:04:35.830> every

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
completely scattered the whole every

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.619 
completely scattered the whole every
single<00:04:36.550> Monday<00:04:36.729> thing<00:04:36.970> wasn't<00:04:37.270> really

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
single Monday thing wasn't really

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.059 
single Monday thing wasn't really
working<00:04:37.780> because<00:04:38.139> there<00:04:38.409> are<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:38.530> many

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
working because there are so many

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.800 
working because there are so many
different<00:04:39.190> brands<00:04:39.580> out<00:04:39.759> there<00:04:39.819> but<00:04:40.629> I'm

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
different brands out there but I'm

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.420 
different brands out there but I'm
thinking<00:04:41.169> of<00:04:41.289> another<00:04:41.560> series<00:04:42.009> for<00:04:42.190> Monday

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
thinking of another series for Monday

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.040 
thinking of another series for Monday
that<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.580> could<00:04:42.940> do<00:04:43.120> every<00:04:43.419> single<00:04:43.599> week<00:04:43.900> just

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
that I could do every single week just

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.779 
that I could do every single week just
because<00:04:44.199> it's<00:04:44.889> something<00:04:45.159> a<00:04:45.220> little<00:04:45.340> bit<00:04:45.520> you

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
because it's something a little bit you

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.490 
because it's something a little bit you
know<00:04:45.819> easier<00:04:46.419> rather<00:04:46.750> than<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.379> know

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
know easier rather than you know
