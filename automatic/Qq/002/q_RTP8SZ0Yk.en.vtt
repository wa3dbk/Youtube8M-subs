thin to at least an eighth of an inch
very<00:00:52.890> thin<00:00:53.480> then<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> center<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
very thin then for the center of the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.750 
very thin then for the center of the
Rose<00:00:55.530> you're<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:55.980> gonna<00:00:56.100> cut<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.699> strip

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
Rose you're just gonna cut out a strip

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.849 
Rose you're just gonna cut out a strip
like<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.420> then<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
like this and then you're just going to

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.550 
like this and then you're just going to
roll<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:04.549> until<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.760> coil<00:01:06.060> shape<00:01:06.560> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
roll it up until like a coil shape and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.810 
roll it up until like a coil shape and
that's<00:01:07.740> gonna<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> center<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> rose

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that's gonna be the center of the rose

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
that's gonna be the center of the rose
now<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.180> it's--if<00:01:09.630> candy<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.470> too<00:01:10.650> thick<00:01:10.920> at

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
now if it's--if candy is too thick at

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
now if it's--if candy is too thick at
this<00:01:11.220> point<00:01:11.580> it'll<00:01:12.150> crack<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.200> just

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
this point it'll crack and then just

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.850 
this point it'll crack and then just
pinch<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> base<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:15.500> get<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> stick

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
pinch the base of it get it to stick

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.820 
pinch the base of it get it to stick
together<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.450> for<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.479> petals<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.080> cut<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
together and for the petals just cut the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.880 
together and for the petals just cut the
petals<00:01:20.040> out<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:21.540> same<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:22.020> we're<00:01:22.619> using<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
petals out the same way we're using a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.840 
petals out the same way we're using a
pair<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.220> clean<00:01:23.490> kitchen<00:01:23.880> shears<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:25.850> smaller

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pair of clean kitchen shears and smaller

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.640 
pair of clean kitchen shears and smaller
petals<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.509> near<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> center<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> in

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
petals for the near the center and in

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
petals for the near the center and in
larger<00:01:29.009> petals<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.610> go<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.180> like

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
larger petals as you go out just like

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.690 
larger petals as you go out just like
you<00:01:30.360> would<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.509> any<00:01:30.869> normal<00:01:31.770> real<00:01:32.460> rose<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
you would have any normal real rose and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.600 
you would have any normal real rose and
then<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.880> add<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.240> petals<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> center

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
then just add the petals to the center

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
then just add the petals to the center
squeezing<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.729> base<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.329> them<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
squeezing at the base to get them to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.780 
squeezing at the base to get them to
stick<00:01:39.840> together<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.650> could<00:01:40.799> even<00:01:41.040> add<00:01:41.280> wet

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
stick together you could even add wet

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.910 
stick together you could even add wet
them<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> tiny<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> base<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.829> get

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
them just a tiny bit at the base to get

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.300 
them just a tiny bit at the base to get
them<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> stick<00:01:44.369> together<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.189> just

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
them to stick together and you can just

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889 
them to stick together and you can just
kind<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> yeah<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.000> push<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> petals<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
kind of yeah but push the petals a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.660 
kind of yeah but push the petals a
little<00:01:49.110> bit<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.530> thumbs<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
little bit with your thumbs there and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.649 
little bit with your thumbs there and
make<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.880> look<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.060> they're<00:01:51.329> realistic

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
make it look like they're realistic

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.960 
make it look like they're realistic
flower<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.399> put<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> top

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
for the leaves you can use green fruit

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.850 
for the leaves you can use green fruit
roll-ups<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.690> can<00:02:00.840> use<00:02:01.020> cut<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.470> with<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.620> pair

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
roll-ups it can use cut out with a pair
