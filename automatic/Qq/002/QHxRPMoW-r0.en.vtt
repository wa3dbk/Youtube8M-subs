number TW one one five a s right now
we're<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.680> standard<00:00:20.279> tuning<00:00:20.609> sort<00:00:21.119> of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
we're in just a standard tuning sort of

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.390 
we're in just a standard tuning sort of
sub<00:00:21.510> standard<00:00:21.960> but<00:00:22.529> let's<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.980> hear<00:00:23.189> how<00:00:23.310> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
sub standard but let's just hear how it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:41.700 
sub standard but let's just hear how it
sounds

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.590 

but<00:00:42.710> you<00:00:42.800> know<00:00:42.949> what<00:00:43.129> there's<00:00:43.969> just<00:00:44.179> something

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
but you know what there's just something

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.169 
but you know what there's just something
not<00:00:44.780> quite<00:00:45.199> right<00:00:45.350> about<00:00:45.769> it<00:00:45.949> I<00:00:46.280> think<00:00:46.879> we

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
not quite right about it I think we

00:00:47.179 --> 00:01:11.109 
not quite right about it I think we
should<00:00:47.329> go<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.719> little<00:00:48.409> deeper<00:01:09.789> it's<00:01:10.789> a<00:01:10.850> little

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
should go a little deeper it's a little

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.120 
should go a little deeper it's a little
better<00:01:11.330> it's<00:01:11.750> getting<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:12.020> little<00:01:12.229> heavier<00:01:12.560> but

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
better it's getting a little heavier but

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.499 
better it's getting a little heavier but
I<00:01:13.159> think<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:13.640> can<00:01:13.789> do<00:01:13.909> better<00:01:14.090> though<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.450> think

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
I think we can do better though I think

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.249 
I think we can do better though I think
I'd<00:01:14.810> like<00:01:14.990> some<00:01:15.280> assistance<00:01:16.280> from<00:01:16.460> our

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
I'd like some assistance from our

I'd like some assistance from our
beautiful<00:01:18.259> ladies<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:20.270> here<00:01:20.479> at<00:01:20.569> the<00:01:20.690> downer

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
beautiful ladies so here at the downer

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.770 
beautiful ladies so here at the downer
tuning<00:01:21.289> experiment<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:22.100> believe<00:01:22.460> in<00:01:22.819> lower

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
tuning experiment we believe in lower

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.190 
tuning experiment we believe in lower
the<00:01:24.500> better<00:01:25.030> after<00:01:26.030> all<00:01:26.149> it's<00:01:26.539> all<00:01:26.750> about<00:01:26.990> that

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
the better after all it's all about that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.410 
the better after all it's all about that
bass<00:01:27.459> so<00:01:28.459> let's<00:01:28.640> see<00:01:28.819> if<00:01:28.909> we<00:01:29.030> can't<00:01:29.240> get<00:01:29.360> a

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
bass so let's see if we can't get a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.999 
bass so let's see if we can't get a
better<00:01:29.569> sound<00:01:29.929> or<00:01:30.229> this<00:01:30.470> beautiful

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
better sound or this beautiful

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.580 
better sound or this beautiful
handcrafted<00:01:31.490> Tanglewood<00:01:32.330> guitar<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.929> then

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
handcrafted Tanglewood guitar and then

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.289 
handcrafted Tanglewood guitar and then
maybe<00:01:33.770> after<00:01:34.190> we<00:01:34.490> can<00:01:34.640> tangle<00:01:34.940> our<00:01:35.090> woods

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
maybe after we can tangle our woods

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:56.410 
maybe after we can tangle our woods
together<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.810> as<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.109> can<00:01:54.259> clearly<00:01:54.560> hear<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
together so as you can clearly hear the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.120 
together so as you can clearly hear the
low<00:01:56.600> string<00:01:56.929> has<00:01:57.140> reached<00:01:57.439> sub-audible

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
low string has reached sub-audible

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.450 
low string has reached sub-audible
frequencies<00:01:58.969> which<00:01:59.659> is<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.829> desired

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
frequencies which is the desired

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.700 
frequencies which is the desired
frequency<00:02:05.020> because<00:02:06.020> as<00:02:06.170> soon<00:02:06.320> as<00:02:06.439> you<00:02:06.590> can

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
frequency because as soon as you can

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.219 
frequency because as soon as you can
distinguish<00:02:07.159> between<00:02:07.219> frets<00:02:07.759> zero<00:02:08.329> three

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229

five<00:02:09.549> seven<00:02:10.549> and<00:02:10.940> twelve<00:02:11.920> that's<00:02:12.920> not<00:02:13.250> good

five seven and twelve that's not good

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.259 
five seven and twelve that's not good
enough<00:02:13.820> let's<00:02:14.660> try<00:02:14.930> some<00:02:15.290> beautiful

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
enough let's try some beautiful

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:23.810 
enough let's try some beautiful
arpeggiators

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.910 

as<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.180> hear<00:02:25.240> we're<00:02:26.080> really<00:02:26.350> achieving

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
as you can hear we're really achieving

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.850 
as you can hear we're really achieving
that<00:02:27.450> subtle<00:02:28.450> dissonance<00:02:28.990> sound<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.590> so

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
that subtle dissonance sound that so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.910 
that subtle dissonance sound that so
many<00:02:30.040> fans<00:02:30.850> crave<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.140> versatility<00:02:32.650> of

many fans crave and the versatility of
this<00:02:33.100> tuning<00:02:33.490> allows<00:02:33.700> us<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.180> do<00:02:34.480> things<00:02:34.810> that

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
this tuning allows us to do things that

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.470 
this tuning allows us to do things that
no<00:02:35.440> other<00:02:35.640> guitarist<00:02:36.640> has<00:02:36.880> been<00:02:37.090> able<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.330> do

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
no other guitarist has been able to do

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.170 
no other guitarist has been able to do
before<00:02:37.600> such<00:02:38.080> as<00:02:38.320> wrap<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.370> string<00:02:39.640> behind

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
before such as wrap the string behind

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.390 
before such as wrap the string behind
the<00:02:40.510> neck<00:02:46.170> although<00:02:47.170> now<00:02:47.740> that<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:48.070> think<00:02:48.100> about

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
the neck although now that I think about

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.330 
the neck although now that I think about
it<00:02:48.780> we're<00:02:49.780> hearing<00:02:50.050> audible<00:02:50.590> frequencies<00:02:51.100> so

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
it we're hearing audible frequencies so

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:03.870 
it we're hearing audible frequencies so
let's<00:02:51.520> just<00:02:51.760> dial<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.120> back<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.390> bit<00:02:52.540> and<00:03:02.880> what

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
let's just dial that back a bit and what

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.140 
let's just dial that back a bit and what
is<00:03:04.230> art<00:03:05.230> without<00:03:05.830> some<00:03:06.100> beautiful<00:03:06.760> chords

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
is art without some beautiful chords

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.500 
is art without some beautiful chords
added<00:03:07.630> into<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.930> mix

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.390 

I<00:03:15.590> guess<00:03:16.590> we<00:03:16.740> could<00:03:16.860> always<00:03:16.980> ask<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> question

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
I guess we could always ask the question

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.270 
I guess we could always ask the question
that<00:03:18.150> you've<00:03:18.270> all<00:03:18.420> been<00:03:18.540> waiting<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:19.130> what<00:03:20.130> is

that you've all been waiting for what is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.330 
that you've all been waiting for what is
