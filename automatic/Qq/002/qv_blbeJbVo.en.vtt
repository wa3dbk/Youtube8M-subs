made for the five hundred dollar budget

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.089 
made for the five hundred dollar budget
meaning<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:30.140> actually<00:00:30.439> costs<00:00:30.590> five<00:00:30.829> hundred

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
meaning it actually costs five hundred

meaning it actually costs five hundred
fifty<00:00:31.340> dollars<00:00:31.669> but<00:00:32.000> if<00:00:32.090> you<00:00:32.180> have<00:00:32.300> a<00:00:32.329> five

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
price what you're looking at here is a

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.500

dual-core processor but due to Intel's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.120 
dual-core processor but due to Intel's
hypothetic<00:00:57.020> technology<00:00:57.470> it's<00:00:57.620> actually<00:00:57.860> for

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
hypothetic technology it's actually for

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.680 
hypothetic technology it's actually for

clock and because of Intel's Haswell

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.760 
clock and because of Intel's Haswell
lineup<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:05.360> has<00:01:05.509> an<00:01:05.689> insane<00:01:06.110> single<00:01:06.619> core

lastly<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.150> comes<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.510> at<00:03:08.630> thirty<00:03:08.990> dollars

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
lastly it comes in at thirty dollars

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.650 
lastly it comes in at thirty dollars
which<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:09.950> really<00:03:10.310> g<00:03:10.520> per<00:03:10.730> case<00:03:11.270> it<00:03:11.630> probably

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
which is really g per case it probably

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.870 
which is really g per case it probably
cost<00:03:12.050> more<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.290> ship<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.650> than<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.950> buy<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.160> so

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
cost more to ship it than to buy it so

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.430 
cost more to ship it than to buy it so
let's<00:03:14.000> move<00:03:14.150> on<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.930> power<00:03:15.140> supply<00:03:15.320> the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
let's move on to the power supply the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.650 
let's move on to the power supply the
last<00:03:15.800> part<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.310> build<00:03:16.580> i<00:03:16.850> went<00:03:17.420> with<00:03:17.510> the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
last part of this build i went with the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.680 
last part of this build i went with the
corsair<00:03:18.110> CX<00:03:18.770> for<00:03:19.130> 30<00:03:19.400> watt<00:03:19.640> power<00:03:20.030> supply<00:03:20.060> I

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
corsair CX for 30 watt power supply I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.380 
corsair CX for 30 watt power supply I
like<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:21.410> power<00:03:21.650> supply<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.459> it's<00:03:22.790> 430

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
like this power supply because it's 430

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.970 
like this power supply because it's 430
watch<00:03:23.630> which<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.050> enough<00:03:24.320> for<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.530> build<00:03:24.770> and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
watch which is enough for this build and

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.710 
watch which is enough for this build and
overclocking<00:03:25.490> and<00:03:25.820> it's<00:03:26.360> 80<00:03:26.480> plus<00:03:26.690> bronze

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
overclocking and it's 80 plus bronze

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.509 
overclocking and it's 80 plus bronze
which<00:03:27.260> means<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.590> delivers<00:03:27.890> clean<00:03:28.130> power<00:03:28.310> to

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
which means it delivers clean power to

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.850 
which means it delivers clean power to
your<00:03:28.610> components<00:03:29.060> it's<00:03:29.870> also<00:03:30.019> semi<00:03:30.380> modular

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
your components it's also semi modular

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.290 
your components it's also semi modular
which<00:03:31.010> means<00:03:31.220> not<00:03:31.400> all<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.670> cables<00:03:32.000> attached

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
which means not all the cables attached

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.820 
which means not all the cables attached
to<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.540> power<00:03:32.720> supply<00:03:32.870> really<00:03:33.530> helping
