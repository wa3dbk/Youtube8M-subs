technobuffalo<00:00:02.310> it<00:00:02.520> might<00:00:02.669> look<00:00:02.820> like<00:00:02.879> they're

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
technobuffalo it might look like they're

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.180 
technobuffalo it might look like they're
just<00:00:03.419> looking<00:00:03.540> at<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.020> samsung<00:00:04.290> galaxy<00:00:04.890> s5

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
just looking at the samsung galaxy s5

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.160 
just looking at the samsung galaxy s5
but<00:00:05.400> actually<00:00:05.700> under<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.150> it<00:00:06.690> just<00:00:06.870> goes<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
but actually under it it just goes to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.990 
but actually under it it just goes to
show<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.589> can<00:00:07.740> squeeze<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.040> 5.5<00:00:08.790> inch

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
show and you can squeeze a 5.5 inch

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.450 
show and you can squeeze a 5.5 inch
screen<00:00:09.240> into<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:10.019> larger<00:00:10.650> or<00:00:10.830> smaller<00:00:10.860> farm

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
screen into a larger or smaller farm

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.259 
screen into a larger or smaller farm
form<00:00:11.849> factor<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:13.049> its<00:00:13.259> LG<00:00:13.590> g3<00:00:13.830> here<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:15.089> got

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
form factor is its LG g3 here so you got

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.599 
form factor is its LG g3 here so you got
the<00:00:15.299> 5.1<00:00:15.929> inch<00:00:16.080> display<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.470> galaxy<00:00:16.830> s5<00:00:17.160> vs

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
the 5.1 inch display of the galaxy s5 vs

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.390 
the 5.1 inch display of the galaxy s5 vs
55<00:00:18.539> right<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.350> want<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.980> show<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.189> for

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
55 right here I want to show this for

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.310 
55 right here I want to show this for
another<00:00:20.460> reason<00:00:20.789> because<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.420> has<00:00:21.570> 1080p

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
another reason because this has 1080p

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.650 
another reason because this has 1080p
display<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.310> has<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.000> quad<00:00:24.210> HD

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
display and this one has the quad HD

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.460 
display and this one has the quad HD
display<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.470> should<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.680> much<00:00:25.920> sharper<00:00:26.220> but

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
display so it should be much sharper but

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.570 
display so it should be much sharper but
side-by-side<00:00:28.470> honestly<00:00:28.980> right<00:00:29.130> now<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.460> not

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
side-by-side honestly right now I'm not

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.429 
side-by-side honestly right now I'm not
seeing<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.910> huge<00:00:30.119> difference<00:00:30.480> between<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> two

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
seeing a huge difference between the two

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.920 
seeing a huge difference between the two
I<00:00:31.650> think<00:00:32.279> maybe<00:00:32.460> we'll<00:00:32.730> see<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.090> more<00:00:33.390> with

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
I think maybe we'll see that more with

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.510 
I think maybe we'll see that more with
text<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.829> videos<00:00:35.640> coming<00:00:36.059> down<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> road<00:00:36.510> but

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
text and videos coming down the road but

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.889 
text and videos coming down the road but
i'll<00:00:38.520> show<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.790> an<00:00:38.940> example<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> video

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
i'll show you an example of the video

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.310 
i'll show you an example of the video
running<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.840> how<00:00:42.960> sharp

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
running here you can see just how sharp

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.229 
running here you can see just how sharp
the<00:00:43.469> screen<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.040> does<00:00:44.219> look<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.090> have

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the screen really does look if you have

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.180 
the screen really does look if you have
the<00:00:45.360> resolution<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> content<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the resolution in the content of it to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.220 
the resolution in the content of it to
run<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.390> otherwise<00:00:48.570> we'll<00:00:48.930> show<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
run it but otherwise we'll show you the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.279 
run it but otherwise we'll show you the
device<00:00:49.500> sizes<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:51.289> rather

a quick size up comparison of the two
phones<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.979> again<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
phones and again you can see just

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.609 
phones and again you can see just
slightly<00:01:38.159> larger<00:01:38.869> form<00:01:39.869> factor<00:01:40.350> than<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
slightly larger form factor than the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
slightly larger form factor than the
galaxy<00:01:40.979> s5<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.640> packs<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.970> 5.5<00:01:42.540> inch<00:01:42.750> screen

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
galaxy s5 but it packs a 5.5 inch screen

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.450 
galaxy s5 but it packs a 5.5 inch screen
now<00:01:43.079> he<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.439> able<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.829> that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
now he was able to do that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.940 
now he was able to do that
a<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:45.180> edge<00:01:45.510> to<00:01:45.810> edge<00:01:45.900> on<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.740> having
