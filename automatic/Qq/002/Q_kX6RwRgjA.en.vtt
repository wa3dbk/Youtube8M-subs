and<00:01:56.190> it's<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:57.090> just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
and it's it's just

and it's it's just
is<00:01:58.229> huge<00:01:59.009> man<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.909> thing<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.329> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
is huge man if this thing is this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.520 
is huge man if this thing is this
thing's<00:02:00.930> gigantic

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.779 

so<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:05.490> flipping<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> clean<00:02:06.390> side<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.789> this

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so I'm flipping to a clean side and this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.050 
so I'm flipping to a clean side and this
is<00:02:08.940> what<00:02:09.119> I'm<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> use<00:02:10.489> so<00:02:11.489> start<00:02:11.849> this

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
is what I'm going to use so start this

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.150 
is what I'm going to use so start this
is<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> very<00:02:13.170> easy<00:02:13.470> product<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.980> don't

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
is like a very easy product you don't

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.220 
is like a very easy product you don't
use<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.730> exactly<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:15.989> your<00:02:16.200> other

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
use it exactly just like all your other

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
use it exactly just like all your other
place<00:02:16.650> except<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.489> can<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.239> really<00:02:19.250> you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
place except you can you can really you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.400 
place except you can you can really you
can<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.730> use<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.060> very<00:02:21.390> quickly<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.140> says

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
can really use this very quickly it says

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.250 
can really use this very quickly it says
so<00:02:22.620> much<00:02:22.800> faster<00:02:22.980> than<00:02:23.250> play<00:02:23.930> when<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.050> first

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
so much faster than play when you first

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.630 
so much faster than play when you first
get<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.739> want<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.980> break<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
get it you want to break it in on the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.520 
get it you want to break it in on the
glass<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:27.030> want<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.239> keep<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.599> sliding<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.290> for

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
glass you want to keep on sliding it for

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.039 
glass you want to keep on sliding it for
about<00:02:28.620> I'd<00:02:29.040> say<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.280> minute<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:30.060> glass<00:02:30.840> and

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
about I'd say a minute on glass and

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.809 
about I'd say a minute on glass and
they'll<00:02:31.200> break<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.799> clay<00:02:32.010> after<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.670> you

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
they'll break in the clay after that you

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.449 
they'll break in the clay after that you
can<00:02:32.940> go<00:02:32.970> ahead<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.390> use<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:35.250> very

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
can go ahead and use it so it's very

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.670 
can go ahead and use it so it's very
simple<00:02:35.880> all<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.360> do<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.080> play<00:02:37.260> just

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
simple all you do is you just play just

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.670 
simple all you do is you just play just
spray<00:02:37.860> some<00:02:37.890> detail<00:02:38.549> spray<00:02:40.700> over<00:02:41.700> an<00:02:41.790> area<00:02:42.090> and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
spray some detail spray over an area and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.550 
spray some detail spray over an area and
then<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.880> what<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.720> feel<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.260> goes

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
then do this and what you feel it goes

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.520 
then do this and what you feel it goes
smooth<00:02:47.299> you're<00:02:48.299> gonna<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:48.959> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> feel

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
smooth you're gonna you're going to feel

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.309 
smooth you're gonna you're going to feel
it<00:02:49.739> became<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.130> contamination<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.269> using<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
it became a contamination and using it

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.100 
it became a contamination and using it
has<00:02:52.470> great<00:02:52.890> tactile<00:02:53.459> response<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.690> really<00:02:54.959> do

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
has great tactile response you really do

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.740 
has great tactile response you really do
feel<00:02:55.349> all<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.120> contaminants<00:02:57.120> being<00:02:57.450> picked

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
feel all the contaminants being picked

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.830 
feel all the contaminants being picked
up<00:02:57.900> from<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.470> bondage<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.340> paint<00:02:59.780> so<00:03:00.780> you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
up from the bondage to the paint so you

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.710 
up from the bondage to the paint so you
feel<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.940> very<00:03:03.180> very<00:03:03.480> smooth

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
feel it and you it's very very smooth

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.960 
feel it and you it's very very smooth
and<00:03:03.989> as<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:04.680> see<00:03:06.290> it's<00:03:07.290> very<00:03:07.470> quickly

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.840 

I<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.750> do<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.020> in<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.290> up-down<00:03:13.040> motion<00:03:13.310> as

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
I like to do it in a up-down motion as

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.370 
I like to do it in a up-down motion as
well<00:03:14.240> as<00:03:14.860> side<00:03:15.860> side<00:03:16.220> motion<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:17.200> right<00:03:18.200> now

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
well as side side motion and right now

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.080 
well as side side motion and right now
at<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.740> point<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.490> car<00:03:19.730> will<00:03:19.880> watch

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
at this point this this car will watch

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.200 
at this point this this car will watch
not<00:03:20.570> too<00:03:20.870> long<00:03:21.620> ago<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.190> it's<00:03:22.700> not<00:03:22.910> very

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
not too long ago so it's not very

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.790 
not too long ago so it's not very
difficult<00:03:23.480> at<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:23.960> of<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:25.370> do<00:03:25.520> this<00:03:26.800> but

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
difficult at all of you to do this but

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.190 
difficult at all of you to do this but
yeah<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:28.520> feels<00:03:28.790> just<00:03:29.150> smooth<00:03:29.660> as<00:03:30.020> glass<00:03:30.050> and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
yeah this feels just smooth as glass and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.190 
yeah this feels just smooth as glass and
a<00:03:33.200> lot<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.500> people<00:03:33.800> worry<00:03:34.490> about<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.930> fact

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
a lot of people worry about the fact

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.680 
a lot of people worry about the fact
that<00:03:36.500> all<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.190> parts<00:03:37.550> of<00:03:37.640> particulates<00:03:38.450> are

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
that all the parts of particulates are

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.560 
that all the parts of particulates are
being<00:03:38.930> embedded<00:03:39.650> into<00:03:40.130> here<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:41.090> with<00:03:41.330> clay

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
being embedded into here and with clay

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.900 
being embedded into here and with clay
you<00:03:41.870> can<00:03:41.900> see<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.500> particulate<00:03:43.040> with<00:03:43.670> this

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
you can see the particulate with this

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.270 
you can see the particulate with this
you<00:03:44.210> can't<00:03:44.480> see<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.780> because<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.230> dark<00:03:45.500> well

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
you can't see it because it's dark well

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.050 
you can't see it because it's dark well
the<00:03:46.970> thing<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.330> would<00:03:47.780> say<00:03:47.960> to<00:03:48.020> them<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:48.940> does<00:03:49.940> it

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
the thing I would say to them is does it

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.060 
the thing I would say to them is does it
really<00:03:50.090> matter<00:03:50.540> because<00:03:50.990> when<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.620> put<00:03:51.800> it<00:03:51.920> on

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
really matter because when you put it on

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.390 
really matter because when you put it on
you<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:52.850> say<00:03:53.390> half<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:54.080> quarter<00:03:54.380> but<00:03:54.650> look<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.370> a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
you do say half a quarter but look to a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.330 
you do say half a quarter but look to a
clean<00:03:55.700> slide<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:57.170> do<00:03:57.560> another<00:03:57.770> quarter<00:03:58.190> of<00:03:58.250> a

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
clean slide do do another quarter of a

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.240 
clean slide do do another quarter of a
foot<00:03:58.700> look<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.660> another<00:03:59.870> clean<00:04:00.260> side<00:04:00.560> look<00:04:01.100> to

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
foot look to another clean side look to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.380 
foot look to another clean side look to
another<00:04:01.400> clean<00:04:01.730> side<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.090> just<00:04:02.120> keep

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
another clean side you just keep

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.060 
another clean side you just keep
clipping<00:04:02.600> them<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.140> when<00:04:03.350> you're<00:04:03.500> done<00:04:03.680> all

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
clipping them and when you're done all

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
it does feel a lot smoother so that's

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.180 
it does feel a lot smoother so that's
the<00:05:09.540> speed<00:05:09.660> ease<00:05:09.900> help<00:05:10.110> prep<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.560> how<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.919> like

would recommend against getting the

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.170 
would recommend against getting the

between fifty five to sixty five dollars
and<00:05:22.380> that's<00:05:22.669> when<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.820> can<00:05:23.970> have<00:05:24.090> better<00:05:24.300> clay

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110

a<00:06:00.539> initial<00:06:01.110> steep<00:06:01.470> price<00:06:01.770> in<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.070> beginning

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
a initial steep price in the beginning

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.570 
a initial steep price in the beginning
however<00:06:03.240> once<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.139> buy<00:06:04.320> it<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:04.620> can<00:06:04.950> use<00:06:05.130> it<00:06:05.340> I

believe<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.360> manufacturer<00:06:06.870> says<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.289> hundred

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
believe the manufacturer says a hundred

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.219 
believe the manufacturer says a hundred
cars<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:08.550> that's<00:06:08.970> honestly<00:06:09.539> probably<00:06:09.750> more

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
cars and that's honestly probably more
