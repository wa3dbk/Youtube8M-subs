cars dot com auto review for a lot of drivers worried about the high cost of fuel

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.560
these days

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.230
there's more than one way to save gas in

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.340
well people have heard a lot about

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.990
so we've come here to check out three
hybrids two diesels

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.840
and EPA's highest rated regular gasoline
car smart fortwo

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.750
see how they do as regular drivers let's
take a look to make a decision we look

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.490
at seven separate categories

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.750
the smart fortwo was actually the
cheapest car as tested between a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.380
previous

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.399
had the lowest annual estimated fuel
costs we didn't give those categories

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.270
as much weight as the others metric
Kelsey first the most important

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.980
categories

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.930
for comfort right quality and driving
fun let's start with comfort

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.149
in this category we took a hard look at
roominess and seating comfort

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.579
the winner for us was the Volkswagen
Jetta TDI had a really comfortable seats

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.879
and a nice roomy cockpit

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.910
but just edged out before Fusion Hybrid
next up will try calling get Patrick and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.489
that's where we look at how the
suspension

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.170
help as well as Road wind and engine
noise and within this category the Audi

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.040
a3 TDI was our big winner

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.070
it was very quiet in sight as with all
the bumps on a multi-state ra

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.830
in second place was the Audi's cousin
for Volkswagen Jetta TDI

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.670
and moving on to next categories driving
fun

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.310
after tell me what were the criterion
well cuz he would each car's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.880
acceleration its handling and braking
nowhere for this category was the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.540
Volkswagen Jetta TDI

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.970
after driving this we all agreed that
its burly diesel engine just the way it

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.439
handled

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.060
me to fuck hard drive I agree its
English miscarry

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.909
something of a surprise for me was a
Ford Fusion Hybrid was also held

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.020
very well with a quick look at cargo
room by

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.740
checking out each car kit carry two
suitcases and the suit bag

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.079
the only card really didn't carry those
was the smart fortwo

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.290
all the rest from did as we scored
accordingly our final category was

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.770
interior quality have reportedly look
after them we looked at birkenau mix

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.890
mature holly

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.960
you know all the stuff that makes a car
feel upscale or not

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.250
and our winner in this category was the
out 83 it makes

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.270
cabin refinement in higher ed materials
like gave it a richer feeling the others

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.370
other because it's an Audi we weren't
all that surprised

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.690
you know what we were surprised by low
in the third-generation Prius

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.930
trade has really stepped up their game
and that's why I took second place

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.190
up Chris may have the lowest annual fuel
cost for the best combination of

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.050
practicality and driving fun

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.080
Jetta TDI was are clear winner thanks
