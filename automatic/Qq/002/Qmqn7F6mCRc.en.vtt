00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.000 

this<00:03:43.780> type<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.110> special<00:03:44.620> effects<00:03:44.890> of

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
this type of special effects of

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.920 
this type of special effects of
composting<00:03:45.550> control<00:03:45.940> because<00:03:46.330> all<00:03:46.629> of<00:03:46.810> this

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
composting control because all of this

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.530 
composting control because all of this
motion<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.620> controlled<00:03:47.860> by<00:03:48.159> a<00:03:48.190> computer<00:03:48.540> every

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
motion is controlled by a computer every

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.880 
motion is controlled by a computer every
movement<00:03:49.780> did<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.170> see<00:03:50.319> right<00:03:50.500> now<00:03:50.650> is

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
movement did you see right now is

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.070 
movement did you see right now is
programmed<00:03:51.489> into<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.879> computer<00:03:52.330> which<00:03:52.930> is

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
programmed into a computer which is

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.600 
programmed into a computer which is
connected<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.769> horrors<00:03:54.159> underneath<00:03:54.489> the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
connected to the horrors underneath the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.420 
connected to the horrors underneath the
cars<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:56.260> allows<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.709> arms<00:03:57.069> to<00:03:57.250> move

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
cars and that allows the arms to move

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.759 
cars and that allows the arms to move
the<00:03:57.549> cars<00:03:57.760> around<00:03:57.970> into<00:03:58.330> any<00:03:58.540> position<00:03:58.780> but

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
the cars around into any position but

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.440 
the cars around into any position but
you<00:03:59.950> wouldn't<00:04:00.280> see<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.580> arms<00:04:00.849> and<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.060> movie<00:04:01.360> or

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
you wouldn't see the arms and a movie or

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.750 
you wouldn't see the arms and a movie or
TV<00:04:01.629> show<00:04:01.810> because<00:04:02.530> later<00:04:02.950> they'd<00:04:03.580> be

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
TV show because later they'd be

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.759 
TV show because later they'd be
completely<00:04:04.299> erased<00:04:04.780> with<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.470> help<00:04:05.620> of

completely erased with the help of
computer<00:04:06.220> effects<00:04:06.489> now<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.239> tram<00:04:07.569> is<00:04:07.750> about
