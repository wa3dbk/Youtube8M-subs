00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
there's beer there's beer samples and

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.730 
there's beer there's beer samples and
it's<00:00:14.610> beautiful<00:00:15.360> outside<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.109> there's<00:00:16.500> way

the same beer okay calm so this is the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.460 
the same beer okay calm so this is the
thermal<00:00:23.820> cream<00:00:24.210> ale<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> orange

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
thermal cream ale and this is the orange

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
thermal cream ale and this is the orange
twist<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.039> there's<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.580> pork<00:00:26.820> go<00:00:26.910> ahead<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
twist and there's this pork go ahead of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.830 
twist and there's this pork go ahead of
those<00:00:27.539> yeah<00:00:28.410> um<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> same<00:00:30.420> beer<00:00:30.630> but

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
those yeah um it's the same beer but

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.359 
those yeah um it's the same beer but
this<00:00:31.109> one<00:00:31.289> becomes<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> orange<00:00:31.920> twist<00:00:32.070> when

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
this one becomes the orange twist when

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.830 
this one becomes the orange twist when
you<00:00:32.460> run<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> through<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.149> guy<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.480> guy's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you run it through this guy this guy's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.450 
you run it through this guy this guy's
got<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> Randall<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.800> basically<00:00:35.070> an<00:00:35.190> infuser

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
got a Randall it's basically an infuser

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
got a Randall it's basically an infuser
that's<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.030> working<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.570> speak<00:00:36.809> so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that's actually working as we speak so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.750 
that's actually working as we speak so
it's<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:38.129> running<00:00:38.430> through<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.610> these

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it's actually running through all these

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
it's actually running through all these
fridges<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.140> was<00:00:40.320> purchased<00:00:40.530> from

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
fridges and then this was purchased from

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
fridges and then this was purchased from
over<00:00:41.190> okay<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.090> comes<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.390> goes<00:00:42.629> into

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
over okay and it comes that goes into

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
over okay and it comes that goes into
this<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.020> cools<00:00:43.410> off<00:00:46.430> well<00:00:47.430> that's<00:00:47.670> without

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this and cools off well that's without

00:00:47.850 --> 00:01:05.520 
this and cools off well that's without
the<00:00:48.000> oranges

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.530 

I<00:01:05.560> think<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.190> just<00:01:06.370> understood<00:01:06.550> what<00:01:06.970> upper

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
I think I just understood what upper

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.270 
I think I just understood what upper
palate<00:01:07.810> ribs<00:01:08.229> I've<00:01:08.440> never<00:01:08.590> really<00:01:08.920> got<00:01:09.100> what

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
palate ribs I've never really got what

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.190 
palate ribs I've never really got what
that<00:01:09.400> meant<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:09.760> so<00:01:09.910> right<00:01:10.150> now<00:01:10.180> I'm<00:01:10.930> like<00:01:11.110> you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
a few drinks let's do some science

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.040 
a few drinks let's do some science
science<00:02:11.610> all<00:02:11.850> right<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.150> they<00:02:12.300> froze<00:02:12.750> some

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
science all right so they froze some

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.960 
science all right so they froze some
marshmallows<00:02:13.860> with<00:02:14.010> liquid<00:02:14.340> nitrogen<00:02:14.670> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
marshmallows with liquid nitrogen and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.340 
marshmallows with liquid nitrogen and
look<00:02:15.180> at<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:15.570> like<00:02:15.690> steaming<00:02:16.230> with

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.460 

hold<00:02:41.910> off<00:02:42.090> we're<00:02:42.569> gonna<00:02:42.630> make<00:02:42.870> dry<00:02:43.290> ice

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
hold off we're gonna make dry ice

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.920 
hold off we're gonna make dry ice
bubbles<00:02:43.920> now
