accommodates<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.269> router<00:00:27.660> lift<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.429> I<00:00:29.429> need<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
accommodates a router lift and I need to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.970 
accommodates a router lift and I need to
build<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.029> fence<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.710> I've<00:00:31.830> spent

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
build a fence for it and so I've spent

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100 
build a fence for it and so I've spent
some<00:00:32.430> time<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> last<00:00:33.030> couple<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.420> days<00:00:33.600> with

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
basically this is what I came up with

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.200 
basically this is what I came up with
it's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.140> combination<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:41.040> things<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.090> I

it's a combination of things that I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.229 
it's a combination of things that I
found<00:00:42.510> online<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:45.690> design<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.739> saw<00:00:47.239> by

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
found online and a design that I saw by

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.119 
found online and a design that I saw by

width so that I don't have any more any
less<00:01:28.770> travel<00:01:29.460> than<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.210> need<00:01:30.720> now

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
less travel than I actually need now

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
less travel than I actually need now
this<00:01:31.920> will<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.430> made<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> three

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
this will all be made out of three

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.800

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the router eventually this will be

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.679 
the router eventually this will be
covered<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.670> three<00:01:50.670> small<00:01:50.909> pieces<00:01:51.210> of

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
vacuum the mistake that I made in the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
design ahead last night was I had a a

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.930 
design ahead last night was I had a a
tee<00:02:09.060> track<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.560> bottom<00:02:10.920> sections<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.790> I

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
tee track on the bottom sections and I

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
tee track on the bottom sections and I
realized<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.690> there<00:02:12.870> was<00:02:13.020> really<00:02:13.200> no

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
realized that there was really no

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.410 
realized that there was really no
way<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.700> was<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> be<00:02:15.209> able<00:02:15.300> to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
way that I was going to be able to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.990 
way that I was going to be able to
connect<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.250> revision<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.790> made

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
connect that so the revision I made

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.340 
connect that so the revision I made
tonight<00:02:18.209> was<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.970> take<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.030> T<00:02:21.420> track<00:02:21.750> out<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
tonight was to take that T track out of

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
realized that it wasn't going to work

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.800 
realized that it wasn't going to work
and<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.980> face<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.269> permanent

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
and on the face this is a permanent

piece that will be bolted in most of the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.690 
piece that will be bolted in most of the
time<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:59.280> has<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.519> t<00:02:59.790> track<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:01.700> provide

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
time it has a t track in it to provide

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.660 
time it has a t track in it to provide
some<00:03:03.030> where<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.330> mount<00:03:03.830> feather<00:03:04.830> boards<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
hold the work pieces down but then if I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.410 
hold the work pieces down but then if I
want<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:09.440> route<00:03:10.440> raised<00:03:10.830> panels<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:12.239> take

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
want to route raised panels I can take

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.710 
want to route raised panels I can take
this<00:03:12.600> piece<00:03:12.930> out<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.410> put<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> taller<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.970> fence

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
inches of adjustment here which should

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.670 
inches of adjustment here which should
be<00:03:35.430> more<00:03:35.700> than<00:03:35.850> enough<00:03:36.079> to<00:03:37.079> move<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.470> around

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
be more than enough to move this around

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.650 
be more than enough to move this around
and<00:03:38.070> snug<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.610> up<00:03:38.700> against<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.180> bit<00:03:39.480> as<00:03:40.010> needed

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
and snug it up against the bit as needed

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.870 
and snug it up against the bit as needed
the<00:03:42.660> key<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.410> size<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:44.070> piece<00:03:44.310> correctly

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
the key is to size this piece correctly

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.710 
the key is to size this piece correctly
but<00:03:45.060> once<00:03:45.269> that's<00:03:45.510> done<00:03:47.390> there's<00:03:48.390> plenty<00:03:48.690> of

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
but once that's done there's plenty of

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.800 
but once that's done there's plenty of
travel<00:03:49.410> here<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.010> then<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.850> other<00:03:51.090> thing<00:03:51.510> is

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
travel here and then the other thing is

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.830 
travel here and then the other thing is
these<00:03:52.620> pieces<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.799> fence<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.660> the

sacrificial pieces that can be moved in

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.550 
sacrificial pieces that can be moved in
and<00:04:06.750> out<00:04:07.519> as<00:04:08.519> you<00:04:08.760> see<00:04:09.030> here<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.630> snug<00:04:10.260> up<00:04:10.440> to

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
and out as you see here to snug up to

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.280 
and out as you see here to snug up to
the<00:04:10.680> bit<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.400> where<00:04:12.120> chip<00:04:12.420> out<00:04:12.570> is<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> problem

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
the bit and where chip out is a problem

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.890 
the bit and where chip out is a problem
I'll<00:04:13.829> simply<00:04:14.280> move<00:04:14.519> these<00:04:14.760> real<00:04:15.150> tight<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.750> the

I'll simply move these real tight to the

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.250 
I'll simply move these real tight to the
bit<00:04:16.850> where<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.000> bit<00:04:18.150> out<00:04:18.180> will<00:04:18.510> actually<00:04:18.690> cut

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
bit where the bit out will actually cut

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.290 
bit where the bit out will actually cut
into<00:04:19.530> this<00:04:19.680> corner<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:22.820> prevent<00:04:23.820> tear<00:04:24.150> out

the pieces

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.120 
the pieces
it's<00:04:26.690> a<00:04:26.840> little<00:04:27.080> bit<00:04:27.200> offset<00:04:27.380> you'll<00:04:27.770> notice

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
it's a little bit offset you'll notice

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.540 
it's a little bit offset you'll notice
these<00:04:28.370> bolts<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:30.200> this<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.800> can't<00:04:31.040> Center

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
these bolts and this is I can't Center

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.930 
these bolts and this is I can't Center
this<00:04:31.900> because<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.140> way<00:04:33.320> this<00:04:33.590> is

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
this because of the way this is

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.700 
this because of the way this is
fabricated<00:04:34.940> so<00:04:35.930> what<00:04:36.110> I've<00:04:36.200> done<00:04:36.380> here<00:04:36.440> is

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
fabricated so what I've done here is

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.220 
fabricated so what I've done here is
I've<00:04:36.860> offset<00:04:37.250> them<00:04:37.400> up<00:04:37.520> on<00:04:37.700> top<00:04:37.970> but<00:04:38.240> I've

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
I've offset them up on top but I've

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.610 
I've offset them up on top but I've
created<00:04:40.240> offsetting<00:04:41.240> holes<00:04:41.480> both<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.380> top

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
created offsetting holes both in the top

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.130 
created offsetting holes both in the top
portion<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.490> bottom<00:04:43.760> portion<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.990> that

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
portion and the bottom portion so that

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.840 
portion and the bottom portion so that
I'll<00:04:45.230> be<00:04:45.260> able<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.590> rotate<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.550> spin

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
I'll be able to rotate this and spin

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.870 
I'll be able to rotate this and spin
this<00:04:47.060> around<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.690> basically<00:04:48.470> sacrifice<00:04:49.250> all

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
this around and basically sacrifice all

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.420 
this around and basically sacrifice all
four<00:04:50.330> corners<00:04:50.630> on<00:04:50.900> each<00:04:50.930> side<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:52.190> if<00:04:52.340> it

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
four corners on each side and if it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.830 
four corners on each side and if it
comes<00:04:52.640> to<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.060> four<00:04:53.270> corners<00:04:53.600> on<00:04:53.720> the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
comes to it the four corners on the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.200 
comes to it the four corners on the
other<00:04:53.990> side<00:04:54.260> before<00:04:55.070> it's<00:04:55.430> time<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.820> rebuild

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
other side before it's time to rebuild

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.990 
other side before it's time to rebuild
these<00:04:56.560> um<00:04:59.500> all<00:05:00.500> that's<00:05:00.740> left<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:01.190> do<00:05:01.400> now<00:05:01.430> I

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
these um all that's left to do now I

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.440 
these um all that's left to do now I
think<00:05:02.690> is<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.550> get<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.730> cast<00:05:04.970> iron<00:05:05.210> table

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
think is to get the cast iron table

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.560 
think is to get the cast iron table
surface<00:05:06.020> mounted<00:05:06.680> in<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:07.070> table<00:05:07.460> saw<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:07.910> the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
surface mounted in the table saw and the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.200 
surface mounted in the table saw and the
lift<00:05:08.780> installed<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:09.590> then<00:05:10.310> begin<00:05:10.640> working<00:05:10.910> on

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
lift installed and then begin working on

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.850 
lift installed and then begin working on
this<00:05:13.720> it's<00:05:14.720> been<00:05:14.870> a<00:05:14.900> lot<00:05:15.110> of<00:05:15.140> fun<00:05:15.410> actually

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
this it's been a lot of fun actually

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.940
