00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.450 

in<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.429> first<00:00:02.700> video<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:03.149> showed<00:00:03.750> you<00:00:03.899> how<00:00:04.140> I

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
in the first video I showed you how I

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.900 
in the first video I showed you how I
draw<00:00:05.540> how<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.569> sure<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.290> perspective<00:00:08.099> drawing

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
draw how I sure this perspective drawing

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.400 
draw how I sure this perspective drawing
and<00:00:10.550> using<00:00:11.550> perspective<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and using perspective and this is the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.609 
and using perspective and this is the
vanishing<00:00:13.950> point<00:00:14.219> right<00:00:14.820> here<00:00:15.350> now<00:00:16.350> when<00:00:16.529> you

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
vanishing point right here now when you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.490 
vanishing point right here now when you
have<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> vanishing<00:00:17.430> point<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> center

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
have the vanishing point in the center

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.529 
have the vanishing point in the center
means<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:20.330> it<00:00:21.330> will<00:00:21.510> give<00:00:21.960> equal

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
means that it will give equal

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.220 
means that it will give equal
representation<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:25.439> both<00:00:25.830> sides<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.990> top<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
representation of both sides and top and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.580 
representation of both sides and top and
bottom<00:00:28.730> but<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.970> not<00:00:30.150> actually<00:00:30.660> Center<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
bottom but it's not actually Center is

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.299 
bottom but it's not actually Center is
both<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:33.380> so<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:34.980> bit<00:00:35.070> lower

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
both here so it's a little bit lower

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.049 
both here so it's a little bit lower
gives<00:00:35.820> more<00:00:36.059> emphasis<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.320> sky<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
gives more emphasis to the sky and a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.380 
gives more emphasis to the sky and a
little<00:00:39.300> bit<00:00:39.420> less<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> road<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
little bit less to the to the road to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.610 
little bit less to the to the road to
the<00:00:42.510> street<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.129> about<00:00:44.550> say<00:00:45.559> now<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the street but it's about say now you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.970 
the street but it's about say now you
can<00:00:47.329> choose<00:00:48.329> where<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.020> vanishing<00:00:49.590> point<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
can choose where this vanishing point is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.500 
can choose where this vanishing point is
going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:51.289> up<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
going to be up here down here to the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.529 
going to be up here down here to the
right<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> left<00:00:55.670> now<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.969> choose<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
right to the left now if you choose the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.680 
right to the left now if you choose the
vanishing<00:00:57.989> point<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> gotta

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
vanishing point to be up here you gotta

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
vanishing point to be up here you gotta
be<00:01:00.870> emphasizing<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.399> road<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.090> less<00:01:03.420> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
be emphasizing the the road and less of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.250 
be emphasizing the the road and less of
the<00:01:03.780> sky<00:01:04.880> like<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:08.150> now<00:01:09.150> he<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:09.750> show<00:01:09.990> more

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the sky like this now he will show more

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.490 
the sky like this now he will show more
of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> road<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.460> less<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> sky<00:01:12.500> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
of the road and less of the sky this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.670 
of the road and less of the sky this
means<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.760> viewer<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:16.380> higher

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
means that the viewer is actually higher

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.020 
means that the viewer is actually higher
up<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.520> looking<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.140> road<00:01:19.860> less<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
up and looking at all this road less of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.100 
up and looking at all this road less of
the<00:01:21.180> sky<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.640> choose<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the sky you can choose have to have this

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.510 
the sky you can choose have to have this
vanishing<00:01:25.650> point<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.340> hand<00:01:26.640> side

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
vanishing point on the right hand side

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.460 
vanishing point on the right hand side
and<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.790> will<00:01:30.180> give<00:01:31.400> different<00:01:32.400> emphases<00:01:33.470> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and that will give different emphases to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
and that will give different emphases to
both<00:01:34.740> sides<00:01:36.530> like<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
both sides like this if we have the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.960 
both sides like this if we have the
vanishing<00:01:39.540> point<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.490> where<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.759> keep

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
vanishing point over here where we keep

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.950 
vanishing point over here where we keep
the<00:01:42.329> rest<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.590> same<00:01:44.119> dimensions<00:01:45.119> for

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the rest are all the same dimensions for

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.520 
the rest are all the same dimensions for
the<00:01:46.110> buildings<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.180> viewer<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.990> over

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the buildings the viewer will be over

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.359 
the buildings the viewer will be over
here<00:01:49.950> looking<00:01:50.579> at<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.479> side<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
here looking at this side here so this

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
here looking at this side here so this
side<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:54.060> stretched<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.840> we'll<00:01:55.020> have

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
side will be stretched and we'll have

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
side will be stretched and we'll have
more<00:01:56.070> detail<00:01:56.810> but<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> side<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:59.119> will<00:02:00.119> be

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
more detail but this side here will be

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.480 
more detail but this side here will be
will<00:02:00.869> shrink<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.549> show<00:02:02.729> less<00:02:03.000> detail

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
will shrink and it will show less detail

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.320 
will shrink and it will show less detail
so<00:02:05.840> deciding<00:02:06.840> where<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.229> vanishing<00:02:07.740> point

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
so deciding where the vanishing point

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.999 
so deciding where the vanishing point
will<00:02:09.330> actually

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
will actually

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.290 
will actually
you're<00:02:11.930> drawing<00:02:13.550> emphasize<00:02:15.290> something
