00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 I 'm not above all a hdblog voter 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 we are still almost endless 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.380
 also but I talk to you to see a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 moment the benchmarks we were seen on 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
 others it seems with 600 so it's right 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.160
 show them on this device too 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.350
 obviously we are talking about quadrant 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.410
 in the first analysis we wait maybe for that 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.230
 finish and download all benchmark that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.470
 it doesn't seem to go on anyway 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.700
 let's make the quadrant benchmark 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.700
 let us remember that the optimum was 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 stopped at around 11 thousand and 900 points 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.750
 only by reporting the test would we be 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.300
 arrived at 12.200 generally doing the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.600
 second third attempt is 400 gain 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.360
 500 points on ht 5 juan we had more or 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.370
 less 12,312 1500 points 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.890
 here we expect the same result 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.260
 let's see if we're lucky 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.420
 anyway if we will be 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.039
 if we know right in this ours 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.449
 forecast mass lines one 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.850
 rdo platform of the same and is 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.530
 interesting to note that maybe you 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.909
 we recommend watching the video on 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.600
 filmed on the interview with qualcomm how 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.789
 qualcomm is the platform now more 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.960
 used in the panorama on the mobile and in 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.420
 particular on android is becoming 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.720
 almost a standard especially because 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.670
 between them four trials 600 the process 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.830
 of chips share the same gpu 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.409
 therefore 12.110 did not deny us the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.030
 result repeating something you earn 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.970
 therefore absolutely performance 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.679
 aligned with other devices 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.319
 another thing we want to show is 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.909
 we have forgotten so much 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.759
 in the previous focus a very function 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.509
 nice that honors me and will vote shortly 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.600
 of the pad shortcuts with 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.330
 let's start the test excuse one 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
 detail of the stage or the splendor 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.190
 inferior although they are not integrated 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.330
 in the displays they allow us to have one 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.170
 sort of 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.140
 google style link now like i 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.050
 nexus is paid with a wipe or better with 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.130
 a long press on the home button 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.860
 a menu will appear that we will show you 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.610
 as soon as it ends up in your head you are 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.500
 it was you in version 3.1.2 that you do not 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.850
 we did on the other devices in 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.070
 how much connection is really here 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.100
 difficult and above all to have time 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.890
 to log in and download the application 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.040
 however so much of him that we see how 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.040
 behaves 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.380
 in while we wait we do not even 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.990
 the station that offers meals and volume 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.840
 button on and off and this 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.030
 mechanism that allows you to peek at the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.770
 compatible apps from smartphones e 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.770
 tablet without interruption whatsoever 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.040
 unfortunately the pato consesso has no casse 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.540
 stereo but only a side case 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.629
 here we continue with the 3 so much you 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.970
 obviously usb connection to be able to 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.540
 recharge the phone but also the spa 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.530
 dwall station 5,000 milian for that the 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.489
 text that continues in its management 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.269
 of the cpc we remember more adreno 320 la 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:30.409
 same as the s4 pro processor from 1.7 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:33.989
 ghz and hopefully in all this 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.900
 there is an increase in snapdragon chips 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.620
 also a major improvement 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.170
 of application optimization 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.310
 above all being able to fully exploit 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.810
 the graphics features sailing cg more from 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.810
 part of the developers in the games 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.510
 we should be at an end by now 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.510
 unfortunately much on long enough 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.620
 ok not to do the last tests and have 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.620
 finished 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.949
 the entrance is yes but unfortunately similar to 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.630
 that of the iphone so need one 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.300
 brooch for opening sim 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.190
 this is a nuisance especially for 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.610
 who like us must necessarily 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.169
 change sims on phones often therefore 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.150
 always remember to have in 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.740
 wallet a safety pin 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.740
 a percent mother 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:59.050
 and the score after reading the sd 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.000
 of 22,700 25 points which is a score but 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.730
 we are obviously not very tall 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.690
 therefore excellent performance and what 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.320
 we said at the beginning 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.180
 keeping this particular menu pressed 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.370
 in google plus style where we will have the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.290
 possibility to set a series of 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.100
 quick applications to be launched in a 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.670
 tac moment 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.530
 the browser camera we have 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.270
 left try again browser 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.340
 we will have to stay a moment on 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:31.030
 connection we have the gallery and the 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:34.390
 calendar or settings such as 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:38.140
 management of care but still management 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:41.620
 of asus eco to use as is 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.180
 practically an asus voice manager 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.680
 unfortunately the language is not present 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.100
 Italian at a time 70 English and 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.990
 Chinese 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.750
 we'll see if it arrives in Italian is 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.000
 however, a kind of Syrian best voice 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.900
 like you want him to call 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.980
 made in asus 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.210
 we also have the possibility to enter 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.190
 directly into the dragon and gods 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.160
 applications from any screen or 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.560
 still set up applications 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.669
 prefer for example if we don't want 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.860
 this application we can here 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.130
 delete we can leave 4 o 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.390
 maybe insert hdblog l prefer that 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:15.870
 could be a wiser choice 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:19.070
 they are infinite and everything at this point does not 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.000
 we just have to try it on the road to 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.880
 complete tests 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.200
 the sensations are excellent we will see how 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.060
 the public will react to the price 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.060
 there are many of your nicol√≤ hdblog
