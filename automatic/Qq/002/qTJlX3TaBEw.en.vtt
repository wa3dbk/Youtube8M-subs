Atmospheric agency in the United States
is<00:00:26.240> now<00:00:26.750> saying<00:00:27.140> that<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:27.529> whole<00:00:27.830> of<00:00:27.859> the

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
is now saying that the whole of the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.550 
is now saying that the whole of the
Pacific<00:00:28.550> Basin<00:00:28.759> is<00:00:29.089> now<00:00:29.300> a<00:00:29.539> tsunami<00:00:30.289> warning

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
Pacific Basin is now a tsunami warning

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.650 
Pacific Basin is now a tsunami warning
area<00:00:30.890> I<00:00:31.189> wouldn't<00:00:31.849> be<00:00:31.910> surprised<00:00:32.300> at<00:00:32.419> that<00:00:32.450> at

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
area I wouldn't be surprised at that at

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.180 
area I wouldn't be surprised at that at
all<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.020> problem<00:00:33.320> with<00:00:33.440> tsunamis<00:00:33.980> is

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
all and the problem with tsunamis is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.370 
all and the problem with tsunamis is
they<00:00:34.700> actually<00:00:34.790> move<00:00:35.120> quite<00:00:35.420> fast<00:00:35.780> they<00:00:36.320> can

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
they actually move quite fast they can

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.980 
they actually move quite fast they can
move<00:00:36.500> around<00:00:36.920> 700<00:00:37.820> kilometers<00:00:38.270> per<00:00:38.300> hour<00:00:38.630> and

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
move around 700 kilometers per hour and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.630 
move around 700 kilometers per hour and
that's<00:00:39.320> because<00:00:39.560> they<00:00:39.830> effectively<00:00:40.340> move

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
that's because they effectively move

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.950 
that's because they effectively move
like<00:00:40.940> shallow<00:00:41.240> waves<00:00:41.510> because<00:00:41.750> they<00:00:41.840> have

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
like shallow waves because they have

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.690 
like shallow waves because they have
such<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.140> long<00:00:42.440> wavelength<00:00:43.010> they<00:00:43.190> just<00:00:43.370> ripple

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
such a long wavelength they just ripple

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.310 
such a long wavelength they just ripple
along<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.060> surface<00:00:44.240> so<00:00:44.930> they<00:00:45.050> can<00:00:45.200> move

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
along the surface so they can move

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.550 
along the surface so they can move
incredibly<00:00:45.830> fast<00:00:46.100> having<00:00:46.820> said<00:00:47.060> that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
incredibly fast having said that

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.660 
incredibly fast having said that
fortunately<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:48.590> Pacific's<00:00:49.070> absolutely

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
fortunately the Pacific's absolutely

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.520 
fortunately the Pacific's absolutely
massive<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.270> although<00:00:50.480> they<00:00:50.720> move<00:00:50.960> relatively

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
massive so although they move relatively

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.850 
massive so although they move relatively
fast<00:00:51.860> we<00:00:52.310> still<00:00:52.640> have<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.940> while<00:00:53.360> before<00:00:53.860> it

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
fast we still have a while before it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.380 
fast we still have a while before it
will<00:00:55.040> actually<00:00:55.190> hit<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.820> we've<00:00:55.910> got<00:00:56.090> time<00:00:56.360> to

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
will actually hit and we've got time to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.330 
will actually hit and we've got time to
evacuate<00:00:56.870> people<00:00:57.290> like<00:00:57.620> we<00:00:57.770> see<00:00:57.890> in<00:00:57.920> Hawaii

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
evacuate people like we see in Hawaii

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.640 
evacuate people like we see in Hawaii
and<00:00:58.520> elsewhere<00:00:59.360> where<00:00:59.660> we're<00:01:00.020> likely<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.410> be

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
and elsewhere where we're likely to be

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.860 
and elsewhere where we're likely to be
here<00:01:00.860> now<00:01:01.760> another<00:01:02.000> alarming<00:01:02.480> thing<00:01:02.540> that

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
here now another alarming thing that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.420 
here now another alarming thing that
which<00:01:03.290> also<00:01:03.530> just<00:01:03.830> heard<00:01:03.950> in<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.129> past<00:01:04.250> few

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
which also just heard in the past few

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.490 
which also just heard in the past few
minutes<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.970> Japanese<00:01:05.509> authorities<00:01:05.990> now

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
minutes the Japanese authorities now

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.470 
minutes the Japanese authorities now
saying<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:06.860> they<00:01:07.340> expect<00:01:07.790> another<00:01:07.970> strong

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
saying that they expect another strong

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.040 
saying that they expect another strong
earthquake<00:01:09.220> yes<00:01:10.450> statistically<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:11.750> very

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
earthquake yes statistically it is very

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.750 
earthquake yes statistically it is very
likely<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:12.590> we<00:01:12.830> are<00:01:12.980> going<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.340> get<00:01:13.520> some

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
likely that we are going to get some

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.460 
likely that we are going to get some
more<00:01:13.970> earthquakes<00:01:14.270> that<00:01:14.780> are<00:01:15.020> going<00:01:15.230> to<00:01:15.320> be

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
more earthquakes that are going to be

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.140 
more earthquakes that are going to be
strong<00:01:15.710> we've<00:01:15.950> already<00:01:16.130> seen<00:01:16.550> aftershocks

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
strong we've already seen aftershocks

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.240 
strong we've already seen aftershocks
that<00:01:17.300> have<00:01:17.480> been<00:01:17.630> over<00:01:18.080> seven<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.770> magnitude

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
that have been over seven in magnitude

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.670 
that have been over seven in magnitude
and<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.700> would<00:01:19.909> be<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.300> very<00:01:20.900> large<00:01:21.350> and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
and that would be a very large and

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.560 
and that would be a very large and
potentially<00:01:22.159> devastating<00:01:22.310> earthquake<00:01:23.150> if<00:01:23.330> it

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
potentially devastating earthquake if it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.649 
potentially devastating earthquake if it
happened<00:01:23.870> on<00:01:23.960> its<00:01:24.110> own<00:01:24.290> but<00:01:24.860> after<00:01:25.370> this<00:01:25.659> 8.9

happened on its own but after this 8.9

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.470 
happened on its own but after this 8.9
earthquake<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.500> lot<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.190> buildings<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.330> lot

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
earthquake a lot of the buildings a lot

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.550 
earthquake a lot of the buildings a lot
of<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.630> structures<00:01:30.050> are<00:01:30.170> likely<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.440> be

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
of the structures are likely to be

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.590 
of the structures are likely to be
damaged<00:01:30.950> anyway<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:31.760> another<00:01:32.060> big<00:01:32.330> hit<00:01:32.540> on

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.140 
damaged anyway so another big hit on
that<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:33.170> could<00:01:33.740> well<00:01:33.890> bring<00:01:34.130> more<00:01:34.340> down<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.970> is

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
that it could well bring more down it is

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.240 
that it could well bring more down it is
likely<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.600> be<00:01:35.720> worse<00:01:36.050> than<00:01:36.080> just<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:36.920> seven

magnitude earthquake on its own after
this<00:01:39.650> one<00:01:39.830> now<00:01:40.340> what<00:01:40.490> we<00:01:40.610> talk<00:01:40.820> about<00:01:40.850> seismic

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
this one now what we talk about seismic

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.330 
this one now what we talk about seismic
activity<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.140> course<00:01:42.320> Japan<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:42.920> prone<00:01:43.310> to

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
activity of course Japan is prone to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.920 
activity of course Japan is prone to
earthquakes<00:01:43.760> so<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.420> first<00:01:44.659> time<00:01:44.780> it's

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
earthquakes so the first time it's

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.700 
earthquakes so the first time it's
happened<00:01:44.960> there<00:01:45.260> it's<00:01:45.350> not<00:01:45.409> gonna<00:01:45.530> be<00:01:45.620> the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
happened there it's not gonna be the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.320 
happened there it's not gonna be the
last<00:01:45.800> time<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.159> will<00:01:46.280> happen<00:01:46.370> there<00:01:46.640> what

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
last time it will happen there what

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.920 
last time it will happen there what
exactly<00:01:47.510> is<00:01:48.020> taking<00:01:48.409> place<00:01:48.610> was<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.720> picture<00:01:50.720> or

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
exactly is taking place was a picture or

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.440 
exactly is taking place was a picture or
showing<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.790> different<00:01:52.790> plates<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.270> we've

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
showing the different plates that we've

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.050 
showing the different plates that we've
got<00:01:53.720> around<00:01:54.140> Japan<00:01:54.770> we've<00:01:55.280> got<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.549> Pacific

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
got around Japan we've got the Pacific

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.210 
got around Japan we've got the Pacific
plate<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:57.020> Philippine<00:01:57.470> plate<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:58.190> the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
plate and the Philippine plate to the

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.190 
plate and the Philippine plate to the
east<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.729> Japan<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.330> then<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.720> west<00:01:59.960> we've

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
east of Japan and then to the west we've

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.930 
east of Japan and then to the west we've
got<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.470> Eurasia<00:02:00.830> plate<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.729> North

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
got the Eurasia plate and the North

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.820 
got the Eurasia plate and the North
American<00:02:02.360> plate<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:02.990> what's<00:02:03.170> happening<00:02:03.619> is

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
American plate and what's happening is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.190 
American plate and what's happening is
the<00:02:03.979> two<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.640> east<00:02:05.030> are<00:02:05.390> going<00:02:06.020> towards

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
the two on the east are going towards

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.960 
the two on the east are going towards
the<00:02:06.560> west<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.159> they're<00:02:07.310> hitting<00:02:07.460> each<00:02:07.760> other

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
the west so they're hitting each other

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.759 
the west so they're hitting each other
and<00:02:08.239> then<00:02:08.659> eventually<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.289> two<00:02:09.409> on<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.590> east

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
and then eventually the two on the east

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.530 
and then eventually the two on the east
are<00:02:09.890> actually<00:02:10.159> being<00:02:10.340> subducted<00:02:10.700> underneath

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
are actually being subducted underneath

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.269 
are actually being subducted underneath
that<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.989> other<00:02:12.170> plate<00:02:12.439> it's<00:02:12.680> happening

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:13.279 
that that other plate it's happening

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.830 
that that other plate it's happening
around<00:02:13.370> eight<00:02:13.700> centimeters<00:02:14.329> a<00:02:14.420> year<00:02:14.450> which

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
around eight centimeters a year which

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.670 
around eight centimeters a year which
might<00:02:15.170> not<00:02:15.349> sound

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
might not sound

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.250 
might not sound
much<00:02:15.799> but<00:02:16.129> is<00:02:16.219> actually<00:02:16.340> quite<00:02:16.730> fast<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.750> so

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
much but is actually quite fast and so

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.500 
much but is actually quite fast and so
as<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.650> goes<00:02:18.829> under<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.549> pressure<00:02:19.849> all<00:02:20.150> builds

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
as it goes under the pressure all builds

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.149 
as it goes under the pressure all builds
up<00:02:20.659> until<00:02:21.109> eventually<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.590> pressure<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:21.980> too

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
up until eventually the pressure is too

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.429 
up until eventually the pressure is too
much<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.609> then<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.329> will<00:02:23.480> let<00:02:23.659> go<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.230> that

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
much and then it will let go and it that

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.250 
much and then it will let go and it that
letting<00:02:24.950> go<00:02:25.189> that<00:02:25.700> causes<00:02:26.269> an<00:02:26.540> earthquake<00:02:27.049> and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
letting go that causes an earthquake and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.289 
letting go that causes an earthquake and
subduction<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.579> worst<00:02:28.879> type<00:02:29.269> of

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
subduction is the worst type of

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.970 
subduction is the worst type of
earthquake<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:30.049> you're<00:02:30.349> looking<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.709> avoid<00:02:30.920> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
earthquake if you're looking to avoid a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.490 
earthquake if you're looking to avoid a
tsunami<00:02:31.579> because<00:02:31.849> as<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.510> earth<00:02:33.109> gets

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
tsunami because as the earth gets

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.349 
tsunami because as the earth gets
dragged<00:02:33.920> underneath<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.700> will<00:02:34.939> get<00:02:35.060> pulled

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
dragged underneath it will get pulled

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.420 
dragged underneath it will get pulled
and<00:02:35.569> pulled<00:02:35.780> until<00:02:36.560> suddenly<00:02:36.829> it'll<00:02:37.159> flick

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
and pulled until suddenly it'll flick

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.879 
and pulled until suddenly it'll flick
back<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.269> that<00:02:38.450> flicking<00:02:39.049> motion<00:02:39.530> that

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
back and it's that flicking motion that

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.069 
back and it's that flicking motion that
will<00:02:40.069> cause<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.579> tidal<00:02:40.909> wave<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.599> that's

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
will cause this tidal wave and that's

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.629 
will cause this tidal wave and that's
what<00:02:42.260> we're<00:02:42.469> seeing<00:02:42.680> now<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.159> it's<00:02:43.489> no

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
what we're seeing now and it's no

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.699 
what we're seeing now and it's no
surprise<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.540> word<00:02:44.750> tsunami<00:02:45.379> is<00:02:45.680> a

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
surprise that the word tsunami is a

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.220 
surprise that the word tsunami is a
Japanese<00:02:46.400> word<00:02:46.730> that's<00:02:47.420> where<00:02:47.720> we<00:02:47.870> saw<00:02:48.019> them

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
Japanese word that's where we saw them

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.599 
Japanese word that's where we saw them
foot<00:02:48.409> that's<00:02:48.650> where<00:02:48.919> they<00:02:49.129> were<00:02:49.189> noticed

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
foot that's where they were noticed

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.309 
foot that's where they were noticed
first<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.269> actually<00:02:50.389> means<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.930> harbor

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
first and it actually means a harbor

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.110 
first and it actually means a harbor
wave<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.799> Japanese<00:02:52.310> right<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:52.970> we're<00:02:53.060> looking

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
wave in Japanese right and we're looking

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.490 
wave in Japanese right and we're looking
at<00:02:53.359> a<00:02:53.389> picture<00:02:53.599> of<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.870> wave<00:02:54.019> right<00:02:54.290> now

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
at a picture of the wave right now

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.080 
at a picture of the wave right now
getting<00:02:54.769> back<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.919> the<00:02:55.220> surface<00:02:55.519> as<00:02:55.819> we<00:02:55.970> can

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
the friction will slow it down somewhat

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.500 
the friction will slow it down somewhat
but<00:03:21.979> because<00:03:22.310> with<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.699> notion<00:03:22.879> there's<00:03:23.359> not

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
but because with the notion there's not

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.330 
but because with the notion there's not
a<00:03:23.569> great<00:03:23.780> deal<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:24.109> friction<00:03:24.620> there<00:03:24.859> so

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
a great deal of friction there so

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.399 
a great deal of friction there so
although<00:03:25.519> yes<00:03:26.150> if<00:03:26.329> you're<00:03:26.569> very<00:03:26.930> close<00:03:27.229> to<00:03:27.379> it

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
although yes if you're very close to it

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.619 
although yes if you're very close to it
you<00:03:27.650> will<00:03:27.859> have<00:03:28.099> a<00:03:28.129> bigger<00:03:28.400> wave<00:03:28.639> even<00:03:29.510> if

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
you will have a bigger wave even if

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.059 
you will have a bigger wave even if
you're<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> very<00:03:30.109> long<00:03:30.379> way<00:03:30.530> away<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.799> can

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
you're a very long way away you can

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.280 
you're a very long way away you can
still<00:03:31.489> have<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.819> very<00:03:32.090> significant<00:03:32.689> wave<00:03:32.840> when

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
still have a very significant wave when

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.069 
still have a very significant wave when
we<00:03:33.409> have<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> tsunami<00:03:34.069> of<00:03:34.280> 2007<00:03:35.239> in<00:03:35.510> indonesia

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
we have the tsunami of 2007 in indonesia

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.050 
we have the tsunami of 2007 in indonesia
that<00:03:36.709> created<00:03:37.129> a<00:03:37.310> wave<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.519> went<00:03:37.790> all<00:03:37.939> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
that created a wave that went all the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.800 
that created a wave that went all the
way<00:03:38.090> across<00:03:39.040> towards<00:03:40.040> sri<00:03:40.459> lanka<00:03:40.879> then<00:03:41.479> it

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
way across towards sri lanka then it

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.300 
way across towards sri lanka then it
hits<00:03:42.109> sri<00:03:42.349> lanka<00:03:42.620> then<00:03:42.799> it<00:03:42.919> went<00:03:43.040> across

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
hits sri lanka then it went across

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.819 
hits sri lanka then it went across
towards<00:03:43.790> kenya<00:03:44.209> even<00:03:44.629> kenya<00:03:44.959> solar<00:03:45.199> so<00:03:45.650> yeah

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
towards kenya even kenya solar so yeah

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.899 
towards kenya even kenya solar so yeah
they<00:03:46.040> can<00:03:46.220> travel<00:03:46.459> vast<00:03:46.790> distances<00:03:47.379> and<00:03:48.909> how

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
they can travel vast distances and how

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.219 
they can travel vast distances and how
good<00:03:50.090> is<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.359> science<00:03:50.689> got<00:03:50.870> right<00:03:51.079> now

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
good is the science got right now

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.050 
good is the science got right now
because<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.530> mean<00:03:51.709> we<00:03:52.189> have<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.430> earthquake<00:03:52.609> I

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
because I mean we have this earthquake I

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.580 
because I mean we have this earthquake I
mean<00:03:53.209> this<00:03:53.329> is<00:03:53.389> very<00:03:53.780> large<00:03:53.930> moving<00:03:54.319> towards

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
mean this is very large moving towards

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.039 
mean this is very large moving towards
the<00:03:54.680> seventh<00:03:55.009> most<00:03:55.250> powerful<00:03:55.729> one<00:03:55.879> in<00:03:56.569> history

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
the seventh most powerful one in history

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.289 
the seventh most powerful one in history
and<00:03:57.709> we're<00:03:57.949> expecting<00:03:58.459> another<00:03:58.699> powerful

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
and we're expecting another powerful

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.300 
and we're expecting another powerful
earthquake<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.019> in<00:04:00.439> terms<00:04:00.889> of<00:04:01.009> predicting

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
earthquake so in terms of predicting

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.649 
earthquake so in terms of predicting
what's<00:04:01.609> going<00:04:01.759> to<00:04:01.819> happen<00:04:02.060> how<00:04:02.209> good<00:04:02.389> is<00:04:02.509> it

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
what's going to happen how good is it

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.339 
what's going to happen how good is it
not<00:04:03.280> so<00:04:04.280> good<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.609> be<00:04:04.699> honest<00:04:05.079> there<00:04:06.079> that

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
not so good to be honest there that

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.409 
not so good to be honest there that
we're<00:04:06.620> very<00:04:06.829> good<00:04:07.040> at<00:04:07.099> predicting<00:04:07.819> that<00:04:08.180> there

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
we're very good at predicting that there

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.300 
we're very good at predicting that there
will<00:04:08.720> be<00:04:08.750> statistically<00:04:09.650> speaking<00:04:09.739> there

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
will be statistically speaking there

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.920 
will be statistically speaking there
will<00:04:10.489> be<00:04:10.639> aftershocks<00:04:10.939> there<00:04:11.389> will<00:04:11.509> be<00:04:11.629> strong

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
will be aftershocks there will be strong

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.289 
will be aftershocks there will be strong
then<00:04:12.349> they'll<00:04:12.530> gradually<00:04:12.889> decrease<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:13.879> then

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
then they'll gradually decrease and then

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.740 
then they'll gradually decrease and then
things<00:04:14.689> will<00:04:14.870> return<00:04:15.019> to<00:04:15.199> normal<00:04:15.519> but<00:04:16.750> we

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
things will return to normal but we

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.759 
things will return to normal but we
still<00:04:17.959> didn't<00:04:18.229> know<00:04:18.289> that<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:18.590> earthquake

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
still didn't know that this earthquake

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.469 
still didn't know that this earthquake
was<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.400> be<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.609> strong<00:04:19.880> we<00:04:20.239> didn't

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
was going to be the strong we didn't

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.460 
was going to be the strong we didn't
know<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.750> was<00:04:20.870> having<00:04:21.109> even<00:04:21.380> on

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
know that it was having even on

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.709 
know that it was having even on
Wednesday<00:04:21.919> when<00:04:22.130> we<00:04:22.250> saw<00:04:22.430> quite<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.330> lot<00:04:23.690> of

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:23.719 
Wednesday when we saw quite a lot of

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.320 
Wednesday when we saw quite a lot of
seismic<00:04:24.260> activity<00:04:24.349> in<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.070> area<00:04:25.130> we<00:04:26.000> didn't

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
seismic activity in this area we didn't

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.190 
seismic activity in this area we didn't
know<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.719> those<00:04:26.870> were<00:04:27.050> pre<00:04:27.320> shocks<00:04:27.650> and

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
know that those were pre shocks and

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.110 
know that those were pre shocks and
till<00:04:28.350> now<00:04:28.530> we've<00:04:28.770> got<00:04:28.920> this<00:04:29.070> massive<00:04:29.370> 8.9

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
till now we've got this massive 8.9

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.970 
till now we've got this massive 8.9
earthquake<00:04:30.750> we<00:04:30.900> can<00:04:31.020> look<00:04:31.170> back<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.440> say<00:04:31.740> our

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
earthquake we can look back and say our

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.560 
earthquake we can look back and say our
that's<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.640> those<00:04:32.820> were<00:04:33.060> they<00:04:33.270> were<00:04:33.300> just

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
that's what those were they were just

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.150 
that's what those were they were just
pre<00:04:33.870> shocked<00:04:34.140> we<00:04:34.560> have<00:04:34.680> no<00:04:34.830> way<00:04:34.980> of<00:04:35.130> knowing

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
pre shocked we have no way of knowing

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.790 
pre shocked we have no way of knowing
that<00:04:35.490> until<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.150> one<00:04:36.390> here<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.620> best

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
that until this one here and the best

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.410 
that until this one here and the best
defense<00:04:38.100> that<00:04:38.400> all<00:04:38.610> these<00:04:38.730> countries<00:04:39.090> have<00:04:39.240> is

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
defense that all these countries have is

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.150 
defense that all these countries have is
just<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.720> tell<00:04:39.930> their<00:04:40.110> people<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.530> move<00:04:40.980> away

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
just to tell their people to move away

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.770 
just to tell their people to move away
that's<00:04:41.610> right<00:04:41.790> there's<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.060> series<00:04:42.390> of<00:04:42.420> boys

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
that's right there's a series of boys

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.260 
that's right there's a series of boys
around<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.590> Pacific<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.250> those<00:04:44.820> can<00:04:45.060> tell

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
around the Pacific and those can tell

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.420 
around the Pacific and those can tell
you<00:04:45.420> how<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.930> wave<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.470> traveling<00:04:46.950> how<00:04:47.100> fast

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
you how the wave is traveling how fast

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.340 
you how the wave is traveling how fast
it's<00:04:47.670> traveling<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.210> how<00:04:48.600> bad<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.930> is<00:04:49.020> because

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
it's traveling and how bad it is because

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.590 
it's traveling and how bad it is because
remember<00:04:49.590> over<00:04:49.980> deep<00:04:50.250> water<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.970> waves<00:04:51.390> are

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
remember over deep water the waves are

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.840 
remember over deep water the waves are
actually<00:04:51.960> really<00:04:52.170> but<00:04:52.620> very<00:04:52.920> negligible<00:04:53.550> you

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
actually really but very negligible you

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.120 
actually really but very negligible you
often<00:04:54.360> can't<00:04:54.540> see<00:04:54.930> them<00:04:55.170> it's<00:04:55.590> only<00:04:55.950> as<00:04:56.040> they

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
often can't see them it's only as they

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.890 
often can't see them it's only as they
go<00:04:56.250> into<00:04:56.400> shallow<00:04:56.730> water<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.300> waves<00:04:57.450> actually

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
go into shallow water the waves actually

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.290 
go into shallow water the waves actually
amplify<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.740> then<00:04:58.980> they<00:04:59.160> become<00:04:59.460> big<00:04:59.730> so<00:05:00.150> when

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
amplify and then they become big so when

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.580 
amplify and then they become big so when
they're<00:05:00.420> traveling<00:05:00.660> over<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.110> very<00:05:01.350> deep

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
they're traveling over the very deep

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.140 
they're traveling over the very deep
