hi it's Kyle Leon here I want to make a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.890 
hi it's Kyle Leon here I want to make a
short<00:00:11.700> video<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.330> today<00:00:12.450> about<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
short video for you today about the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.930 
short video for you today about the
muscle<00:00:13.320> building<00:00:13.559> strategy<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.190> bulking<00:00:14.670> then

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
muscle building strategy of bulking then

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.760 
muscle building strategy of bulking then
cutting<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.570> also<00:00:16.199> offer<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.560> some

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
cutting and also offer you some

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
cutting and also offer you some
information<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.279> will<00:00:17.550> help<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:18.150> if

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
information that will help you if

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.480 
information that will help you if
bulking<00:00:19.140> then<00:00:19.289> cutting<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.770> not<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> right

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
bulking then cutting is not the right

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.189 
bulking then cutting is not the right
strategy<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:21.840> you're<00:00:21.960> still

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
strategy for you but you're still

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.529 
strategy for you but you're still
looking<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.560> put<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.920> some<00:00:23.130> muscle<00:00:23.420> bulking<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
looking to put on some muscle bulking is

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.150 
looking to put on some muscle bulking is
a<00:00:24.570> strategy<00:00:24.869> used<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.500> build<00:00:25.710> muscle<00:00:25.920> by

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
a strategy used to build muscle by

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.490 
a strategy used to build muscle by
putting<00:00:26.609> our<00:00:26.760> bodies<00:00:27.210> into<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> large<00:00:27.900> caloric

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
putting our bodies into a large caloric

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.620 
putting our bodies into a large caloric
surplus<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.550> predetermined<00:00:29.939> amount<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
surplus for a predetermined amount of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.479 
surplus for a predetermined amount of
time<00:00:30.840> basically<00:00:31.500> bringing<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.040> more<00:00:32.189> calories

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
time basically bringing in more calories

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
time basically bringing in more calories
than<00:00:32.790> our<00:00:33.059> body<00:00:33.270> burns<00:00:33.570> off<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.110> cutting

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
than our body burns off and cutting

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.889 
than our body burns off and cutting
refers<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> time<00:00:35.370> needed<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.120> lose<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
refers to the time needed to lose the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.770 
refers to the time needed to lose the
excess<00:00:37.230> body<00:00:37.469> fat<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.430> strategy<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.090> based

excess body fat this strategy is based

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
excess body fat this strategy is based
on<00:00:39.960> sound<00:00:40.230> logic<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.370> common

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
on sound logic because it is common

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.610 
on sound logic because it is common
knowledge<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.420> our<00:00:42.690> bodies<00:00:43.079> need<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.500> in

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
knowledge that our bodies need to be in

a caloric surplus to be able to build

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.540 
a caloric surplus to be able to build
muscle<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.899> many<00:00:46.379> bodybuilders<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:47.219> used<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
muscle and many bodybuilders have used a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
muscle and many bodybuilders have used a
strategy<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> lot<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> success<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
strategy with a lot of success the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.740 
strategy with a lot of success the
obvious<00:00:50.280> problem<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.850> course<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.390> when

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
obvious problem of course is that when

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
obvious problem of course is that when
our<00:00:51.780> bodies<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> large<00:00:52.739> caloric

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
our bodies are in a large caloric

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
our bodies are in a large caloric
surplus<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.210> experience<00:00:54.600> fat<00:00:54.960> gain<00:00:55.199> as

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
surplus we will experience fat gain as

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.010 
surplus we will experience fat gain as
well<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.640> accepted<00:00:57.270> fact<00:00:57.570> with

are<00:01:04.920> associated<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.119> old-school

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
are associated with this old-school

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320 
are associated with this old-school
strategy<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.860> big<00:01:08.280> less<00:01:08.820> known<00:01:09.090> about

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
strategy one big less known about

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.469 
strategy one big less known about
problem<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.049> fat<00:01:10.619> cell<00:01:10.950> hyperplasia<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:12.299> is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
problem is fat cell hyperplasia this is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
problem is fat cell hyperplasia this is
when<00:01:12.659> our<00:01:12.689> bodies<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.350> forced<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> create

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
when our bodies are forced to create

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.010 
when our bodies are forced to create
more<00:01:14.580> fat<00:01:14.880> cells<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
more fat cells because of all of the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
more fat cells because of all of the
excess<00:01:16.500> calories<00:01:16.799> coming<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.909> our

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
excess calories coming in that our

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
excess calories coming in that our
bodies<00:01:18.270> can't<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:18.960> towards<00:01:19.500> muscle<00:01:19.890> growth

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
bodies can't use towards muscle growth

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
bodies can't use towards muscle growth
and<00:01:20.310> here's<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.090> these<00:01:21.840> fat<00:01:22.170> cells

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and here's the thing these fat cells

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.149 
and here's the thing these fat cells
never<00:01:23.040> ever<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:24.060> away<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.049> even<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.860> do

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
never ever go away so even when you do

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
never ever go away so even when you do
go<00:01:26.400> through<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.729> cutting<00:01:27.060> phase<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.479> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
go through the cutting phase of this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
go through the cutting phase of this
strategy<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.400> really

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
strategy and get down to a really really

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880 
strategy and get down to a really really
low<00:01:29.790> body<00:01:30.000> fat<00:01:30.150> percentage<00:01:30.780> these<00:01:31.350> new<00:01:31.590> fat

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
low body fat percentage these new fat

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.850 
low body fat percentage these new fat
cells<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.759> still<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.619> having<00:01:34.619> more

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
cells will still be there having more

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
cells will still be there having more
fat<00:01:35.189> cells<00:01:35.549> makes<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.000> easier<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:36.869> us<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
fat cells makes it easier for us to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.499 
fat cells makes it easier for us to
store<00:01:37.380> fat<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> rest<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.549> our<00:01:38.700> lives<00:01:39.060> when

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
store fat for the rest of our lives when

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
store fat for the rest of our lives when
we<00:01:39.630> mess<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.200> our<00:01:40.350> diet<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.610> don't

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we mess up on our diet we really don't

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.490 
we mess up on our diet we really don't
need<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> feel<00:01:42.450> any<00:01:42.630> more<00:01:42.840> guilty<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.350> our

need to feel any more guilty on our
cheat<00:01:43.770> days<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.600> take-home

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
cheat days now do we the take-home

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.889 
cheat days now do we the take-home
message<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:47.189> can't<00:01:47.610> force<00:01:48.270> our<00:01:48.479> bodies
