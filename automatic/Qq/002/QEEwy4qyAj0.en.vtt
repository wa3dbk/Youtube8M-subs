 currently searching 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:13.329
 Penske large hall, the treasure hunters sat decidedly fun 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.599
 There is always somewhere out there 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.380
 without having bent a number of estimates 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.569
 first looking 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.060
 or is insane 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.160
 on our expedition to the treasure hiding around the globe we have 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.010
 discover many secrets 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 into the city so without a trace past us 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 Boost needed reputation of gold by rock and Roche 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.210
 School and desert 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.210
 or on a lonely treasure island 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.290
 Take part in one of our expeditions into the realm of the treasure hunters 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 and archaeologists 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 What are they actually holding 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 that the user the treasure hunter 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.740
 we are now at the place 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.540
 it is claimed that the treasure is here 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.810
 I'll explain myself briefly again 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630
 what you hope to find here 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.410
 then we unpack the equipment and who the place here once thoroughly 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.980
 investigate 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.270
 Percent estimated will follow 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.270
 it was here in 1905 a way way 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.660
 Wiegand opposed 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.990
 Tina for practical fighting here during the war in albums to Verdis 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.350
 teething 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.950
 gold coins 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.640
 thrown off England by aircraft were funded to fight against 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.740
 Thieves lead owner Barmer GEK no matter what the Communists lead 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.680
 Democrats are not over for England 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.510
 to be immigrated to seven sprints to immigrate 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.550
 Most of Geisenfelder 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.829
 not known exactly 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.660
 he suggests Dietz MPs the area so the run 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.230
 yes it has held and it was like that 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.170
 own hand sent way through the right hand with the wind blown away 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.370
 from the helpers 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.980
 Gone with the wind 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.840
 that they were at the top of a plateau 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.580
 Jeff Burton 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.870
 have given 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.710
 as a feature 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.949
 a tree behind him 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:09.659
 how to be cross 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.439
 at the opposite village that wants 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.759
 the movie scenes 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.049
 the old well in the eye 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.669
 Tree and flowers 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.069
 a straight line in the eye 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.510
 as soon as it keeps running it disappears and then you stand exactly 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.779
 on the desk on it 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.769
 why are we here today for the passport there every one guessed that it was 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:29.369
 These 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.359
 time from the end 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.769
 What the Mediterranean is adept but perfect 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.549
 if I old the sentence 1 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.089
 which fits if it should be true the man now wants to get his approval 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.359
 Vedanta of tasks 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.699
 around now want to see here 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.019
 in the history the debris had penetrated 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.069
 to this 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.069
 that this had stopped the city center for up to four weeks 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.449
 "Because judging by the size of the holes does indeed have quite 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.189
 plain and simple with good genes 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.189
 stolen indiscriminately 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.749
 but I would go for "Doctor Faustus" group 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.639
 yes, followed by 4 at the Olympus Lobes 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.159
 good work 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.129
 just search the area 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.329
 everything rather 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.489
 so build here on the site now 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.489
 we would shape ourselves well 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.500
 be in the report 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 just put it there 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.599
 so now this has to fall here according to the stories in this strip 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.929
 what the other to take over c-boys here probably Schulten 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.329
 from the proceeds of Amprion meetings 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.329
 okay then I have to bother with new beetle 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.020
 and so did Jason Kidd make his heart out 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.349
 now want 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.349
 because not too much costs 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.419
 Sorbitol, of course, relieved 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.529
 and I'm positive about that 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:27.259
 what remained above both groups on success 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.240
 Datacert 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.870
 at first it does not call 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.479
 but then go 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.610
 good shoes off and on 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.610
 put in the end 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.569
 Shakers I have a bit of earth for many generations 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.629
 the safest and most unobtrusive on the Baar Stockholm are around 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.449
 Resistors and jewels 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.349
 and is a rumor or not 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.490
 it will pass from the father to the son 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.270
 these stories survive on CDU 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.749
 most fishermen and farmers know them 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:02.819
 but with time around 7 o'clock 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:03.930
 many gardeners 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.330
 who once have their treasures 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.960
 Panknin fight the 2 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.550
 before she could entrust her secret hidden treasure to her next 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.150
 sometimes the description was also 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.169
 Deuce is not enough with Sisi 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.289
 and the external features that should locate the site had become 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:20.919
 fundamental
