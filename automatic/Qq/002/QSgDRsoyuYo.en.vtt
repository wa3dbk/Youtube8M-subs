bluetooth<00:01:17.970> module<00:01:18.240> they<00:01:18.630> got<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:19.170> sparkfun

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
bluetooth module they got from sparkfun

bluetooth module they got from sparkfun
and<00:01:20.790> i<00:01:21.450> made<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> custom<00:01:22.409> android<00:01:22.860> app<00:01:23.040> that's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and i made it custom android app that's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.770 
and i made it custom android app that's
what's<00:01:24.030> controlling<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.960> LEDs<00:01:26.780> there's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
what's controlling all the LEDs there's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
what's controlling all the LEDs there's
the<00:01:28.049> top<00:01:28.290> part<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.220> strip<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the top part there's a strip in the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.819 
the top part there's a strip in the
bottom<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.390> there's<00:01:30.750> also<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> actual

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
bottom and there's also the actual

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.069 
bottom and there's also the actual
tesseract<00:01:33.470> hrrg<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.659> pretty

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
tesseract hrrg be so you can make pretty

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.469 
tesseract hrrg be so you can make pretty
much<00:01:37.200> any<00:01:37.350> color<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> want<00:01:38.299> then<00:01:39.299> there's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
much any color you want then there's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.030 
much any color you want then there's
some<00:01:39.630> patterns<00:01:40.280> that's<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.460> chase<00:01:41.729> pattern<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
some patterns that's a chase pattern I

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.109 
some patterns that's a chase pattern I
guess<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.280> did<00:01:44.430> three<00:01:44.759> different<00:01:45.030> colors

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
guess there did three different colors

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.179 
guess there did three different colors
just<00:01:45.840> keeps<00:01:46.049> repeating<00:01:46.200> itself<00:01:46.590> over<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
just keeps repeating itself over and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
just keeps repeating itself over and
over<00:01:47.329> there's<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.450> speed<00:01:48.750> adjust<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.619> can

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
over there's a speed adjust so you can

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:07.749 
over there's a speed adjust so you can
slow<00:01:49.950> down<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.369> speed<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.670> up

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.350 

there's<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:09.000> extract<00:02:10.519> I'm<00:02:11.519> not<00:02:12.060> really<00:02:12.239> used

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
there's this extract I'm not really used

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.270 
there's this extract I'm not really used
to<00:02:12.569> my<00:02:12.720> GoPro<00:02:13.140> yet<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.709> had<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.920> move<00:02:14.099> the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
to my GoPro yet so I had to move the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.670 
to my GoPro yet so I had to move the
camera<00:02:19.700> there's<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> inside<00:02:21.239> strip<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
camera there's the inside strip the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.339 
camera there's the inside strip the
tesseract<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.540> saw<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.810> top<00:02:25.110> court

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
tesseract and you saw the top court

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.130 
tesseract and you saw the top court
earlier<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:27.480> turned<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.780> Raspberry<00:02:28.110> Pi

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
earlier I just turned the Raspberry Pi

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.190
