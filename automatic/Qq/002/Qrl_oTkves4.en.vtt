this is my deadlift I lights from week

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.450 
this is my deadlift I lights from week
six<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.789> fourth<00:00:24.119> cycle<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.250> meant<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> week

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
six of my fourth cycle I meant to week

six of my fourth cycle I meant to week
six<00:00:26.760> which<00:00:26.970> ordinarily<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
six which ordinarily would be a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.810 
six which ordinarily would be a
sometimes<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.500> test<00:00:31.710> week<00:00:31.920> sometimes

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
sometimes a test week sometimes

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.049 
preparation for a test week in this case
it's<00:00:35.399> probably<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
it's probably going to be the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's probably going to be the
penultimate<00:00:36.750> week<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> my<00:00:37.590> cycle<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
penultimate week of my cycle and then I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.479 
penultimate week of my cycle and then I
will<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> test<00:00:39.960> week<00:00:40.160> potentially<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.309> week

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
will do a test week potentially in week

will do a test week potentially in week
a<00:00:41.670> I'm<00:00:41.969> still<00:00:42.559> that's<00:00:43.559> close<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a I'm still that's close to up in the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.209 
a I'm still that's close to up in the
air<00:00:44.370> anyway<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:46.260> may<00:00:46.469> notice<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.980> my

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
air anyway and you may notice that my

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.810 
air anyway and you may notice that my
voice<00:00:47.430> still<00:00:47.850> sounds<00:00:47.879> slightly<00:00:48.750> mazal<00:00:49.680> um<00:00:49.950> I'm

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
voice still sounds slightly mazal um I'm

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.279 
voice still sounds slightly mazal um I'm
starting<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.899> haven't<00:00:52.140> got

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
starting to think that I haven't got

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.110 
starting to think that I haven't got
cold<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.190> my<00:00:53.399> new<00:00:53.610> voice<00:00:53.879> but

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
cold and this is just my new voice but

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.430 
cold and this is just my new voice but
I'm<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.420> can't<00:00:54.600> develop<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.260> deep

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
I'm just can't develop a really deep

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.189 
I'm just can't develop a really deep
voice<00:00:55.469> would<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.010> pretty<00:00:56.489> cool<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.629> fair<00:00:57.989> um

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
voice would be pretty cool to be fair um

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.490 
voice would be pretty cool to be fair um
right<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.399> session<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.969> did<00:01:00.300> some<00:01:00.809> or

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
right in this session I did some or

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.750 
right in this session I did some or
technically<00:01:01.920> you're<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.250> taking<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.640> are

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
technically you're not taking they are

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
technically you're not taking they are
planned<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.840> some<00:01:04.140> triples<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.619> thought<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
planned to do some triples I thought I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.330 
planned to do some triples I thought I
went<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.150> hundred<00:01:06.390> twenty-five<00:01:06.869> kilos

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
went for two hundred twenty-five kilos

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.910 
went for two hundred twenty-five kilos
496<00:01:08.340> pounds<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.200> kind<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> little<00:01:10.799> bit

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
496 pounds it was kind of a little bit

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.200 
496 pounds it was kind of a little bit
experimental<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.640> still<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.119> I've

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
experimental it still is because I've

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
experimental it still is because I've
gone<00:01:12.360> back<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.689> my<00:01:12.720> third<00:01:13.080> session<00:01:13.530> map<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
gone back it's my third session map and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.429 
gone back it's my third session map and
sumo<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:14.700> still<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.439> playing

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
sumo now so I'm still kind of playing

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
sumo now so I'm still kind of playing
with<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> way<00:01:16.860> deciding<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
with the way deciding what to do in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.780 
with the way deciding what to do in
terms<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:18.780> sessions<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.400> want<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.670> do

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
terms of my sessions I don't want to do

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.670 
terms of my sessions I don't want to do
5<00:01:21.060> sets<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.630> five<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.110> think<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
5 sets of five because I think that's to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
5 sets of five because I think that's to
a<00:01:24.500> potentially<00:01:25.500> too<00:01:25.619> much<00:01:25.799> volume<00:01:26.150> when<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> say

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
a potentially too much volume when I say

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
a potentially too much volume when I say
I<00:01:27.390> mean<00:01:27.659> obviously<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.170> doesn't<00:01:28.380> allow<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
I mean obviously it doesn't allow you to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.370 
I mean obviously it doesn't allow you to
lift<00:01:29.100> enough<00:01:29.400> weight<00:01:29.579> because<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> volume

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
lift enough weight because of the volume

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.130 
lift enough weight because of the volume
I<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.310> 5<00:01:33.119> sets<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.659> three

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
I don't want to do 5 sets of three

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
I don't want to do 5 sets of three
because<00:01:34.530> again<00:01:34.890> i<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.369> doesn't<00:01:35.579> able<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
because again i think it doesn't able to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.200 
because again i think it doesn't able to
lift<00:01:36.270> enough<00:01:36.689> weight<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.740> said<00:01:38.040> i<00:01:38.280> don't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
lift enough weight that said i don't

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.190 
lift enough weight that said i don't
really<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.479> how<00:01:39.509> much<00:01:39.720> change<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:40.049> mind

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
really know how much change your mind

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.870 
really know how much change your mind
and<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.530> anyway<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.460> basically<00:01:41.820> i

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and do that anyway and so basically i

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370 
and do that anyway and so basically i
did<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> triple<00:01:42.390> initially<00:01:42.840> then<00:01:43.020> i<00:01:43.079> did<00:01:43.140> two

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
did a triple initially then i did two

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 
did a triple initially then i did two
sets<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.430> i<00:01:44.460> plan<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.210> ended<00:01:45.659> up

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
sets and here i plan to do one ended up

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.300 
sets and here i plan to do one ended up
moving<00:01:45.869> getting<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.439> spoiler<00:01:46.740> alert<00:01:47.040> by<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
moving getting one spoiler alert by the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.210 
moving getting one spoiler alert by the
way<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:48.149> kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.259> moved<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> slight<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
way I kind of moved it a slight at the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
way I kind of moved it a slight at the
floor<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:51.329> adductors<00:01:51.990> were<00:01:52.110> pretty

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
floor but my adductors were pretty

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.660 
floor but my adductors were pretty
hammered<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:52.979> point<00:01:53.189> i<00:01:53.310> found<00:01:53.579> that

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
hammered at this point i found that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.249 
hammered at this point i found that
obviously<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.659> I've<00:01:54.780> wanted<00:01:55.170> my

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
bit of a cross over there so I was a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820 
bit of a cross over there so I was a
little<00:02:11.730> bit<00:02:12.060> sore<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:13.140> still<00:02:13.410> feel

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
little bit sore but I still feel

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.440 
little bit sore but I still feel
in<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.130> first<00:02:14.160> triple<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.270> most

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
in that first triple that is the most

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.290 
in that first triple that is the most
weight<00:02:15.830> 496<00:02:16.830> pounds<00:02:17.220> that's<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> most<00:02:17.940> way<00:02:18.210> up

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
weight 496 pounds that's the most way up

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.760 
weight 496 pounds that's the most way up
ever<00:02:18.450> done<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.960> triple<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.440> technically

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
ever done for a triple so is technically

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.910 
ever done for a triple so is technically
a<00:02:19.860> PRS<00:02:20.220> also<00:02:20.490> happy<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.030> um<00:02:21.920> I'm

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
a PRS also happy with that um I'm

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.460 
a PRS also happy with that um I'm
thinking<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.550> might<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.180> good<00:02:24.480> kind<00:02:25.380> of

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
thinking that might be a good kind of

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.530 
thinking that might be a good kind of
setup<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.040> temperatures<00:02:26.370> do<00:02:26.490> like<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> 321<00:02:27.330> to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
setup the temperatures do like a 321 to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
setup the temperatures do like a 321 to
find<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.870> way<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.050> maximal<00:02:28.860> weight<00:02:28.890> i<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
find a way to maximal weight i can do a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.640 
find a way to maximal weight i can do a
triple<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.360> then<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.690> go<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.930> reps<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
triple with and then just go to reps and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.080 
triple with and then just go to reps and
then<00:02:31.770> go<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.100> rep<00:02:32.250> potentially<00:02:32.850> i'm<00:02:32.940> not

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
then go one rep potentially i'm not

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.940 
then go one rep potentially i'm not
really<00:02:33.240> sure<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.410> i<00:02:34.500> said<00:02:34.530> i'm<00:02:34.740> still

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
really sure but like i said i'm still

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.670 
really sure but like i said i'm still
kind<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.220> deciding<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.180> best

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
kind of deciding what is the best

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.410 
kind of deciding what is the best
deadlift<00:02:37.680> cetera<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.010> me<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.640> then

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
deadlift cetera for me to do I then

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.940 
deadlift cetera for me to do I then
followed<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.140> three<00:02:40.440> sets<00:02:40.770> of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
followed that we have three sets of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.580 
followed that we have three sets of
seven<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.490> 195<00:02:42.120> kilos<00:02:42.480> 408<00:02:43.050> pounds<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.500> you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
seven at 195 kilos 408 pounds if you

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.000 
seven at 195 kilos 408 pounds if you
just<00:02:43.830> saw<00:02:44.010> there<00:02:45.170> again<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.260> explain<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.770> last

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
just saw there again I explain this last

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920 
just saw there again I explain this last
week<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> thinking<00:02:47.760> behind<00:02:47.910> what<00:02:48.660> I've<00:02:48.750> done

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
week the thinking behind what I've done

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.680 
week the thinking behind what I've done
for<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.140> last<00:02:49.200> couple<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.620> weeks<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:50.690> I'm

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
for the last couple of weeks is I'm

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.180 
for the last couple of weeks is I'm
basically<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:52.380> pretty<00:02:52.620> basic<00:02:52.740> I'm<00:02:53.100> just

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
basically it's pretty basic I'm just

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.560 
basically it's pretty basic I'm just
thinking<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.540> do<00:02:54.600> some<00:02:54.900> heavy<00:02:55.190> kind<00:02:56.190> of

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
thinking if I do some heavy kind of

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.940 
thinking if I do some heavy kind of
singles<00:02:57.570> doubles<00:02:57.780> triples<00:02:58.080> kind<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.590> work<00:02:58.740> in

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
singles doubles triples kind of work in

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.820 
singles doubles triples kind of work in
that<00:02:59.130> range<00:02:59.420> obviously<00:03:00.420> completely<00:03:01.080> based<00:03:01.560> or

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
that range obviously completely based or

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.400 
that range obviously completely based or
geared<00:03:02.790> toward<00:03:03.090> strength<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:04.110> then<00:03:04.230> fill

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
geared toward strength I can then fill

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.050 
geared toward strength I can then fill
it<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:04.650> some<00:03:04.980> sets<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.490> like<00:03:05.640> seven<00:03:05.970> to

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
it up with some sets of like seven to

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.060 
it up with some sets of like seven to
eight<00:03:06.180> ish<00:03:06.420> reps<00:03:06.810> which<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.590> obviously<00:03:07.830> indeed

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
eight ish reps which is obviously indeed

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.430 
eight ish reps which is obviously indeed
the<00:03:08.160> volume<00:03:08.459> which<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.610> going<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.940> build<00:03:09.440> the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
the volume which is going to build the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.699 
the volume which is going to build the
kind<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.770> base<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.060> size<00:03:12.390> which<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.620> know

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
kind of base and the size which you know

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.840 
kind of base and the size which you know
that<00:03:13.830> obviously<00:03:13.890> hypertrophy<00:03:14.550> hopefully

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
that obviously hypertrophy hopefully

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.920 
that obviously hypertrophy hopefully
that's<00:03:15.030> going<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.300> enable<00:03:15.480> me<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.690> get

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
that's going to enable me to get

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.350 
that's going to enable me to get
stronger<00:03:16.200> eventually<00:03:16.800> because<00:03:17.459> sumo<00:03:17.850> why

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
stronger eventually because sumo why

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.690 
stronger eventually because sumo why
sumos<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> new<00:03:19.110> lift<00:03:19.380> me<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.769> fills<00:03:20.040> me<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.580> I'm

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
sumos a new lift me it fills me like I'm

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.220 
sumos a new lift me it fills me like I'm
getting<00:03:20.790> saw<00:03:21.090> him<00:03:21.360> plucks<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:21.870> my<00:03:21.959> ducks

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
getting saw him plucks it in my ducks

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.360 
getting saw him plucks it in my ducks
which<00:03:22.410> I've<00:03:22.530> never<00:03:22.560> really<00:03:22.860> had<00:03:22.980> before<00:03:23.280> in

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
which I've never really had before in

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.370 
which I've never really had before in
any<00:03:23.430> kind<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.700> lift<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.090> i<00:03:24.300> think<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:25.050> i<00:03:25.140> can<00:03:25.290> get

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
any kind of lift so i think if i can get

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.810 
any kind of lift so i think if i can get
a<00:03:25.440> nice<00:03:25.590> big<00:03:25.890> base<00:03:26.160> there<00:03:26.400> that's<00:03:26.580> going<00:03:26.730> to

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
a nice big base there that's going to

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.670 
a nice big base there that's going to
translate<00:03:26.970> into<00:03:27.330> strength<00:03:27.630> eventually<00:03:28.170> but

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
translate into strength eventually but

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.699 
translate into strength eventually but
we<00:03:28.950> will<00:03:29.130> see<00:03:29.340> um<00:03:29.610> right<00:03:29.850> then<00:03:30.420> did<00:03:30.660> some

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
we will see um right then did some

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.430 
we will see um right then did some
dumbbell<00:03:31.709> rows<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.610> single<00:03:33.450> arm<00:03:33.570> ones<00:03:33.810> which

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
dumbbell rows a single arm ones which

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.259 
dumbbell rows a single arm ones which
you<00:03:34.590> just<00:03:34.620> sort<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:34.980> mini<00:03:35.160> guard<00:03:35.370> very<00:03:35.880> really

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
you just sort of mini guard very really

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.699 
you just sort of mini guard very really
do<00:03:36.450> these<00:03:36.630> because<00:03:36.870> i<00:03:36.900> said<00:03:37.080> before<00:03:37.200> i'm<00:03:37.440> very

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
do these because i said before i'm very

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.699 
do these because i said before i'm very
very<00:03:37.800> lazy<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.580> any<00:03:39.000> kind<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.660> charts<00:03:40.170> i<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.500> to

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
very lazy so any kind of charts i get to

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.759 
very lazy so any kind of charts i get to
do<00:03:40.860> unilateral<00:03:41.190> work<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.880> tend<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.239> do<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.769> and

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
do unilateral work I tend to do that and

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.290 
do unilateral work I tend to do that and
obviously<00:03:43.890> where<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.459> go<00:03:44.550> do<00:03:44.700> one<00:03:44.940> side<00:03:45.120> off

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
obviously where you go do one side off

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.900 
obviously where you go do one side off
the<00:03:45.420> others<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.630> bit<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> pain<00:03:46.140> but<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.910> did

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
the others a bit of a pain but I did

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.090 
the others a bit of a pain but I did
them<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:48.780> did<00:03:48.989> some<00:03:49.050> lat<00:03:49.680> pulldowns

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
them and I then did some lat pulldowns

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.220 
them and I then did some lat pulldowns
really<00:03:50.310> like<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.940> see<00:03:51.209> me<00:03:51.600> doing<00:03:51.630> here<00:03:52.019> and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
really like you see me doing here and

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
really like you see me doing here and
what<00:03:52.350> I'm<00:03:52.410> doing<00:03:52.530> differently<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.730> would<00:03:53.850> have

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
what I'm doing differently I would have

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.670 
what I'm doing differently I would have
done<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.300> couple<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.720> times<00:03:54.930> recently<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.440> really

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
done a couple of times recently I really

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.229 
done a couple of times recently I really
like<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.220> hold<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:56.700> for<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.000> fraction

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
like it so I just hold it for a fraction

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.970 
like it so I just hold it for a fraction
of<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.600> second<00:03:57.930> at<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.019> bottom<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.530> rep<00:03:58.709> so

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
of a second at the bottom of the rep so

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.940 
of a second at the bottom of the rep so
I<00:03:59.160> find<00:04:00.090> sometimes<00:04:00.540> even<00:04:01.380> though<00:04:01.500> I'm<00:04:01.590> now<00:04:01.800> I'm

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
I find sometimes even though I'm now I'm

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.070 
I find sometimes even though I'm now I'm
hitting<00:04:02.190> my<00:04:02.250> back<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:02.730> don't<00:04:03.030> feel<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.600> huge

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
hitting my back I don't feel a huge

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.500 
hitting my back I don't feel a huge
amount<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.860> back<00:04:05.010> engagement<00:04:05.550> or<00:04:06.120> as<00:04:06.269> much<00:04:06.450> as

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
amount of back engagement or as much as

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.660 
amount of back engagement or as much as
I'd<00:04:06.780> liked<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.140> so<00:04:07.290> what<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.470> do<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.310> what

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
I'd liked you so what I do is just what

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.729 
I'd liked you so what I do is just what
the<00:04:08.820> reason<00:04:09.209> anyway<00:04:09.510> there<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.560> worked

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
the reason anyway there and it worked

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.470 
the reason anyway there and it worked
through<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.040> really<00:04:11.610> well<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.880> any<00:04:12.000> kind<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.299> raw

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
through a really well of any kind of raw

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.120 
through a really well of any kind of raw
I<00:04:12.510> found<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:13.170> just<00:04:13.350> hold<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.920> fraction

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
I found it's just hold it for a fraction

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.800 
I found it's just hold it for a fraction
of<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.459> second<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.880> end<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.420> rep<00:04:15.600> and

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
of a second on the end of the rep and

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.620 
of a second on the end of the rep and
you<00:04:16.260> really<00:04:16.709> really<00:04:16.950> feel<00:04:17.250> your<00:04:17.400> back<00:04:17.669> you

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
you really really feel your back you

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.810 
you really really feel your back you
know<00:04:18.750> burning<00:04:19.260> as<00:04:19.410> always<00:04:19.650> as<00:04:19.799> long<00:04:20.040> as<00:04:20.729> you

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
know burning as always as long as you

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.159 
know burning as always as long as you
make<00:04:21.000> sure<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.209> are<00:04:21.330> pulling<00:04:21.540> and<00:04:21.780> holding

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
make sure you are pulling and holding

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.140 
make sure you are pulling and holding
from<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.440> elbow<00:04:22.560> not<00:04:23.370> with<00:04:23.520> your<00:04:23.610> hands<00:04:23.880> and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
from the elbow not with your hands and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.300 
from the elbow not with your hands and
right<00:04:24.810> I<00:04:24.930> then<00:04:25.229> did<00:04:25.470> sir

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
right I then did sir

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.120 
right I then did sir
reverse<00:04:27.090> dumbbell<00:04:27.600> flyes<00:04:27.990> which<00:04:28.590> I'm<00:04:28.830> trying

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
reverse dumbbell flyes which I'm trying

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.590 
reverse dumbbell flyes which I'm trying
to<00:04:29.280> incorporate<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.760> lot<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:30.000> upset<00:04:30.270> us<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.389> few

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
to incorporate a lot of upset us a few

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.659 
to incorporate a lot of upset us a few
times<00:04:30.870> just<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.620> counteract<00:04:32.250> all<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.580> the

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
times just to counteract all of the

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.120 
times just to counteract all of the
pressing<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.650> regular<00:04:34.650> flies<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.040> I'm

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
pressing and the regular flies that I'm

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.050 
pressing and the regular flies that I'm
doing<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.490> don't<00:04:35.580> want<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:35.940> an

doing that don't want to get an

been<00:04:38.550> doing<00:04:38.820> this<00:04:38.880> it<00:04:39.030> might<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.300> coincident

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
been doing this it might be coincident

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.000 
been doing this it might be coincident
when<00:04:39.960> my<00:04:40.020> shoulders<00:04:40.380> have<00:04:40.470> felt<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.710> million

kind of troubling me a little bit so

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.620 
kind of troubling me a little bit so
