00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.530 
really could do I suppose sort of sign
on<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.070> side<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.610> trying<00:05:23.150> to<00:05:23.210> make<00:05:23.300> through

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
together but some of the sequences in

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.340 
together but some of the sequences in
the<00:05:25.070> game<00:05:25.280> are<00:05:25.490> timed<00:05:25.760> so<00:05:26.210> that<00:05:26.479> bridge<00:05:27.199> will

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350
