00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.070
 Hey guys, I have until then for the mobilkom to teaching video number six and 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.570
 so that's really the last instructional video 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.560
 Oh I'm still missing something by no means a videochat function the field is one 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.509
 was us 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.789
 I have addressed the topic in the last video 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.939
 what video last year 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.089
 is about the 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.089
 Order how to activate cards 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.020
 The whole thing is called% Stairs PID or spell speed 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.440
 this in the NLA just rose on which Katemann which card active 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.520
 their may 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.250
 in order not to activate each Kati on each one is not possible and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.170
 that's why 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.080
 if I explain that to you now 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.870
 Barnier there are three different is the Pils and go to a street 1 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.500
 2 and 3 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.720
 which image I have to which maps are right 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.160
 of course explained now 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.690
 We start with fun as it used to be the slowest of percent of a stylus 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390
 pins 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.880
 to belong to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.290
 Norman mourning cards 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.220
 Playing field opera cards 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.970
 equipment mourning cards 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.770
 Ritual mourning cards important moment unfortunately but and not 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.430
 permanent pressure 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.960
 these spell cards 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.869
 Not 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.540
 even when activated, no one else has the other card 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.140
 to activate this or another pan or effect 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 is not because they are the SPD 1 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.560
 to this percentage of the booklet also belongs 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 the effect of a normal swept monster 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.900
 how to distinguish the effects of a defect and what will be the last 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.600
 Year video usually 7 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.990
 if I explain that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 yes soccer to stress bligg former says include permanent 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.480
 equipment 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.620
 Equipment for the garden leased pitch Male Friedhold Hoppert had and when 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.419
 time effect of monsters 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.549
 Soros PS PID 2 Kaman is activated on the activation legs 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.580
 a card that the none of an act that the 2 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.200
 to belong to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.749
 Have contact on site 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:23.730
 around 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.099
 to that I now say what the counter to the drachma in the not called I have it 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.769
 just 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.459
 So I used to say that sometimes 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.079
 it's fast moved 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:32.969
 around 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 for example, the venue is a humorous recent court 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.760
 to the green to armor than normal fall so normal case belong to it 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.649
 permanent fall 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.259
 that's what you do 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.339
 Often the picture can move in activate or even Space pea-2 there 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:52.479
 can activate 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.569
 to take an example too little too soon 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.779
 and STS PID 3 is the last one that can be activated on 1 2 and 3 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.959
 will be and these are counter-attacks 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.959
 how solemn brings 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.629
 So now I have said 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.170
 in Pecik has fallen into which category 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.449
 and now let's just do a very simple example 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.449
 Of course, the chain is added again 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.309
 Let's say the enemy is activated 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:25.279
 rebirth 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.709
 It would theoretically bring nothing but we'll do it anyway 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.619
 we also activate the Fudan a bit 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.229
 Percent or we do it differently we do that that makes sense 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.229
 and that by a particularly strength Whitacre one except mortal danger is that 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.369
 Merit of the peak 1 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:46.949
 that means we can only activate fun like two or three 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.469
 One can not be deactivated on it 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.699
 The activation now turns off that the 22 points can go fast 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.699
 to meet the card mystical space 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.749
 now we can point out to you the opponent now or we can do it ourselves 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.229
 then one more out that the two activate 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:07.059
 or 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.059
 an austs activate the image three 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:12.919
 for example, became solemn 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.269
 so of course they will be dissolved now after the cold in 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.669
 let's say 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.499
 we must now be in a hasty judgment neutralized episode of 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.779
 recent court 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.960
 However, the consequence of the recent court would have nothing to do with the 

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:34.119
 mystical place to do iPhone therefore offer effect of mystic and may and 

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:35.259
 still activated 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.800
 and the mausoleum is destroyed 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.939
 Now I have KÃ¤the us around that PID in an example 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.610
 yes abbot can show 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.300
 experienced the following situation necessarily activated mystical place 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.350
 we can not do that 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.150
 as I said 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.569
 for example, activate a rebirth 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.849
 we can really only get cards from stress PID 2 or 3 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.779
 activate it 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.699
 I notice all that you have to Ska St Zankapfel Oh yes that's exactly it 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:07.509
 2 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.150
 include even more wing fekter and trader effects 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.530
 which one differentiates which effect from monsters 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.770
 I will enjoy the video as I said 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.789
 then lay 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.740
 yes that's it 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.940
 I hope and I could explain everything very well and you did everything stand 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.659
 "What I wanted to say 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.189
 around 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.110
 but now I want to go to the next one 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.569
 already today
