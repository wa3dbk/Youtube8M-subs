00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
so I said we're placing battery

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.090 
so I said we're placing battery
terminals<00:00:06.750> on<00:00:06.870> my<00:00:06.990> brother's<00:00:07.380> truck<00:00:07.800> it's<00:00:08.010> a

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
terminals on my brother's truck it's a

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.330 
terminals on my brother's truck it's a
Chevy<00:00:08.370> so<00:00:08.760> it's<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.030> side<00:00:09.330> mounted<00:00:09.809> battery

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
Chevy so it's a side mounted battery

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.180 
Chevy so it's a side mounted battery
terminals<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:12.360> happen<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.840> these<00:00:13.380> gets<00:00:13.890> so

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
terminals this happen is these gets so

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.030 
terminals this happen is these gets so
loose<00:00:14.519> or<00:00:14.970> some<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.600> Heller<00:00:16.200> doing<00:00:16.560> really<00:00:16.860> I

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
loose or some with Heller doing really I

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.280 
loose or some with Heller doing really I
think<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.849> probably<00:00:18.300> because<00:00:18.480> recorded<00:00:19.110> or

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
think it's probably because recorded or

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.010 
think it's probably because recorded or
rusted<00:00:19.680> or<00:00:19.800> something<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.970> hit<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> bump

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
rusted or something that hit a bump

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.690 
rusted or something that hit a bump
they'll<00:00:22.680> come<00:00:22.829> off<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:23.130> next<00:00:23.400> time<00:00:23.489> we<00:00:23.579> get<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
they'll come off the next time we get a

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.909 
they'll come off the next time we get a
started<00:00:24.090> watt<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.390> go<00:00:24.509> open<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.439> head<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.829> hit

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
started watt to go open the head and hit

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.999 
started watt to go open the head and hit
the<00:00:26.009> battery<00:00:26.340> actually<00:00:26.910> hit<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> terminals

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
the battery actually hit the terminals

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.170 
the battery actually hit the terminals
but<00:00:29.009> uh<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.550> don't<00:00:29.669> know<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.149> enough

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
but uh I don't know if I have enough

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
had to use a hacksaw over here look at

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.090 
had to use a hacksaw over here look at
this<00:00:44.190> piece<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.670> off<00:00:45.710> you<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.859> that<00:00:47.010> was
