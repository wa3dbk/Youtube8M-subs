00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you get points for so those numbers up

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.330 
you get points for so those numbers up
there<00:01:46.380> are<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.799> crazy<00:01:47.009> they're

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
which you hit B which I haven't

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.780 
which you hit B which I haven't
implemented<00:02:19.640> yet<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.370> right<00:02:22.520> now<00:02:22.550> I've<00:02:22.760> got

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
implemented yet so right now I've got

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.850 
implemented yet so right now I've got
WASD<00:02:23.600> movement<00:02:23.990> with<00:02:24.110> mouse<00:02:24.320> look<00:02:24.650> it's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
WASD movement with mouse look it's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.130 
WASD movement with mouse look it's
really<00:02:25.130> really<00:02:25.550> smooth<00:02:25.880> if<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.660> when<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.870> release

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
really really smooth if I when I release

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.170 
really really smooth if I when I release
a<00:02:27.200> version<00:02:28.130> do<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.430> guys<00:02:28.580> soon<00:02:28.790> enough<00:02:29.000> you'll

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
a version do you guys soon enough you'll

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.590 
a version do you guys soon enough you'll
notice<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:30.130> I'm<00:02:31.130> going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.370> get<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> new<00:02:32.240> model

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
notice that I'm going to get a new model

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.380 
notice that I'm going to get a new model
maybe<00:02:32.750> make<00:02:32.960> one<00:02:33.110> myself<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.060> custom<00:02:35.060> animate

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
maybe make one myself and custom animate

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.840 
maybe make one myself and custom animate
it<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.810> because<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:37.160> right<00:02:37.460> here<00:02:37.520> that's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
it just because this right here that's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.210 
it just because this right here that's
really<00:02:38.090> nice<00:02:38.210> isn't<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.740> moving<00:02:39.740> backwards<00:02:40.100> of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
really nice isn't it moving backwards of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.340 
really nice isn't it moving backwards of
that<00:02:40.370> without<00:02:41.330> actually<00:02:41.750> looking<00:02:41.870> like<00:02:42.020> it

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
that without actually looking like it

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.010 
that without actually looking like it
not<00:02:42.770> something<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.130> want<00:02:43.340> in<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.460> game<00:02:44.020> another

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
not something I want in the game another

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.180 
not something I want in the game another
thing<00:02:45.170> I've<00:02:45.260> been<00:02:45.290> working<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.800> shooting

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
thing I've been working on is shooting

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.820 
thing I've been working on is shooting
this<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> super<00:02:47.150> early<00:02:47.300> version<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.770> just

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
this is a super early version it it just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.980 
this is a super early version it it just
kind<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.640> test<00:02:49.910> I'm<00:02:50.270> not<00:02:50.420> probably<00:02:50.870> not

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
kind of this a test I'm not probably not

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.120 
kind of this a test I'm not probably not
going<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.140> use<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.410> version<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:51.860> shooting

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
going to use this version of shooting

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.450 
going to use this version of shooting
anyways<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:53.240> just<00:02:53.690> spawned<00:02:54.560> some<00:02:54.740> basic<00:02:55.130> units

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
anyways I just spawned some basic units

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.130 
anyways I just spawned some basic units
at<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.700> XYZ<00:02:56.000> coordinates<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:57.050> a

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
at the XYZ coordinates this is just a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.770 
at the XYZ coordinates this is just a
test<00:02:57.380> for<00:02:58.370> testing<00:02:58.550> purposes<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.270> you<00:02:59.690> get

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
test for testing purposes but you get

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.480 
test for testing purposes but you get
the<00:02:59.840> general<00:03:00.020> idea<00:03:00.310> problem<00:03:01.310> with<00:03:01.400> this

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
the general idea problem with this

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.550 
the general idea problem with this
system<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.120> I'm<00:03:02.630> holding<00:03:02.960> it<00:03:03.080> down<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
system is that I'm holding it down and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.900 
system is that I'm holding it down and
they<00:03:03.650> keep<00:03:03.830> spawning<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.310> same<00:03:04.460> location

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
they keep spawning the same location

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.730 
they keep spawning the same location
they<00:03:05.000> don't<00:03:05.150> follow<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.510> crosshair<00:03:05.990> I<00:03:06.200> can't

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
they don't follow the crosshair I can't

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.020 
they don't follow the crosshair I can't
shoot<00:03:06.890> off<00:03:07.010> into<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.310> distance<00:03:07.460> because

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
shoot off into the distance because

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.170 
shoot off into the distance because
there's<00:03:08.240> no<00:03:08.450> coordinates<00:03:09.110> up<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.640> if

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
there's no coordinates up there so if

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.760 
there's no coordinates up there so if
you<00:03:11.270> guys<00:03:11.390> got<00:03:11.600> any<00:03:11.630> tips<00:03:12.020> or<00:03:12.200> ideas<00:03:12.290> for<00:03:12.680> that

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
you guys got any tips or ideas for that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.620 
you guys got any tips or ideas for that
let<00:03:13.010> me<00:03:13.040> know<00:03:13.130> because<00:03:13.820> that<00:03:14.150> would<00:03:14.300> make<00:03:14.450> this

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
let me know because that would make this

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.040 
let me know because that would make this
a<00:03:14.690> lot<00:03:14.870> better<00:03:15.820> yes<00:03:16.820> that's<00:03:17.390> pandemic<00:03:18.020> right

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
a lot better yes that's pandemic right

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.270 
a lot better yes that's pandemic right
now<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:19.690> am<00:03:20.690> looking<00:03:21.140> for<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> trainer<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.160> a

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
now I am looking for a trainer and a
