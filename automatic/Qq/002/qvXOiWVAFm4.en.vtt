00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
boeuf root and that's what the kenyan is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
boeuf root and that's what the kenyan is
called<00:00:30.089> donut<00:00:30.570> um<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.769> not<00:00:32.129> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
called donut um this is not the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.850 
called donut um this is not the
traditional<00:00:32.809> foot<00:00:33.809> recipe<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.680> it's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
traditional foot recipe but it's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.209 
traditional foot recipe but it's
alternative<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.879> it<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.829> you<00:00:37.829> can't<00:00:38.070> really

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
alternative to it and you can't really

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.450 
alternative to it and you can't really
taste<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> difference<00:00:39.120> when<00:00:39.449> you<00:00:39.570> try<00:00:39.839> it<00:00:40.460> so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
taste the difference when you try it so

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
taste the difference when you try it so
for<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.659> need<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:44.690> self<00:00:45.690> raising

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
for that you need some self raising

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
for that you need some self raising
flour<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:46.860> roughly<00:00:47.489> three<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.790> half

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
flour you need roughly three and a half

I've done next is I've got the milk and
I've<00:02:14.210> added<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.540> sugar<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.140> I'm<00:02:15.620> just

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
I've added the sugar to it I'm just

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.380 
I've added the sugar to it I'm just
gonna<00:02:15.950> mix<00:02:16.250> stir<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.820> around<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.150> sugar

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
gonna mix stir that around the sugar

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.300 
gonna mix stir that around the sugar
dissolves<00:02:17.990> yeah<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:19.280> then<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.090> add<00:02:21.310> roughly

and just stir this around a bit
make<00:02:37.040> sure<00:02:37.160> sugar<00:02:37.370> dissolves<00:02:37.940> being<00:02:38.270> any<00:02:38.750> more

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
make sure sugar dissolves being any more

you're doing it all the time you'll be
perfect<00:06:12.520> by<00:06:12.970> can<00:06:13.210> use<00:06:13.390> expand<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.170> is<00:06:14.350> to<00:06:21.420> case

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
perfect by can use expand it is to case

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.300 
perfect by can use expand it is to case
ask<00:06:22.660> you<00:06:22.780> see<00:06:22.930> this<00:06:22.990> recipe<00:06:23.200> makes<00:06:23.620> a<00:06:23.770> lot<00:06:24.070> of

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
ask you see this recipe makes a lot of

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.940 
ask you see this recipe makes a lot of
donuts

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
donuts

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.950 
donuts
hopefully<00:06:26.950> you<00:06:27.010> can<00:06:27.160> see<00:06:27.540> quite<00:06:28.540> a<00:06:28.600> lot<00:06:28.870> of

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
hopefully you can see quite a lot of

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.900 
hopefully you can see quite a lot of
them<00:06:29.170> there<00:06:29.440> and<00:06:32.370> like<00:06:33.370> I<00:06:33.400> said<00:06:33.550> this

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
them there and like I said this

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.620 
them there and like I said this
additional<00:06:34.390> Guardian<00:06:35.850> before<00:06:36.850> that<00:06:37.210> one<00:06:37.390> is

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
additional Guardian before that one is

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:45.990 
additional Guardian before that one is
basically<00:06:38.490> water<00:06:40.260> yeast<00:06:41.260> and<00:06:43.320> flour<00:06:44.730> so<00:06:45.730> water

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
basically water yeast and flour so water

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.460 
basically water yeast and flour so water
use<00:06:46.270> flour<00:06:46.540> and<00:06:46.840> sugar<00:06:47.970> and<00:06:49.110> I'm<00:06:50.110> not<00:06:50.320> sure

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
use flour and sugar and I'm not sure

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.320 
use flour and sugar and I'm not sure
exactly<00:06:50.650> the<00:06:51.010> proportions<00:06:51.850> I<00:06:52.090> can

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
exactly the proportions I can

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.500 
exactly the proportions I can
investigate<00:06:52.720> and<00:06:53.020> let<00:06:53.170> you<00:06:53.320> know<00:06:53.500> later<00:06:54.510> but

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
investigate and let you know later but

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.660 
investigate and let you know later but
for<00:06:55.720> that<00:06:55.870> one<00:06:56.050> you<00:06:56.320> tend<00:06:56.560> to<00:06:56.680> leave<00:06:57.520> it

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
for that one you tend to leave it

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.880 
for that one you tend to leave it
overnight<00:06:58.080> you<00:06:59.080> need<00:06:59.230> to<00:06:59.320> make<00:06:59.500> sure<00:06:59.530> I<00:06:59.680> leave

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
overnight you need to make sure I leave

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.150 
overnight you need to make sure I leave
it<00:07:00.040> overnight<00:07:00.280> and<00:07:00.490> fry<00:07:00.940> it<00:07:01.000> next<00:07:01.600> day<00:07:02.130> so<00:07:03.130> it

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
it overnight and fry it next day so it

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.950 
it overnight and fry it next day so it
does<00:07:03.460> take<00:07:03.700> longer<00:07:03.730> to<00:07:04.210> prepare<00:07:04.300> and<00:07:04.810> make

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
does take longer to prepare and make

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:16.159 
does take longer to prepare and make
them<00:07:05.170> this<00:07:05.350> one

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.169 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.229 

you
