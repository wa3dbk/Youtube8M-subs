00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the enemy's health is very low so it

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.780 
the enemy's health is very low so it
gives<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.440> less<00:02:15.650> hit<00:02:15.950> there<00:02:16.190> goes<00:02:16.430> dead

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
gives you the less hit there goes dead

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.190 
gives you the less hit there goes dead
at<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> grab<00:02:17.860> then<00:02:18.860> use<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.340> stub<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.840> now

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
at the grab then use the stub and now

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.020 
at the grab then use the stub and now
that<00:02:21.380> loot<00:02:21.590> allottee<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.040> gonna<00:02:22.190> start<00:02:22.520> right

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
there instead of finishing the x-ray so

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.940 
there instead of finishing the x-ray so
that<00:02:26.240> also<00:02:26.660> makes<00:02:27.050> sense<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.560> know<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.890> a

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950
