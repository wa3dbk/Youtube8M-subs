 approached him and sat at the foot of it 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.379

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.140
 To think that it would be very nice to rest 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.020

 that bed appeared next to him and amazed 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:21.649
 he leaned back and kept thinking that the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.619
 high of bliss would be achieved if a 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:28.960

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.490
 this he realized he was wearing all the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.479
 day without eating and he thought with confidence 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.220
 it would be fantastic it would be wonderful if 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.880
 I could eat now 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.230
 and suddenly a table appeared before him 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.870
 full of succulent delicacies 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.600

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.200

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.050
 after eating and drinking and with fatigue 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.800
 of the good trip because he got sleepy and 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.110
 he laid down he fell on the bed 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.700
 and began to think about the extraordinary 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.740
 of the day 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.130
 the extraordinary events that had 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.120
 that had occurred and it was said good 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.599
 I'm going to sleep a couple of hours 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.230
 and I continue to think the worst would be that a 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.680
 tiger will pass here while I sleep 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.489

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.580
 Then a tiger appeared 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.920
 good 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.700
 tremendous tremendous tremendous history 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.790
 story the traveler did not notice 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.819
 that he had by his side the tree of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.400
 wishes a tree 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.960
 waiting to turn your wishes into 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.670
 reality 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:09.220
 and us friend friend you and me too 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.000
 we have together with each one of us 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.580
 we have perhaps unknowingly a cloud in 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.180
 a tree like the electron and the noise 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.690
 to the story the tree of our wishes 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.819

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.290
 thoughts that you allow yourself to have 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.170

 they build your reality if you have 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.950
 positive thoughts as at the beginning 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.170
 of the story your reality is positive 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.319
 it becomes positive if you have 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.900
 negative thoughts your reality 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.900
 begins to have just that tone that tone 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.190
 negative that I know you have your 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.040
 thoughts 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.980
 Well, I'm going to give you five steps so that 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.410
 you can use that you can use to 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.020
 use your mind your thoughts to your 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.590
 favor and not against you as it happened to 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.440
 our traveler step number 1 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.700
 do not think about defeat think about the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.220
 victory 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.320
 how are you going to succeed if you think about the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.600
 failure can not be think of success 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.880
 think about how to get it make plans for 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.830
 reach it and throw yourself 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.470
 step number 2 think do not think so much and 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.220
 if it does not work if you do not think better and if 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.820
 they work when you think and if not 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.370
 that thought works that doubt what 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.300
 what it does is that it paralyzes you instead 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.790
 when you think and if it will work is that 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.840
 ask that question of power what 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.800
 does it throw you into action 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.070
 step number 3 do not consider your 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.070
 weaknesses 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.930
 lean on your strengths 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.300
 notice 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.600
 Your future 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.630
 the building of your reality 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.140
 of your success you must build them on 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.280
 your power over your strengths over your 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:18.680
 strengths lean on them 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.500
 step number 4 do not think I 'll do it later 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.780
 better walk now 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.490
 postponement 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.460
 leave for later what one has to 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.930
 do is one of the main enemies 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.120
 of success 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.440
 therefore change that way of thinking 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:40.280
 and step number five very important not 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:44.270
 think in small think big 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.060
 see if you make small goals 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.260
 you will have small achievements if you mark 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.560
 big goals 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.190
 you will achieve great results by 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.320
 so much 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.690
 think big do not think of a 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.310
 small and one more observation remembers 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:07.180
 the big ideas the big goals the 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.640
 big plans are not more expensive nor 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.620
 more complicated or more difficult than 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.330
 little ones 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.060

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.180
