00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello everyone with you bart and today i 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.250
 I do a review on the mode minecraft I hope not 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:15.120
 the last one called okay mod mod 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.750
 adds a new generation of the world is the world 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.770
 composed entirely of mycelium blocks 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.699
 the surface of which consists of blocks 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.010
 mycelium and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.689
 bare tree crowns also we can 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.740
 meet here such ruins 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.480
 already extinct civilization in which in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.860
 which we can find all sorts of unnecessary 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.739
 food for us is mostly iron buckets 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.850
 arrow bars of wheat bone and the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.430
 similar also on the surface of the world we 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.430
 we can meet a hole that's where they lead 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.680
 here it is the juice of this 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.460
 years under the earth are huge 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.629
 huge caves which also times 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 tear or fibroids 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.930
 it's very interesting very interesting 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.810
 followed by such caves are very beautiful 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:15.090
 one of the new snow bricks turns out 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.360
 blocks of snow added everywhere 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.119
 Blocks if it is watered a bit around the world I 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.049
 I'll show you some more 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.740
 underground biomes also this mod like you 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.350
 see adds new blocks and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.119
 thing is a cave lantern 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.810
 This is how you see it looks like 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.540
 block gold just slightly different color 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.100
 as the snow which had already seen 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:52.850
 north brick this 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:56.939
 to me in the moss is such an unusual and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.140
 also has become a stalagmite stalactite here 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.219
 such crystals and the same with these 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.829
 crystals fall out like this 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.590
 pebble from this pebble can make 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.410
 lamp 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.230
 this lamp is very convenient very convenient 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.140
 light source we can walk in contrast 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.950
 from the torch the light will we can not set 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.590
 this lamp 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.100
 we will not put but held 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.570
 around us there will always be light 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.360
 very comfortable and one of the coolest in 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.420
 this fashion innovations now and try 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.920
 find something more interesting then one 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.070
 snow biome you probably not very 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:48.520
 interesting on the cart unloaded because 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.710
 that the world as you see is big also lived 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.930
 if you have a mod optifine 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:59.620
 it is advisable to remove the clouds and then on 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:02.460
 surfaces they are right above the very 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.760
 ground and it doesn't look very nice 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.290
 we came to new bill this grassy by 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.290
 he has big trees here 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.070
 tropical trees and here itâ€™s just 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:24.640
 the land is also tropical trees and 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:28.750
 do they hang from everywhere else 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.570
 several biomes are obsidian and yet 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.780
 it seems to be sitting on a wobble well here right away 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.780
 understandably it is covered completely with obsidian 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.050
 Well, I think to show nothing more you all 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.150
 they themselves have already understood the link to this mod will be 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.590

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.210
