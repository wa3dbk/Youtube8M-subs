00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.109
 a soul that is important and the block

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:32.980
 poker we have everything back from us 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.530

 so bluffing is part of poker 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.320
 it's a soul it's a tool like 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.289
 any other tool there are these 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.840
 advantages of these disadvantages three 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.619
 Things I do not like the bluff 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.020
 way that 98% of people days for that 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.619
 three choices to people not bluff too much 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.750
 use even use left and too 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.580
 little used is that there are people who 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.320
 are ping blocks machine t.blx of 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.229
 kings love who bluffes who bluffes a 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.720
 moment you block more you're a 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.439
 loose player who puts a lot of money 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.210
 with them nothing and on the internet it shows 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.460
 because there is software for 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.320
 show the stats of the players there 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.840

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.930
 dudes it's pretty simple to see that this 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.450
 player there he bluffes never it takes just 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.799
 play big amounts with anyone 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.470
 what a hand to try to share 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.710
 to the tests then anguelov it's just a 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.030
 bad game a bluff so it's done 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.810
 spaced way secondly it takes 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.689
 choose conti to bluff six blocks when 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.299
 a bad player who follows all the time 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:05.049
 to buy my time and my money he's going 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.640
 follow me I can not tell him and 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.950
 there is not here does not know that about the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.959
 share with him four countries 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.030
 deprived of money then anyway 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.319
 these players in order to sit down and 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.790
 allies to have his age 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.170
 you do not need to try to 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.480
 impress him that a block well 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.480
 complicated you're going to have it from any 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.639
 way his money something else I want 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.079
 bluffed when a player who is going to be 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.359
 able to go to bed but I want to go 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.069
 give reasons that lie down so to 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.430
 100 piasses in the east not legault pledge 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.129
 1 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.269
 but I realize at 2 there is not a 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.659
 Christian who will stand 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.099
 I did not force the player to stop 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.780
 to share and if we see it 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.389
 regularly people who told me 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.510
 their argument in a buddy of 2.1 in a 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:48.099
 friend of 50 in a friend of 115 people 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.750
 of middle class will not lie down 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.780
 can give them reasons to 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.209
 calais so if you bluff tools bluff 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.040
 damn and try to share in the joys 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.560
 must not forget one thing especially one 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.750
 block plus the only thing you want 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.150
 is that the player checked his game is there 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.250
 better than you will not win 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.290
 otherwise because he was doing it apart having the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:15.010
 forced to che ck so 1 choose your 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.319
 opponent 2 choose the amount 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.909
 and you when I say here is your 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.780
 adversary that means choosing 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:25.479
 choose no opponent 6 to 4 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.359
 players after the flop that holds can 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.889
 have the stitches 17 to bluff there is 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.259
 one of four who hit something 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.790
 the enough to follow me is that a 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.220
 bluff it's good when it's when a 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.019
 ximum player has a player 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.389
 the opportunity to simulate know yves sa 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.299
 cattle diction general rule a bluff 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.970
 it's mano to mano a player when we 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.739
 sees this fluo blue are more likely to 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.060
 to pass it will pass quite often that this 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.199
 be paid once to bend 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.669
 you do not deny it's not serious 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:56.199
 the other times at least you have 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:58.810
 picked up something we look at channels 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.370
 bluff defend and pockets by 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.879
 example it's us guys who 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.719
 are hot the testosterone clips have 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.400
 made an assessment I bluffed framed cat 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:11.469
 they want me I did not want 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.090
 it's a game so happy with the 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:19.150
 see blocked I go up bello 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.459
 in fact what early managed to put the 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.240
 doubt in the straw of your opponent 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.850
 legault who will tear your money kg to 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.500
 moment when he begins to see your respect 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.900
 because he does not really know if you had 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.230
 a good hand you for rather managed to 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.870
 do it 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:39.430
 shetty yes it gives what you come from 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.140
 tell the players I believe so much 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.110
 credible it would not be tech if you do 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.770
 a block on chosen included you do at 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.950
 good my complexion and you hide from the four 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.430
 points this is the only way to make a 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.460
 bluff 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.410
 the other is first because this bluff 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.580
 we understand each other we will repeat it their 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.240
 only language I was going to win 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.620
 that's if your opponent cochard and 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.230
 the other way semi bluff 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.960
 it is a weapon that is used a lot 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.970
 the more we use everyday 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.040
 time we do not know anymore we do all the 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.480
 world is semi bluffing and it's a 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.530
 concept that's important it's a 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.900
 concept that will bring you 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.700
 a fair amount of money are you 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.350
 put in situation please yes 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.080
 of course we are talking about a table of 10 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.030
 players where there are five or six players 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.890
 for a step that decides the ump it's 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.050
 to say to simply call the 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.360
 value this big blind the action happened you 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.160
 with valance on the button you decide 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.460
 be it the good one not to call the 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
 setting 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.260
 the jokes complete and he comes the flop 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.840
 bone 7 and 9 of spades that gives you a 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.040
 flush draw in more notes 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.310
 hot could not have wanted to take the 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.140
 match at goats shops and a state by 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.260
 inside I simply say that if 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.790
 you hit 1.8 jones day which is good 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.250
 disguised mail was not great luck 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.880
 to catch the first player to speak the 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.530
 small blind 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.530
 but he's worth the spot and
