this<00:00:53.590> gives<00:00:53.770> you<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.040> best<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.399> both<00:00:54.550> worlds

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
this gives you the best of both worlds

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.819 
this gives you the best of both worlds
by<00:00:55.149> offering<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:55.870> exhaust<00:00:56.200> that<00:00:56.410> can<00:00:56.530> be<00:00:56.649> both

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
by offering the exhaust that can be both

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.970 
by offering the exhaust that can be both
loud<00:00:57.100> or<00:00:57.579> quiet<00:00:57.610> depending<00:00:58.600> on<00:00:58.719> your<00:00:58.840> mood<00:00:59.050> now

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
loud or quiet depending on your mood now

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.770 
loud or quiet depending on your mood now
what<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.309> power<00:01:00.489> valve<00:01:00.730> fully<00:01:01.210> closed<00:01:01.540> like

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
what the power valve fully closed like

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.540 
what the power valve fully closed like
it<00:01:01.930> is<00:01:02.050> now<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.649> exhaust<00:01:02.980> takes<00:01:03.250> on<00:01:03.430> the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
it is now the exhaust takes on the

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.369 
it is now the exhaust takes on the
characteristics<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.629> three<00:01:04.929> chambered

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
characteristics of a three chambered

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.319 
characteristics of a three chambered
muffler<00:01:05.770> so<00:01:06.280> it's<00:01:06.399> gonna<00:01:06.490> be<00:01:06.609> relatively<00:01:07.090> soft

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
muffler so it's gonna be relatively soft

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.539 
muffler so it's gonna be relatively soft
and<00:01:07.630> relatively<00:01:08.049> quiet<00:01:08.409> but<00:01:09.100> with<00:01:09.219> the<00:01:09.340> power

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
and relatively quiet but with the power

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.609 
and relatively quiet but with the power
valve<00:01:09.850> fully<00:01:10.299> open<00:01:10.539> you're<00:01:11.170> essentially

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
valve fully open you're essentially

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.949 
valve fully open you're essentially
bypassing<00:01:12.130> these<00:01:12.459> first<00:01:12.729> two<00:01:12.909> chambers<00:01:13.420> it's

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:13.959 
bypassing these first two chambers it's

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:15.840 
bypassing these first two chambers it's
at<00:01:14.109> that<00:01:14.380> point<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.889> muffler<00:01:15.189> takes<00:01:15.459> on<00:01:15.670> the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
at that point the muffler takes on the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.639 
at that point the muffler takes on the
characteristics<00:01:16.270> of<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.899> single<00:01:17.259> chambered

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
characteristics of a single chambered

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.410 
characteristics of a single chambered
muffler<00:01:18.039> so<00:01:18.549> it's<00:01:18.670> gonna<00:01:18.759> get<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.939> lot<00:01:19.149> louder

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
muffler so it's gonna get a lot louder

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.699 
muffler so it's gonna get a lot louder
and<00:01:19.840> you're<00:01:19.990> also<00:01:20.170> gonna<00:01:20.439> get<00:01:20.529> those

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
and you're also gonna get those

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:22.410 
and you're also gonna get those
rough-around-the-edges<00:01:21.130> sounds<00:01:22.029> coming<00:01:22.240> off

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
rough-around-the-edges sounds coming off

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.179 
rough-around-the-edges sounds coming off
the<00:01:22.569> revs<00:01:22.779> you<00:01:23.079> know<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.319> subtle<00:01:23.619> pops<00:01:23.889> and

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
the revs you know the subtle pops and

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.429 
the revs you know the subtle pops and
backfires<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:25.359> course<00:01:25.689> you<00:01:25.810> can't<00:01:26.020> experiment

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
backfires of course you can't experiment

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.529 
backfires of course you can't experiment
with<00:01:26.799> leaving<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.130> valve<00:01:27.399> halfway<00:01:27.909> open<00:01:28.149> and

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
with leaving the valve halfway open and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.059 
with leaving the valve halfway open and
to<00:01:28.869> see<00:01:29.049> what<00:01:29.170> kind<00:01:29.319> of<00:01:29.380> tone<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.799> will<00:01:29.920> give

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
to see what kind of tone that will give

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:31.949 
to see what kind of tone that will give
you<00:01:30.189> as<00:01:30.279> well<00:01:30.549> so<00:01:31.209> with<00:01:31.359> the<00:01:31.450> varitune<00:01:31.810> is

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
you as well so with the varitune is

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.349 
you as well so with the varitune is
bolted<00:01:32.289> up<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:32.439> our<00:01:32.679> 14<00:01:33.130> GT<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:34.060> were<00:01:34.179> curious

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
bolted up to our 14 GT we were curious

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.359 
bolted up to our 14 GT we were curious
to<00:01:34.630> see<00:01:34.659> if<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.959> would<00:01:35.020> make<00:01:35.200> any<00:01:35.349> power<00:01:35.679> with

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
to see if it would make any power with

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.459 
to see if it would make any power with
the<00:01:36.549> valve<00:01:36.729> fully<00:01:36.969> open<00:01:37.119> versus<00:01:37.959> being<00:01:38.200> fully

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
the valve fully open versus being fully

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.099 
the valve fully open versus being fully
closed<00:01:38.889> well<00:01:39.639> after<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.119> few<00:01:40.179> dyno<00:01:40.539> pulls<00:01:40.929> we

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
closed well after a few dyno pulls we

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:42.510 
closed well after a few dyno pulls we
actually<00:01:41.499> put<00:01:41.649> down<00:01:41.679> about<00:01:42.039> eight<00:01:42.279> more

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
actually put down about eight more

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.029 
actually put down about eight more
