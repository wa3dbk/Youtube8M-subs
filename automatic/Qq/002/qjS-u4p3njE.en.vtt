 Welcome to cooking with Rossi kitten 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:21.700
 today we are going to make a Macedonian cake 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:27.270
 first let's throw flour 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.270
 then milk and then sugar 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.790
 we are going to put a dozen eggs 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 but you can also put a dozen 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.260
 does not matter 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.320
 the important thing is that they are eggs 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.510
 and later 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.440
 and we beat everything well 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.160
 but before it gets ready I want to give 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.160
 thank you 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.190
 to creators who have been able to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.430
 this 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:11.200
 reality and that have always supported me 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.400
 always always good, the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.530
 dough 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.659
 now let's put a few 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.100
 more ingredients 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.100

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.650

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:37.120

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.480

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.480
 oven 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.470
 wyss in cairo no matter what 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.470
 important is that the dough has not gone 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.899

 It's sunny and a little cold 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.739
 you do not believe me with the day 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.099
 so good that it has given me to sing 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.410
 but saving comics I'll sing it because 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.900
