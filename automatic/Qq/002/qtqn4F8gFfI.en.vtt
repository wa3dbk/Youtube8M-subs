00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
much like the Stratocaster that I've

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
much like the Stratocaster that I've
replaced<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> pickups<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> MJS<00:01:26.189> this

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
one I've noticed even more so than the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.499 
one I've noticed even more so than the
