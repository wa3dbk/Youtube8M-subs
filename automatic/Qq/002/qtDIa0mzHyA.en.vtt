your elbow or bending your wrist you

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.089 
your elbow or bending your wrist you
will<00:00:13.090> begin<00:00:13.450> by<00:00:13.630> supporting<00:00:14.290> your<00:00:14.410> elbow<00:00:14.860> on

with the blades pointed up and the thumb
ring<00:00:20.170> turned<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.670> it<00:00:21.850> is<00:00:22.000> perpendicular<00:00:22.420> to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
ring turned so it is perpendicular to

ring turned so it is perpendicular to
the<00:00:23.140> handle<00:00:23.670> let's<00:00:24.670> think<00:00:24.910> of<00:00:25.090> this<00:00:25.240> as

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
the handle let's think of this as

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.210 
the handle let's think of this as
position<00:00:26.080> one<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:28.090> position<00:00:28.570> to<00:00:28.980> use<00:00:29.980> your

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
position one for position to use your

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.729 
position one for position to use your
index<00:00:30.430> and<00:00:31.060> middle<00:00:31.150> fingers<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:31.960> push<00:00:32.529> the

blades so they are positioned to cut the

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.910 
blades so they are positioned to cut the
length<00:00:36.569> horizontally<00:00:37.569> like<00:00:38.379> when<00:00:38.559> layering
