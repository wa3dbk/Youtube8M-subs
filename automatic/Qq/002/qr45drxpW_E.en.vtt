00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.279
 my friends to the 

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.320
 pokernews long time no video 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.480
 uploaded but this time it works 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.910
 pokémon omega ruby and just that much 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.130
 in demo that's all now 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.260
 are sown pictures to demo I had 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.070
 Here's just what it is with the both 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.409
 with the demo on it and yes 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.429
 let's just start the demo 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:27.579
 will be released on 15 10 2014 and the demo 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.109
 To get to mcdonald's about nintendos 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.449
 without that I think so 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.890
 and there you can download the code 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.200
 Download and then stop them 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:41.140
 Enter the shop and download it 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.230
 as an initial pokémons there is raptor 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.610
 Young blood and morality you can do 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.280
 just choose it so you catch 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.570
 apparently in the middle of the middle and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.960
 yes you can just one of them 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.840
 choose and they evolve too 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.540
 in demo on the developments 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.340
 stop and then you can be too 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.960
 with there are the first pokémons 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.790
 then you see the poster no deal then 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.469
 So choose already in the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.670
 middle development and there I am 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.159
 no matter 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.850
 yes and the new one will be a new one 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.579
 Mega development into the game keeps revealed 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.490
 and you can then stop it 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:23.590
 So to speak, yes , you can go into the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.380
 then there is a major game to swap over 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.539
 also the demo is supposed to be in mosbach city 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.899
 So I play the complete one 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.670
 not that the entire team has 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.090
 plays in mosbach city and then there is 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.619
 again a double fight against the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.060
 boards of team aqua and tina da 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.659
 you can even see them standing there 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.689
 both about perfect timing and yes 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.579
 because you fight against the fight in the double 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.630
 no idea why because actually are 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.600
 yes, both magic 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.240
 those fighting the somehow together I 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:04.360
 I do not understand either 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:06.399

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.830
 was it in this regard ie from 15 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.290
 and yes I do not know so I would 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.080
 like to know a few projects are for 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.819
 example custom quest since I think that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.959
 that depends too much and too little 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.040
 spectators and shadow kings I know 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:45.370

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.940

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.150

 yes I will be a lot I will 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.440

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.519
 There are a few other last places 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.230

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.360
