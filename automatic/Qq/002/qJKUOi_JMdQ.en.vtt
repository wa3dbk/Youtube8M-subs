the<00:00:13.059> month<00:00:13.269> on<00:00:13.510> black<00:00:13.959> triangle<00:00:14.619> closure<00:00:15.539> so

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
the month on black triangle closure so

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.090 
the month on black triangle closure so
let's<00:00:16.660> go<00:00:16.779> ahead<00:00:16.900> with<00:00:17.020> the<00:00:17.230> technique<00:00:17.650> so<00:00:18.039> i'm

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
let's go ahead with the technique so i'm

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.590 
let's go ahead with the technique so i'm
going<00:00:18.220> to<00:00:18.279> show<00:00:18.460> this<00:00:18.609> to<00:00:18.670> you<00:00:18.850> on<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.150> dental

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
going to show this to you on a dental

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.570 
going to show this to you on a dental
form<00:00:19.840> and<00:00:20.019> this<00:00:20.260> is<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:20.740> area<00:00:20.949> we're<00:00:21.400> going<00:00:21.519> to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
form and this is the area we're going to

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.490 
form and this is the area we're going to
close<00:00:21.789> that<00:00:21.820> black<00:00:22.599> triangle<00:00:23.140> that<00:00:23.230> you<00:00:23.349> can

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
close that black triangle that you can

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.859 
close that black triangle that you can
see<00:00:23.680> here<00:00:23.980> so<00:00:24.430> step<00:00:24.730> one<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:25.270> to<00:00:25.660> make<00:00:25.840> sure

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
see here so step one is to make sure

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.960 
see here so step one is to make sure
that<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.440> surfaces<00:00:26.949> are<00:00:27.100> perfectly<00:00:27.610> clean

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
that the surfaces are perfectly clean

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.689 
that the surfaces are perfectly clean
you<00:00:28.600> can<00:00:28.780> create<00:00:29.080> a<00:00:29.140> slide<00:00:29.650> slight<00:00:30.130> bevel<00:00:30.400> if

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
you can create a slide slight bevel if

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.850 
you can create a slide slight bevel if
necessary<00:00:31.330> but<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:31.960> most<00:00:32.110> important<00:00:32.590> thing

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
necessary but the most important thing

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.250 
necessary but the most important thing
is<00:00:33.039> that<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.399> enamel<00:00:33.879> be<00:00:34.030> really<00:00:34.870> squeaky

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
is that the enamel be really squeaky

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.529 
is that the enamel be really squeaky
clean<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.859> make<00:00:36.010> sure<00:00:36.250> that<00:00:36.609> the<00:00:36.820> etch<00:00:37.030> will

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
clean to make sure that the etch will

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.150 
clean to make sure that the etch will
clean<00:00:37.840> well<00:00:38.109> and<00:00:38.440> that<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.649> composite<00:00:39.129> will

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
clean well and that the composite will

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.000 
clean well and that the composite will
adhere<00:00:39.399> perfectly<00:00:40.120> so<00:00:40.989> you<00:00:41.050> can<00:00:41.289> use<00:00:41.499> a<00:00:41.530> profit

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
adhere perfectly so you can use a profit

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.489 
adhere perfectly so you can use a profit
jet<00:00:42.219> or<00:00:42.460> micro<00:00:42.850> etch<00:00:43.030> on<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.989> interproximal

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
jet or micro etch on the interproximal

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.349 
jet or micro etch on the interproximal
and<00:00:45.010> make<00:00:45.159> sure<00:00:45.339> you<00:00:45.460> go<00:00:45.609> all<00:00:45.819> the<00:00:45.969> way<00:00:45.999> to<00:00:46.149> the

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
and make sure you go all the way to the

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.590 
and make sure you go all the way to the
lingual<00:00:46.780> step<00:00:47.530> two<00:00:47.800> would<00:00:48.429> be<00:00:48.639> to<00:00:48.879> roughen<00:00:49.569> the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
lingual step two would be to roughen the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.410 
lingual step two would be to roughen the
surface<00:00:49.749> or<00:00:50.379> bevel<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:50.829> very<00:00:51.069> lightly<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.789> for

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
surface or bevel it very lightly and for

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.289 
surface or bevel it very lightly and for
this<00:00:52.600> you<00:00:52.780> can<00:00:52.929> use<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.620> diamond<00:00:53.949> burr<00:00:54.339> or<00:00:54.639> you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
this you can use a diamond burr or you

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.079 
this you can use a diamond burr or you
can<00:00:55.510> use<00:00:55.749> some<00:00:56.559> discs<00:00:57.069> so<00:00:57.219> many<00:00:57.429> rough<00:00:57.760> discs

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
can use some discs so many rough discs

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.910 
can use some discs so many rough discs
would<00:00:58.329> work<00:00:58.510> too<00:00:58.809> just<00:00:59.319> make<00:00:59.499> sure<00:00:59.679> you<00:00:59.769> can

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
would work too just make sure you can

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.629 
would work too just make sure you can
actually<00:01:00.039> get<00:01:00.429> to<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.699> interproximal<00:01:01.179> area

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:02.639 
actually get to the interproximal area

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.280 
actually get to the interproximal area
step<00:01:03.639> three<00:01:03.969> is<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.180> protect<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.780> adjacent

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
step three is to protect the adjacent

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.980 
step three is to protect the adjacent
tooth<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.799> I<00:01:06.190> marked<00:01:06.610> with<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:07.180> lead<00:01:07.720> pencil

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
tooth and I marked with a lead pencil

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.550 
tooth and I marked with a lead pencil
the<00:01:08.890> area<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:10.150> I<00:01:10.360> beveled<00:01:10.930> very<00:01:11.229> lightly

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
the area that I beveled very lightly

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.370 
the area that I beveled very lightly
step<00:01:12.400> four<00:01:12.760> would<00:01:13.000> be<00:01:13.120> to<00:01:13.270> etch<00:01:13.450> past<00:01:13.990> the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
step four would be to etch past the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.860 
step four would be to etch past the
prepared<00:01:14.800> area<00:01:15.190> so<00:01:15.430> past<00:01:15.730> that<00:01:16.150> bevel<00:01:16.690> make

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
prepared area so past that bevel make

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.300 
prepared area so past that bevel make
sure<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.140> etch<00:01:17.290> all<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.800> way<00:01:17.920> because<00:01:18.250> you

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
sure you etch all the way because you

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.190 
sure you etch all the way because you
never<00:01:18.580> know<00:01:18.910> where<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.600> composite<00:01:20.080> is

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
never know where the composite is

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.920 
never know where the composite is
actually<00:01:20.710> going<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.190> stop<00:01:21.610> step<00:01:22.390> five<00:01:22.630> would

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
actually going to stop step five would

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.960 
actually going to stop step five would

composite heater this one is Cal say by
Aden<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.810> once<00:02:05.020> your<00:02:05.200> composite<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.800> nicely

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
Aden so once your composite is nicely

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.210 
Aden so once your composite is nicely
heated<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:06.880> have<00:02:07.360> removed<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.530> teflon

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
heated and you have removed the teflon

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.540 
heated and you have removed the teflon
tape<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:10.149> want<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.599> fill<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.620> lingual<00:02:12.159> part

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
tape you want to fill the lingual part

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.619 
tape you want to fill the lingual part
of<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:14.260> matrix<00:02:15.250> with<00:02:15.999> the<00:02:16.150> flowable

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
of your matrix with the flowable

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.360 
of your matrix with the flowable
composite<00:02:16.689> and<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.620> really<00:02:17.889> have<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.219> make

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
composite and you really have to make

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.280 
composite and you really have to make
sure<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.879> leave<00:02:19.150> some<00:02:19.510> space<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
sure that you leave some space for the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.420 
sure that you leave some space for the
regular

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430

regular
body<00:02:21.579> micro<00:02:22.540> fill<00:02:22.719> on<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.140> facial<00:02:23.620> area<00:02:23.859> and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
body micro fill on the facial area and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.000 
body micro fill on the facial area and
I'm<00:02:25.239> really<00:02:25.569> holding<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.049> matrix<00:02:26.469> very<00:02:26.739> tight

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
I'm really holding the matrix very tight

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.699 
I'm really holding the matrix very tight
with<00:02:27.670> my<00:02:28.030> finger<00:02:28.480> Explorer<00:02:29.079> you<00:02:29.349> want<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.590> hold

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
with my finger Explorer you want to hold

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.380 
with my finger Explorer you want to hold
it<00:02:29.829> really<00:02:29.980> tight<00:02:30.099> against<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.879> tooth<00:02:31.150> so

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
it really tight against the tooth so

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.699 
it really tight against the tooth so
there's<00:02:31.599> no<00:02:31.840> leakage<00:02:32.349> underneath<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.519> matrix

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
there's no leakage underneath the matrix

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.349 
there's no leakage underneath the matrix
once<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.890> light<00:02:36.099> your<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.579> go<00:02:36.939> check<00:02:37.239> the

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
once you light your that go check the

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.149 
once you light your that go check the
lingual<00:02:37.719> as<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.049> can<00:02:38.230> see<00:02:38.409> here<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.829> lingual

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
lingual as you can see here the lingual

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.339 
lingual as you can see here the lingual
is<00:02:39.280> perfectly<00:02:39.819> sealed<00:02:40.239> with<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.959> composite

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
is perfectly sealed with the composite

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.080 
is perfectly sealed with the composite
if<00:02:41.590> ever<00:02:42.069> you<00:02:42.189> have<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> little<00:02:42.700> void<00:02:42.909> or

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
if ever you have a little void or

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.000 
if ever you have a little void or
something<00:02:43.510> just<00:02:43.659> add<00:02:43.900> some<00:02:44.170> extra<00:02:44.560> flowable

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
something just add some extra flowable

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.459 
something just add some extra flowable
place<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:46.030> matrix<00:02:46.450> tight<00:02:46.689> and<00:02:46.989> like<00:02:47.260> here

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469 
place the matrix tight and like here

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.379 
place the matrix tight and like here
again<00:02:47.739> then<00:02:48.639> you're<00:02:48.969> going<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.120> remove<00:02:49.329> your

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
again then you're going to remove your

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.720 
again then you're going to remove your
matrix

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
matrix

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.250 
matrix
so<00:02:51.730> once<00:02:51.939> the<00:02:52.090> matrix<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.599> removed<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.200> can

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
so once the matrix is removed you can

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.949 
so once the matrix is removed you can
notice<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.769> beautiful<00:02:54.689> interproximal<00:02:55.689> shape

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
notice a beautiful interproximal shape

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.530

polish the interproximal area before you

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.129 
polish the interproximal area before you
start<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.849> number<00:04:01.239> two<00:04:01.449> which<00:04:01.720> will<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:01.989> the

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.129 
canine so as you can see here I'm
actually<00:04:04.840> passing<00:04:05.739> my<00:04:06.220> disc<00:04:06.699> my<00:04:07.659> pink<00:04:07.959> one

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
actually passing my disc my pink one

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.809 
actually passing my disc my pink one
from<00:04:08.349> confident<00:04:08.949> in<00:04:09.099> between<00:04:09.669> the

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
from confident in between the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.199 
from confident in between the
interproximal<00:04:10.239> area<00:04:10.870> if<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:12.579> disc<00:04:12.790> does<00:04:13.000> not

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
interproximal area if the disc does not

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.649 
interproximal area if the disc does not
pass<00:04:13.449> you<00:04:13.930> can<00:04:14.169> use<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:15.040> flexi<00:04:15.849> diamond

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
pass you can use the flexi diamond

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.670 
pass you can use the flexi diamond
strips<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.859> fine<00:04:18.159> ones<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:20.049> can<00:04:20.259> see<00:04:20.470> here

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
strips the fine ones you can see here

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.370 
strips the fine ones you can see here
the<00:04:20.829> first<00:04:21.070> lateral<00:04:21.789> is<00:04:21.909> done<00:04:23.159> now

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
the first lateral is done now

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.470 
the first lateral is done now
repeat<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.920> steps<00:04:25.220> on<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.520> adjacent<00:04:26.000> tooth

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
repeat the steps on the adjacent tooth

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.880 
repeat the steps on the adjacent tooth
but<00:04:26.750> as<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:26.990> said<00:04:27.200> before<00:04:27.380> we're<00:04:27.650> going<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.830> go

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
but as I said before we're going to go

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.860 
but as I said before we're going to go
very<00:04:28.130> quickly<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.820> I'm<00:04:29.210> going<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.390> give<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:29.840> a

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
very quickly and I'm going to give you a

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.250 
very quickly and I'm going to give you a
few<00:04:30.260> extra<00:04:30.290> tips<00:04:30.830> instead<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.570> for<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.900> second

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
few extra tips instead so for the second

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.750 
few extra tips instead so for the second
tooth<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.620> really<00:04:33.830> want<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.100> make<00:04:34.340> sure<00:04:34.370> you

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
tooth you really want to make sure you

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.150 
tooth you really want to make sure you
choose<00:04:35.030> your<00:04:35.240> matrix<00:04:35.750> accordingly<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.800> you

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
choose your matrix accordingly and you

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.640 
choose your matrix accordingly and you
can<00:04:37.310> see<00:04:37.520> here<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.120> could<00:04:38.870> have<00:04:38.900> actually<00:04:39.350> used

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
can see here I could have actually used

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.530 
can see here I could have actually used
a<00:04:39.980> matrix<00:04:40.580> that<00:04:40.640> was<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:40.850> little<00:04:41.060> bit<00:04:41.270> wider

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
a matrix that was a little bit wider

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.600 
a matrix that was a little bit wider
than<00:04:41.840> what<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.020> actually<00:04:42.260> chose<00:04:42.770> now<00:04:43.370> it

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
than what I actually chose now it

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.730 
than what I actually chose now it
depends<00:04:44.030> if<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.330> really<00:04:44.720> want<00:04:45.140> to<00:04:45.410> close<00:04:45.710> a

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
depends if you really want to close a

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.640 
depends if you really want to close a
triangle<00:04:46.490> absolutely<00:04:47.210> completely<00:04:47.720> or<00:04:48.380> if<00:04:48.500> you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
triangle absolutely completely or if you

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.160 
triangle absolutely completely or if you
want<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.040> respect<00:04:49.580> natural<00:04:50.180> anatomy<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:50.960> your

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
want to respect natural anatomy of your

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.250 
want to respect natural anatomy of your
teeth<00:04:51.940> so<00:04:52.940> two<00:04:53.000> ways<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.540> creating<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:54.050> nice

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
teeth so two ways of creating a nice

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.920 
teeth so two ways of creating a nice
tight<00:04:54.650> fit<00:04:54.680> of<00:04:55.220> that<00:04:55.400> matrix<00:04:55.670> is<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.600> hold<00:04:56.810> it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
tight fit of that matrix is to hold it

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.230 
tight fit of that matrix is to hold it
with<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.110> gloved<00:04:57.470> finger<00:04:58.010> or<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.700> can<00:04:58.850> hold<00:04:59.060> it

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
with a gloved finger or you can hold it

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.670 
with a gloved finger or you can hold it
also<00:04:59.420> with<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.810> Explorer<00:05:00.350> on<00:05:00.530> the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
also with the Explorer on the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.270 
also with the Explorer on the
interproximal<00:05:01.130> area<00:05:01.790> in<00:05:02.410> some<00:05:03.410> instances<00:05:04.070> you

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
interproximal area in some instances you

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.550 
interproximal area in some instances you
will<00:05:04.310> be<00:05:04.670> able<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:05.090> place<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.510> wedge<00:05:05.720> but<00:05:06.350> in

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
will be able to place a wedge but in

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.160 
will be able to place a wedge but in
this<00:05:06.800> particular<00:05:07.340> situation<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.780> was

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
this particular situation I was

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.660 
this particular situation I was
concerned<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.770> would<00:05:09.890> deform<00:05:10.490> the

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
concerned that it would deform the

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.480 
concerned that it would deform the
interproximal<00:05:11.060> area<00:05:12.070> now<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.130> might<00:05:13.460> be

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
interproximal area now you might be

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.750 
interproximal area now you might be
wondering<00:05:13.850> why<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.990> add<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.890> regular<00:05:16.430> body

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
wondering why I add the regular body

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.500 
wondering why I add the regular body
micro<00:05:17.270> fill<00:05:17.480> on<00:05:17.690> top<00:05:18.350> of<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.920> flowable<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.730> my

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
micro fill on top of the flowable and my

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.050 
micro fill on top of the flowable and my
personal<00:05:21.110> reason<00:05:21.350> is<00:05:21.800> that<00:05:21.860> I<00:05:22.040> find<00:05:22.460> that<00:05:22.850> the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
personal reason is that I find that the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.450 
personal reason is that I find that the
regular<00:05:23.450> body<00:05:23.690> is<00:05:24.080> easier<00:05:24.590> to<00:05:24.830> sculpt<00:05:25.340> of

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
regular body is easier to sculpt of

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.910 
regular body is easier to sculpt of
course<00:05:25.700> a<00:05:25.820> flowable<00:05:26.270> is<00:05:26.450> flowable<00:05:27.140> but<00:05:27.770> you

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
course a flowable is flowable but you

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.270 
course a flowable is flowable but you
can<00:05:28.130> use<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.760> brush<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.750> sculpt<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:30.770> really

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
can use the brush to sculpt and really

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.090 
can use the brush to sculpt and really
blend<00:05:31.640> the<00:05:32.120> composite<00:05:32.630> on<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:33.020> enamel<00:05:33.410> now

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
blend the composite on the enamel now

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.340 
blend the composite on the enamel now
before<00:05:34.550> using<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:35.060> disks<00:05:35.540> I<00:05:35.660> usually<00:05:36.140> like<00:05:36.320> to

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
before using the disks I usually like to

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.650 
before using the disks I usually like to
use<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.860> et9<00:05:37.520> bur<00:05:37.970> for<00:05:38.240> gross<00:05:38.810> finishing<00:05:39.440> and

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
use the et9 bur for gross finishing and

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.570 
use the et9 bur for gross finishing and
this<00:05:41.660> is<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:41.870> picture<00:05:42.470> of<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.770> Flexi<00:05:43.160> diamond

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
this is a picture of the Flexi diamond

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.640 
this is a picture of the Flexi diamond
strip<00:05:43.880> I<00:05:44.060> always<00:05:44.540> finish<00:05:44.840> with<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.200> a<00:05:45.260> little

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
strip I always finish with that a little

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.070 
strip I always finish with that a little
bit<00:05:45.800> sub<00:05:46.490> gingerly<00:05:47.120> to<00:05:47.390> make<00:05:47.540> sure<00:05:47.750> that<00:05:47.900> it's

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
bit sub gingerly to make sure that it's

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.190 
bit sub gingerly to make sure that it's
really<00:05:48.470> very<00:05:48.500> very<00:05:49.040> smooth<00:05:49.630> for<00:05:50.630> the<00:05:50.660> final

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
really very very smooth for the final

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.290 
really very very smooth for the final
polish<00:05:51.620> on<00:05:51.830> top<00:05:52.160> I<00:05:52.370> find<00:05:52.760> that<00:05:52.910> confidence

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
polish on top I find that confidence

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.010 
polish on top I find that confidence
nan-oh<00:05:54.220> polishers<00:05:55.220> really<00:05:55.910> get<00:05:56.150> in<00:05:56.750> the

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
nan-oh polishers really get in the

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.780 
nan-oh polishers really get in the
interproximal<00:05:57.500> shape<00:05:58.160> there<00:05:58.490> are<00:05:58.580> some

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
interproximal shape there are some

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.300 
interproximal shape there are some
points<00:05:59.090> some<00:05:59.720> interproximal<00:06:00.590> points<00:06:00.950> also

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
points some interproximal points also

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.990 
points some interproximal points also
that<00:06:01.580> really<00:06:01.730> go<00:06:01.970> well<00:06:02.150> in<00:06:02.330> those<00:06:02.480> situations

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
that really go well in those situations

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.820 
that really go well in those situations
so<00:06:05.000> as<00:06:05.180> you<00:06:05.360> can<00:06:05.480> see<00:06:05.720> here<00:06:06.110> and<00:06:06.290> as<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:06.680> will
