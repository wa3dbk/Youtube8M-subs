00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.020 
to my research I think it came out in
2007<00:04:35.230> but<00:04:36.230> I<00:04:36.410> really<00:04:36.740> like<00:04:36.980> it<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.580> then<00:04:37.820> as

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.150 
2007 but I really like it and then as
the<00:04:38.240> ends<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.840> know<00:04:38.990> get<00:04:39.260> ratty<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.680> could<00:04:39.950> just

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
the ends you know get ratty I could just

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.460 
the ends you know get ratty I could just
start<00:04:41.090> putting<00:04:41.300> from<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.720> back<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.200> cut<00:04:42.350> them

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470
