 they blocked every corner here 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.969

 never really had such a good feeling 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.999
 and this is of course for more 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.289
 for to races 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.550
 yes we want to run for championship 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:29.879

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.879
 end
