want to start you know and no more of
that<00:00:55.780> starting<00:00:56.200> from<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.410> bottom<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.739> working

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
that starting from the bottom of working

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.410 
that starting from the bottom of working
your<00:00:57.070> way<00:00:57.100> up<00:00:57.280> we<00:00:57.399> wanted<00:00:57.670> players<00:00:57.789> to<00:00:58.030> be<00:00:58.149> like

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
your way up we wanted players to be like

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.610 
your way up we wanted players to be like
in<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.690> role<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:58.930> someone<00:00:59.140> that's<00:00:59.320> calling

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
in the role of someone that's calling

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.709 
in the role of someone that's calling
the<00:00:59.710> shots<00:00:59.920> we<00:01:00.190> think<00:01:00.370> that's<00:01:00.520> a<00:01:00.610> very<00:01:00.760> unique

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
the shots we think that's a very unique

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.720 
the shots we think that's a very unique
position<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.500> we<00:01:02.829> think<00:01:03.039> that<00:01:03.190> players<00:01:03.640> are

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
position and we think that players are

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.040 
position and we think that players are
gonna<00:01:03.820> want<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.030> play<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.360> character<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
gonna want to play this character so the

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.260 
gonna want to play this character so the
Saints<00:01:05.350> lots<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.190> guns<00:01:06.369> lots<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.820> money<00:01:07.000> lots

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
Saints lots of guns lots of money lots

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.480 
Saints lots of guns lots of money lots
of<00:01:07.390> power<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.750> they<00:01:08.229> soon<00:01:08.500> figure<00:01:09.220> out<00:01:09.340> that

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
of power and they soon figure out that

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.520 
of power and they soon figure out that
they<00:01:09.670> have<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.000> prove<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.899> they're<00:01:11.350> there

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
they have to prove that they're there

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.170 
they have to prove that they're there
prove<00:01:12.220> that<00:01:12.340> they<00:01:12.490> need<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.670> do<00:01:12.850> that<00:01:12.970> at

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
prove that they need to do that at

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.580 
prove that they need to do that at
another<00:01:13.240> city<00:01:13.690> that's<00:01:13.930> new<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.229> them

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
another city that's new to them

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.100 
another city that's new to them
so<00:01:15.160> they're<00:01:15.670> branching<00:01:15.910> out<00:01:16.180> exactly<00:01:16.990> so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
so they're branching out exactly so

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.910 
so they're branching out exactly so
they're<00:01:17.229> branching<00:01:17.410> out<00:01:17.560> so<00:01:17.649> we're<00:01:17.740> not<00:01:17.800> going

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
they're branching out so we're not going

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.170 
they're branching out so we're not going
to<00:01:17.979> be<00:01:18.070> in<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.190> same<00:01:18.340> location<00:01:18.789> that<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:19.000> have
