00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
 Today, the Street-Art community across Europe 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.500
 stands up against deep-water trawling which is the most destructive fishing method in history. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.990
 Member States of the European Union can adopt a law that would prohibit this method of fishing. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.990
 An event organized by BLOOM across Europe on July 14, 2014 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.990
 Deep trawling consists 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.990
 to fish with large weighted nets 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.990
 and kept open by two steel panels. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.990
 And all this plows the seabed, 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.990
 tearing everything out of his way. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.900
 One of the major problems 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.990
 is the lack of selectivity. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.090
 It has been proven that for a dozen targeted species, 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.990
 more than a hundred others are caught as bycatch. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.990
 It would be incredible if Portugal could convince 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.990
 other countries join the fight for the protection of deep oceans 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.990
 and against deep trawling. 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.990
 Italy has the opportunity 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.990
 during the Italian Presidency of the Council of European Ministers to intervene 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.990
 to unlock the deep fishing record and act for the protection of this ecosystem. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.990
 Germany played an important role 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.490
 in the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.990
 We ask the government to defend with such energy 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.990
 prohibition of fishing methods that destroy deep oceans. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.990
 Ban deep trawling now! 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.990
 Street-artists, European citizens and NGOs 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.990
 urge governments to make the right decision. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.990
 This concerns our future, 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.990
 it's at hand, 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.990
 you can not miss this opportunity. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.990
 Thus, we ask you to prohibit deep trawling. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:22.990
