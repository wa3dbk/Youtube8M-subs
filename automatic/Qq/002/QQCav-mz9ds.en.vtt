00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
 disassemble ingredients as well 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.330
 It does not need it anymore because it already 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.500
 is excluded 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.029
 what have we got here today i have today 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.020
 bought a whole chicken and wants 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.500
 to show how this works plus still 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.789
 a few wings in addition because 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.240
 not here of use 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.270
 so we do not drive on here 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.170
 Munich is the club that the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.899
 thigh 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.190
 that is the mace here we have the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.040
 wings and both of you breasts we too 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.379
 need no meat at the back 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.789
 pieces we serve today 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.629
 want to work and that's why we fall 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.410
 now first to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.239
 The first thing we do with what we do 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.079
 she is this fat one off this field 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.609
 here physically used is here as 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 First because I left so winn 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.080
 Let's cut the club off 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.060
 Let's go show that tenth already 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.570
 All right, that we only clean here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.570
 have to cut 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:18.840
 Can you see that and then we can 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.979
 Turning to the side is very important 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.780
 if you offer it to the side see here 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.619
 you already commented we almost got it 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.210
 the whole club already in it 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.509
 side and then this bone comes to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.490
 Let's see where this is 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.610
 just like that 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.829
 So that's now the Bundner Justices 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.850
 the one from the munich too 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.540
 that means that even it is so laid out 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.540
 and push it out here and shining 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.540
 right from the bone 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.259
 but the doctors are the burden 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.390
 the first piece do the same here 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:09.019
 Once again I show it here 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:17.620
 snowing off the stone next to the breast so here 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:21.140
 synonymous turn the same back to the side 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.940
 you see the bone of the 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.709
 club and there she sets the knife 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.989
 very important here the knife did not have 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.310
 not here else you can the breast 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.480
 For example , we want to hurt 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:45.140
 Not too fast here again 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:46.610
 one through the second so this is here 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.900
 the club and that is here 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.750
 thighs we could theoretically 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.690
 again by no but we know 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:01.579
 So after that we come to the wing 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:04.630
 write here in the flights are 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.160
 her bones come out again 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.459
 Above all, we do not cut important 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.130
 on bones but next to the bone 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 see the bones and snow here 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:22.040
 the bones of land we have the hearth the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.560
 first wing so currently synonymous here in 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.670
 here is the post from rings not 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.769
 try to beat in the chest 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.880
 she has to be cut again 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:40.030
 Here is the bone again 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.700
 can see here and everyone on the joint 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.740
 Videos here for weeks a bone 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.150
 and in between that is the joint and 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.990
 please do not cut in between 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.080
 broken up 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.330
 so now we already have two wings 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.060
 29 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.160
 Now we have the breast only something 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.180
 we are now taking to the breast must die 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.940
 here's the one left and right one middle 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.200
 bone a middle piece there we can 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.650
 not by long we were fast 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.900
 right and left past that is what we are called 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:17.320
 right here is the middle fast 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.820
 short in the middle and see and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:31.930
 see the little bones here 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:33.790
 Maybe this is the one here 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:40.650
 Breast bones we pass 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.650
 we have to cut a bit here 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.479
 and on the other side we do that 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.479
 also the same 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:10.899
 here are other bones then 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:14.589
 Let's get lost here for a long time now 

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:24.189
 Measure and visit us here long to 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:27.789

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:53.729
 because I do not do that easily 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.729
 which also has to be cut 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:01.689
 this must be the zeta we have here 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:04.270

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:08.319

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.639

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.830
 actually he knows a wish bones 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.120
 but because the short piece pulls as if 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.449
 I can pull it longer 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.449
