00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
to get it bang on now the middle is soft

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.980 
to get it bang on now the middle is soft
and<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:33.950> little<00:03:33.980> bit<00:03:34.460> ordinary<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.060> it's<00:03:35.840> going

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
and a little bit ordinary so it's going

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.050 
and a little bit ordinary so it's going
to<00:03:36.050> be<00:03:36.140> hinging<00:03:36.470> over<00:03:36.770> just<00:03:36.980> on<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.310> crust

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
to be hinging over just on the crust

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.390 
to be hinging over just on the crust
probably<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.540> outer<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.890> outer<00:03:39.920> one<00:03:40.220> our

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
probably the outer the outer one our

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.120 
probably the outer the outer one our
pinches<00:03:40.790> both<00:03:40.970> sides<00:03:41.300> so<00:03:41.980> it's<00:03:42.980> pretty

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
pinches both sides so it's pretty

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.300 
pinches both sides so it's pretty
important<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.640> get<00:03:43.820> this<00:03:44.000> spot<00:03:44.270> on<00:03:45.220> there<00:03:46.220> you

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
important to get this spot on there you

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.110 
important to get this spot on there you
go<00:03:46.490> that's<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.760> gap<00:03:47.000> we're<00:03:47.210> going<00:03:47.390> in<00:03:47.600> and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
go that's the gap we're going in and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.200 
go that's the gap we're going in and
this<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.180> what<00:03:50.390> open<00:03:50.690> felling<00:03:51.050> is<00:03:51.110> all<00:03:51.230> about

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
this is what open felling is all about

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.610 
this is what open felling is all about
is<00:03:53.210> she's<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.570> mongrel<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.020> cut<00:03:54.200> up<00:03:54.320> there<00:03:54.500> and

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
is she's a mongrel to cut up there and

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.590 
is she's a mongrel to cut up there and
your<00:03:54.710> skid<00:03:54.920> now<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.250> your<00:03:55.340> spikes<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:55.850> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
your skid now and your spikes and the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.690 
your skid now and your spikes and the
diameter<00:03:57.140> is<00:03:57.260> now<00:03:57.440> starting<00:03:57.860> to<00:03:57.920> taper<00:03:58.100> in<00:03:58.430> so

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
diameter is now starting to taper in so

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.640 
diameter is now starting to taper in so
everything<00:03:59.570> wants<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.780> slide<00:04:00.020> down<00:04:00.290> like<00:04:00.410> an

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
everything wants to slide down like an

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.170 
everything wants to slide down like an
inverted<00:04:00.890> funnel<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.610> more<00:04:02.000> like<00:04:02.030> a

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
inverted funnel like a more like a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.780 
inverted funnel like a more like a
funnel<00:04:02.450> like<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.690> cone<00:04:03.020> and<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:04.160> really<00:04:04.430> sucks

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
funnel like a cone and it really sucks

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.780 
funnel like a cone and it really sucks
so<00:04:05.650> my<00:04:06.650> funding<00:04:06.980> skills<00:04:07.220> are<00:04:07.370> pretty<00:04:07.460> good<00:04:07.730> and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
so my funding skills are pretty good and

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.740

another half a metre easy to make sure
it<00:04:25.550> fits<00:04:26.260> but<00:04:28.270> got<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.300> few<00:04:29.480> critics<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.080> we
