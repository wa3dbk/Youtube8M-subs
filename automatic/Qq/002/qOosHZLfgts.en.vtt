00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
get a B for me they went for a West

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.550 
get a B for me they went for a West
Coast<00:01:57.460> IPA<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.300> they<00:01:58.600> pretty<00:01:58.870> much<00:01:59.080> hit<00:01:59.410> it

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
Coast IPA and they pretty much hit it

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.469 
Coast IPA and they pretty much hit it
spot-on<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:00.430> know<00:02:00.520> it's<00:02:00.670> got<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.940> grapefruit

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
spot-on you know it's got the grapefruit

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.480 
spot-on you know it's got the grapefruit
the<00:02:01.630> citrus<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.350> dry<00:02:02.620> finish<00:02:02.950> everything

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
the citrus the dry finish everything

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.760 
the citrus the dry finish everything
there<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.180> doesn't<00:02:04.630> do<00:02:04.750> anything<00:02:04.960> special<00:02:05.440> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
there it doesn't do anything special and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.440 
there it doesn't do anything special and
I<00:02:05.800> think<00:02:06.040> that's<00:02:06.220> really<00:02:06.700> what's<00:02:06.940> keeping

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
I think that's really what's keeping

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.850 
I think that's really what's keeping
holding<00:02:07.810> him<00:02:07.900> back<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.110> little<00:02:08.350> bit<00:02:08.530> for<00:02:08.740> me

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
holding him back a little bit for me

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.980 
holding him back a little bit for me
I've<00:02:09.550> had<00:02:09.729> this<00:02:09.850> one<00:02:10.000> draft<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.570> bunch<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.959> I

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
I've had this one draft a bunch and I

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.600 
I've had this one draft a bunch and I
actually<00:02:11.110> like<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.590> lot<00:02:11.740> better<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.070> drak<00:02:12.400> I

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
actually like it a lot better on drak I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.430 
actually like it a lot better on drak I
think<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> hops<00:02:13.120> kind<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.780> hopped<00:02:14.020> more<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
think the hops kind of hopped more the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.620 
think the hops kind of hopped more the
hops<00:02:14.620> seemed<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.890> little<00:02:15.340> bit<00:02:15.430> subdued<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.209> this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
hops seemed a little bit subdued in this

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.480 
hops seemed a little bit subdued in this
bottle<00:02:17.050> it's<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> fairly<00:02:17.500> fresh<00:02:17.860> bottle<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.400> if

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
bottle it's a fairly fresh bottle so if

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.530 
bottle it's a fairly fresh bottle so if
you<00:02:18.550> can<00:02:18.670> get<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:18.970> draft<00:02:19.240> I<00:02:19.420> would

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540
