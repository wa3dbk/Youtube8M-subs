a butterfly on this gray sheet here and
I'm<00:02:11.150> going<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.480> use<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:12.470> butterfly<00:02:12.830> stencil

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
it's a little bit easier to to fit on

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.250 
it's a little bit easier to to fit on
the<00:02:24.290> table<00:02:24.560> but<00:02:25.280> when<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.690> paint<00:02:26.690> on<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.900> sheet

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.349 
a folded up pad like this because the
surface<00:02:40.100> won't<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.400> flat<00:02:40.640> enough<00:02:40.910> for<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.209> to

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
surface won't be flat enough for you to

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.210 
surface won't be flat enough for you to
get<00:02:41.540> good<00:02:41.720> results<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.470> what<00:02:42.680> I'm<00:02:42.769> gonna<00:02:42.890> do<00:02:43.069> is

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
get good results so what I'm gonna do is

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.550 
get good results so what I'm gonna do is
kind<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.459> pull<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.390> apart<00:02:44.569> here<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:45.319> I<00:02:45.350> can

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
kind of pull this apart here so I can

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.319 
kind of pull this apart here so I can
get<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:46.959> flat<00:02:47.959> area<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.220> table<00:02:49.670> here<00:02:52.329> to

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
get a flat area on the table here to

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:53.890 
get a flat area on the table here to
work<00:02:53.480> with

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
work with

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.080 
work with
okay<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.260> then<00:02:55.040> I'm<00:02:55.130> going<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.280> put<00:02:55.459> my<00:02:55.579> stencil

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
okay so then I'm going to put my stencil

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.110 
okay so then I'm going to put my stencil
down<00:02:56.209> I'm<00:02:56.420> going<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.630> get<00:02:57.400> fairly<00:02:58.400> close<00:02:58.850> to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
down I'm going to get fairly close to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.780 
down I'm going to get fairly close to
the<00:02:59.209> edge<00:02:59.420> there<00:02:59.450> and<00:03:00.380> I'm<00:03:01.100> going<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.280> use<00:03:01.489> some

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
the edge there and I'm going to use some

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.370 
the edge there and I'm going to use some
of<00:03:01.819> this<00:03:03.220> masking<00:03:04.220> tape<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.819> hold<00:03:05.780> my<00:03:05.959> stencil

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
of this masking tape to hold my stencil

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.229 
of this masking tape to hold my stencil
down<00:03:06.560> because<00:03:06.889> if<00:03:07.040> your<00:03:07.160> stencil<00:03:07.609> slides<00:03:07.970> you

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
down because if your stencil slides you

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.800 
down because if your stencil slides you
won't<00:03:08.389> get<00:03:08.540> very<00:03:08.720> good<00:03:08.870> results<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:11.030> it's

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
won't get very good results so it's

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.729 
won't get very good results so it's
gonna<00:03:11.959> tape<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.680> down<00:03:14.260> make<00:03:15.260> sure<00:03:15.440> it's<00:03:15.590> nice

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
gonna tape that down make sure it's nice

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.350 
gonna tape that down make sure it's nice
and<00:03:15.799> flat<00:03:16.340> smooth

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.590 

okay<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.380> have<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.560> taped<00:03:20.740> down<00:03:20.920> there<00:03:21.600> all

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
okay so I have it taped down there all

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.330 
okay so I have it taped down there all
right<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:23.050> I'm<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.680> use<00:03:23.920> one<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.190> these

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
right so I'm going to use one of these

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.500 
right so I'm going to use one of these
foam<00:03:25.230> pouncing<00:03:26.230> brushes<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:28.240> one<00:03:28.360> thing

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
foam pouncing brushes and the one thing

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.760 
foam pouncing brushes and the one thing
you<00:03:28.570> want<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.780> remember<00:03:28.870> when<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.350> use<00:03:29.530> these

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
you want to remember when you use these

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.550 
you want to remember when you use these
if<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.460> are<00:03:30.490> doing<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.810> number<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.470> different

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
if you are doing a number of different

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.980 
if you are doing a number of different
colors<00:03:33.190> don't<00:03:34.000> use<00:03:34.210> them<00:03:34.420> again<00:03:34.660> when<00:03:34.810> they're

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
colors don't use them again when they're

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.720 
colors don't use them again when they're
wet<00:03:35.290> because<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:36.190> will<00:03:36.640> cause<00:03:36.880> your<00:03:37.210> color<00:03:37.510> to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
wet because it will cause your color to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.550 
wet because it will cause your color to
dilute<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.970> bleed<00:03:40.390> into<00:03:40.840> everything<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.470> it

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
dilute and bleed into everything and it

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.230 
dilute and bleed into everything and it
might<00:03:41.710> seep<00:03:42.010> out<00:03:42.160> underneath<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.610> edges<00:03:43.090> of

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
might seep out underneath the edges of

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.120 
might seep out underneath the edges of
your<00:03:43.270> stencil<00:03:44.110> so<00:03:44.890> I'm<00:03:45.250> going<00:03:45.490> to<00:03:45.550> start<00:03:45.970> with

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
your stencil so I'm going to start with

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.560 
your stencil so I'm going to start with
the<00:03:48.130> basic<00:03:48.520> color<00:03:48.700> I'm<00:03:48.850> going<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.060> lay<00:03:49.150> down<00:03:49.180> is

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
the basic color I'm going to lay down is

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.680 
the basic color I'm going to lay down is
going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.780> be<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:50.670> pink<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:52.420> I'm<00:03:52.480> just<00:03:52.600> gonna

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
going to be this pink so I'm just gonna

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.000 
going to be this pink so I'm just gonna
pounce<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.230> in<00:03:53.350> there<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.560> get<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.800> good<00:03:53.950> and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
pounce it in there and get it good and

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.880 
pounce it in there and get it good and
loaded<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:55.330> want<00:03:55.540> your<00:03:55.690> paint<00:03:55.990> you<00:03:56.770> want

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
loaded and you want your paint you want

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.980 
loaded and you want your paint you want
this<00:03:57.070> nice<00:03:57.280> thick<00:03:57.700> texture<00:03:58.240> here<00:03:58.540> because<00:03:58.840> if

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
this nice thick texture here because if

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.470 
this nice thick texture here because if
it's<00:03:59.140> thin<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.470> runny<00:03:59.740> it's<00:04:00.130> going<00:04:00.490> to<00:04:00.700> seep

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
it's thin and runny it's going to seep

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.940 
it's thin and runny it's going to seep
under<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.840> edges<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.270> then<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:04.740> dab<00:04:05.740> off

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
under the edges so and then you dab off

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.860 
under the edges so and then you dab off
a<00:04:05.980> little<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.280> excess<00:04:06.880> there<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.690> you

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
a little the excess there so that you

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.820 
a little the excess there so that you
are<00:04:08.170> don't<00:04:08.860> have<00:04:09.120> too<00:04:10.120> much<00:04:10.530> that's<00:04:11.530> not<00:04:11.709> too

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
are don't have too much that's not too

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.949 
are don't have too much that's not too
goopy<00:04:12.250> okay<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.030> then<00:04:13.300> all<00:04:13.450> I'm<00:04:13.570> going<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.780> do

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
goopy okay so then all I'm going to do

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.680 
goopy okay so then all I'm going to do
is<00:04:14.700> make<00:04:15.700> sure<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.910> don't<00:04:16.000> go<00:04:16.239> over<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:16.510> edge

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
is make sure I don't go over the edge

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:27.000 
is make sure I don't go over the edge
there<00:04:20.370> pounce<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.609> down<00:04:21.760> on<00:04:22.000> there<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:26.919> want

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010

to<00:04:27.130> go<00:04:27.280> as<00:04:27.550> straight<00:04:28.030> up<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.690> down<00:04:28.930> as<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.530> can

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.909

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
so the next thing I'm going to do is

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.950 
so the next thing I'm going to do is
take<00:04:52.410> my<00:04:52.730> dark<00:04:53.730> pink<00:04:54.030> here<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.420> load<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.750> up<00:04:54.840> on

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
take my dark pink here and load it up on

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.560 
take my dark pink here and load it up on
my<00:04:55.080> brush<00:04:58.010> make<00:04:59.010> sure<00:04:59.040> it's<00:04:59.370> not<00:04:59.520> and<00:05:00.090> then<00:05:00.330> I'm

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
my brush make sure it's not and then I'm

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.210 
my brush make sure it's not and then I'm
going<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.840> basically<00:05:01.350> go<00:05:01.590> around<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:02.100> whole

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
going to basically go around the whole

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.110 
going to basically go around the whole
outside<00:05:02.940> here<00:05:06.140> just<00:05:07.140> adding<00:05:07.590> kind<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.920> a

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120
