00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.419
 and finally the fifth position of the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.419
 sun value scale 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.820
 the fifth position of the greater cove 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 begins at the sixth grade of the scale 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.480
 in the case of the sun shade in the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.140
 do also then we put the finger 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.140
 one in the min 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.320
 13 in 41 34 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.860
 13 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.700
 4 open 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.900
 a semitone is not 134 is not alpha 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.900
 natural alpha sharp 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.720
 13 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:56.770
 124 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:01:04.500
 1 and 34 again 13 41 41 35 if 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.500
 wants 13 14 13 4 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.560
 that step has had and is also here 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.390
 this is what would be a -1 in the third 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.390
 rope could use this fingering 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.100
 Y 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.100
 yes 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.610
 but according to my criteria it can be very 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.220
 debatable 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.710
 It is much more comfortable to open a finger than 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.150
 to move the hand to move the hand 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.160
 It forces me to rethink all my 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.170
 fingerings instead opened from is not 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.510
 an annoyance in one alone in one 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.510
 I make it complete 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 Y 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.620
 as touching you as the sharpest note of 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.470
 each rope that is between 12 could 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.790
 transport the ropes to the air the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.790
 Sun position will keep me 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.330
 to me
