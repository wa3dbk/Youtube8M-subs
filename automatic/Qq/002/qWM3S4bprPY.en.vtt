pikachu<00:01:11.040> i<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.510> or<00:01:12.720> three<00:01:13.049> Rotom<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
pikachu i think two or three Rotom I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.880 
pikachu i think two or three Rotom I
think<00:01:14.130> too<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.240> had<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> guess<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.650> think

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
think too if I had to guess and I think

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
think too if I had to guess and I think
about<00:01:16.979> three<00:01:17.369> level<00:01:17.640> X's<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.060> average<00:01:18.390> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
about three level X's on average so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.109 
about three level X's on average so
about<00:01:19.439> six<00:01:19.830> hits<00:01:20.070> per<00:01:20.250> box<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.790> guess<00:01:21.000> we

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
about six hits per box so I guess we

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.240 
about six hits per box so I guess we
have<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> 16<00:01:21.689> chance<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.560> finding

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
