00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello youtuber cyber tour welcome in 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.650
 this brand new survey video 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.839
 investigation of what there is to talk about 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.750
 fucking dragon kids don't 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.880
 going out then let's see if we can do some 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.850
 reasoning about why it is not 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.490
 released so far because in fact it was 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.769
 a dlc announced for mid-June 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 and who like me maybe follow forums like 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.070
 reddit etc. 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.960
 he knows that those dates were good or bad 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.700
 Pope normally comes when speaking 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 su reddit these topics you can 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.450
 miss 3 4 days ten days 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.280
 in short, it has always been like this today 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 contributive something successful 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.030
 different in the sense that at present it does not 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.000
 we still know when it will be launched 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.800
 dlc if you go to origin anyway in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.660
 somehow you can figure it out 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 announced for July 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.600
 the problem is that there is no one written 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.770
 date 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.230
 obviously if you go to the calendar 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.140
 premium idem you know it will be launched 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.780
 in summer but you don't know what day 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.150
 precisely and some of us start at 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.729
 be who a little bored with what those 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.100
 annoyed who can't wait for it to come out e 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.750
 a little dangerous because maybe so 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.210
 there will be a total shit and then 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.310
 there will be total disappointment but me 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.350
 I prefer to think positively I think that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.369
 will be one of the dlc that I will like the most 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.590
 of bf 4 so to nose because a game that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.240
 on vehicles it didn't convince me more than 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.920
 so much warmer in regards to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.409
 balancing reasons example on 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.790
 golmud always the same old story after you 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.920
 nine months from the release of the game you can 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.479
 show tar helicopters enemies from yours 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.600
 base with anti-aircraft was there because in 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.430
 bf3 this never happened to a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320
 to witness the real problems that there are 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.000
 I'm behind bs4 so with tremors that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.490
 with some maps I reduced a little 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.040
 I hope that the gamplay is actually done 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.040
 etc 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.020
 is a bit changed to bs 4 from bf3 e 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.330
 honestly I like it in the sense when 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.710
 turn a corner the soldier movement a 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.840
 a little more fluid 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.340
 in short, there's this picking thing 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.920
 you may have noticed the videos I have 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.290
 played much less on off-road vehicles 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.390
 f 4 that in bf 3 and I don't do it to 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.040
 party got guys was like that 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.750
 simply because as you know about 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.670
 youtube I share the way I do 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.890
 enjoy on battlefield otherwise 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.420
 I would definitely also play other games 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.910
 that would take many written so much 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.350
 visibility but it doesn't make sense this is the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.670
 my passion grows together with buy ed 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.250
 that's why we grew up like that 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.650
 well up until now then removing a 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.120
 moment putting things aside i 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.550
 the problems of menstruation via f 4 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.560
 let's talk about tremon because precisely 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.840
 we know what kind of saying it seems to be 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.790
 something a little more klos porter 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.570
 but not to the cloche porter of bf3 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.730
 in short, the size maps of 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.250
 beck maps buy two more or less ie 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.170
 similar size stuff a little smaller 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.300
 of the harden map something 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.070
 fun should jump out of 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.030
 these dlc do not know anything yet e 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.550
 then 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.030
 I wanted to start with my theories from 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.730
 conspiracy conspiracy yes boys well 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.650
 if you think about it it was announced 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.989
 the public reaction is hardline 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.180
 especially fun who has 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.650
 played the beta said fun though 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.600
 with bf 4 it has nothing to do rightly 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.100
 one spin off there will be vehicles there 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.480
 are the equivalents for each vehicle 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.299
 example is as obvious as the jeep in a 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.860
 let's say armored is that in hard rain 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.680
 exactly what the tanque per 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.120
 battlefield the scout helicopter become 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.830
 an attack helicopter that drives you in 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.360
 two so the balance and always 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.299
 girls bacteria always that game there 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.500
 but obviously the setting could 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.810
 bring out some people who 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.120
 prefers modern warfare prefers 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.040
 the environment of war and does not want to hear 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.170
 talk about more fun stories like 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.519
 criminals against cops I'm not 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.010
 of this idea but obviously respect 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.900
 who does not like the game because it is 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.930
 totally their rights and do well to 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.629
 don't buy it if you do n't like it 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.810
 they know it they know some 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.549
 will stop playing beat titles 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.129
 for a year because they don't like that 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.329
 title and therefore these will remain here 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.599
 play abf 4 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.790
 now it is only the delay of the severing 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.579
 von teese is something to take 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.410
 time and give more life bf 4 let's try 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.150
 understand us on the municipality of test inverun mensun 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.500
 changing so many things as you kept them in 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.410
 varies that game environment where 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.960
 the premium on pc can go for it 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.599
 beta beta testers and they're changing 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.639
 a lot of things now the opting sway 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.710
 you have the red cross inside the 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.720
 viewfinder that tells you exactly where 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.610
 go the shots before it was punctured and 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.440
 fact is as if the rifle bent over 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.630
 45 degrees because the priest ends with one 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.000
 part millionaire from the other as you know 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.400
 it is a solid body that is solid to the barrel 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.080
 of the rifle and then where it aims at the rifle 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.120
 vanni shots 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.289
 this was a big change one 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.320
 great best at who's playing 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.240
 now ctm can confirm it to me 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.160
 netcode has improved in part sta 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.150
 continuing to improve on the ctl 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.550
 game modes like rush stand 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.170
 they are under balance so they come 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.090
 improve every day 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.120
 these changes are not yet in place 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.040
 b f 4 vanilla ie in the original game 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.390
 obviously they will be inserted but if me 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.980
 delay a little dragon tiff e 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.080
 I'll probably be able to get out 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.360
 by the accounts with the improvements of the ct is 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.210
 so therefore more people will like bs4 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.400
 more people may be involved in 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.900
 buy of f4 especially knowing that 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.940
 there will be no one flying 5 next 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.590
 year but there will be a hardware battlefield 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.090
 so this could be a game 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.040
 that could continue its sales 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.780
 next year so much to repair 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.880
 a bit that initial hole he made 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.740
 with the enormous disappointment we could 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.900
 be a lot of people that will quit 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.150
 playing abf trains will be playing abf 4 from 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.220
 next September you know there 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.410
 they may even be sick 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.860
 example imagine if it comes out 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.380
 the other in prison I went to 5 euros 10 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.170
 euro we give you another dlc with six maps 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.060
 etc. maybe a little discounted price 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.080
 to apologize to the electron community 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.210
 cards so you never will 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.400
 with all respect and my trust 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.320
 they are bought but they are all things 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.500
 in short, so pour parler could always 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.880
 in short, let's imagine we f4 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.260
 go on for another year 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.330
 I think it will live together 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.860
 quietly with arden because vi 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.040
 we did see with carmen like a 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.690
 abc level of the fps is different then the 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.520
 game menu interfaces and so on 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.310
 they will remember you a lot behind 4 ma 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.110
 I mean, he could always keep himself 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.650
 two titles in parallel and continue to 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.900
 give the support that bf 4 deserves in short 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.000
 you saw a little what you think about me 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.890
 bf 4 may last in one way or 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.470
 in the other, perhaps delaying the last ones 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.800
 two dlc for another year and above all 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.630
 how would you take it you would say 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.790
 would gladly welcome this thing or 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.980
 you would be more than the idea of mixed data 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.930
 cases we finish 10 4 then play ad 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.830
 hard in the next year 4 I don't owe it anymore 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.600
 see why hate 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.230
 tell me a little what you think below 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.730
 in the comments if the perversion 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.350
 nostradamus you liked put a 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.080
 like the video see you in the next one 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.439
 comment and vote if you want
