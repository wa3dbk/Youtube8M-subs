00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
sleep that works at a up towards the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
sleep that works at a up towards the
surface<00:01:32.460> rather<00:01:32.880> than<00:01:33.030> deeper<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> water

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
surface rather than deeper in the water

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.319

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and within a week she is much much

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.080 
and within a week she is much much
better<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:37.680> sure<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.820> what<00:01:38.970> I'm

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
better but I'm not sure so what I'm

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.539 
better but I'm not sure so what I'm
suggesting<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.770> helpful<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.310> be

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
suggesting is it's it's helpful to be

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.130 
suggesting is it's it's helpful to be
knowledgeable<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> patient<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.110> a
