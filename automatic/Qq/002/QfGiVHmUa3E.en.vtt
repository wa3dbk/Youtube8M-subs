OtterBox<00:02:34.340> kind<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.730> sounds<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.600> I'm

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
OtterBox kind of sounds like and so I'm

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.350

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
guessing this one's no different so with

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.120 
guessing this one's no different so with
this<00:02:38.390> otterbox<00:02:38.990> preserver<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.830> can<00:02:39.980> now<00:02:40.070> take

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
this otterbox preserver you can now take

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.460 
this otterbox preserver you can now take
calls<00:02:40.640> fairly<00:02:41.090> easily<00:02:41.300> but<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.960> doesn't<00:02:42.230> sound

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
calls fairly easily but it doesn't sound

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.530 
calls fairly easily but it doesn't sound
as<00:02:42.650> good<00:02:42.680> as<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.970> know<00:02:44.060> when<00:02:44.210> they<00:02:44.360> could

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
out of 5 up from 4.1 now i know that is

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.180 
out of 5 up from 4.1 now i know that is
a<00:03:02.540> minimal<00:03:02.960> increase<00:03:03.320> but<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.620> rate<00:03:03.830> against

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
a minimal increase but we rate against

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.340 
a minimal increase but we rate against
everything<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.330> this<00:03:05.660> case<00:03:05.900> performs

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
everything and so this case performs

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.440 
everything and so this case performs
very<00:03:06.560> well<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:06.890> all<00:03:07.130> other<00:03:07.310> categories<00:03:08.060> except

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
very well in all other categories except

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.940 
very well in all other categories except
for<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> handling<00:03:09.170> one<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.500> now<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.800> does<00:03:09.920> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
for the handling one and now it does a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.949 
for the handling one and now it does a
little<00:03:10.160> bit<00:03:10.370> better<00:03:10.550> all<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:11.480> all<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.810> a

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
little bit better all in all this is a

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.960 
little bit better all in all this is a
