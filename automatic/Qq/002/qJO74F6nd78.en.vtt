00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
player you know I I think it's a really

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.129 
player you know I I think it's a really
cool<00:05:44.229> suggestion<00:05:44.830> to<00:05:45.009> allow<00:05:45.399> players<00:05:45.819> to

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
cool suggestion to allow players to

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.809 
cool suggestion to allow players to

crack down on the other players and

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:51.269 
crack down on the other players and
rather<00:05:49.750> than<00:05:49.899> once<00:05:50.620> they've<00:05:50.830> got<00:05:51.009> the<00:05:51.099> cash

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
rather than once they've got the cash

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.339 
rather than once they've got the cash
they<00:05:51.490> win<00:05:51.729> make<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:52.659> an<00:05:52.779> ongoing<00:05:52.960> challenge

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
they win make it an ongoing challenge

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.950 
they win make it an ongoing challenge
for<00:05:53.830> them<00:05:53.889> to<00:05:54.069> keep<00:05:54.279> that<00:05:54.520> cash<00:05:54.789> and<00:05:55.029> you<00:05:55.839> know

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
for them to keep that cash and you know

that's<00:06:59.560> fine<00:06:59.650> surely<00:07:00.280> so<00:07:00.880> I<00:07:01.240> think<00:07:01.810> they've

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
that's fine surely so I think they've

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.870 
that's fine surely so I think they've
got<00:07:02.560> the<00:07:02.650> wrong<00:07:02.830> attitude<00:07:03.040> I<00:07:03.520> think<00:07:03.790> they

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
got the wrong attitude I think they

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.240 
got the wrong attitude I think they

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
should develop tools for players who are

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.880 
should develop tools for players who are
