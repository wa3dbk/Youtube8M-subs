a keeper soft we received a few

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.190 
a keeper soft we received a few
questions<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.559> whether<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.070> glove<00:00:11.429> glue

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
questions on whether the glove glue

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.470 
questions on whether the glove glue
prepare<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.469> washes<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.309> need<00:00:14.549> work<00:00:14.790> so

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
prepare and washes and I need work so

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.180 
prepare and washes and I need work so
we're<00:00:15.630> here<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.139> explain<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.740> little<00:00:16.949> bit<00:00:17.130> about

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
we're here to explain a little bit about

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.849 
we're here to explain a little bit about
this<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> three<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.810> receive<00:00:19.439> from

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
this is the three that I receive from

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.810 
this is the three that I receive from
the<00:00:20.189> company<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.240> actually<00:00:21.420> use<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:23.130> sample

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the company and I actually use to sample

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.689 
the company and I actually use to sample
so<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> globe<00:00:25.289> glue<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
so this is the globe glue you have the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.700 
so this is the globe glue you have the
glove<00:00:26.939> fresh<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.109> glove<00:00:28.380> walk

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
glove fresh and you have a glove walk

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
glove fresh and you have a glove walk
and<00:00:29.010> prepare<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.789> three<00:00:30.090> part<00:00:30.390> system

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
and prepare so it's a three part system

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.959 
and prepare so it's a three part system
you<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.170> buy<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.320> individually<00:00:31.640> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.820> want

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you can buy it individually if you want

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.430 
you can buy it individually if you want
just<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.239> glove<00:00:33.450> loop<00:00:33.750> which<00:00:33.989> seems<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
just a glove loop which seems to be the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290 
just a glove loop which seems to be the
most<00:00:34.530> popular<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.219> use<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.700> but

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
most popular you can use that but

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
most popular you can use that but
getting<00:00:36.719> more<00:00:37.050> popular<00:00:37.500> especially<00:00:37.800> there<00:00:38.190> in

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
getting more popular especially there in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
getting more popular especially there in
summer<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> glove<00:00:39.450> fresh<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
summer you have the glove fresh and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.530 
summer you have the glove fresh and
there's<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.100> wash<00:00:41.250> I'm<00:00:42.090> almost<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.480> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
there's a little wash I'm almost out of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.970 
there's a little wash I'm almost out of
the<00:00:42.719> glove<00:00:42.899> watch<00:00:43.110> repair<00:00:43.620> because<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the glove watch repair because I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.440 
the glove watch repair because I
actually<00:00:44.129> use<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:44.940> goalkeeper

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
actually use this on my goalkeeper

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.709 
actually use this on my goalkeeper
gloves<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.090> add<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
gloves so what you do is you add the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.590 
gloves so what you do is you add the
glove<00:00:49.050> glue<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> gloves<00:00:50.219> prior<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> so

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
glove glue to the gloves prior to you so

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.319 
glove glue to the gloves prior to you so
maybe<00:00:52.050> during<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.129> warmup<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> field

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
maybe during your warmup you get a field

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.819 
maybe during your warmup you get a field
where<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.600> squirt<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> bunch<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> times<00:00:55.620> we'll

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
where you squirt a bunch of times we'll

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
where you squirt a bunch of times we'll
do<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.039> again<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.460> halftime<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.329> you're

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
do it again in the halftime so you're

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.290 
do it again in the halftime so you're
adding<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.230> sticky<00:00:58.710> glue<00:00:59.280> element<00:00:59.850> slick<00:01:00.090> below

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
adding a sticky glue element slick below

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.840 
adding a sticky glue element slick below
that's<00:01:00.570> water-soluble<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> does<00:01:02.219> wash<00:01:02.550> off

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that's water-soluble so it does wash off

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.450 
that's water-soluble so it does wash off
and<00:01:03.149> after<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.809> catch<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> few<00:01:04.470> times<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and after you catch it a few times the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.520 
and after you catch it a few times the
grip<00:01:05.760> gets<00:01:06.030> less<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.299> less<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.600> less<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
grip gets less and less and less so it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.260 
grip gets less and less and less so it
goes<00:01:07.680> back<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.070> whatever<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.549> latex<00:01:08.939> water

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
goes back to whatever your latex water

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
goes back to whatever your latex water
prior<00:01:09.630> doesn't<00:01:10.170> damage<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> latex<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.340> does

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
prior doesn't damage the latex it does

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.260 
prior doesn't damage the latex it does
diminish<00:01:12.750> over<00:01:13.200> time<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.490> found<00:01:14.790> by

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
diminish over time so what I found by

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.469 
diminish over time so what I found by
12:15<00:01:16.080> catches<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.430> start<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> little

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
12:15 catches you start to see a little

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
12:15 catches you start to see a little
bit<00:01:18.689> less<00:01:18.990> stickiness<00:01:19.799> which<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> fun<00:01:20.430> because

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
bit less stickiness which is fun because

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.660 
bit less stickiness which is fun because
again<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:21.869> making<00:01:22.380> 30<00:01:22.710> 40<00:01:23.159> saves<00:01:23.369> or

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
again you're not making 30 40 saves or

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
again you're not making 30 40 saves or
in-game<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:24.479> average<00:01:24.840> saves<00:01:25.110> making

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
in-game and your average saves making

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.910 
in-game and your average saves making
maybe<00:01:25.650> 20<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.880> you're<00:01:27.090> still<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> have

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
maybe 20 but you're still going to have

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
maybe 20 but you're still going to have
more<00:01:28.920> support<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.640> stickiness<00:01:30.329> than<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
more support and stickiness than you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
more support and stickiness than you
would<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.290> didn't<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
would if you didn't have it so if you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
would if you didn't have it so if you
have<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.700> glove<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.540> its<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.780> out<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
have a glove that's on its way out or a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
have a glove that's on its way out or a
little<00:01:35.490> bit<00:01:35.610> dry<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.049> used<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
little bit dry because you know used it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.289 
little bit dry because you know used it
for<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> couple<00:01:37.860> seasons<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:38.970> wash<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
for a couple seasons and then wash a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.179 
for a couple seasons and then wash a
bunch<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.780> times<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> way<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
bunch of times and this is a way to

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.219 
bunch of times and this is a way to
revitalize<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.509> bit<00:01:42.630> more<00:01:42.780> life<00:01:42.990> into

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
revitalize a little bit more life into

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.540 
revitalize a little bit more life into
the<00:01:43.470> glove<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> bring<00:01:44.100> that

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
the glove to bring that

up<00:01:54.870> for<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.200> gloves<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.370> you<00:01:56.400> spray<00:01:56.820> inside

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
up for your gloves so you spray inside

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.990 
up for your gloves so you spray inside
the<00:01:57.750> glove<00:01:58.130> all<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.250> two<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.610> three<00:01:59.790> times

let<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.480> dry<00:02:00.720> naturally<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.920> actually

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
let it dry naturally and it actually

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.790 
let it dry naturally and it actually
eats<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.000> bacteria<00:02:03.660> inside<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.470> glove<00:02:04.650> so

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
eats the bacteria inside of the glove so

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.310 
eats the bacteria inside of the glove so
this<00:02:04.950> unique<00:02:05.250> formula<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.480> makes

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
this unique formula you have it makes

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.010 
this unique formula you have it makes
the<00:02:07.500> glove<00:02:07.910> smell<00:02:08.910> less<00:02:09.240> because<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.930> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the glove smell less because of the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.570 
the glove smell less because of the
packing<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> bacteria<00:02:11.100> in<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> blow<00:02:11.400> it's

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
packing the bacteria in the blow it's

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.700 
packing the bacteria in the blow it's
not<00:02:11.670> masking<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> odor<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:13.350> know<00:02:13.470> it's

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
not masking the odor you know it's

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770 
not masking the odor you know it's
eating<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.190> bacteria<00:02:14.430> which<00:02:14.940> causes<00:02:15.300> that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
eating the bacteria which causes that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.780 
eating the bacteria which causes that
stench<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.350> smell<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.490> you're<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:17.730> to

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
don't want to wash that out so the glove

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.380 
don't want to wash that out so the glove
wash<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.230> prepared<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.459> last<00:03:11.730> piece<00:03:12.120> of

on<00:05:26.599> it<00:05:26.719> they<00:05:26.960> definitely<00:05:27.259> are<00:05:27.529> now<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:28.009> again

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
on it they definitely are now and again

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.189 
on it they definitely are now and again
what<00:05:28.400> I<00:05:28.430> would<00:05:28.520> do<00:05:28.819> is<00:05:29.120> spray<00:05:29.509> them<00:05:29.659> again<00:05:29.930> at

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
what I would do is spray them again at

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.159 
what I would do is spray them again at
half<00:05:30.589> time<00:05:31.240> so<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.300> can<00:05:32.689> go<00:05:32.810> ahead<00:05:32.900> and<00:05:33.110> go

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
half time so you can go ahead and go

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.219 
half time so you can go ahead and go
through<00:05:33.199> the<00:05:33.439> whole<00:05:33.650> game<00:05:34.839> so<00:05:35.839> if<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.050> want

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
through the whole game so if you want

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.739 
through the whole game so if you want
your<00:05:36.349> gloves<00:05:36.589> to<00:05:36.710> last<00:05:36.919> longer<00:05:37.249> or<00:05:37.669> you<00:05:38.539> have<00:05:38.719> a

your gloves to last longer or you have a

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.379 
your gloves to last longer or you have a
pair<00:05:39.650> of<00:05:39.680> cheaper<00:05:40.550> gloves<00:05:40.849> and<00:05:40.999> you<00:05:41.089> wanted<00:05:41.360> to

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
pair of cheaper gloves and you wanted to

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.149 
pair of cheaper gloves and you wanted to
have<00:05:41.599> a<00:05:41.629> little<00:05:41.960> bit<00:05:42.080> better<00:05:42.349> more<00:05:42.740> superior

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
have a little bit better more superior

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.700 
have a little bit better more superior
grip<00:05:43.550> then<00:05:43.999> you<00:05:44.089> plot<00:05:44.330> apply<00:05:44.749> the<00:05:44.810> glue<00:05:45.499> on

grip then you plot apply the glue on

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.089 
grip then you plot apply the glue on
them<00:05:46.069> it'll<00:05:46.550> make<00:05:46.729> it<00:05:46.909> last<00:05:47.120> longer<00:05:47.360> so<00:05:48.099> again

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
them it'll make it last longer so again

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.760
