well study the tape once we get it onto
the<00:01:17.800> computer<00:01:18.370> because<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.380> said<00:01:20.440> yesterday

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
the computer because as I said yesterday

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.870 
the computer because as I said yesterday
sometimes<00:01:22.120> these<00:01:22.680> objects<00:01:23.680> like<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.070> appear

sometimes these objects like to appear
after<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.450> fact<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.670> as<00:01:27.910> you<00:01:28.000> can<00:01:28.150> see

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
after the fact and as you can see

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.370 
after the fact and as you can see
