00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890

live in a store-bought cage moving on
the<00:01:25.970> main<00:01:26.210> reason<00:01:26.690> why<00:01:26.840> store-bought<00:01:27.200> cages

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
the main reason why store-bought cages

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.620 
the main reason why store-bought cages
are<00:01:27.800> so<00:01:28.190> bad<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.700> because<00:01:28.729> they're<00:01:29.420> way<00:01:29.600> too

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
are so bad is because they're way too

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.020 
are so bad is because they're way too
small<00:01:29.840> even<00:01:30.440> for<00:01:30.470> one<00:01:30.800> guinea<00:01:31.040> pig<00:01:31.250> you're<00:01:31.880> so

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
small even for one guinea pig you're so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.640 
small even for one guinea pig you're so
small<00:01:32.330> that<00:01:32.479> some<00:01:32.660> people<00:01:32.990> even<00:01:33.110> like<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.530> use

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
small that some people even like to use

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.690 
small that some people even like to use
them<00:01:33.830> as<00:01:33.950> carriers<00:01:34.400> a<00:01:36.160> couple<00:01:37.160> of<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.369> reason

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
them as carriers a couple of the reason

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.430 
them as carriers a couple of the reason
why<00:01:37.910> they're<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:38.300> bad<00:01:38.509> is<00:01:38.810> because<00:01:39.080> they're

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
why they're so bad is because they're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.980 
why they're so bad is because they're
cheaply<00:01:39.680> made<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.250> are<00:01:40.940> usually<00:01:41.180> overpriced

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
cheaply made and are usually overpriced

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.520 
cheaply made and are usually overpriced
so<00:01:43.360> now<00:01:44.360> what<00:01:44.509> I'm<00:01:44.630> going<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:45.050> is<00:01:45.290> I'm<00:01:45.500> going

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.870 
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:45.680> put<00:01:45.830> in<00:01:45.920> everything<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.460> you're<00:01:46.700> going
