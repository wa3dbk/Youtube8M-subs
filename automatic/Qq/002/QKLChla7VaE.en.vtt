four I will parry for parry six parry

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.990 
four I will parry for parry six parry
for<00:01:39.380> Perry<00:01:40.380> six<00:01:42.649> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> parry<00:01:44.130> seven<00:01:44.610> just

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
for Perry six this is a parry seven just

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.649 
for Perry six this is a parry seven just
on<00:01:45.119> my<00:01:45.270> low<00:01:45.509> line<00:01:46.159> notice<00:01:47.159> how<00:01:47.430> my<00:01:47.610> point<00:01:47.939> stays

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
on my low line notice how my point stays

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.139 
on my low line notice how my point stays
is<00:01:48.840> close<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.290> being<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:50.009> line<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.610> time

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
is close to being in on line at all time

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.969 
is close to being in on line at all time
that's<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.990> parry<00:01:52.229> eight<00:01:56.270> Perry<00:01:57.270> seven<00:01:57.979> parry

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that's a parry eight Perry seven parry

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.190 
that's a parry eight Perry seven parry
eight<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> important<00:02:00.420> part<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.079> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
eight so the important part is that you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
eight so the important part is that you
keep<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.530> economy<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> motion<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.090> keep

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
keep that economy of motion and you keep

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690 
keep that economy of motion and you keep
your<00:02:03.390> point<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.899> much<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.500> possible<00:02:04.700> pointing
