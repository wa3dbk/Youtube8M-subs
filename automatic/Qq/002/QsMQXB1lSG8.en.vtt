00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.700
 good afternoon everyone in this 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.500
 Occasion I come to bring or good them 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.720
 I come to explain a little better about the 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.370
 solution that I just posted does 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.480
 Lord of the Rings' time 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.969
 battle for the middle earth 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.369
 First, it is to verify that my system 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.369
 in which I am working in the hour 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.020
 a 64-bit operating system 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.279
 windows 7 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.110
 good the mistake we had or used to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.540
 have some of us in the system 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.970
 operative perhaps in others was this the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.340
 moment to start the game between masters 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.510
 he stayed on this screen we wait 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.510
 until the error comes out 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.080
 addicted 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 well I do not know how long I'm going to take this 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 to use the video in a while until 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.739
 appears the error and good after 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.269
 have waited about three minutes or two 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.940
 this is the error that you did not know or read 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.979
 We did not know how to go out that Mr. 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.360
 rings stopped working 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.360
 good the solution that I had them 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.540
 delivered in lie or the video was 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.180
 download this part of file that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.250
 it's in half fire 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.420
 the only thing that consisted was only in 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.380
 copy in this direction 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.580
 first we open local disk ce 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.920
 we enter users or in some 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:32.299
 machines will be with usher 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.659
 in the name of our user that 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.470
 it would be michael reid and this part is 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.700
 essential 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.799
 we will have to enter this folder 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.689
 same to silver that will be in folders 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.270
 hidden as we can see folders 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.100
 hidden we selected in organize 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.170
 View and show folder options 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.689
 Hidden files 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.390
 we enter this folder and then to 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.280
 James 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.720
 and we will have to look in this folder 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.360
 my archives of the battle for the land 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.380
 average in this part is where we have to 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.969
 copy what we just downloaded 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.909
 we will have in this folder once 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.610
 downloaded sir the friends we went in and 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.320
 we copy everything 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.320
 copy and paste 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.300
 and therefore the game should start 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.360
 without difficulties 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.800
 As I 've already taught you, I'm doing 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.770
 run the game 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.290
 windows 7 64 bits 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.010
 good to check if truly 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.010
 works 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.080
 we enter 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.860
 and as we can see the game has started 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.310
 is working is what so many 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.890
 some good this is a great game 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.290
 I like fascinates me the improvements 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.849
 in the rings and for me it's something 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.439
 exciting that the game works and how 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.379
 You will appreciate this by making it run 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.379
 in windows 7 without any problem 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.650
 so you can see this error that 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.650
 have but I think it 's because of the resolution 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:21.000
 and as we can see we can play 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.000
 no problem let's try 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.250
 a fast battle 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.500
 so they can verify 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.189
 verify that the games work 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.189
 correctly 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.970
 I hope everyone works for them I did not try 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.230
 still in windows 8 but according to 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.420
 the comments I saw that some yes 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.860
 it worked and I do not know why others do not 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.360
 they work good in this video les 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.970
 I'm showing what the steps are like 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.340
 follow and do not need to restart or anything 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.069
 because the game was just installed by me 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.560
 also professors again to butt like 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.870
 we can see the game works without any 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.519
 problem well that would be all I hope that 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.290
 solves them some who have some 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.670
 doubt and how to solve this 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.290
 problem 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.199
 it worked for me and I hope that many of 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.530
 you do not work for us until then 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.530
 God bless you
