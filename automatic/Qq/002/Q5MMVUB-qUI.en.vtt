so<00:01:38.750> let's<00:01:39.200> move<00:01:39.410> closer<00:01:39.710> let's<00:01:40.100> see

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.500 

local<00:02:16.870> news<00:02:17.019> all<00:02:17.920> right<00:02:18.010> well<00:02:21.330> that's<00:02:22.330> pretty

uneventful

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.550 

which<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.850> good<00:02:27.000> sign<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.300> guess<00:02:27.570> things<00:02:28.380> are

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
which is good sign I guess things are

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.960 
which is good sign I guess things are
getting<00:02:28.650> under<00:02:28.950> control

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.750

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
so I guess maybe off that way then is

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.370 
so I guess maybe off that way then is
where<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.600> big<00:02:37.720> fire<00:02:37.990> is<00:02:39.870> get<00:02:40.870> all<00:02:41.050> blocked
