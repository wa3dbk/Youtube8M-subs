and how I think they'll do this season
so<00:00:13.980> let's<00:00:14.160> start<00:00:14.460> now<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.210> team<00:00:15.420> that

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
so let's start now with the team that

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.779 
so let's start now with the team that
won<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:15.960> empower<00:00:16.470> championship<00:00:17.190> which<00:00:17.580> was

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789

cardiff<00:00:18.449> city<00:00:18.840> now<00:00:19.560> last<00:00:19.800> year<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.189> had<00:00:20.220> 25

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
cardiff city now last year they had 25

think they ended up winning by quite a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.290 
think they ended up winning by quite a
margin<00:00:25.199> now<00:00:26.189> they've<00:00:26.460> never<00:00:26.730> played<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.049 
think is gonna be a really great match
their<00:00:37.559> defense<00:00:38.010> carried<00:00:38.489> them<00:00:38.640> last<00:00:38.850> season

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
their defense carried them last season

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.569 
their defense carried them last season
and<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.600> only<00:00:39.750> allowed<00:00:39.989> 45<00:00:40.890> goals<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
and they only allowed 45 goals in the
championship<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> less<00:00:42.989> than<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.350> per

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
championship which is less than one per

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.680 
championship which is less than one per
match<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.730> great<00:00:44.969> record<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
match which is a really great record and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.150 
match which is a really great record and
you<00:00:46.200> know<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.500> summer<00:00:46.770> they've<00:00:46.920> made<00:00:47.129> some

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
you know this summer they've made some

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.330 
you know this summer they've made some
smart<00:00:47.640> signings<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.629> suvir's<00:00:49.620> Gary<00:00:49.950> Medel

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
smart signings like suvir's Gary Medel

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
smart signings like suvir's Gary Medel
and<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.539> shows<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.320> they're

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and so it shows that you know they're

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.049 
and so it shows that you know they're
not<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:52.920> without<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.309> fight<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.789> they

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
not going down without a fight and they

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.670 
not going down without a fight and they
also<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.449> money<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> spend<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.289> they<00:00:55.410> need<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
also have money to spend if they need to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
also have money to spend if they need to
I<00:00:56.010> think<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> Malaysian<00:00:57.149> owner<00:00:57.329> or

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I think it's a Malaysian owner or

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
I think it's a Malaysian owner or
something<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.890> yeah<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.340> could

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
something like that so yeah they could

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.069 
something like that so yeah they could
end<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.940> doing<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.329> right<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> Premier

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
end up doing all right in the Premier

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.420 
end up doing all right in the Premier
League<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.500> reckon<00:01:01.800> they'll<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> best

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
League and I reckon they'll do the best

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.030 
League and I reckon they'll do the best
out<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.030> promoter<00:01:03.390> team<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.619> could<00:01:04.860> see

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
out of the promoter team and I could see

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.310 
out of the promoter team and I could see
them<00:01:05.220> definitely<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:06.210> least<00:01:06.270> putting<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:07.049> one

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
them definitely at least putting up one

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.890 
them definitely at least putting up one
hell<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.770> fight<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.159> avoid<00:01:08.460> relegation<00:01:08.900> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
hell of a fight to avoid relegation the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960 
hell of a fight to avoid relegation the
next<00:01:10.229> team<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.619> promoted<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.520> whole

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
next team that got promoted was whole

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.539 
next team that got promoted was whole
city<00:01:12.330> who<00:01:12.630> came<00:01:12.840> second<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> championship

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
city who came second in the championship

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.660 
city who came second in the championship
with<00:01:14.549> 24<00:01:15.030> wins<00:01:15.210> seven<00:01:15.810> drawers<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.560> 15<00:01:17.159> losses

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.370 
do all right this year however I don't
think<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.030> their<00:01:33.270> defense<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.020> strong

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
think that their defense is that strong

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.370 
think that their defense is that strong
and<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.119> sure<00:01:36.540> how<00:01:37.020> many<00:01:37.229> goals

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and you know I'm not sure how many goals

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.630 
and you know I'm not sure how many goals
I'll<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.710> able<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> score<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.460> they've

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
I'll be able to score you know they've

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.340 
I'll be able to score you know they've
signed<00:01:38.820> Danny<00:01:39.119> Graham<00:01:39.450> who<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.720> don't<00:01:39.930> really

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
signed Danny Graham who I don't really

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.800 
signed Danny Graham who I don't really
rate<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> striker<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.790> honest<00:01:42.090> so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
rate as a striker all to be honest so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.569 
rate as a striker all to be honest so
yeah<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.259> worry<00:01:43.649> about<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:44.070> slightly<00:01:44.399> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
yeah I do worry about them slightly I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.420 
yeah I do worry about them slightly I
mean<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:44.939> scored<00:01:45.270> 61<00:01:45.780> goals<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.350> 46<00:01:46.950> matches

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
mean they scored 61 goals in 46 matches

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.160 
mean they scored 61 goals in 46 matches
in<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> championship<00:01:48.420> which<00:01:48.869> isn't

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
in the championship which isn't

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
in the championship which isn't
brilliant<00:01:49.500> when<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.130> about<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.340> team

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
brilliant when you think about a team

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.179 
brilliant when you think about a team
that<00:01:50.850> came<00:01:51.090> second<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:53.040> them

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
that came second so I can see them

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.700 
that came second so I can see them
getting<00:01:53.369> relegated<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:54.180> year<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.710> yeah

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
getting relegated this year and yeah

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.350 
getting relegated this year and yeah
that's<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.189> much<00:01:56.340> else<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.670> say<00:01:56.790> really<00:01:56.939> about

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that's not much else to say really about

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
that's not much else to say really about
hole<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> next<00:01:58.560> team<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.100> Crystal

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
hole and so the next team is Crystal

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.100 
hole and so the next team is Crystal
Palace<00:01:59.939> who<00:02:00.119> finished<00:02:00.450> fifth<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
Palace who finished fifth in the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.200 
Palace who finished fifth in the
championship<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.340> got<00:02:02.490> promoted<00:02:02.880> by

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
championship but then got promoted by

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.080 
championship but then got promoted by
the<00:02:03.240> playoffs<00:02:03.930> um<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:05.130> didn't<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.490> too<00:02:05.790> great

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
the playoffs um they didn't do too great

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059 
the playoffs um they didn't do too great
last<00:02:06.329> season<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.869> they<00:02:07.079> had<00:02:07.229> 15<00:02:07.770> drawers

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
last season you know they had 15 drawers

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
last season you know they had 15 drawers
which<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> huge<00:02:08.910> number<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.479> apparently

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
which is a huge number and apparently

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.720 
which is a huge number and apparently
they<00:02:10.289> had<00:02:10.440> some<00:02:10.649> difficulty<00:02:11.220> holding<00:02:11.400> onto

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
they had some difficulty holding onto

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.840 
they had some difficulty holding onto
leads<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.360> I

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
leads and I

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.070 
leads and I
think<00:02:12.970> they<00:02:13.060> might<00:02:13.090> struggle<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:13.870> year

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
think they might struggle this year

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.870 
think they might struggle this year
without<00:02:14.230> our<00:02:14.620> Zaha<00:02:15.190> who<00:02:15.400> was<00:02:15.550> their<00:02:15.700> main

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
without our Zaha who was their main

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.880 
without our Zaha who was their main
creative<00:02:16.330> outlet<00:02:16.720> last<00:02:16.930> year<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.860> be

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
creative outlet last year and to be

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.040 
creative outlet last year and to be
honest<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.430> don't<00:02:18.520> see<00:02:18.880> marijuana<00:02:19.420> shamik<00:02:19.900> as

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
honest I don't see marijuana shamik as

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.690 
honest I don't see marijuana shamik as
being<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> main<00:02:20.710> man<00:02:20.920> who's<00:02:21.220> going<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.490> score

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
being the main man who's going to score

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.890 
being the main man who's going to score
enough<00:02:21.970> goals<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.390> keep<00:02:22.540> them<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
enough goals to keep them in the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.690 
enough goals to keep them in the
premiership<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.590> season<00:02:23.950> which<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.550> why<00:02:24.670> I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
premiership this season which is why I

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.790 
premiership this season which is why I
think<00:02:24.940> they<00:02:25.240> might<00:02:25.660> well<00:02:26.140> yeah<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> think

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
think they might well yeah I think

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.830 
think they might well yeah I think
they'll<00:02:27.040> get<00:02:27.160> relegated<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.720> guess

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
they'll get relegated and so I guess

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.120 
they'll get relegated and so I guess
we'll<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.380> wait<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.530> see<00:02:29.710> how<00:02:29.950> all<00:02:30.100> of

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
we'll have to wait and see how all of

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.590 
we'll have to wait and see how all of
these<00:02:30.370> teams<00:02:30.640> do<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.210> Premier<00:02:31.570> League

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
these teams do in the Premier League

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.900 
these teams do in the Premier League
only<00:02:32.320> two<00:02:32.590> days<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.800> go<00:02:32.980> now<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.490> for

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.550 
only two days to go now and for
tomorrow's<00:02:34.270> video<00:02:34.450> I'll<00:02:34.840> try<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.230> put<00:02:35.380> out<00:02:35.530> a
