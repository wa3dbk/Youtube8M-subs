present to you our newest product or
newest<00:00:12.990> invention<00:00:13.500> which<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.799> actually

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
newest invention which is actually

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.799 
newest invention which is actually
called<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.880> fast<00:00:15.089> asleep<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.630> that

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
called this fast asleep so that

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.900 
called this fast asleep so that
essentially<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.800> concept<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.369> us<00:00:17.550> fastest

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
essentially is the concept of us fastest

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.450 
essentially is the concept of us fastest
way<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.630> idea<00:00:18.660> was<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.560> need<00:00:19.710> at<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
way and the idea was that we need at a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.609 
way and the idea was that we need at a
point<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.210> care<00:00:21.390> Diagnostics<00:00:21.420> which<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.439> what

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
point of care Diagnostics which is what

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.099 
point of care Diagnostics which is what
radium<00:00:23.490> has<00:00:23.730> needs<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.150> what<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.449> wanted<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> do

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
radium has needs so what we wanted to do

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.740 
radium has needs so what we wanted to do
was<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.830> interface<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> bunch<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.029> diagnostic

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
was to interface a bunch of diagnostic

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.339 
was to interface a bunch of diagnostic
tests<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:29.010> well<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.220> sensors<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:30.630> an<00:00:30.929> Android

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
tests as well as sensors with an Android

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
tests as well as sensors with an Android
tablet<00:00:31.560> an<00:00:31.920> affordable<00:00:32.460> Android<00:00:32.880> tablet<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
tablet an affordable Android tablet is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.660 
tablet an affordable Android tablet is
an<00:00:33.690> affordable<00:00:33.960> Android<00:00:34.530> phone<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.550> would

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
an affordable Android phone so we would

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.310 
an affordable Android phone so we would
actually<00:00:35.790> show<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:37.260> things

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
actually show that these things

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
actually show that these things
connecting<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> automatically<00:00:38.730> captured

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
connecting the automatically captured

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
connecting the automatically captured
into<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> tablet<00:00:39.989> put<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> central

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
into the tablet put on to a central

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
into the tablet put on to a central
database<00:00:41.550> where<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.329> actually<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:42.809> go

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
database where we can actually then go

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.959 
database where we can actually then go
ahead<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> enable<00:00:44.280> their<00:00:44.610> healthcare

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
ahead and enable their healthcare

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.779 
ahead and enable their healthcare
workers<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.780> record<00:00:46.500> data<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.670> an

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
workers to record data very in an

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.729 
workers to record data very in an
automated<00:00:48.120> fashion<00:00:48.300> anymore<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.170> doctors<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
automated fashion anymore the doctors to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
automated fashion anymore the doctors to
be<00:00:49.860> able<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.129> see<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> supervise<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.480> as

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
be able to see this and supervise it as

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.740 
be able to see this and supervise it as
well<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.140> enable<00:00:52.500> public<00:00:52.860> health<00:00:53.750> researchers

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
well as enable public health researchers

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.080 
well as enable public health researchers
with<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:55.199> their<00:00:55.440> needs<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.250> epidemiology

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
with all their needs for epidemiology

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.029 
with all their needs for epidemiology
and<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> essentially<00:00:58.859> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and so on so what this is essentially is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.520 
and so on so what this is essentially is
it<00:00:59.219> enables<00:00:59.670> us<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> capture<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.660> data<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.379> an

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it enables us to capture the data in an

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.950 
it enables us to capture the data in an
automated<00:01:01.829> form<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> essentially<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
automated form this is essentially the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
automated form this is essentially the
mode<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.320> haven't<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:04.769> covered<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.430> just

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
mode we haven't actually covered it just

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.550 
mode we haven't actually covered it just
so<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.869> actually<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.320> what's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
so that you can actually see what's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.620 
so that you can actually see what's
going<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.369> got<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> Bluetooth<00:01:09.030> sensor<00:01:09.450> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
going on it's got a Bluetooth sensor so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
going on it's got a Bluetooth sensor so
there's<00:01:09.780> actually<00:01:09.869> no<00:01:10.200> wire<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.740> goes<00:01:10.799> from

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
there's actually no wire that goes from

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.300 
there's actually no wire that goes from
the<00:01:11.909> board<00:01:12.150> into<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.990> tablet<00:01:13.560> but

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the board into the tablet but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.770 
the board into the tablet but
essentially<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.240> does<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
essentially what this does do is it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.050 
essentially what this does do is it
looks<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.350> four<00:01:16.830> things<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.310> there's<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
looks at four things right now there's a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.609 
looks at four things right now there's a
temperature<00:01:18.479> sensor<00:01:18.869> which<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.200> essentially

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
temperature sensor which is essentially

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
temperature sensor which is essentially
right<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.159> we've<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.240> water<00:01:21.509> quality

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
right here we've got a water quality

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
right here we've got a water quality
meter<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.799> plugs<00:01:23.040> into<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:24.000> there

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
meter that it plugs into right there

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.090 
meter that it plugs into right there
this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.810> our<00:01:24.960> heart<00:01:25.200> rate<00:01:25.409> sensor<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> again

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this is our heart rate sensor and again

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
this is our heart rate sensor and again
we<00:01:26.250> cover<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
we cover all of this up in this and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.870 
we cover all of this up in this and
these<00:01:28.020> are<00:01:28.170> our<00:01:28.290> four<00:01:28.560> lead<00:01:28.799> ECG<00:01:29.430> wanted<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
these are our four lead ECG wanted to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.179 
these are our four lead ECG wanted to
test<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> enables<00:01:31.950> us<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
test this out because it enables us to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.490 
test this out because it enables us to
really<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> sense<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:33.960> data<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
really get a sense of how much data it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
really get a sense of how much data it
can<00:01:34.740> handle<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.280> where<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.150> go

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
can handle and where it can actually go

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.660 
can handle and where it can actually go
there<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.590> examples<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> three<00:01:38.460> different

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
there is examples of three different

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.149 
there is examples of three different
kinds<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.299> Android<00:01:40.110> platform<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.009> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
kinds of Android platform that this is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.550 
kinds of Android platform that this is

move this to part per million and you
can<00:02:36.090> see<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.329> automatically<00:02:36.810> records<00:02:37.379> one<00:02:37.829> of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
can see it automatically records one of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.709 
can see it automatically records one of
the<00:02:38.010> parts<00:02:38.280> per<00:02:38.340> million<00:02:38.639> in<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.510> water

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
the parts per million in the water

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.659 
the parts per million in the water
quality<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.469> again<00:02:40.709> let's<00:02:41.250> put<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.549> in

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:41.669 
quality and again let's put it in

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.940 
quality and again let's put it in
another<00:02:41.970> kind<00:02:42.599> of<00:02:42.689> water<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.560> you'll<00:02:43.709> be<00:02:43.859> able

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
another kind of water and you'll be able

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.280 
another kind of water and you'll be able
to<00:02:44.159> see<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> big<00:02:44.639> difference<00:02:44.879> in<00:02:45.659> terms<00:02:46.079> of<00:02:46.230> how

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
to see a big difference in terms of how

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.990 
to see a big difference in terms of how
they're<00:02:46.620> actually<00:02:46.980> goes<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.879> can

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
they're actually goes and so you can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.399 
they're actually goes and so you can
actually<00:02:48.150> go<00:02:48.389> ahead<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.629> see<00:02:48.870> how<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.169> moves

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
actually go ahead and see how it moves

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.909 
actually go ahead and see how it moves
on<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.950> moves<00:02:50.459> further<00:02:50.989> we've<00:02:51.989> got<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.739> water

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
on and moves further we've got the water

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.530 
on and moves further we've got the water
quality<00:02:53.189> into<00:02:53.669> the<00:02:53.700> system<00:02:54.090> let's<00:02:54.299> take<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
quality into the system let's take a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.839 
quality into the system let's take a
look<00:02:54.689> at<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> heart<00:02:55.139> rate<00:02:55.379> what<00:02:56.280> I'll<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:56.579> is<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
look at the heart rate what I'll do is I

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.209 
look at the heart rate what I'll do is I
just<00:02:57.060> go<00:02:57.239> ahead<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.510> put<00:02:57.659> my<00:02:57.810> finger<00:02:57.870> into<00:02:58.290> it

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
just go ahead and put my finger into it

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.069 
just go ahead and put my finger into it
and<00:02:59.459> you'll<00:02:59.609> see<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.060> little<00:03:00.209> green<00:03:00.450> light<00:03:00.810> on

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
and you'll see the little green light on

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.199 
and you'll see the little green light on
it<00:03:01.379> going<00:03:01.650> through<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:02.370> after<00:03:02.519> around<00:03:03.030> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
it going through and after around a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.690 
it going through and after around a
minute<00:03:03.510> or<00:03:03.659> so<00:03:03.840> exactly<00:03:04.260> went<00:03:05.219> ahead<00:03:05.400> and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
minute or so exactly went ahead and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.280 
minute or so exactly went ahead and
average<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.329> thing<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.689> you'll<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.930> able<00:03:07.049> to

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.879 
actually allowing us to do that level of
thing<00:03:18.930> let's<00:03:19.379> take<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.560> look<00:03:19.709> at<00:03:19.799> the

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
thing let's take a look at the

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.469 
thing let's take a look at the
temperature<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.790> night<00:03:20.970> rest<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.329> back

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
temperature you night rest the back

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.300 
temperature you night rest the back
button<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.409> I<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.530> go<00:03:22.799> ahead<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:23.099> do<00:03:23.190> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
button and I can go ahead and do the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.099 
button and I can go ahead and do the
temperature<00:03:23.849> here<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.449> you<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.720> see<00:03:24.870> as<00:03:24.989> I

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
temperature here and you can see as I

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.839 
temperature here and you can see as I
hold<00:03:25.409> it<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:26.099> temperature<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.729> actually

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
hold it the temperature is actually

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.629 
hold it the temperature is actually
changing<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.829> calibrating<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:29.010> what<00:03:29.519> it

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
changing and calibrating to what it

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.420 
changing and calibrating to what it
should<00:03:29.879> be<00:03:29.909> which<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.359> 98.5<00:03:31.319> so<00:03:31.919> we've<00:03:32.069> got<00:03:32.280> all

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
should be which is 98.5 so we've got all

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.360 
should be which is 98.5 so we've got all
those<00:03:32.639> things<00:03:32.970> already<00:03:33.209> working<00:03:34.069> let<00:03:35.069> me<00:03:35.189> hide

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
those things already working let me hide

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.270 
those things already working let me hide
this<00:03:35.669> and<00:03:36.409> then<00:03:37.409> let's<00:03:37.620> actually<00:03:37.769> look<00:03:37.919> at<00:03:38.129> the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
this and then let's actually look at the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.759 
this and then let's actually look at the
ECG<00:03:38.729> which<00:03:39.209> will<00:03:39.389> just<00:03:39.569> require<00:03:39.689> me<00:03:40.169> to<00:03:40.199> put<00:03:40.650> on

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
ECG which will just require me to put on

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.589 
ECG which will just require me to put on
these<00:03:40.949> leads<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.699> I'll<00:03:41.819> go<00:03:42.000> ahead<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.269> do<00:03:42.419> that

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
these leads so I'll go ahead and do that

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.929 
these leads so I'll go ahead and do that
I've<00:03:43.109> already<00:03:43.259> put<00:03:43.409> the<00:03:43.799> electrodes<00:03:44.759> on

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
I've already put the electrodes on

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.210 
I've already put the electrodes on
myself<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.720> should<00:03:45.870> allow<00:03:46.109> us<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.319> do<00:03:47.009> that

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
myself that should allow us to do that

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.050 
myself that should allow us to do that
so<00:03:47.430> there's<00:03:47.609> my<00:03:47.790> right<00:03:48.000> arm<00:03:49.699> there's<00:03:50.699> my<00:03:50.849> left

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
so there's my right arm there's my left

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.240 
so there's my right arm there's my left
leg<00:03:51.739> I'm<00:03:52.739> gonna<00:03:52.919> put<00:03:53.129> that<00:03:53.280> onto<00:03:53.489> my<00:03:53.669> left<00:03:54.000> leg

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
leg I'm gonna put that onto my left leg

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.539 
leg I'm gonna put that onto my left leg
right<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.729> then<00:03:56.939> here's<00:03:57.239> my<00:03:59.479> right<00:04:00.479> leg<00:04:01.549> I'm

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
right and then here's my right leg I'm

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.670 
right and then here's my right leg I'm
gonna<00:04:02.669> put<00:04:02.819> that<00:04:02.939> onto<00:04:03.120> my<00:04:03.239> right<00:04:03.509> leg<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:04.530> I've

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
gonna put that onto my right leg so I've

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.339 
gonna put that onto my right leg so I've
got<00:04:04.859> all<00:04:04.979> these<00:04:05.159> in<00:04:05.489> place<00:04:06.030> then<00:04:06.989> we<00:04:07.079> turn<00:04:07.319> the

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
got all these in place then we turn the

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.030 
got all these in place then we turn the
ACG<00:04:08.009> on<00:04:08.189> and<00:04:08.569> there<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.599> go<00:04:09.959> with<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.859> lead

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
ACG on and there you go with the lead

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.460 
ACG on and there you go with the lead
three<00:04:11.430> here's<00:04:12.150> my<00:04:12.299> deed<00:04:12.509> one<00:04:12.750> not<00:04:13.349> I'll

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
three here's my deed one not I'll

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.349 
three here's my deed one not I'll
actually<00:04:13.620> give<00:04:13.979> you<00:04:14.129> the<00:04:14.699> value<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.209> can

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
actually give you the value so you can

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.269 
actually give you the value so you can
see<00:04:15.540> it's<00:04:15.689> actually<00:04:15.840> handling<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.620> lot<00:04:16.889> of<00:04:16.919> data

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:17.279 
see it's actually handling a lot of data

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.800 
see it's actually handling a lot of data
and<00:04:17.820> if<00:04:17.969> you<00:04:18.029> can<00:04:18.150> see<00:04:18.239> if<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.450> actually<00:04:18.570> go

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and if you can see if you actually go

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.269 
and if you can see if you actually go
ahead<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.139> put<00:04:19.289> my<00:04:19.320> feet<00:04:19.680> down<00:04:19.709> you'll<00:04:20.099> see<00:04:20.250> a

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:20.279 
ahead and put my feet down you'll see a

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.949 
ahead and put my feet down you'll see a
little<00:04:20.459> change<00:04:20.849> in<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.599> way<00:04:21.719> it's<00:04:21.840> done

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
little change in the way it's done

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.400 
little change in the way it's done
because<00:04:22.229> it's

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
because it's

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.160 
because it's
grounding<00:04:22.890> as<00:04:23.250> my<00:04:23.430> lead<00:04:23.640> -<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.750> can<00:04:24.990> see

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
grounding as my lead - so you can see

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.660 
grounding as my lead - so you can see
that<00:04:25.380> exactly<00:04:25.680> able<00:04:25.980> to<00:04:26.070> capture<00:04:26.280> high

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
that exactly able to capture high

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.910 
that exactly able to capture high
volumes<00:04:27.150> of<00:04:27.330> data<00:04:27.480> through<00:04:28.230> this<00:04:28.440> particular

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
volumes of data through this particular

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.150 
volumes of data through this particular
system<00:04:29.100> that<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.020> sense<00:04:31.350> is<00:04:31.590> what<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.860> is

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
system that in a sense is what it is

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.620 
system that in a sense is what it is
once<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.640> actually<00:04:32.790> go<00:04:33.060> ahead<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.240> disconnect

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
once I actually go ahead and disconnect

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.840 
once I actually go ahead and disconnect
this<00:04:33.930> system<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.770> will<00:04:34.950> actually<00:04:35.070> upload<00:04:35.670> all

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
this system it will actually upload all

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.050 
this system it will actually upload all
the<00:04:36.000> data<00:04:36.210> on<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:37.050> our<00:04:37.530> server<00:04:37.950> that<00:04:38.580> allows<00:04:38.880> us

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
the data on to our server that allows us

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.760 
the data on to our server that allows us
to<00:04:39.210> do<00:04:39.330> this<00:04:39.510> again<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.900> works<00:04:40.140> with<00:04:40.560> this

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
to do this again it works with this

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.010 
to do this again it works with this
particular<00:04:41.310> device<00:04:41.430> works<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:42.540> this<00:04:42.720> device

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
particular device works with this device

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.770 
particular device works with this device
it<00:04:43.260> even<00:04:43.500> works<00:04:44.630> theoretically<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:45.720> should

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
it even works theoretically it should

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.590 
it even works theoretically it should
work<00:04:45.990> with<00:04:46.170> our<00:04:46.350> cache<00:04:46.590> because<00:04:46.980> we<00:04:47.100> know<00:04:47.250> that

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
work with our cache because we know that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.990 
work with our cache because we know that
it<00:04:48.600> works<00:04:48.990> on<00:04:49.110> Android<00:04:49.320> 2.2<00:04:49.980> so<00:04:50.610> that's<00:04:50.790> not<00:04:50.940> a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
it works on Android 2.2 so that's not a

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.670 
it works on Android 2.2 so that's not a
little<00:04:51.210> thing<00:04:51.390> to<00:04:51.600> empower<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.260> health<00:04:52.470> care

little thing to empower the health care

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.680 
little thing to empower the health care
workers<00:04:53.070> so<00:04:53.550> they<00:04:53.670> can<00:04:53.820> carry<00:04:54.060> this<00:04:54.330> device

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
workers so they can carry this device

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.080 
workers so they can carry this device
