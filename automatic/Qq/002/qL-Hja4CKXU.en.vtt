00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so the Marines will spawn here and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.240 
so the Marines will spawn here and
there's<00:00:37.860> an<00:00:38.010> old<00:00:38.100> ship<00:00:38.370> over<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:40.100> let's<00:00:41.100> go

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
there's an old ship over there let's go

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.810 
there's an old ship over there let's go
here<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:43.559> first<00:00:43.800> thing<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.070> done<00:00:44.280> was

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
here the first thing I done was

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.139 
here the first thing I done was
basically<00:00:45.480> oh<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.719> spawn<00:00:49.879> these<00:00:50.879> little

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
basically oh so you spawn these little

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.170 
basically oh so you spawn these little
things<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.930> custom-made<00:00:52.500> drop<00:00:52.800> pods<00:00:53.180> so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
things here are custom-made drop pods so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.650 
things here are custom-made drop pods so
stand<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> goes<00:00:58.710> down<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.210> should

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
stand on and it goes down and you should

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.510 
stand on and it goes down and you should
survive<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> fall<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.829> obviously<00:01:02.039> I'm<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
survive the fall but obviously I'm a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
survive the fall but obviously I'm a
panda<00:01:02.820> trade<00:01:03.120> zone<00:01:03.390> because<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.110> might

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
panda trade zone because you might

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.160 
panda trade zone because you might
survive<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> fall<00:01:05.060> over<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.900> ladder

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
survive the fall over here is a ladder

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.340 
survive the fall over here is a ladder
platform<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> I've<00:01:08.970> got<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> those

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
platform so I've got a one of those

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.760 
platform so I've got a one of those
ships<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.860> repair<00:01:12.049> what<00:01:13.049> looks<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.530> actually

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ships and repair what looks it actually

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.700 
ships and repair what looks it actually
looks<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.280> nice<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> lights<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.759> all

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.810 

this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.070> looks<00:01:23.219> like<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.820> far<00:01:24.380> I'm

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
this is what it looks like so far I'm

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.490 
this is what it looks like so far I'm
probably<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> make<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.960> going

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
probably going to make it so it's going

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.889 
probably going to make it so it's going
to<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.619> used<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.460> flood<00:01:29.729> artists<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.689> crane

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
to be used to flood artists a crane

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.749 
to be used to flood artists a crane
right<00:01:31.110> away<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:32.159> satellite<00:01:32.549> dish<00:01:32.759> over<00:01:33.119> here

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
right away I'm satellite dish over here

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
right away I'm satellite dish over here
yeah<00:01:35.759> reason<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:36.899> I<00:01:37.380> made

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
yeah reason for that is because I made

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
yeah reason for that is because I made
another<00:01:37.829> map<00:01:38.130> using<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:40.579> type<00:01:41.579> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
another map using all these type of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
another map using all these type of
themes<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.360> drop<00:01:42.569> positive<00:01:42.869> stuff<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
themes with drop positive stuff and it
