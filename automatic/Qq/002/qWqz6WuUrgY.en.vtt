00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.750
 Hi, my name is Juan Morales. Professor of 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.560
 Technological Institute of Automotive Training 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.550
 in this opportunity we are going to see 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.470
 the operation of a sensor that is built into the injection system 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.680
 traditional electronics 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.300
 basically let's talk about the air temperature sensor 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.190
 this sensor is located 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.550
 in the air pass duct 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.650
 admitted towards the engine 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.399
 It is generally located 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.820
 before the throttle butterfly 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.620
 in some models or vehicles 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.250
 can be located after the throttle butterfly 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.679
 we could say directly about the admission manifold many times it is 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.760
 in company with another sensor known as MAP sensor 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.560
 can be independently or can also be located as another sensor 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.080
 before the throttle butterfly 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.700
 It should be noted that it can be the MAP sensor 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.789
 but it will always be located in the air duct pass to the engine 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.800
 let's show in a Corsican chevrolet engine 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.880
 with injection 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.929
 where is this sensor located 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.220
 we can see that this sensor is located 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.739
 in the hose of the air pass duct 

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:35.390
 before the throttle butterfly 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.470
 this sensor is connected 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.390
 through two circuits directly to the control unit 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.060
 this sensor is internally made up of a known resistance 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.050
 as a thermistor 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.590
 it is a variable resistance 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.030
 will vary its resistive value will also vary its tension depending on the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.869
 temperature change 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.030
 of the ambient air 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.929
 or of the air that is being entered 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.429
 towards the engine 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.670
 approximately at this time we have an ambient temperature of approximately 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.160
 29 째, 28/29 째 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.400
 this sensor will permanently be taking 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.200
 that temperature that is the air that is entering the engine 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.160
 once the control unit receives that signal 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.010
 the control unit 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.650
 will modify the amount of fuel that will enter 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.410
 through the injectors 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.960
 function 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.970
 to the mass of air that is being admitted or admitted by the engine 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.160
 the sensor is a variable resistance 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.630
 now we will be able to observe it inside a model 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.100
 that we can control its resistive value depending on the temperature and 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.760
 also its value 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.030
 of variable voltage change we will work first 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.140
 about its resistive value for it 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.190
 let's disconnect 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.190
 the sensor 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.200
 let's discount 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.100
 the card that goes directly connected to the control unit 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.350
 and we will measure through an ohmmeter its resistive value 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.060
 that should give us approximately 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.510
 between 2000 to 2500 ohm 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.990
 depending on the temperature at which we are finding ourselves at this moment 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.690
 let's move on to measure 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.459
 first the resistance value that sensor has 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.890
 depending on the temperature 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.560
 we use the ohmmeter we disconnect the sensor 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.990
 and we measure its resistive value 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.670
 we can observe in the ohmmeter that we have 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:51.690
 2,351 kiloohms and we can see that we have a temperature of approximately 28 째 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.970
 that is the value 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.810
 resistive that is giving us 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.849
 depending on the ambient temperature they are measuring 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.330
 the air temperature sensor 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.670
 we had said that this sensor is connected directly to the unit 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.930
 control through two circuits 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.420
 the first circuit 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.790
 it's going to be a 5 volt voltage 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.130
 and the second one is going to be a tension 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.130
 of dough 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.289
 for it 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.739
 let's control 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.470
 using our voltmeter 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.330
 we installed the negative circuit 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.550
 to the negative terminal of the battery 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.939
 with the positive circuit 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.120
 we control 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.849
 the 5 volts that is delivering 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.129
 the control unit to the sensor 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.809
 as next step 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:46.270
 let's change 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.009
 polarity 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.479
 our voltmeter 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.719
 and we will control 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.229
 the negative voltage also being delivered by the computer 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.129
 to the sensor 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.849
 once these two tensions are controlled 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.080
 we connect the sensor 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.029
 with the control unit 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:12.400
 we return to install our negative circuit 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.939
 with the negative terminal of the battery 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.689
 with the positive circuit 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.389
 to the signal circuit 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.319
 there we can observe 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.870
 that we have a value of 1.9 volts 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.499
 that is the voltage value that the sensor is giving us as a function of temperature 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:33.699
 that is in this moment 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.210
 that we had said is approximately 28 to 29 째 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.210
 that variable signal depending on the temperature that will be sending the 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.210
 sensor 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.669
 to the computer 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.610
 the computer will be permanently correcting 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.029
 Fuel time or injection time 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.419
 and the amount of fuel that will be 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.819
 delivering to each of the engine cylinders 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.749
 the faults that this sensor can generate 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.379
 it is usually going to present 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.460
 when the engine is regulating 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.069
 or when it is in minimum gear 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:10.539
 as usual 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.960
 we did not find a homogeneous engine operation 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.710
 why this happens 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.210
 because the computer delivers the amount of fuel 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.879
 very different 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.819
 at the temperature that is entering the 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.460
 air towards the engine 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.169
 which makes an engine 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.889
 work unstable 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.830
 during the minimum running 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.699
 way to locate it 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.629
 with the use of the voltmeter 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.180
 or directly with the use of other equipment 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.409
 like the scanner 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:42.939
 This was one more video for ITCA TV, see you in the next one. 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:48.500
