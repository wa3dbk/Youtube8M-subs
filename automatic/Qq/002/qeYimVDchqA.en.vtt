earth full of sharks in the past and
here<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:13.159> is<00:01:13.220> now<00:01:13.430> because<00:01:13.939> of<00:01:14.060> overfishing

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
here it is now because of overfishing

most fishermen just do their best to
make<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.700> living<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.479> some<00:01:17.689> go<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:17.990> catch

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
make a living so some go and catch

sharks<00:01:18.469> on<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.789> longline<00:01:19.810> since<00:01:20.810> all<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.259> money

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
sharks on a longline since all the money

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.349 
sharks on a longline since all the money
is<00:01:21.679> in<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.009> fins<00:01:22.219> sometimes<00:01:22.880> they<00:01:23.119> are<00:01:23.179> cut

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
is in the fins sometimes they are cut

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.849 
is in the fins sometimes they are cut
off<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:23.780> rest<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.079> the<00:01:24.140> shark<00:01:24.320> is<00:01:24.439> wasted

nutritional value at all so why eat it

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.440 
nutritional value at all so why eat it
it's<00:02:00.920> because<00:02:01.249> of<00:02:01.369> status<00:02:01.700> if<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:01.909> can<00:02:02.179> afford

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's because of status if you can afford

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.059 
it's because of status if you can afford
it<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.749> can<00:02:03.020> show<00:02:03.170> your<00:02:03.319> friends<00:02:03.380> how<00:02:03.770> well

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
it you can show your friends how well

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.660 
it you can show your friends how well
off<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.310> are
