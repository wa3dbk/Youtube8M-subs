the older generations alive anyway he

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.160 
the older generations alive anyway he

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
oh I'm gonna you turn out of Ross class

oh I'm gonna you turn out of Ross class
and<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.410> scout<00:00:25.890> what<00:00:26.039> he<00:00:26.099> does<00:00:26.279> now

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and just to scout what he does now

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.849 
and just to scout what he does now
froslass<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.289> he's<00:00:28.470> actually<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
froslass is you you but he's actually a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.160 
froslass is you you but he's actually a
pretty<00:00:28.949> good<00:00:29.269> spyker<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> 0<00:00:30.689> UT<00:00:31.140> ur

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
pretty good spyker in the 0 UT ur

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
pretty good spyker in the 0 UT ur
because<00:00:31.380> he<00:00:31.619> has<00:00:31.769> access<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> destiny<00:00:32.910> bond

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
because he has access to a destiny bond

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
because he has access to a destiny bond
and<00:00:33.390> ice<00:00:33.510> shard<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.260> well<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> few<00:00:34.739> other

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and ice shard as well as a few other

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.979 
and ice shard as well as a few other
move<00:00:35.100> options<00:00:35.489> he<00:00:36.090> actually<00:00:36.239> goes<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> ton

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
move options he actually goes for a ton

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.200 
move options he actually goes for a ton
which<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.649> confusing<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.430> i'm

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
which was a little confusing because i'm

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.760 
which was a little confusing because i'm
pretty<00:00:39.480> sure<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.840> self<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.260> speeds<00:00:40.590> for

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
pretty sure that a self out speeds for

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.020 
pretty sure that a self out speeds for
us<00:00:40.860> lives<00:00:41.100> anyway<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.700> wouldn't<00:00:41.910> have

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
us lives anyway so it wouldn't have

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.369 
us lives anyway so it wouldn't have
stopped<00:00:42.300> me<00:00:42.390> from<00:00:42.480> setting<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:42.899> stealth<00:00:43.170> rock

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
stopped me from setting up stealth rock

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
stopped me from setting up stealth rock
I<00:00:43.620> went<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> psychic<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.059> thought<00:00:45.329> he<00:00:45.480> might

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
I went for a psychic I thought he might

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
I went for a psychic I thought he might
switch<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.260> fear<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.680> choice<00:00:46.950> scarf<00:00:47.309> iron

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
switch in fear of a choice scarf iron

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.459 
switch in fear of a choice scarf iron
head<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.149> apparently<00:00:48.539> not<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> he<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.289> went

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
head but apparently not and he just went

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.889 
head but apparently not and he just went
for<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.739> destiny<00:00:50.219> bond<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.390> miss<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:51.780> on

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
for that destiny bond and I miss out on

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.110 
for that destiny bond and I miss out on
the<00:00:51.989> KO<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> switch<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> Heatran<00:00:53.340> he<00:00:53.789> gets<00:00:53.969> up

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the KO and switch to Heatran he gets up

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
the KO and switch to Heatran he gets up
spikes<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> switch<00:00:54.960> which<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.410> pretty

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
spikes on the switch which was pretty

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.279 
spikes on the switch which was pretty
smart<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.280> him<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> get

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
smart of him and I'm just going to get

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
smart of him and I'm just going to get
stealth<00:00:58.620> rock<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:59.070> while<00:00:59.399> he<00:00:59.640> destiny<00:01:00.149> bonds

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
stealth rock up while he destiny bonds

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.170 
stealth rock up while he destiny bonds
again<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> I'm<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:02.010> exactly<00:01:02.340> happy<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.850> how

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
again and I'm not exactly happy with how

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
again and I'm not exactly happy with how
this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> turn<00:01:03.960> out<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.680> basically

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
this is going to turn out but basically

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.039 
this is going to turn out but basically
there's<00:01:05.939> no<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.810> able<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
there's no way I'm going to be able to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.750 
there's no way I'm going to be able to
get<00:01:07.170> rid<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.350> frost<00:01:07.680> last<00:01:07.890> without<00:01:08.189> losing<00:01:08.640> one

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
get rid of frost last without losing one

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.170 
get rid of frost last without losing one
of<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.880> own<00:01:09.150> pokemon<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.140> destiny<00:01:10.710> bond

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
of my own pokemon do you do destiny bond

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.399 
of my own pokemon do you do destiny bond
so<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.420> pretty<00:01:12.570> much<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> be

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so I'm pretty much just going to be

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.100 
so I'm pretty much just going to be
forced<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.950> sacrifice<00:01:14.250> my<00:01:14.760> heat<00:01:15.000> trend<00:01:15.299> now

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
forced to sacrifice my heat trend now

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
forced to sacrifice my heat trend now
heatran<00:01:16.950> might<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.250> useful<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.729> later<00:01:18.090> so

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
heatran might be useful for later so

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.910 
heatran might be useful for later so
it's<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.590> i<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:19.830> have

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
it's not really what i would have

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.700 
it's not really what i would have
preferred<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.790> yeah<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.299> kind<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> lose

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
preferred but yeah I kind of had to lose

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
preferred but yeah I kind of had to lose
a<00:01:22.740> Pokemon<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.549> might<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.090> well<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.330> Heatran

probably<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.790> set<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.030> stealth<00:01:39.360> rock

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
probably is going to set up stealth rock

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.020 
probably is going to set up stealth rock
and<00:01:39.869> now<00:01:40.799> he<00:01:40.860> has<00:01:41.070> stealth<00:01:41.310> rock<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.790> one

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and now he has stealth rock and one

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.030 
and now he has stealth rock and one
layer<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.329> spikes<00:01:42.659> down<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.770> really

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
layer of spikes down so that's really

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
layer of spikes down so that's really
going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> put<00:01:44.460> some<00:01:44.490> pressure<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.479> far

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
going to put some pressure on me as far

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.899 
going to put some pressure on me as far
as<00:01:45.960> switching<00:01:46.380> around<00:01:46.500> goes<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.490> i<00:01:47.520> can't

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
as switching around goes so i can't

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.130 
as switching around goes so i can't
really<00:01:47.970> afford<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.509> switch<00:01:48.960> around

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
power fire which is a pretty good

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
fire water grass scores as soon as you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.700 
fire water grass scores as soon as you

which he sends in a heat trend now and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
I'm going to be forced to go into

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.070 
I'm going to be forced to go into
kingdra<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.640> King<00:02:33.360> Troy<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> little<00:02:33.930> bit<00:02:34.050> of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
kingdra and King Troy is a little bit of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.200 
kingdra and King Troy is a little bit of
a<00:02:34.200> shaky<00:02:34.590> check<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.010> Heatran<00:02:35.460> considering

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
a shaky check to Heatran considering

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.960 
a shaky check to Heatran considering
Heatran<00:02:36.720> actually<00:02:37.260> out<00:02:37.410> speeds<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.280> he

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
Heatran actually out speeds it and he

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.520 
Heatran actually out speeds it and he
makes<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> pretty<00:02:39.480> nice<00:02:39.750> prediction<00:02:40.050> here

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
makes it a pretty nice prediction here

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.080 
makes it a pretty nice prediction here
and<00:02:40.770> goes<00:02:41.010> for<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.250> dragon<00:02:41.550> pulse<00:02:41.850> on<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
and goes for a dragon pulse on the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.970 
and goes for a dragon pulse on the
switch<00:02:42.390> which<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.200> catch<00:02:43.620> me<00:02:43.650> off

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
switch which is going to catch me off

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.060 
switch which is going to catch me off
guard<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.580> take<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.480> kingdra<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.440> pretty

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
guard and take out kingdra so pretty

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.730 
guard and take out kingdra so pretty
good<00:02:47.250> play<00:02:47.460> on<00:02:47.490> his<00:02:47.820> part<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.230> now<00:02:49.470> he's

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
good play on his part so now he's

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.650 
good play on his part so now he's
probably<00:02:50.370> locked<00:02:50.820> into<00:02:51.120> dragon<00:02:51.450> poles

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
probably locked into dragon poles

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.870 
probably locked into dragon poles
because<00:02:51.810> i<00:02:51.960> think<00:02:52.290> only<00:02:52.470> scarf<00:02:52.920> Arians<00:02:53.370> round

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
because i think only scarf Arians round

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.240 
because i think only scarf Arians round
dragon<00:02:54.210> pause<00:02:54.360> ordinarily<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.070> going<00:02:56.100> to

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
dragon pause ordinarily so I'm going to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.910 
dragon pause ordinarily so I'm going to
go<00:02:56.400> into<00:02:56.610> gengar<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.570> just<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.770> get<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
go into gengar and just going to get a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.580 
go into gengar and just going to get a
focus<00:02:59.310> blast<00:02:59.520> off<00:02:59.820> on<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> switch<00:03:00.450> he<00:03:01.140> goes<00:03:01.320> into

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
focus blast off on a switch he goes into

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.740 
focus blast off on a switch he goes into
Swampert<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.310> fortunately<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.090> don't<00:03:03.300> miss

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
Swampert and fortunately I don't miss

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.380 
Swampert and fortunately I don't miss
with<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.410> focus<00:03:04.830> blast<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.850> does<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.360> a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
with the focus blast so that does do a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.540 
with the focus blast so that does do a
pretty<00:03:06.660> good<00:03:06.840> amount<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.110> damage<00:03:07.470> he<00:03:08.160> gets<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
pretty good amount of damage he gets the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.550 
pretty good amount of damage he gets the
leftovers<00:03:08.850> recovery<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.660> at<00:03:10.020> this<00:03:10.140> point<00:03:10.350> I'm

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
leftovers recovery and at this point I'm

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.890 
leftovers recovery and at this point I'm
not<00:03:10.590> exactly<00:03:11.010> sure<00:03:11.220> if<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:11.700> KO<00:03:12.450> him<00:03:12.750> with

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
not exactly sure if I can KO him with

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.500 
not exactly sure if I can KO him with
another<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.260> shadow<00:03:13.620> ball<00:03:13.860> because<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.480> looks

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
another a shadow ball because it looks

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.210 
another a shadow ball because it looks
like<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.900> could<00:03:16.050> be<00:03:16.080> close<00:03:16.410> but<00:03:16.680> maybe<00:03:16.920> not

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
like it could be close but maybe not

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.700 
like it could be close but maybe not
quite<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.610> KO<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.630> going<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.930> jirachi<00:03:19.230> because

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
quite a KO so I going to jirachi because

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.500 
quite a KO so I going to jirachi because
I<00:03:19.800> really<00:03:20.070> doubt<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.310> he's<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.090> be

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
I really doubt that he's going to be

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.720 
I really doubt that he's going to be
using<00:03:21.750> earthquake<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.350> gengar<00:03:22.770> maybe<00:03:23.550> ice

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
using earthquake on gengar maybe ice

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.490 
using earthquake on gengar maybe ice
beam<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.120> anything<00:03:24.480> instead<00:03:25.050> he<00:03:25.170> goes<00:03:25.260> for

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
beam if anything instead he goes for

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.710 
beam if anything instead he goes for
curse<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.430> am<00:03:26.580> packing<00:03:26.940> grass<00:03:27.180> not<00:03:27.450> as<00:03:27.600> I

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
curse and I am packing grass not as I

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.330 
curse and I am packing grass not as I
mentioned<00:03:28.050> earlier<00:03:28.140> but<00:03:28.860> I'm<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.160> really

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
mentioned earlier but I'm not really

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.940 
mentioned earlier but I'm not really
going<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.700> review<00:03:30.210> it<00:03:30.390> yet<00:03:30.570> because<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.350> think

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
going to review it yet because I think

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.980 
going to review it yet because I think
that<00:03:32.250> he<00:03:32.520> might<00:03:32.790> want<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.180> scout<00:03:33.390> for<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.750> but

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
that he might want to scout for it but

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.630 
that he might want to scout for it but
I'm<00:03:34.110> not<00:03:34.260> exactly<00:03:34.530> sure<00:03:34.710> so<00:03:35.310> I'm<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.520> going

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
I'm not exactly sure so I'm just going

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.890 
I'm not exactly sure so I'm just going
to<00:03:35.700> be<00:03:35.820> playing<00:03:36.000> really<00:03:36.180> cautiously<00:03:36.690> right

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
to be playing really cautiously right

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.140 
to be playing really cautiously right
now<00:03:37.070> so<00:03:38.070> I'm<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.370> switch<00:03:38.550> again<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.060> go

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
now so I'm going to switch again and go

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.320 
now so I'm going to switch again and go
to<00:03:39.210> as<00:03:39.390> off<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.990> earthquake<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.030> he's<00:03:42.030> at

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
to as off on the earthquake and he's at

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.480 
to as off on the earthquake and he's at
plus-one<00:03:43.020> attack<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.650> fence<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.130> I'm<00:03:44.310> not

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
plus-one attack in the fence so I'm not

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.130 
plus-one attack in the fence so I'm not
really<00:03:44.610> going<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.940> do<00:03:45.090> much<00:03:45.270> but<00:03:45.540> explosions

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
really going to do much but explosions

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.680 
really going to do much but explosions
should<00:03:46.350> still<00:03:46.709> be<00:03:46.860> enough<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.100> KO<00:03:47.400> him<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.480> I'm

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
should still be enough to KO him but I'm

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.199 
should still be enough to KO him but I'm
going<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.110> end<00:03:49.709> up<00:03:49.890> exploding<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.610> his<00:03:50.730> Heatran

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
going to end up exploding on his Heatran

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.449 
going to end up exploding on his Heatran
which<00:03:51.420> he<00:03:51.570> switches<00:03:51.870> out<00:03:52.140> into<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.770> I'm

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
which he switches out into you and I'm

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.620 
which he switches out into you and I'm
not<00:03:53.490> really<00:03:53.760> sure<00:03:53.880> if<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.209> would<00:03:54.270> have<00:03:54.360> pay<00:03:54.540> out

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
not really sure if it would have pay out

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.840 
not really sure if it would have pay out
otherwise<00:03:54.930> but<00:03:55.410> since<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> choice<00:03:56.610> man

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
otherwise but since this is a choice man

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.520 
otherwise but since this is a choice man
as<00:03:57.060> though<00:03:57.270> it's<00:03:57.570> going<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.900> KO<00:03:58.140> through

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
as though it's going to KO through

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.050 
as though it's going to KO through
Heatran<00:03:59.070> even<00:03:59.520> though<00:03:59.610> it's<00:03:59.760> not<00:03:59.910> very

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
Heatran even though it's not very

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.110 
Heatran even though it's not very
effective<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:01.140> yeah<00:04:01.350> choice<00:04:02.100> ban<00:04:02.400> explosion

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
effective so yeah choice ban explosion

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.360 
effective so yeah choice ban explosion
should<00:04:03.360> definitely<00:04:03.810> not<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:03.959> underestimated

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
should definitely not be underestimated

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.949 
should definitely not be underestimated
akin<00:04:05.370> KO<00:04:05.580> its<00:04:05.820> way<00:04:05.970> through<00:04:06.300> almost<00:04:06.570> anything

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
akin KO its way through almost anything

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.110 
akin KO its way through almost anything
really<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:08.340> now<00:04:08.520> I'm<00:04:08.550> going<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.850> go<00:04:08.940> into

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
really so now I'm going to go into

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.610 
really so now I'm going to go into
jirachi<00:04:09.540> again<00:04:09.930> because<00:04:10.140> I<00:04:10.230> think<00:04:10.410> he's<00:04:10.530> going

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
jirachi again because I think he's going

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.980 
jirachi again because I think he's going
to<00:04:10.709> send<00:04:10.890> out<00:04:11.070> Swampert<00:04:11.610> next<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.270> he

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
to send out Swampert next and he

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.420 
to send out Swampert next and he
actually<00:04:13.140> does<00:04:13.560> which<00:04:13.770> is<00:04:13.800> really<00:04:14.100> good<00:04:14.280> for

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
actually does which is really good for

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.340 
actually does which is really good for
me<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.790> at<00:04:15.270> this<00:04:15.420> point<00:04:15.660> I've<00:04:15.900> gotten<00:04:16.170> rid<00:04:16.320> of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
me and at this point I've gotten rid of

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.470 
me and at this point I've gotten rid of
his<00:04:16.620> Heatran<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:17.520> I<00:04:17.549> feel<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.299> going<00:04:18.420> to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
his Heatran so I feel like it's going to

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.090 
his Heatran so I feel like it's going to
be<00:04:18.570> pretty<00:04:18.720> safe<00:04:19.109> for<00:04:19.560> me<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:19.770> for<00:04:20.070> the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
be pretty safe for me to go for the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.010 
be pretty safe for me to go for the
grass<00:04:20.340> knot<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.060> do<00:04:21.120> which<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.510> definitely

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
grass knot and I do which is definitely

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.469 
grass knot and I do which is definitely
going<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.260> KO<00:04:22.440> Swampert<00:04:23.070> because<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.180> quite

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
going to KO Swampert because it is quite

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.300 
going to KO Swampert because it is quite
effective<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:25.110> Swampert<00:04:25.620> has<00:04:25.770> pretty<00:04:26.100> low

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
effective in Swampert has pretty low

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.290 
effective in Swampert has pretty low
special<00:04:26.760> defense

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
special defense

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.379 
special defense
otherwise<00:04:28.310> so<00:04:29.310> I'm<00:04:29.490> not<00:04:29.580> really<00:04:29.639> sure<00:04:29.849> what<00:04:30.240> he

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
otherwise so I'm not really sure what he

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.760 
otherwise so I'm not really sure what he
has<00:04:30.569> left<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.199> i'm<00:04:31.289> just<00:04:31.379> going<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.620> take<00:04:31.710> a

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
has left and i'm just going to take a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.100 
has left and i'm just going to take a
look<00:04:31.949> looks<00:04:32.520> like<00:04:32.639> about<00:04:32.759> two<00:04:33.030> pokemon<00:04:33.539> and<00:04:34.050> he

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
look looks like about two pokemon and he

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.110 
look looks like about two pokemon and he
goes<00:04:34.289> for<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.500> Nassif<00:04:34.949> based<00:04:35.520> on<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:35.789> fact<00:04:36.000> that

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
goes for a Nassif based on the fact that

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.700 
goes for a Nassif based on the fact that
it<00:04:36.300> wasn't<00:04:36.569> in<00:04:36.629> the<00:04:36.720> lead<00:04:36.870> spot<00:04:37.199> i<00:04:37.229> guess<00:04:37.530> it's

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
it wasn't in the lead spot i guess it's

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.189 
it wasn't in the lead spot i guess it's
nasty<00:04:38.129> plot<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.639> i'm<00:04:38.699> right<00:04:38.849> about<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:40.169> i

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
nasty plot and i'm right about that so i

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.839 
nasty plot and i'm right about that so i
don't<00:04:40.530> really<00:04:40.560> want<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.919> switch<00:04:41.190> around<00:04:41.460> too

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
don't really want to switch around too

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.369 
don't really want to switch around too
much<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.509> decided<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.930> best<00:04:42.960> course<00:04:43.169> of

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
much and I decided the best course of

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.960 
much and I decided the best course of
action<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.770> probably<00:04:44.099> just<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.490> sacrifice

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
action is probably just a sacrifice

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.330 
action is probably just a sacrifice
jirachi<00:04:45.360> so<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.139> go<00:04:46.289> for<00:04:46.470> HP<00:04:46.800> fire<00:04:47.009> which<00:04:47.310> is

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
jirachi so I go for HP fire which is

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.490 
jirachi so I go for HP fire which is
actually<00:04:47.699> going<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.180> be<00:04:48.300> what<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.020> think<00:04:49.259> is<00:04:49.349> my

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
actually going to be what I think is my

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.830 
actually going to be what I think is my
strongest<00:04:49.710> attack<00:04:50.039> available<00:04:50.879> right<00:04:51.030> now<00:04:51.090> and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
strongest attack available right now and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.930 
strongest attack available right now and
i'm<00:04:51.990> just<00:04:52.050> going<00:04:52.199> to<00:04:52.349> stay<00:04:52.409> in<00:04:52.590> on<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.190> plus<00:04:53.669> to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
i'm just going to stay in on the plus to

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.089 
i'm just going to stay in on the plus to
fire<00:04:54.270> attack<00:04:54.690> i'm<00:04:55.259> really<00:04:55.590> not<00:04:55.680> going<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.889> need

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
fire attack i'm really not going to need

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.999 
fire attack i'm really not going to need
jirachi<00:04:56.460> i<00:04:56.699> think<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.690> i<00:04:57.990> really<00:04:58.620> don't<00:04:58.710> want

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
jirachi i think so i really don't want

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.230 
jirachi i think so i really don't want
to<00:04:59.129> switch<00:04:59.370> around<00:04:59.490> too<00:04:59.789> much<00:04:59.940> against

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
to switch around too much against

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.879 
to switch around too much against
something<00:05:00.449> dangerous<00:05:00.960> like<00:05:01.139> a<00:05:01.169> nasty<00:05:01.560> plot<00:05:01.830> a

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
something dangerous like a nasty plot a

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.399 
something dangerous like a nasty plot a
self<00:05:02.280> because<00:05:03.060> my<00:05:03.419> team<00:05:03.719> would<00:05:03.930> probably<00:05:04.259> not

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
self because my team would probably not

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.320 
self because my team would probably not
like<00:05:04.440> dealing<00:05:04.830> with<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:05.280> now<00:05:05.940> i<00:05:05.969> go<00:05:06.180> into

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
like dealing with it and now i go into

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.059 
like dealing with it and now i go into
scarf<00:05:06.750> flag<00:05:06.990> on<00:05:07.169> which<00:05:07.349> is<00:05:07.500> going<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.740> check

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
scarf flag on which is going to check

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.010 
scarf flag on which is going to check
that<00:05:08.250> out<00:05:08.310> pretty<00:05:08.819> nicely<00:05:09.120> with<00:05:09.449> a<00:05:09.479> scarf<00:05:09.810> you

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
that out pretty nicely with a scarf you

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.920 
that out pretty nicely with a scarf you
turn<00:05:10.400> after<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.639> hidden<00:05:11.879> power<00:05:12.030> fire<00:05:12.330> I'm<00:05:12.629> it's

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
turn after a hidden power fire I'm it's

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.510 
turn after a hidden power fire I'm it's
definitely<00:05:13.409> going<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.620> be<00:05:13.710> within<00:05:13.919> KO<00:05:14.190> range

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
definitely going to be within KO range

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.029 
definitely going to be within KO range
so<00:05:14.969> I'm<00:05:15.180> going<00:05:15.449> to<00:05:15.599> eliminate<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.050> self<00:05:16.469> and<00:05:16.740> go

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
so I'm going to eliminate a self and go

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.100 
so I'm going to eliminate a self and go
back<00:05:17.280> into<00:05:17.310> gengar<00:05:18.240> to<00:05:18.539> find<00:05:18.750> out<00:05:18.870> what<00:05:19.020> his

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
back into gengar to find out what his

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.279 
back into gengar to find out what his
last<00:05:19.319> pokemon<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:20.099> and<00:05:20.509> he<00:05:21.509> only<00:05:21.659> has<00:05:21.840> one<00:05:21.870> left

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
last pokemon is and he only has one left

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.899 
last pokemon is and he only has one left
so<00:05:22.590> I'm<00:05:22.770> pretty<00:05:22.979> sure<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.219> should<00:05:23.580> be<00:05:23.610> able<00:05:23.759> to

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
so I'm pretty sure I should be able to

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.670 
so I'm pretty sure I should be able to
deal<00:05:24.060> with<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.020> turns<00:05:25.229> out<00:05:25.319> to<00:05:25.500> be<00:05:25.530> a

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
deal with it and it turns out to be a

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.740 
deal with it and it turns out to be a
BRI<00:05:26.039> loom<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:27.000> don't<00:05:27.180> know<00:05:27.270> if<00:05:27.360> Shadow<00:05:27.569> Ball

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
BRI loom and I don't know if Shadow Ball

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.149 
BRI loom and I don't know if Shadow Ball
wat<00:05:27.930> khao<00:05:28.110> so<00:05:28.440> i'm<00:05:28.530> just<00:05:28.560> going<00:05:28.889> to<00:05:28.949> go<00:05:29.039> with

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
wat khao so i'm just going to go with

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.550 
wat khao so i'm just going to go with
explosion<00:05:30.150> which<00:05:30.389> is<00:05:30.569> the<00:05:30.780> safe<00:05:31.080> option<00:05:31.319> of

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
explosion which is the safe option of

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.800 
explosion which is the safe option of
course<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.069> since<00:05:32.969> i<00:05:33.180> end<00:05:33.330> up<00:05:33.389> killing<00:05:33.719> myself

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
course and since i end up killing myself

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.230 
course and since i end up killing myself
this<00:05:34.380> is<00:05:34.590> technically<00:05:35.009> going<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.490> end<00:05:35.669> with<00:05:35.940> a

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
this is technically going to end with a

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.570 
this is technically going to end with a
10<00:05:36.659> victory<00:05:37.110> so<00:05:37.380> really<00:05:37.650> close<00:05:37.860> match<00:05:38.190> and

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
10 victory so really close match and

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.180 
10 victory so really close match and
good<00:05:39.000> game
