entire<00:02:58.260> playlist<00:02:58.680> based<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.489> was

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
entire playlist based on so I was

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.610 
entire playlist based on so I was
inspired<00:02:59.820> recently<00:03:00.750> all<00:03:00.900> right<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.230> was

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
inspired recently all right I was

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.820 
inspired recently all right I was
inspired<00:03:02.130> by<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.910> zoo<00:03:03.330> literally<00:03:04.200> by<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.470> zoo

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
inspired by the zoo literally by the zoo

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.740 
inspired by the zoo literally by the zoo
I<00:03:05.040> don't<00:03:05.519> know<00:03:05.610> why<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.850> hate<00:03:06.150> let<00:03:06.480> me<00:03:06.570> actually

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
I don't know why I hate let me actually

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.180 
I don't know why I hate let me actually
I<00:03:06.900> know<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.080> actually<00:03:07.410> know<00:03:07.709> why<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> don't<00:03:08.070> know

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
I know I actually know why I don't know

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.590 
I know I actually know why I don't know
why<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.340> said<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.640> but<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:08.970> actually<00:03:09.090> know<00:03:09.420> why

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
why I said that but I actually know why

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.449 
why I said that but I actually know why
the<00:03:10.080> reason<00:03:10.470> why<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.650> was<00:03:10.860> inspired<00:03:11.220> by<00:03:11.400> this

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
the reason why this was inspired by this

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.490 
the reason why this was inspired by this
view<00:03:11.700> first<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.000> all<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.330> zoo<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:13.230> go<00:03:13.380> in

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
view first of all in the zoo you go in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.140 
view first of all in the zoo you go in
and<00:03:13.620> ain't<00:03:13.830> no<00:03:13.980> Squire<00:03:14.370> first<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:14.970> then<00:03:15.060> it

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
and ain't no Squire first but then it

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.740 
and ain't no Squire first but then it
gets<00:03:15.330> loud<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.780> gets<00:03:15.930> noisy<00:03:16.140> gets<00:03:16.560> flowy<00:03:16.830> so

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
gets loud it gets noisy gets flowy so

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.660 
gets loud it gets noisy gets flowy so
these<00:03:18.750> tracks<00:03:19.200> right<00:03:19.500> each<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:20.280> these<00:03:20.370> tracks

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
these tracks right each of these tracks

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.949 
these tracks right each of these tracks
and<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> animals<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.480> I've<00:03:21.600> named<00:03:21.810> them

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
and the animals that I've named them

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.930 
and the animals that I've named them
after<00:03:22.110> basically<00:03:22.920> all<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.340> these<00:03:23.610> tracks

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
after basically all a of these tracks

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.060 
after basically all a of these tracks
will<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.780> named<00:03:25.049> after<00:03:25.200> an<00:03:25.410> animal<00:03:25.530> within<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
will be named after an animal within the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.180 
will be named after an animal within the
zoo<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.579> all<00:03:27.380> eight<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.410> these<00:03:28.650> tracks<00:03:28.980> will

and all of these roads and these tracks

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.949 
and all of these roads and these tracks
are<00:03:34.980> gonna<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.370> sort<00:03:35.610> of<00:03:35.640> fast<00:03:35.970> flowy<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.900> you

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
are gonna be sort of fast flowy so you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:37.940 
are gonna be sort of fast flowy so you
could<00:03:37.079> take<00:03:37.200> them<00:03:37.320> at<00:03:37.410> high<00:03:37.470> speeds<00:03:37.769> but<00:03:37.860> at

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
could take them at high speeds but at

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.680 
could take them at high speeds but at
same<00:03:38.040> time<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.700> gotta<00:03:38.880> be<00:03:38.970> Bossier<00:03:39.360> certain

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
same time you gotta be Bossier certain

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.240 
same time you gotta be Bossier certain
points<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.440> really<00:03:40.560> take<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.829> risk<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.100> go

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
points to really take the risk and go

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.560 
points to really take the risk and go
for<00:03:41.400> overtake<00:03:41.700> someone<00:03:41.790> no<00:03:42.000> but<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.299> can<00:03:42.450> have

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
for overtake someone no but you can have

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.910 
for overtake someone no but you can have
clean<00:03:42.810> battles<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.799> main

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
clean battles and that's the main

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.650 
clean battles and that's the main
priority<00:03:44.370> here<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.850> making<00:03:45.239> sure<00:03:45.480> people

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
priority here and making sure people

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.000 
priority here and making sure people
have<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.959> proprietary<00:03:46.200> use<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:46.799> anyway

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
have the proprietary use but anyway

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.039 
have the proprietary use but anyway
point<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.670> for<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> example<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:48.989> a

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
point is for the example and this is a

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.600 
point is for the example and this is a
kind<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.380> GP<00:03:49.680> simply<00:03:49.950> because<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.370> way<00:03:50.459> does

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
kind of GP simply because the way does

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.000 
kind of GP simply because the way does
its<00:03:50.880> desires<00:03:51.269> love<00:03:51.570> its<00:03:52.019> girls<00:03:52.530> going<00:03:52.739> left

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
its desires love its girls going left

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.530 
its desires love its girls going left
right<00:03:53.130> left<00:03:53.280> right<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.850> hairpin<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.269> lot<00:03:54.480> of

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
right left right and a hairpin a lot of

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.910 
right left right and a hairpin a lot of
twists<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.810> times<00:03:54.959> on<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.110> mass<00:03:55.290> couple

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
twists of times on the mass couple

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.949 
twists of times on the mass couple
straights<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.519> you're<00:03:57.450> getting<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:57.720> nice

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
straights so you're getting this nice

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.289 
straights so you're getting this nice
flow<00:03:58.350> imbalance<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.519> Anaconda<00:04:00.030> sort<00:04:00.239> of

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
flow imbalance and the Anaconda sort of

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.550 
flow imbalance and the Anaconda sort of
shaped<00:04:00.600> like<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.989> if<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.140> actually<00:04:01.260> looked

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
shaped like that if you actually looked

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.990 
shaped like that if you actually looked
at<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.769> initial<00:04:02.100> map<00:04:02.370> when<00:04:02.579> you<00:04:02.670> actually<00:04:02.760> try

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
at the initial map when you actually try

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.330 
at the initial map when you actually try
this<00:04:03.120> track<00:04:03.420> on<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.810> Xbox<00:04:04.140> 360<00:04:04.320> as<00:04:04.769> well<00:04:05.160> as
