only about two miles but just kind of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.549

on<00:01:08.430> those<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.420> those<00:01:09.600> bars<00:01:10.460> now<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.670> an

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
on those up on those bars now it's an

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.750 
on those up on those bars now it's an
empty<00:01:12.090> pot<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> had<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.860> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
empty pot out there but I had that that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.749 
empty pot out there but I had that that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
pot up there in the bars and I think it

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.179

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
from my angle I could never really

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.630 
from my angle I could never really
investigate<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.330> turning<00:01:24.810> brown<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.280> I

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
just saw the top of the plant and I

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.010 
just saw the top of the plant and I
thought<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:29.939> were<00:01:30.000> bulbs<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.689> thought<00:01:30.900> they

they're very small as you can see my

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.490 
they're very small as you can see my
first<00:04:31.150> idea<00:04:32.150> about<00:04:32.570> eating<00:04:32.900> these<00:04:33.050> was<00:04:33.290> to

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
first idea about eating these was to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.430 
first idea about eating these was to
just<00:04:33.800> start<00:04:34.040> on<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.550> this<00:04:35.300> side<00:04:35.600> but<00:04:35.900> my

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
just start on on this side but my

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.870 
just start on on this side but my
mother-in-law<00:04:36.740> tells<00:04:37.100> me<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.430> should<00:04:37.610> hold

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
mother-in-law tells me you should hold

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.960 
mother-in-law tells me you should hold
them<00:04:38.150> at<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.479> bottom<00:04:38.990> here<00:04:39.320> especially<00:04:40.100> if

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
them at the bottom here especially if

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.930 
them at the bottom here especially if
there's<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.410> stem<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.860> hold<00:04:43.070> it<00:04:43.190> like<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.370> to

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
there's a stem you hold it like this to

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.930 
there's a stem you hold it like this to
try<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.720> minimize<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.560> contact<00:04:46.250> with<00:04:46.729> your

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
try to minimize the contact with your

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.870 
try to minimize the contact with your
fingers<00:04:47.780> on<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:47.990> on<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.979> peel<00:04:49.280> cuz<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:49.790> don't

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
fingers on the on the peel cuz you don't

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.180 
fingers on the on the peel cuz you don't
want<00:04:50.060> any<00:04:50.300> pesticides<00:04:50.930> on<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.590> actual<00:04:51.919> meat

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
want any pesticides on the actual meat

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.120 
want any pesticides on the actual meat
and<00:04:52.639> then<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.150> peel<00:04:53.419> from<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.900> top<00:04:54.169> part<00:04:54.770> down

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
and then you peel from the top part down

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.379 
and then you peel from the top part down
and<00:04:56.090> then<00:04:56.810> just<00:04:56.840> let<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.889> let<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.700> peel<00:04:59.090> just

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
and then just let the let the peel just

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.690 
and then just let the let the peel just
lay<00:04:59.870> over<00:05:00.229> your<00:05:00.410> your<00:05:00.740> fingers<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.490> then<00:05:01.639> you

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
lay over your your fingers and then you

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.210 
lay over your your fingers and then you
you<00:05:02.389> eat<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:02.840> like<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.229> would<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.440> like<00:05:04.190> a

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
you eat it like you would a like a

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.060

popsicle<00:05:04.700> there<00:05:05.300> are<00:05:05.419> a<00:05:05.479> couple<00:05:05.660> of<00:05:05.840> seeds<00:05:06.229> in

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
popsicle there are a couple of seeds in

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.460 
popsicle there are a couple of seeds in
there<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:08.060> course<00:05:08.120> to<00:05:08.419> spit<00:05:08.690> out<00:05:08.720> this<00:05:09.110> is<00:05:09.290> not

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
there of course to spit out this is not

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.020 
there of course to spit out this is not
entirely<00:05:11.770> fruit<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:12.950> think<00:05:13.160> 30<00:05:13.400> percent<00:05:13.910> of

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
entirely fruit I think 30 percent of

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.420 
entirely fruit I think 30 percent of
this<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.360> taken<00:05:14.690> up<00:05:14.810> by<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.990> seat<00:05:15.440> but<00:05:15.800> you<00:05:16.220> can

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
this is taken up by the seat but you can

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.779 
this is taken up by the seat but you can
eat<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.180> couple<00:05:17.479> of<00:05:17.630> these<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.310> that's<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.520> great

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
eat a couple of these and that's a great

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
okay see so I kind of peeled it down

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.690 
okay see so I kind of peeled it down
like<00:05:27.979> a<00:05:28.010> banana

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
like a banana

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.659 
like a banana
and<00:05:28.820> then<00:05:29.690> I'm<00:05:29.870> just<00:05:29.930> gonna<00:05:30.370> just<00:05:31.370> bite<00:05:31.639> off

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
and then I'm just gonna just bite off

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.240 
and then I'm just gonna just bite off
the<00:05:31.820> top<00:05:32.150> there<00:05:35.530> so<00:05:36.530> these<00:05:36.680> are<00:05:36.889> the<00:05:36.979> seeds

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
the top there so these are the seeds

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.390 
the top there so these are the seeds
that<00:05:37.490> you<00:05:37.669> have<00:05:37.820> to<00:05:37.970> spit<00:05:38.240> out<00:05:38.389> so<00:05:39.110> quite<00:05:40.100> large

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
that you have to spit out so quite large

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.690 
that you have to spit out so quite large
I<00:05:41.229> might<00:05:42.229> try<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:42.530> plant<00:05:43.250> one<00:05:43.340> of<00:05:43.520> these

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
I might try and plant one of these

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.420 
I might try and plant one of these
things<00:05:44.030> because<00:05:44.600> I<00:05:44.990> heard<00:05:45.800> that<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:46.100> tree

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
things because I heard that the tree

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.580 
things because I heard that the tree
does<00:05:46.669> not<00:05:46.700> get<00:05:47.060> too<00:05:47.330> big<00:05:47.600> and<00:05:47.630> that's<00:05:48.229> what<00:05:48.560> I

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
does not get too big and that's what I

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.340 
does not get too big and that's what I
need<00:05:48.860> to<00:05:49.070> grow<00:05:49.510> my<00:05:50.510> property<00:05:50.990> is<00:05:51.110> something

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
need to grow my property is something

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.310 
need to grow my property is something
kind<00:05:51.950> of<00:05:52.039> if<00:05:52.789> I<00:05:52.970> was<00:05:53.090> gonna<00:05:53.210> to<00:05:53.450> choose<00:05:53.900> a<00:05:53.930> fruit

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
kind of if I was gonna to choose a fruit

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.200 
kind of if I was gonna to choose a fruit
I'd<00:05:54.560> choose<00:05:55.250> something<00:05:55.460> that<00:05:55.610> doesn't<00:05:56.000> get

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
I'd choose something that doesn't get

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.080 
I'd choose something that doesn't get
that<00:05:56.510> big<00:05:56.780> so<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.800> can<00:05:57.919> be<00:05:58.039> like<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.220> bush<00:05:58.550> or<00:05:58.880> a

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
that big so it can be like a bush or a

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.400 
that big so it can be like a bush or a
tree<00:06:00.099> but<00:06:01.099> it<00:06:01.760> may<00:06:01.910> be<00:06:01.970> in<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.240> front<00:06:03.169> doorway

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
tree but it may be in the front doorway

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.089 
tree but it may be in the front doorway
it<00:06:03.889> would<00:06:04.039> be<00:06:04.190> a<00:06:04.220> good<00:06:04.370> place<00:06:04.990> so<00:06:05.990> there<00:06:06.530> you<00:06:06.650> go

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
it would be a good place so there you go

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.629 
it would be a good place so there you go
the<00:06:07.550> loquat<00:06:08.030> or<00:06:08.330> pee<00:06:08.720> paw<00:06:09.130> I'll<00:06:10.130> give<00:06:10.310> you<00:06:10.430> some
