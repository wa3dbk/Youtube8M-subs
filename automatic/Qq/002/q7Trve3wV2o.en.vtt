base so yeah I think it's pretty much
everywhere<00:03:13.030> but<00:03:13.239> here<00:03:13.389> is<00:03:13.569> stuck<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.019> one<00:03:14.169> base

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
everywhere but here is stuck in one base

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.530 
everywhere but here is stuck in one base
now<00:03:14.680> all<00:03:15.069> he<00:03:15.430> has<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.579> tanks<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.209> vultures
