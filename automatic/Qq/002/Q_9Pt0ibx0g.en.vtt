hey guys welcome back next year today
we're<00:00:02.580> going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> take<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.909> look<00:00:03.090> at<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.210> widget

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
we're going to take a look at a widget

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.999 
we're going to take a look at a widget
that<00:00:03.689> will<00:00:03.810> give<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.110> access<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.589> your<00:00:04.740> most

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
that will give you access to your most

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.559 
that will give you access to your most
frequently<00:00:05.549> used<00:00:05.580> applications<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.540> your

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
frequently used applications on your

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.180 
frequently used applications on your
system<00:00:07.020> let's<00:00:07.770> check<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.040> out<00:00:13.190> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
system let's check it out the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.350 
system let's check it out the
application<00:00:14.610> we're<00:00:14.730> looking<00:00:14.940> at<00:00:15.059> today<00:00:15.240> is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
application we're looking at today is

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.390 
application we're looking at today is
called<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> mru<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.560> most<00:00:16.770> recently<00:00:17.160> used

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
called the mru the most recently used

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.609 
called the mru the most recently used
widget<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.750> way<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:18.990> looks<00:00:19.199> essentially

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
widget and the way it looks essentially

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.290 
widget and the way it looks essentially
is<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.039> grid<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.279> applications<00:00:21.180> that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
is it's a grid of applications that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.240 
is it's a grid of applications that
you've<00:00:21.449> recently<00:00:21.930> used<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.830> different

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
you've recently used this is different

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.220 
you've recently used this is different
than<00:00:23.430> your<00:00:23.490> recently<00:00:24.269> used<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.810> system

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
than your recently used to a system

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.870 
than your recently used to a system
because<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.830> actually<00:00:26.099> clear<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
because you can actually clear this and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.120 
because you can actually clear this and
you<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.720> open<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.080> again<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.769> nothing

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you can open it up again we have nothing

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.519 
you can open it up again we have nothing
I'm<00:00:29.340> using<00:00:29.789> Omni<00:00:30.599> switch<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.410> why

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
I'm using Omni switch here so that's why

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.840 
I'm using Omni switch here so that's why
it<00:00:31.650> looks<00:00:31.859> different<00:00:32.070> than<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.340> normal<00:00:32.399> system

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
it looks different than a normal system

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.610 
it looks different than a normal system
but<00:00:33.480> you'll<00:00:33.600> notice<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.050> essentially<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
but you'll notice here essentially is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.350 
but you'll notice here essentially is
that<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.950> list<00:00:35.160> gets<00:00:35.340> updated<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.030> I'm

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
that that list gets updated and as I'm

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
that that list gets updated and as I'm
using<00:00:36.540> application<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.260> changes<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
using application it changes and the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.889 
using application it changes and the
beauty<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.390> set<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
beauty of it is if you have a set of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.869 
beauty of it is if you have a set of
apps<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.829> core<00:00:41.250> apps<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
apps that are your core apps that you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.790 
apps that are your core apps that you
use<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> time<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.710> than

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
use all the time it will more than

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
use all the time it will more than
likely<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.579> list<00:00:44.820> making<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> very

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
likely be in this list making it very

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.880 
likely be in this list making it very
functional<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.649> quick

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
functional for you to just have quick

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.650 
functional for you to just have quick
access<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.430> apps<00:00:47.700> without<00:00:48.149> having<00:00:48.300> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
access to your apps without having to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.389 
access to your apps without having to
actually<00:00:48.780> look<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.320> them<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> example

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
actually look for them so the example

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.619 
actually look for them so the example
would<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.879> let's<00:00:51.149> say<00:00:51.270> I'll<00:00:51.360> go<00:00:51.510> back

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
would be here let's say I'll go back

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
would be here let's say I'll go back
into<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:51.960> Google+<00:00:52.500> I've<00:00:53.340> launched<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
into my Google+ I've launched the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.340 
into my Google+ I've launched the
application<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> review<00:00:55.230> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
application and this is the review that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.130 
application and this is the review that
just<00:00:55.500> went<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.940> today<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.449> I'll<00:00:57.989> go

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
just went up today and then I'll go

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
just went up today and then I'll go
ahead<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.070> let's<00:00:59.250> say<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
ahead and go in and let's say go to the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.389 
ahead and go in and let's say go to the
Google<00:01:00.000> Play<00:01:00.030> Store<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.890> again<00:01:01.890> I'll<00:01:02.190> go<00:01:02.370> back

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.579 
Google Play Store and again I'll go back
home<00:01:02.760> you'll<00:01:03.239> notice<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.960> list<00:01:04.170> itself

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
home you'll notice as the list itself

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.859 
home you'll notice as the list itself
has<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> refresh<00:01:05.460> rate<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.180> went<00:01:06.570> ahead<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
has a refresh rate so it went ahead and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.270 
has a refresh rate so it went ahead and
updated<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.650> showed<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> last<00:01:08.070> two

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

other<00:02:33.810> than<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.110> think<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.500> pretty

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
other than that I think it's pretty

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.440 
other than that I think it's pretty
simple<00:02:34.890> from<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.160> setup<00:02:35.430> once<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.360> it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
simple from the setup once you have it

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.030 
simple from the setup once you have it
on<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.750> add<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.080> as<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> normal<00:02:37.560> widget<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.950> your

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
on you add it as a normal widget to your

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.699 
on you add it as a normal widget to your
to<00:02:38.550> your<00:02:38.580> lockscreen<00:02:39.060> from<00:02:40.020> your<00:02:40.170> system<00:02:40.470> this

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
to your lockscreen from your system this

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.960 
to your lockscreen from your system this
is<00:02:40.890> lollipop<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.489> that's<00:02:41.670> how<00:02:41.760> you'd<00:02:41.940> be

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
is lollipop so that's how you'd be

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.090 
is lollipop so that's how you'd be
adding<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.810> that's<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.380> lock<00:02:43.560> screen<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
adding it so that's the lock screen and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.190 
adding it so that's the lock screen and
then<00:02:44.790> that's<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.300> can<00:02:45.630> interact<00:02:45.840> with<00:02:45.989> it

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
then that's it you can interact with it

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.660 
then that's it you can interact with it
wherever<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.560> want<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.950> find<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.610> very

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
wherever you want I find it very

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.979 
wherever you want I find it very

if<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.510> use<00:04:09.660> other<00:04:09.840> applications<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.500> are

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
if you use other applications that are

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.830 
if you use other applications that are
similar<00:04:11.100> in<00:04:11.250> this<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.880> course<00:04:12.209> our<00:04:12.480> recent

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
similar in this of course our recent

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.539 
similar in this of course our recent
apps<00:04:13.049> doesn't<00:04:13.410> really<00:04:13.560> function<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.430> way

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
apps doesn't really function in that way

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.949 
apps doesn't really function in that way
because<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.970> just<00:04:15.090> shows<00:04:15.329> us<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.630> recent

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
because it just shows us the recent

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.050 
because it just shows us the recent
applications<00:04:16.500> not<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.130> recently<00:04:17.549> used<00:04:17.789> one

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
applications not the recently used one

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.940 
applications not the recently used one
so<00:04:18.299> or<00:04:18.479> most<00:04:18.780> frequently<00:04:18.930> used<00:04:19.380> one<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.739> guess

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
so or most frequently used one I guess

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.170 
so or most frequently used one I guess
so

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
so

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.450 
so
