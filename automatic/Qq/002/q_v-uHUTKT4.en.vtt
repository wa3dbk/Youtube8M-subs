00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.459
 but 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.280
 hello today i will show you a simple recipe 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.340
 classic sponge cake 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.510
 take 120 grams of sugar is 7 tablespoons 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.680
 spoons with a slide 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.630
 or two-thirds of a regular faceted glass 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.360
 first we need only 100 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 grams of sugar so extra 20 grams 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.300
 need to pour it about one and a half 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.890
 tablespoons without slides 100 grams 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.969
 sugar and 4 egg yolks 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 whip at maximum speed 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:48.120
 mixer two or three minutes, the mass will brighten 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 and double the 4 egg whites 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.069
 beat in a stable foam in order 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.640
 so that whites are better whipped 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:59.809
 they must be chilled to proteins 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.159
 sprinkle the remaining sugar 20g and 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.159
 continue to beat 2 minutes 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.200
 squirrels will be dense and shiny now 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.350
 prepare the flour 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.380
 we will need 120 grams it's almost 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.540
 full faceted glass 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.420
 flour need to sift 2-3 times to 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.350
 saturate her with oxygen and she became more 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.440
 aerial 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.170
 the yolks send them white and start 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.410
 shuffle gently from below 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.140
 up here so no sudden movements 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.660
 so as not to destroy the airiness of proteins 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.330
 add our last ingredient 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.680
 sifted flour and in the same way 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.680
 mix everything neatly 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:00.480
 dough ready to form lubricate 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 melted butter remember 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.780
 the smaller your shape the higher will be 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.780
 biscuit 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.510
 it is also desirable to sprinkle with flour and shape 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.400
 shake off excess flour 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.400
 like this 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.790
 we lay out the dough in the form we try 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.269
 to make a small one in the middle 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.230
 groove then the finished sponge will 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.569
 even 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.150
 the oven must be pre 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.000
 warmed to 200 degrees 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.640
 bake the cake for 20-25 minutes 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.920
 the first 15 minutes you can not open the door 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.320
 oven to keep it in the oven 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.140
 temperature remember that sponge cake 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.220
 will rise and will be high only if 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.380
 you bake it at high temperature 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.209
 do not rush to get a biscuit out of the form 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.209
 let it cool completely 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.000
 and how beautiful and easy to cut a biscuit 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.250
 on two korzh you can look at me 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.400
 on the channel or click on the link 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.240
 which you see on the screen and my biscuit 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.240
