00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 blair it's called rip minus 7 grams 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.440
 weighs it looks like a krank although called 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.460
 gum has passed and conditions 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.400
 competition and I think I need to perch 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.400
 give the opportunity to change wobblers because 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.650
 what do i think what's next this wobbler though 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:52.320
 and not deep can not pass here 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.320
 therefore, according to the battle , we must put 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.040
 shallower I've tried the hour already 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.879
 4 wobblers but took 15 more or less with him 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.210
 depth and will work and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.240
 We put now the kind of turntable means 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.800
 the weather is disgusting constantly 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.500
 changing rain in the sun in general perch in 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.630
 this time is not caught but we will 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.810
 youtube hello dear fishermen 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.950

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.000
 hello to my channel subscribers today 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:36.240
 we are doing comparing catching a perch and 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.100
 compare two bait virtuoso 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:46.680
 Japanese form 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:51.470
 com seen zip baits gr-50 weighing 5 grams 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.909
 and stably working 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.909
 swede turntables no wounds 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.909
 reinforced 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.060
 Finnish crochet q &amp; a probably start 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.190
 Competitions let's see that and zabroshka 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:20.560
 I worked the score 1 1 with I put a beep 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:23.470
 7 grams of the world came down but it is set off 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.270
 Bowl luklu somewhere floating with a piece of grass 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:33.280
 very beautiful right on my fish set 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:42.110
 small as zinchik and immediately bite 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:47.710
 shallow here 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:53.020
 and the score becomes 31 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:59.390
 I lightly bum him but it is natural 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:02.300
 see what it means of course this 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.290
 power but the spinner should not be here 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.160
 play objectively except for 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.160
 the fact that 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.480
 I had two outcomes for her not 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.480
 compares the score and now I’ll say for sure 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.500
 yes 31 more now will be 32 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.410
 spinner catching up riot but then gentlemen i 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.040
 I must pay tribute, I will compare 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.640
 very good catchy wobbler with very 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.440
 there’s not a good turntable 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:53.030
 can and while com seen r50 from debate 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.030
 will pass we will use it 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.200
 while going through with unprotected 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.319
 I mean by hooks 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.799
 then try to protect the hooks but it 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:15.200
 I do not know what will come of it so 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:15.200
 a score of 42 in favor and catchy these Japanese 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:31.910
 off on the score of 87 favor I fingers 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.910
 probably think it's quiet here 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.559
 nothing terrible 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:45.900
 covers see how wrong you are 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.770
 the Swede has just been attacked by a sumo wrestler and 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:53.610
 wanted to drag him to the stands 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:58.930
 we don't need such hockey 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:02.950
 Of course the Swedes are very strong floor 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.940
 hours I could not catch anything and here 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.950
 finally it happens only before 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.400
 thunderstorm 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:18.640
 bass have both y sensitive and 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:26.650
 stop pecking effects this one's not 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:29.910
 need and stop pecking for about 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.910
 an hour before the storm 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:38.770
 just about my 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.500
 They took a beautiful Okushko but mine it's time 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:45.700
 sum it up what's the bottom line 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:49.570
 today's fishing fishing basically 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:55.530
 managed a watery beard of course we are not 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:06:00.870
 grabbed though very hard but 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.870
 the result of this game that we started 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.930
 1010 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:14.880
 I did a great Polish virtuosity 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:20.960
 can sing it back 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.960
 and where to be com seen gr-50 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:34.169
 well and steadily working Swede world vip 

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:41.619
 7 grams reinforced Finnish crochet 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:45.729
 protected class and on this perhaps all 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:48.309
 I say goodbye to you before new meetings 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:55.859
 but I'll probably do some more myself 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:07:01.199
 bullet but the solution for you is obvious 

00:06:55.859 --> 00:07:01.199
 draw your own conclusions for now
