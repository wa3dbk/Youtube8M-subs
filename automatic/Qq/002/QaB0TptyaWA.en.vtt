00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
chain make one double crochet chain one
then<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> same<00:01:38.909> chain<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.840> double

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
then in the same chain make one double

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.800 
then in the same chain make one double
crochet<00:01:40.619> chain<00:01:43.100> one<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.670> same<00:01:45.060> chain<00:01:45.450> make

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
crochet chain one in the same chain make

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.340 
crochet chain one in the same chain make
one<00:01:46.170> double<00:01:46.470> crochet<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.320> four
