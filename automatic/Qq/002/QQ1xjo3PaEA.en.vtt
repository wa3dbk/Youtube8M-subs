00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.200 
for the sake of the video let's just say
you<00:01:37.799> can't<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> peasant<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.030> only

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you can't be a peasant and you can only

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.359 
you can't be a peasant and you can only
choose<00:01:39.600> between<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.079> warrior<00:01:40.350> rogen<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> me<00:01:41.189> I'm

curious as to what you guys would be and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
curious as to what you guys would be and
I<00:01:42.990> think<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> lot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> people's<00:01:43.799> choices<00:01:44.130> will

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I think a lot of people's choices will

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.889 
I think a lot of people's choices will
show<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> lot<00:01:44.970> about<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> person<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.689> general

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
show a lot about the person in general

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
show a lot about the person in general
like<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.680> wanted<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> warrior<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
like if you wanted to be a warrior you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.399 
like if you wanted to be a warrior you
may<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.390> little<00:01:48.570> bit<00:01:48.720> more<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> an

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
may be a little bit more of an

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.810 
may be a little bit more of an
aggressive<00:01:49.500> person<00:01:50.280> although<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:50.579> not

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
aggressive person although that's not

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.429 
aggressive person although that's not
entirely<00:01:51.060> true<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.570> many<00:01:51.659> large

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
entirely true there are many large

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.749 
entirely true there are many large
people<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.369> could<00:01:53.460> beat<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
people out there that could beat the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.980 
people out there that could beat the
shit<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> people<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.570> they're<00:01:54.840> just

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
shit out of people and they're just

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.420 
shit out of people and they're just
really<00:01:55.229> nice<00:01:55.439> people<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.040> think<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.310> says

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
really nice people but I think that says

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.399 
really nice people but I think that says
a<00:01:56.460> lot<00:01:56.670> about<00:01:56.700> PB<00:01:57.149> personally<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.259> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
a lot about PB personally I think I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.569 
a lot about PB personally I think I
would<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> maid<00:01:59.219> even<00:01:59.460> though<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
would want to be a maid even though I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.429 
would want to be a maid even though I
hate<00:02:00.030> reading<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> would<00:02:00.719> probably<00:02:01.290> just

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
hate reading and I would probably just

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.870 
hate reading and I would probably just
fall<00:02:01.649> asleep<00:02:01.770> trying<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> learn<00:02:02.399> half<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
spells I'd probably be a really shit
