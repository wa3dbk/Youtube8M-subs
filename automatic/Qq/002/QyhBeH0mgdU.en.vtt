00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:09.219
 What is the first thing to image that is said to be a poisoned room with a lock? 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:15.099
 Is it like such a cyanide potassium arsenic aconite 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:20.420
 This time the murder was done using an unusual poison that would not normally be considered 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:24.890
 This room is just one animal worth a child of the cloud doors and windows, which were of course closed all any gap 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:30.050
 If I 'm not, where is the one offender gone? 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.140
 From the people various experiences and information for I do not know will hint say one person 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:38.690
 It means that it is easy to judge things by belief 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.410
 Well certainly you will not be able to find a never answer as long as you do not throw away the belief 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.510
 It is awkward to say 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.830
 I guess I'm thinking I'm drinking it I'm thinking that I'm going to make it so that I'm home John 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 I'm also before but I was in full rotation when I was hitting Aging 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:59.220
 The Tteyuu last pen I think that I think everyone where you say 100% 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.800
 But there seems to be no 100% 99 light bulbs 995 only 100 seems not 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.479
 Oh 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.390
 It's going to be a full turn, I guess I'm guessing if I hit it already I'll drop it 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.409
 It's off because it's coming over and waved 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.330
 What I you had me also seen uncle of the next I was by What the hell is reading Te 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.940
 I said Lee, who is totally open 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.790
 Low mountain is 99.99% and there is not 100% ah ah 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.280
 That's right 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.550
 I'm totally convinced that I think it 's difficult to change the school 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.870
 ま す 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:36.980
 I'm thinking = I can not believe that there is no room for doubt because it's a change of mind 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:43.040
 I it is that can not be by yourself 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:47.090
 In the end, this case perpetrator is Mika to Miho Shiraishi 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.270
 Pull out the contents from the outside Shi kill a cloud called Cameron 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.640
 I say that the skin was covered with black poisoned shibogumo 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.390
 Kuwashima do not know anything bitten because you've taken in hand I think that it is another poisonous spider Cameron death 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.000
 The 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.060
 Mikawa 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.210
 The p set to confirm the death of Kuwashima tried to recover the other poison spider and stand in the water tank 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.380
 But for that reason I could not find a cloud 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:15.540
 I was panic and I think that another poison spider when it was bitten to be face to seat 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.990
 Meka came close to Tsujimoto to bring the poisonous spider with the skin of melon 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.090
 Nomoto is a cloud of f 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:28.030
 There was a corpse of another poison spider in there and buy that show water tank of crickets to have as 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.930
 I went into the water tank in search of Shimoyama , but it turned into food for cricket, which was in reverse 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:36.040
 Mikawa who was pushed down finally admitted the crime 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.890
 A lot of clouds l Did you watch while eating ramen in the middle of the night ? 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.060
 Tsuke put the whether Cameron's on I will not to be touch this I the 9 other anymore poison spider 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.500
 Probably a Akanwake 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.920
 It was dry after surprised Mr. trying to do frank in its Kumoore 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.310
 To get rid of the refrigerator or frozen to get rid of the other to hibernate a little 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.959
 Such strategy also Toka Anja Is not it was saying things like 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:03.730
 Well there are a lot of difficult stories out there, but he 's going on the way of the mother ship 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.730
 Oh, it was stuck 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:13.329
 Well, I was quite active in this incident 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:17.950
 Toda Erika Ka- like out ten cockroaches day is a daddy let me know that he has disconnected 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.660
 It came out Nde like a Is not it Bishitsu and shell officers there were many rooms until now in the role 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.130
 I wonder if anyone will do it for a moment 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:29.480
 I also wore glasses and it was a really bad atmosphere. 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:36.680
 It will change if you do not notice that Pad 1 substitute is 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:40.680
 But it behind closed doors is not also shrewd intercept the usual Enomoto decided dialogue Tteyuu torn beneath 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.799
 More year of Hey was a pretty cute per Tteyuu I also 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.230
 Then I wondered if it was a little bit better 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:52.409
 I'd feel like that became good friends something it and Junko paid to'm delicious Sahhe 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.040
 Medium'll not we come a little way Mebae' 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:04:01.689
 Hey 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:06.760
 In the way, capture or self-confidence is certainly in an interview of this official site with respect to Yakudotoro 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:08.109
 Puzzle mystery + little comedy like a style was not in month 9 of until now 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.689
 It may be a taste 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:14.060
 But since I do not have the concept of something like " Month 9" in me, such changes are purely 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.239
 ball 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:23.570
 I feel that it is worthwhile to participate in such works 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.050
 At first it was a feeling like high to hear the contents of the general framework and Mr. Satoshi Ono co-starring 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.260
 From 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.720
 I feel that I will definitely study for myself 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.050
 I wanted to participate by all means, but it is the first time I have been troubled with drugs so far 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.169
 This medicine of Junko 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.940
 I 'm lost and played with trial and error 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:46.830
 Director producer might be because I had a little shift to Junko image also 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:51.000
 I think that my thinking is too big, for example in the play of a little higher tension 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:54.040
 A gap has just been created in the tension that three people imagine 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.750
 But Ms. Enomoto Ms. Serizawa and the first three children 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.830
 Properly be present as already each character is two of you when you shooting extraordinary 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.480
 I have given you 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.500
 Mind I wonder if've seen people say that quasi-v also in me by was able to shoot the scene 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.630
 Is doing 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:15.490
 Anyway Junko seems to be a lawyer and indeed a really good lawyer 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.480
 As a lawyer, I'm always getting over the scene without a request or a court scene 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.870
 It is an impression to say 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.380
 I've been studying for a long time, so I have many friends 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:28.000
 Because there is also a hard part , I sit on the chair 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.290
 It would be nice for me to be a character that is pretty but serious and strange 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.620
 I think 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.490
 Well I said Toda Erika 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:40.760
 If it's kind of bothersome, it's a part of the character called tight character 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:42.440
 Until now it was quite a lot and it was addicted to it, but surely this kind of loose office 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:49.610
 I can not say 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.639
 That's right Nema now guess the movie spec heaven wide have been published in the theater Saaya Toma 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.909
 This image is 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:58.470
 I had a hard time in this blue and role making that say 10, including the still strong only in the differentiation 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:02.640
 I think I 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:07.820
 It's probably a room with a lock on it 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.820
 Value ordering physician that I would like to be firmly Mitodoke future
