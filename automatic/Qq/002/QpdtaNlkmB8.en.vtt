00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.859
 uncommon colors on canvas 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:12.399
 welcome to the world meeting of body art in Caracas 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.469
 here are artists from 17 countries 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.080
 one of the greatest exponents is the Mexican penÃ©lope rivera pioneer in 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.789
 use of techniques that combine ancestral traditions and contemporary painting 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.569
 why think a human being 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.579
 the body by itself 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.039
 its beautiful 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.040
 painted is magnified guinness in that sense 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.680
 ulises three premises any body 10 we have now we could have a single 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.370
 design 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.380
 and 10 ports of sines decided well different 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.460
 in the work of the artist can be seen for example of these representations of 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.830
 very Mexican death 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.420
 and although most p 2 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 reasons that the entity this meeting 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.150
 of body art and it has to do with how many centuries as it happens whenever 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.549
 can 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.020
 rotondo and then painter 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.020
 there are also some hits of reality like absorbing 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 another person who already bullet alone 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.920
 the footprint of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 five months 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.120
 but even that is not easy 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.520
 the model has to know how to be still while they paint it and then move 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.570
 to express what the painter seeks to communicate 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.570
 nothing seems that little can be done 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.980
 but the 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 nice they learn many things at once 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.650
 it could be said that body painting is an ephemeral art because these 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.550
 designs that took up to eight hours between maple 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.460
 band disappear in a few minutes when the works of art come out of the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.300
 display 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.520
 and it takes a long time 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.859
 from the meeting of body art in Caracas to ask for that world 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:11.749
