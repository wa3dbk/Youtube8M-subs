 proposed medium-term

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.359
 it yields little if it is a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 investment that even has a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 currency protection because it will use 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.990

 just to look at the title that goes 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.210
 invest try to marry the title term 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.340
 with the term of the investment now which 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 it would be the best place they find 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.660
 investments in brokerage firms. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.690
