resolutions and sort of try to execute

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.340 
resolutions and sort of try to execute
them<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> systematic<00:01:03.570> basis<00:01:03.989> throughout

them on a systematic basis throughout
the<00:01:04.650> year<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.820> always<00:01:06.119> set<00:01:06.390> goals<00:01:06.600> for

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the year I do always set goals for

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.469 
the year I do always set goals for
myself<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:08.070> figured<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.460> why<00:01:09.450> not

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
myself and I figured now that why not

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
myself and I figured now that why not
seems<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:10.710> appropriate<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.430> than

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
seems like a more appropriate time than

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
seems like a more appropriate time than
ever<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.510> sort<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> share<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> ask<00:01:13.409> for

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ever to to sort of share it to ask for

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.359 
ever to to sort of share it to ask for
feedback<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.140> whatever<00:01:17.100> else

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
feedback and I don't know whatever else

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
feedback and I don't know whatever else
might<00:01:18.180> come<00:01:18.540> up<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.259> let<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
might come up and let in the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.899 
might come up and let in the
conversation<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:21.770> guess<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> floor<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.369> as

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
conversation so I guess this floor is as

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.920 
conversation so I guess this floor is as
far<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.780> New<00:01:24.930> Year<00:01:25.229> goes<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:27.659> sure

breakfast<00:02:20.230> at<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.950> time<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:22.180> always

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
breakfast at that time I I do always

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.080 
breakfast at that time I I do always
feel<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:23.290> I'm<00:02:23.470> more<00:02:23.710> productive<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.760> days

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
feel like I'm more productive on days

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.000 
feel like I'm more productive on days
that<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.420> wake<00:02:25.660> up<00:02:25.870> early<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.200> I'd<00:02:26.740> like<00:02:26.950> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
that I do wake up early and I'd like to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.100 
that I do wake up early and I'd like to
make<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.850> more<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.240> regular<00:02:28.390> thing<00:02:28.630> and

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
make that more of a regular thing and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.860 
make that more of a regular thing and
then<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.250> obviously<00:02:31.000> translates<00:02:31.600> into

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
then that obviously translates into

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.130 
then that obviously translates into
video<00:02:32.800> making<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.400> where<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:34.720> perfectly

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
video making to where to be perfectly

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.360 
video making to where to be perfectly
honest<00:02:35.590> some<00:02:36.160> days<00:02:36.400> I'm<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:37.020> like<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.370> don't

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
honest some days I'm just like I don't

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.330 
honest some days I'm just like I don't
really<00:02:39.580> feel<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.180> editing<00:02:40.830> video<00:02:41.830> together

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
really feel like editing video together

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.920 
really feel like editing video together
and<00:02:44.220> therefore<00:02:45.220> one<00:02:45.520> might<00:02:45.820> not<00:02:46.210> go<00:02:46.570> up<00:02:46.660> that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
and therefore one might not go up that

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.610 
and therefore one might not go up that
day<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:48.010> try<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.880> do<00:02:49.600> like<00:02:49.810> sort<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.230> one<00:02:50.380> video

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
day I try to do like sort of a one video

whenever<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.210> works<00:02:55.570> out<00:02:55.840> but<00:02:55.990> it<00:02:56.140> sort<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.680> I'd

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
whenever it works out but it sort of I'd

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.510 
whenever it works out but it sort of I'd
like<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.640> try<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.650> make<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.130> when<00:03:00.460> a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
like to try to make it so that when a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.420 
like to try to make it so that when a
day<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:01.030> skipped<00:03:01.360> it's<00:03:01.780> for<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.500> legitimate

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
day is skipped it's for a legitimate

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.110 
day is skipped it's for a legitimate
reason<00:03:04.030> as<00:03:04.390> opposed<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.960> I<00:03:05.430> just<00:03:06.430> didn't<00:03:06.970> feel

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
reason as opposed to I just didn't feel

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.180 
reason as opposed to I just didn't feel
like<00:03:07.180> editing<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.900> video<00:03:07.990> today<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:10.860> yeah<00:03:11.860> that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
like editing a video today so yeah that

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.720 
like editing a video today so yeah that
that's<00:03:12.850> one<00:03:13.660> sort<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.230> big<00:03:14.830> thing<00:03:15.160> for<00:03:15.370> me<00:03:15.430> for

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
that's one sort of big thing for me for

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.699 
that's one sort of big thing for me for
example<00:03:16.060> on<00:03:16.450> top<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:16.930> like<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.470> reason

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
example on top of that like the reason

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.020 
example on top of that like the reason
I'm<00:03:17.800> wearing<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.100> beanie<00:03:18.280> right<00:03:18.580> now<00:03:18.760> is

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
I'm wearing a beanie right now is

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.380 
I'm wearing a beanie right now is
because<00:03:19.990> I<00:03:20.380> have<00:03:20.740> not<00:03:21.370> gone<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.000> got<00:03:22.180> my

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
because I have not gone and got my

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.810 
because I have not gone and got my
haircut<00:03:22.540> which<00:03:22.959> again<00:03:23.410> translates<00:03:24.010> into<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
haircut which again translates into the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.720 
haircut which again translates into the
laziness<00:03:25.209> thing<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:27.100> is<00:03:27.250> something<00:03:27.430> I'd

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
laziness thing so that is something I'd

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.770 
laziness thing so that is something I'd
certainly<00:03:28.090> like<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> work<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.370> think

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
certainly like to work on and I think

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.350 
certainly like to work on and I think
with<00:03:31.780> enough<00:03:32.160> with<00:03:33.160> enough<00:03:33.370> self<00:03:33.670> motivation

up as the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.360 
up as the
a<00:04:25.900> place<00:04:26.229> I'd<00:04:26.410> be<00:04:26.440> responding<00:04:27.010> because<00:04:27.100> it

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
a place I'd be responding because it

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.740

seems<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.850> be<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.030> easiest<00:04:28.060> given<00:04:28.630> that

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
seems to be the easiest given that

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.820 
seems to be the easiest given that
questions<00:04:29.110> are<00:04:29.229> pretty<00:04:29.320> short<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.650> concise

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
questions are pretty short and concise

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.300 
questions are pretty short and concise
within<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.850> character<00:04:31.180> limits<00:04:31.540> it's<00:04:32.310> much

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
within the character limits it's much

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.240 
within the character limits it's much
easier<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:33.790> I<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.449> a<00:04:34.720> conversation<00:04:35.440> on<00:04:36.220> that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
easier to I have a conversation on that

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.040 
easier to I have a conversation on that
so<00:04:36.880> anyway

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
there and whatnots and I guess those are

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.900 
there and whatnots and I guess those are
those<00:04:53.500> are<00:04:53.710> two<00:04:53.889> things<00:04:54.160> that<00:04:54.310> sort<00:04:54.669> of<00:04:54.760> come

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
those are two things that sort of come

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.310 
those are two things that sort of come
to<00:04:54.940> mind<00:04:55.150> then<00:04:55.990> keeping<00:04:56.889> more<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.370> a

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
to mind then keeping more of a

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.700 
to mind then keeping more of a
consistent<00:04:59.320> schedule<00:04:59.800> the<00:05:00.190> videos<00:05:00.550> going<00:05:00.940> up

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
consistent schedule the videos going up

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.930 
consistent schedule the videos going up
and<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:03.820> course<00:05:04.260> doing<00:05:05.260> music<00:05:06.010> videos<00:05:06.370> I<00:05:06.669> don't

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
even have to bring that up because they

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.860

at this point I figure that rather than

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.210 
at this point I figure that rather than
me<00:05:22.660> going<00:05:22.690> on<00:05:23.229> about<00:05:23.530> things<00:05:23.889> that<00:05:24.070> I've
