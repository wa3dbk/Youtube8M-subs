the<00:00:13.799> system<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.219> bit<00:00:14.340> early<00:00:14.940> was<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:15.960> a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the system a bit early was in on a

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.779 
the system a bit early was in on a
Kickstarter<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.770> guys<00:00:17.070> show<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.340> off<00:00:17.490> what

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
Kickstarter so I guys show you off what

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.730 
Kickstarter so I guys show you off what
the<00:00:17.910> system<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.390> what<00:00:18.750> some<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> games<00:00:19.500> are

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the system is what some of the games are

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.679 
the system is what some of the games are
mainly<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.850> today<00:00:21.119> let's<00:00:21.390> look<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.990> Oh<00:00:23.689> what

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
mainly so today let's look at Oh what

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.560 
mainly so today let's look at Oh what
didn't<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.050> look<00:00:25.199> at<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.529> yet<00:00:26.240> how<00:00:27.240> about<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
didn't we look at it yet how about the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
didn't we look at it yet how about the
sci-fi<00:00:27.900> ters<00:00:32.480> don't<00:00:33.480> done<00:00:34.280> single<00:00:35.280> game<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
sci-fi ters don't done single game I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.230 
sci-fi ters don't done single game I
have<00:00:36.300> no<00:00:36.570> friends<00:00:37.190> moving<00:00:38.190> on

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
so there's a good look at the controller

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.090 
so there's a good look at the controller
for<00:00:42.160> those<00:00:42.280> who<00:00:42.400> haven't<00:00:42.550> seen<00:00:42.700> it<00:00:42.910> yet<00:00:43.060> and

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
developed you probably before the system

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.520 
developed you probably before the system
was<00:02:03.009> oh<00:02:04.860> well<00:02:05.860> not<00:02:06.189> backfired<00:02:06.670> on<00:02:06.819> you<00:02:07.410> come<00:02:08.410> on

probably<00:02:31.750> developed<00:02:32.730> before<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.090> system<00:02:34.510> was

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
probably developed before the system was

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.879 
probably developed before the system was
even<00:02:34.840> out<00:02:34.900> with<00:02:35.109> a<00:02:35.139> developer<00:02:35.680> gift<00:02:36.870> haha<00:02:37.889> that
