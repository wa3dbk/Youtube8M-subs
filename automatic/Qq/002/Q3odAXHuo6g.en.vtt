00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.080 
whether you wanted the boss on the enemy
team<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.790> pretty<00:01:39.030> much

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
team or not but in this you pretty much

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.819 
team or not but in this you pretty much
just<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.079> your<00:01:40.110> team<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.740> I'd

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
just have to do it on your team so I'd

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.050 
just have to do it on your team so I'd
recommend<00:01:40.979> putting<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> way<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
recommend putting it all the way up to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.230 
recommend putting it all the way up to
11<00:01:42.570> um<00:01:42.689> bot<00:01:43.619> difficulty<00:01:44.280> doesn't<00:01:44.880> matter<00:01:45.030> at

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
11 um bot difficulty doesn't matter at

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.280 
11 um bot difficulty doesn't matter at
all<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.420> they're<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.110> your

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
all because they're going to be on your

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.260 
all because they're going to be on your
team<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.770> no<00:01:47.040> enemy<00:01:47.430> buffs<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:48.060> want

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
team and no enemy buffs you don't want

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.749 
team and no enemy buffs you don't want
pots<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> other<00:01:49.259> team<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
pots that are on the other team and so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.249 
pots that are on the other team and so
all<00:01:51.030> you're<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> do<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.930> you're

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
all you're going to want to do is you're

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.899 
all you're going to want to do is you're
going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:52.560> ahead<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.100> start<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> match

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
going to go ahead and start up the match

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.950 
going to go ahead and start up the match
just<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.840> now<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.610> yeah<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> only

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
just like it is now and yeah the only

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
just like it is now and yeah the only
problem<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> main

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
problem with this this is the main

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.209 
problem with this this is the main
problem<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.210> i've<00:02:00.390> found<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.890> have

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
problem that i've found is that you have

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.700 
problem that i've found is that you have
to<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> map<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.880> has<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.600> spots<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to do a map that has good spots for the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.139 
to do a map that has good spots for the
blitz<00:02:05.189> pond<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.700> you're<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
blitz pond so you're going to have to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.690 
blitz pond so you're going to have to
experiment<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:07.290> bit<00:02:07.520> it's<00:02:08.520> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
experiment with that a little bit it's a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.729 
experiment with that a little bit it's a
little<00:02:08.729> difficult<00:02:09.119> sometimes<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> maps

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
little difficult sometimes with the maps

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.380 
little difficult sometimes with the maps
but<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.069> stormfront<00:02:11.700> has<00:02:11.879> good<00:02:12.060> spots

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
but I know stormfront has good spots

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.240 
but I know stormfront has good spots
this<00:02:12.569> map<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.780> good

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
this map is good

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.660 
this map is good
uh<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.750> think<00:02:14.990> Stonehaven<00:02:15.950> has<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.130> good<00:02:16.370> one<00:02:16.520> I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
uh I think Stonehaven has a good one I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.700 
uh I think Stonehaven has a good one I
don't<00:02:16.820> really<00:02:17.060> know<00:02:17.360> exactly<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.960> knot<00:02:18.170> but

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
don't really know exactly the knot but

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.380 
don't really know exactly the knot but
all<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:18.980> want<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.160> do<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.400> auto<00:02:19.640> assign<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
all you want to do is auto assign and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.900 
all you want to do is auto assign and
you<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.990> look<00:02:21.140> at<00:02:21.260> where<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> bots<00:02:21.680> pawn<00:02:22.040> this

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
you can look at where the bots pawn this

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.550 
you can look at where the bots pawn this
sides<00:02:23.150> really<00:02:23.450> good<00:02:23.630> but<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.050> can<00:02:24.170> always<00:02:24.290> go

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
sides really good but you can always go

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.900 
sides really good but you can always go
ahead<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.860> look<00:02:24.980> at<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.160> other<00:02:25.310> team<00:02:25.520> and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.070 

check<00:02:28.910> if<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.120> like<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.420> spot<00:02:29.720> better<00:02:29.900> I

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
check if you like that spot better I

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.280 
check if you like that spot better I
personally<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.570> side<00:02:32.840> by<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.050> house

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
personally like the side by the house

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.020 
personally like the side by the house
better<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:34.100> you're<00:02:34.280> just<00:02:34.430> going<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.670> pick<00:02:34.850> your

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
better so you're just going to pick your

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.420 
better so you're just going to pick your
spot<00:02:35.330> now<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.870> few<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> box<00:02:36.800> should<00:02:37.130> spawn

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
spot now a few of the box should spawn

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.560 
spot now a few of the box should spawn
around<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:37.910> as<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.240> see<00:02:38.270> they're

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
around you and as you can see they're

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.880 
around you and as you can see they're
running<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:38.959> over<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.170> place<00:02:39.260> like<00:02:39.530> crazy

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
running all over the place like crazy

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.670 
running all over the place like crazy
but<00:02:40.459> if<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.120> almost<00:02:41.420> stay<00:02:41.660> back<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.230> that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
but if you almost stay back and that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.230 
but if you almost stay back and that
will<00:02:42.890> just<00:02:43.190> give<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.520> better<00:02:43.730> shot<00:02:44.209> than

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
will just give you a better shot than

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.360 
will just give you a better shot than
you<00:02:44.540> only<00:02:44.750> have<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.650> having<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.010> shot<00:02:46.190> in

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
you only have and having a shot in

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.550 
you only have and having a shot in
private<00:02:46.730> match<00:02:46.820> versus<00:02:47.209> one<00:02:47.420> dump<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.930> I

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
private match versus one dump and I

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.199 
private match versus one dump and I
personally<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.459> because<00:02:49.580> this<00:02:50.000> game

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
personally like that because this game

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.870 
personally like that because this game
is<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:50.750> hard<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.200> its<00:02:51.620> stuff<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.160> when<00:02:52.760> you're

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
is so hard to its stuff in when you're

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.030 
is so hard to its stuff in when you're
just<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.180> private<00:02:53.510> match<00:02:53.600> by<00:02:53.840> yourself<00:02:54.230> so

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
just in private match by yourself so

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.010 
just in private match by yourself so
yeah<00:02:55.489> obviously<00:02:55.910> these<00:02:56.330> dummies<00:02:56.660> going

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
yeah obviously these dummies going

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.540 
yeah obviously these dummies going
around<00:02:57.260> you'll<00:02:57.800> have<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.070> experiment<00:02:58.370> with

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
around you'll have to experiment with

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.220 
around you'll have to experiment with
this<00:02:58.700> spots<00:02:59.209> that's<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.600> most<00:02:59.750> important

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
this spots that's the most important

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.270 
this spots that's the most important
thing<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.410> don't<00:03:00.650> know<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.860> way<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.070> like

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
thing we don't know a way to like

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.610 
thing we don't know a way to like
actually<00:03:01.489> really<00:03:02.270> pick<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.720> spots<00:03:03.050> for<00:03:03.470> the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
actually really pick the spots for the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.470 
actually really pick the spots for the
teams<00:03:03.890> yet<00:03:04.130> but<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.640> good<00:03:04.760> thing<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:05.030> even

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
teams yet but the good thing is even

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.390
