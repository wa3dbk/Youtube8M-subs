into<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.149> wall<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.350> here

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
into the wall and then this right here

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.910 
into the wall and then this right here
will<00:01:49.829> glow<00:01:50.159> green<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:52.259> you'll<00:01:52.500> turn<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
will glow green and then you'll turn it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.039 
will glow green and then you'll turn it
on<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> doesn't<00:01:54.060> make<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> very<00:01:54.570> loud<00:01:54.990> noise

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
on and it doesn't make a very loud noise

skin you don't want to stop because that

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.430 
skin you don't want to stop because that

sure<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.810> always<00:02:48.989> keep<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.709> moving<00:02:50.040> when<00:02:50.190> it's

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
sure to always keep it moving when it's

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.550 
sure to always keep it moving when it's
on<00:02:50.400> my<00:02:50.580> skin<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.480> you're<00:02:51.690> someone<00:02:52.110> who<00:02:52.379> was

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
on my skin and if you're someone who was

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.680 
on my skin and if you're someone who was
looking<00:02:52.590> into<00:02:53.160> getting<00:02:53.690> microdermabrasion

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
looking into getting microdermabrasion

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.259 
looking into getting microdermabrasion
done<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.230> would<00:02:55.800> definitely<00:02:56.010> suggest<00:02:56.640> trying

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
done I would definitely suggest trying

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.880 
done I would definitely suggest trying
this<00:02:57.569> out<00:02:57.750> before<00:02:58.019> actually<00:02:58.560> going<00:02:58.739> somewhere

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
this out before actually going somewhere

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.280 
this out before actually going somewhere
to<00:02:59.250> get<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.400> done<00:02:59.670> because<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.050> long<00:03:01.230> run

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
to get it done because in the long run

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.649 
to get it done because in the long run
this<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.129> going<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:02.819> much<00:03:02.970> cheaper<00:03:03.450> and

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
this is going to be so much cheaper and

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.899 
this is going to be so much cheaper and
works<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.379> as<00:03:04.590> good<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.860> not<00:03:05.069> better<00:03:05.280> than

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
works just as good if not better than

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.149 
works just as good if not better than
actually<00:03:06.269> going<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.230> paying<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.800> get<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.040> done

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
actually going and paying to get it done

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.130 
actually going and paying to get it done
every<00:03:08.519> single<00:03:08.550> time<00:03:09.000> when<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.629> can<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.840> have

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
every single time when you can just have

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.770 
every single time when you can just have
one<00:03:10.470> thing<00:03:10.800> forever<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.700> always<00:03:11.970> use<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.599> in

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
one thing forever and always use it in

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.750 
one thing forever and always use it in
my<00:03:13.140> opinion<00:03:13.409> it's<00:03:13.709> going<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.099> be<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.610> much

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
my opinion it's going to be so much

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.839 
my opinion it's going to be so much
cheaper<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.720> PMD<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.290> comes<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.430> box

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
cheaper so the PMD it comes in a box

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.600 
cheaper so the PMD it comes in a box
that<00:03:18.090> looks<00:03:18.300> like<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.500> then<00:03:20.010> it'll<00:03:20.280> also

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
that looks like this and then it'll also

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.479 
that looks like this and then it'll also
