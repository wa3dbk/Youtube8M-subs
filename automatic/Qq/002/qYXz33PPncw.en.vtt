in place by the thread the problem with

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.730 
in place by the thread the problem with
making<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.920> tool<00:01:53.659> like<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
making a tool like that is that the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.490 
making a tool like that is that the
threads<00:01:56.100> are<00:01:56.369> not<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.909> standard<00:01:57.469> type<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
threads are not a standard type of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.020 
threads are not a standard type of
thread<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.070> would<00:01:59.189> find<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.700> everyday

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
thread that you would find in everyday

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.080 
thread that you would find in everyday
use<00:02:00.390> around<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:00.990> shop<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:01.979> can't<00:02:02.369> just

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
use around your shop so you can't just

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.080 
use around your shop so you can't just
go<00:02:03.329> down<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.750> purchase<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.500> nipple<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> try<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
go down and purchase a nipple and try to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.359 
go down and purchase a nipple and try to
insert<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:06.990> because<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:08.039> threads

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
insert it in there because the threads

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.479 
insert it in there because the threads
won't<00:02:08.610> match<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.590> next<00:02:10.830> step<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.459> to

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
won't match up so the next step is is to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.530 
won't match up so the next step is is to
try<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> figure<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.090> how

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
try to figure out how

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.559 
try to figure out how
to<00:02:12.689> attach<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.560> tool<00:02:13.980> inside<00:02:14.909> there<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.390> will

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
to attach a tool inside there that will

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.690 
to attach a tool inside there that will
work<00:02:15.689> so<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.560> first<00:02:16.829> thing<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.099> thought<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
work so the first thing I thought of is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.170 
work so the first thing I thought of is
how<00:02:18.090> about<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.269> pipe<00:02:18.480> expander<00:02:19.109> so<00:02:19.439> I<00:02:20.370> went<00:02:21.000> on

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
how about a pipe expander so I went on

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.089 
how about a pipe expander so I went on
and<00:02:21.390> took<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.049> look<00:02:22.290> at<00:02:22.439> it<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.680> said<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.010> know

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
and took a look at it I said you know

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.880 
and took a look at it I said you know
that<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.489> might<00:02:23.640> work<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.469> a<00:02:25.500> list<00:02:25.739> of

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
that just might work we have a list of

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.740 
that just might work we have a list of
things<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.159> I<00:02:26.310> put<00:02:26.549> together<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.480> think

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
things that I put together that I think

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.839 
things that I put together that I think
are<00:02:27.870> gonna<00:02:27.959> make<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.379> work<00:02:28.439> I<00:02:28.980> haven't<00:02:29.700> built

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
are gonna make this work I haven't built

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.640 
are gonna make this work I haven't built
the<00:02:29.970> tool<00:02:30.209> yet<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.629> you're<00:02:30.780> gonna<00:02:30.900> watch<00:02:31.170> see

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the tool yet but you're gonna watch see

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.979 
the tool yet but you're gonna watch see
and<00:02:31.939> learning<00:02:32.939> maybe<00:02:33.299> we<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.840> this

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
and learning maybe we can do this

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.839 
and learning maybe we can do this
together<00:02:36.680> try<00:02:37.680> putting<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.069> pipe<00:02:38.280> expander

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
together try putting the pipe expander

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.479 
together try putting the pipe expander
in<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.359> just<00:02:40.260> give<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.769> little<00:02:40.920> turn

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
in here and just give it a little turn

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.520 
in here and just give it a little turn
you<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.819> too<00:02:42.060> little<00:02:42.150> pressure<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.629> it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
you have too little pressure on it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.259 
you have too little pressure on it
it<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.799> little<00:02:43.980> bit<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.370> starts<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.909> expand

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
it a little bit so it starts to expand

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.530 
it a little bit so it starts to expand
it<00:02:45.810> looks<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.379> though<00:02:46.730> when<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.030> happens

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
it looks as though when this happens

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.780 
it looks as though when this happens
it's<00:02:48.810> firm<00:02:49.260> enough<00:02:49.500> if<00:02:49.739> we<00:02:50.340> tighten<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.760> down

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
it's firm enough if we tighten it down

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.030 
it's firm enough if we tighten it down
that<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.329> will<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.659> it<00:02:52.109> will<00:02:52.139> provide<00:02:52.530> certain

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that it will be it will provide certain

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.710 
that it will be it will provide certain
amount<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.879> friction<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.269> will<00:02:54.450> hold<00:02:54.599> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
amount of friction that will hold the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.949 
amount of friction that will hold the
tool<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.019> place<00:02:55.139> so<00:02:56.269> we'll<00:02:57.269> give<00:02:57.419> that<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.599> shot

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
that you can attach that will actually

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.450 
that you can attach that will actually
compress<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:25.270> helix<00:05:25.690> down<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.169> then<00:05:27.070> hold<00:05:27.310> it

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
compress the helix down and then hold it

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.400 
compress the helix down and then hold it
in<00:05:27.580> place<00:05:27.700> while<00:05:27.970> you<00:05:28.090> can<00:05:28.270> remove<00:05:28.570> the<00:05:29.140> four

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
in place while you can remove the four

in place while you can remove the four
Torx<00:05:29.740> screws<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:32.710> what<00:05:32.860> we're<00:05:32.980> going<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.130> do

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
Torx screws so what we're going to do

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.440 
Torx screws so what we're going to do
first<00:05:33.520> is<00:05:33.700> we're<00:05:33.790> going<00:05:33.910> to<00:05:33.970> start<00:05:34.210> right

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
first is we're going to start right

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.750 
first is we're going to start right
welding<00:05:35.440> this<00:05:36.370> nut<00:05:36.610> on<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.960> this<00:05:38.710> shaft<00:05:39.010> of<00:05:39.340> the

welding this nut on to this shaft of the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.310 
welding this nut on to this shaft of the
tail<00:05:39.970> pipe<00:05:40.210> expander<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:42.900> that<00:05:43.900> should<00:05:44.200> be

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
tail pipe expander and that should be

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.010 
tail pipe expander and that should be
done<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:44.830> that<00:05:45.010> it<00:05:45.190> is<00:05:45.340> perpendicular

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
done so that it is perpendicular

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.820 
done so that it is perpendicular
straight<00:05:47.020> up<00:05:47.140> and<00:05:47.229> down<00:05:47.260> as<00:05:47.530> you<00:05:47.710> could

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
straight up and down as you could

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.790 
straight up and down as you could
possibly<00:05:48.010> get<00:05:48.490> it<00:05:49.110> so<00:05:50.110> that<00:05:50.260> you<00:05:50.410> don't<00:05:50.560> have<00:05:50.740> a

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
possibly get it so that you don't have a

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.610 
possibly get it so that you don't have a
crooked<00:05:51.160> shaft<00:05:51.580> coming<00:05:51.910> out<00:05:52.120> try<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:52.960> compress

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
crooked shaft coming out try to compress

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.020 
crooked shaft coming out try to compress
that<00:05:53.650> spring<00:05:53.830> with<00:05:54.280> you<00:05:54.400> want<00:05:54.550> it<00:05:54.669> as<00:05:54.790> straight

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
that spring with you want it as straight

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.370 
that spring with you want it as straight
as<00:05:55.180> possible<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:56.850> well<00:05:57.850> do<00:05:58.000> that<00:05:58.210> I'm<00:05:59.200> right

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
as possible so well do that I'm right

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.590 
as possible so well do that I'm right
