 Sing this in the words of the most recent person here and in this

 Once I enter, I understand the pace once for Yamamura Koji 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.019
 It was difficult for Kuniyoshi-cho 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.669
 Last year 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.589
 For a great grilled meat set 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.430
 I have a little personality 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.120
 Three times this won 8-2 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 These attacks are intensely planned as the first shot and two 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.950
 Price is undecided after this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.060
 It will be like this if you write 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.280
 You may think that it is a form seen somewhere, this equipment to do 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.310
 I made use of authentication characteristics 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.220

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.000
 Will be together 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.510

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.230
 I will do it 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.470
 It was just one set because it was one set on the second floor of the apartment 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.000
 Instruction 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.590
 I spoke a little 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.080
 It has been from now on but so much 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 It was usually hard to come to this 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.560
 This result was 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.080
 I want to meet a music 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.880

 I have acquired crypto beta 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.910

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.880

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.830
 Others who sang a song 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.319
 End 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.389
 I still have a structural aspect 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.049
 At the same time its Japanese corporate identity 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.049

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.579
 So it may be hard to love jasdaq 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.689

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.680

 Big inning eyes become club of 23 points 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.289
 Why so much 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.269
 I think it will take a year 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.019
 As we think with general 800 yen Grammy 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.659
 The rest 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.009
 Not video

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.859
 Much higher 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.089
 New plan 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.649
 Tourists came when you entered 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.079
 As we can do for this mug a little near 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.499
 here 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.619
 I will divide it here 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.559
 Until it is half-scalar of green it 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:24.559
 * One step after 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.349
 Sweet and sour 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.169
 First in 57 years 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.409
 It's a shame 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.409
 Acrylic board in the Edo period 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.569
 As we do not have to figure below, leaves 8.3. 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.259
 But i'm shaking 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:13.209

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.089

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:19.719
 It turned out so far 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.800
 The fact that it may be said easily 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.880
 Please note 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.139
 Japan's Government 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.759
