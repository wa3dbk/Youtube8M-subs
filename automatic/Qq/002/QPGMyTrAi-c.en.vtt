00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.340
 what's nice about grilling is that it's not for 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.170
 You are something that you share with all 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.900
 world and the most beautiful part of that is when 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.210
 they are in those that you feel a 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.430
 satisfaction of having done something 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.650
 to make someone happy the people we 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.510
 says what is your secret is the love that 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.850
 we have this and it is true 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.860
 transmits and they appreciate it and 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.810
 we also if passion is passion 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.619
 we like to complicate ourselves 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.869
 We are 10 chefs the smoke because 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.730
 we love to smoke steel because the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.730
 grill the typical north 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.319
 I to jose julian the connections with the 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.019
 medicine and talking, or whatever 

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:45.579
 like cooking I like to eat 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.229
 friendship then the first time that 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.879
 we prepared something was in my house and I 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.739
 it was very good as it grows 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.989
 the friendship because I saw that he liked 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.690
 grill we did raise a little more 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.309
 level to the typical roast beef that 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.100
 let's be on the grill we did not put 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.649
 investigate then that there were the marks 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.170
 a company on Thursday every day because the 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.390
 first thing we bought was a back in 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.820
 arts smoker this we got him quite 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.580
 roaster game and then we entered more the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.799
 We bought another mania that was the one 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.869
 touch with the difference of a rotisserie 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.030
 traditional that everyone knows and 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.640
 a spit webber as one the quality 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.380
 It is very good the finish that has the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.630
 finishing of the meat this is very 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700
 different in a traditional new egg 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.009
 I really like the ease that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.069
 has is to remove the lid to 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.200

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.619
 the coal with your oil napkin what 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.630
 It turns on if you were doing much smoke

 very rich of smoked is not a very 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.500
 bothersome black and the products that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.170
 has webber as there is a fireplace 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.380

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.000
 cubit down paraffin you turn it on and it 's 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.250
