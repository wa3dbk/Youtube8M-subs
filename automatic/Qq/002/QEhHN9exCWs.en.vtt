00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the original pro light range was

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.400 
the original pro light range was
massively<00:00:17.820> successful<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.930> really<00:00:19.230> good

carp anglers have always loved black
tackle<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.199> really<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.560> down<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
tackle and really it was just down to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.189 
tackle and really it was just down to
the<00:00:29.220> man<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.760> many<00:00:30.000> people<00:00:30.390> were<00:00:30.599> asking<00:00:31.050> us

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the man so many people were asking us

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.979 
the man so many people were asking us
for<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.470> black<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.520> as<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.969> company<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.480> had

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
for the black that as a company we had

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
for the black that as a company we had
to<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.500> satisfy<00:00:34.820> customer<00:00:35.820> demand<00:00:36.120> base

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to do it to satisfy customer demand base

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
to do it to satisfy customer demand base
it's<00:00:36.600> simple<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> well<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.129> looks<00:00:38.280> all

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
it's simple as that well it looks all

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
it's simple as that well it looks all
too<00:00:38.790> smart<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.210> what's<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> difference

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
too smart so what's the difference

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.280 
too smart so what's the difference
we've<00:00:41.300> cosmetically<00:00:42.300> changed<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> top<00:00:43.050> here

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
we've cosmetically changed the top here

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
we've cosmetically changed the top here
rather<00:00:43.500> than<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> original<00:00:44.670> pro<00:00:44.850> lot

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
rather than the on the original pro lot

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.869 
rather than the on the original pro lot
it<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.360> nolde<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.410> has<00:00:46.530> been<00:00:46.680> updated<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it was nolde so this has been updated to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.600 
it was nolde so this has been updated to
match<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.800> stainless<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> three<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.370> six

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
match the stainless the three one six

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
match the stainless the three one six
range<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.210> apart<00:00:51.629> from<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
range and apart from that it's just a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.760 
range and apart from that it's just a
black<00:00:53.010> hard<00:00:53.610> anodized<00:00:54.270> finish<00:00:55.050> we've

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
black hard anodized finish we've

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.400 
black hard anodized finish we've
streamlined<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.000> range<00:00:57.180> slightly<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.199> well

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
streamlined the range slightly as well

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.250 
streamlined the range slightly as well
there's<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.399> three<00:01:00.180> sizes<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
there's going to be three sizes in the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.460 
there's going to be three sizes in the
three<00:01:01.469> rod<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.890> three<00:01:02.760> sizes<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> two<00:01:04.229> rod

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
three rod and three sizes in the two rod

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.580 
three rod and three sizes in the two rod
and<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.750> sizes<00:01:07.140> are<00:01:07.290> slightly

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and also they're the sizes are slightly

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130 
and also they're the sizes are slightly
more<00:01:07.830> different<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
more different so as you can see on the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
more different so as you can see on the
setup<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.340> choose<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> sizes

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
setup here if you choose the sizes

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.080 
setup here if you choose the sizes
correctly<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.350> slightly<00:01:13.680> more<00:01:14.090> splayed

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
correctly you get slightly more splayed

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
correctly you get slightly more splayed
out<00:01:15.119> rods<00:01:15.750> rather<00:01:16.080> than<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.830> pro<00:01:17.070> light<00:01:17.280> ones

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
out rods rather than the pro light ones

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.219 
out rods rather than the pro light ones
which<00:01:17.850> were<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:19.049> parallel<00:01:19.700> also<00:01:21.229> customers

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
which were very parallel also customers

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
which were very parallel also customers
were<00:01:22.350> asking<00:01:22.500> us<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.090> whilst<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.479> LEDs

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
were asking us that whilst a lot of LEDs

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.590 
were asking us that whilst a lot of LEDs
do<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> narrow<00:01:25.439> ones<00:01:25.790> some<00:01:26.790> some<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
do like the narrow ones some some of the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
do like the narrow ones some some of the
LEDs<00:01:27.780> were<00:01:28.049> they<00:01:28.710> didn't<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.549> rods<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
LEDs were they didn't like the rods you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.550 
LEDs were they didn't like the rods you
know<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> rules<00:01:30.509> too<00:01:30.780> close<00:01:31.049> together<00:01:31.290> etc

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
know the rules too close together etc

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.280 
know the rules too close together etc
and<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.820> made<00:01:33.119> some<00:01:33.390> wider<00:01:33.780> bars<00:01:34.110> as

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and so we have made some wider bars as

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
and so we have made some wider bars as
well<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.740> range<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
well in this range so so just as a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210 
well in this range so so just as a
preference<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:36.930> yeah<00:01:37.740> well<00:01:38.040> we've

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
preference really yeah well we've

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
preference really yeah well we've
listened<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:38.790> our<00:01:38.820> customers<00:01:39.060> wanted

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
listened to what our customers wanted

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170 
listened to what our customers wanted
and<00:01:39.950> rather<00:01:40.950> than<00:01:41.100> confusing<00:01:41.790> people<00:01:41.939> with

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and rather than confusing people with

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
and rather than confusing people with
loads<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.600> different<00:01:42.780> sizes<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.439> etc<00:01:44.189> etc

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
loads of different sizes and etc etc

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.520 
loads of different sizes and etc etc
we've<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:45.000> streamlined<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> range<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
we've just streamlined the range just to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.980 
we've just streamlined the range just to
meet<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.130> demand<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.210> people<00:01:48.659> wanted

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
meet the demand of what people wanted

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.590 
meet the demand of what people wanted
the<00:01:49.560> whole<00:01:49.799> ethos<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> pro<00:01:51.119> light<00:01:51.360> range

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the whole ethos of the pro light range

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.710 
the whole ethos of the pro light range
originally<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:53.040> lightweight<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.540> soon

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
originally was lightweight and as soon

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
originally was lightweight and as soon
as<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.930> start<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> make<00:01:55.439> things<00:01:55.680> adjustable

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
as you start to make things adjustable

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.060 
as you start to make things adjustable
and<00:01:56.600> locking<00:01:57.600> pins<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.439> you're<00:01:58.829> adding

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and locking pins and this you're adding

or is it as their purpose to them well
its<00:03:36.970> aesthetics<00:03:37.569> but<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.200> also<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:39.849> gives<00:03:40.090> a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
its aesthetics but it's also it gives a

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.860 
its aesthetics but it's also it gives a
much<00:03:40.629> longer<00:03:41.319> grip<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:42.459> grip<00:03:42.910> is<00:03:43.120> like

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
much longer grip and the grip is like

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.300

know so anything else to come out in the
range<00:06:18.150> in<00:06:18.360> kitchen<00:06:18.750> it<00:06:18.870> well<00:06:19.139> if<00:06:19.259> the<00:06:19.680> range<00:06:19.889> is

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
range in kitchen it well if the range is

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.860 
range in kitchen it well if the range is
successful<00:06:20.729> which<00:06:20.909> I'm<00:06:21.150> pretty<00:06:21.360> sure<00:06:21.479> it<00:06:21.719> will

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
successful which I'm pretty sure it will

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.719 
successful which I'm pretty sure it will
be<00:06:22.080> but<00:06:22.440> if<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:22.680> range<00:06:22.889> is<00:06:23.039> successful<00:06:23.550> year

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
be but if the range is successful year

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.040 
be but if the range is successful year
there<00:06:23.909> will<00:06:24.030> be<00:06:24.090> a<00:06:24.270> few<00:06:24.539> other<00:06:24.690> bits<00:06:24.780> and

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
there will be a few other bits and

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.749 
there will be a few other bits and
pieces<00:06:25.139> but<00:06:25.620> we've<00:06:25.979> just<00:06:26.009> covered<00:06:26.400> all<00:06:26.580> the

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
pieces but we've just covered all the

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.100 
pieces but we've just covered all the
basics<00:06:27.150> that<00:06:27.300> people<00:06:27.570> are<00:06:27.630> going<00:06:27.719> to<00:06:27.810> want<00:06:27.930> for

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
basics that people are going to want for

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.469 
basics that people are going to want for
the<00:06:28.169> moment<00:06:28.469> there<00:06:29.009> will<00:06:29.159> be<00:06:29.219> stuff<00:06:29.550> but<00:06:29.820> it's

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
the moment there will be stuff but it's

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.060 
the moment there will be stuff but it's
in<00:06:30.719> the<00:06:30.810> port<00:06:31.020> launch<00:06:31.199> I<00:06:31.409> saw<00:06:31.590> I'm<00:06:31.710> sorry<00:06:31.979> I

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
in the port launch I saw I'm sorry I

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.040 
in the port launch I saw I'm sorry I
can't<00:06:32.340> talk<00:06:32.490> without<00:06:32.820> and<00:06:33.060> I'm<00:06:33.180> fair<00:06:33.840> enough

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
can't talk without and I'm fair enough

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.899 
can't talk without and I'm fair enough
and<00:06:34.229> price<00:06:34.740> wise<00:06:34.979> is<00:06:35.219> going<00:06:35.310> to<00:06:35.460> be<00:06:35.550> similar<00:06:35.760> to

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
and price wise is going to be similar to

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.420 
and price wise is going to be similar to
the<00:06:36.060> pro<00:06:36.240> light<00:06:36.449> yeah<00:06:36.930> it<00:06:37.260> will<00:06:37.380> be<00:06:37.440> within<00:06:38.159> the

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
the pro light yeah it will be within the

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.150 
the pro light yeah it will be within the
same<00:06:38.639> ballpark<00:06:39.300> I<00:06:39.690> mean<00:06:39.870> since<00:06:40.199> we<00:06:40.380> bought<00:06:40.560> the

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
same ballpark I mean since we bought the

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.560 
same ballpark I mean since we bought the
roll<00:06:41.280> out<00:06:41.430> you<00:06:41.910> know<00:06:42.030> it's<00:06:42.150> been<00:06:42.270> a<00:06:42.300> few<00:06:42.390> years

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
roll out you know it's been a few years

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.720 
roll out you know it's been a few years
now<00:06:42.870> so<00:06:43.170> things<00:06:43.470> of<00:06:43.620> unfortunate<00:06:44.580> things

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
now so things of unfortunate things

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.580 
now so things of unfortunate things
become<00:06:45.030> more<00:06:45.240> expensive<00:06:45.510> etc<00:06:46.200> but<00:06:46.320> it<00:06:46.440> will

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
become more expensive etc but it will

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.530 
become more expensive etc but it will
yes<00:06:47.040> it<00:06:47.190> will<00:06:47.340> be<00:06:47.520> within<00:06:47.730> the<00:06:47.940> same<00:06:48.150> ballpark

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
yes it will be within the same ballpark

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.620 
yes it will be within the same ballpark

time<00:06:58.650> oh<00:06:58.980> I<00:06:59.550> remember<00:06:59.760> that<00:07:00.470> now<00:07:01.470> it<00:07:01.560> should<00:07:01.800> be

early<00:07:02.220> mojo<00:07:02.640> I<00:07:02.820> mean<00:07:03.060> somewhere<00:07:03.480> around<00:07:03.570> that

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
early mojo I mean somewhere around that

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.320 
early mojo I mean somewhere around that
time<00:07:03.930> it<00:07:04.260> you<00:07:04.560> know<00:07:04.590> it<00:07:04.920> will<00:07:05.160> be<00:07:05.370> within<00:07:06.060> that

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
time it you know it will be within that

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.200 
time it you know it will be within that
ballpark<00:07:06.540> of<00:07:06.990> early<00:07:07.410> might<00:07:07.560> year<00:07:07.770> but<00:07:08.460> in<00:07:08.580> okay

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
ballpark of early might year but in okay

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.970 
ballpark of early might year but in okay
