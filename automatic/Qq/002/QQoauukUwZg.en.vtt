00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.070 

alright<00:00:08.639> let's<00:00:08.910> talk<00:00:09.090> about<00:00:09.150> insulin<00:00:09.780> spikes

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
alright let's talk about insulin spikes

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.049 
alright let's talk about insulin spikes
today<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:10.500> lukehoward<00:00:11.099> wants<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.700> know<00:00:11.849> our

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
today so lukehoward wants to know our

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.570 
today so lukehoward wants to know our
insulin<00:00:12.599> spikes<00:00:12.929> just<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.500> myth<00:00:13.769> true<00:00:14.160> or<00:00:14.340> false

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
insulin spikes just a myth true or false

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.300 
insulin spikes just a myth true or false
and<00:00:14.880> then<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.750> next<00:00:16.440> question<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:17.010> from

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and then the next question is from

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.540 
and then the next question is from
Wallace<00:00:18.230> Vegas<00:00:19.230> he<00:00:19.439> says<00:00:19.650> protein<00:00:20.189> shakes

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
Wallace Vegas he says protein shakes

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.060 
Wallace Vegas he says protein shakes
also<00:00:21.210> spiked<00:00:21.539> insulin<00:00:22.050> levels<00:00:22.410> true<00:00:22.740> or<00:00:22.890> false

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
also spiked insulin levels true or false

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.990 
also spiked insulin levels true or false
so<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.880> best<00:00:24.240> way<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.130> understand<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.640> by

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
so the best way to understand this is by

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.689 
so the best way to understand this is by
understanding<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:28.080> concept<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.980> continuum

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
understanding the concept of a continuum

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.970 
understanding the concept of a continuum
alright<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> best<00:00:30.660> way<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> look<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.560> almost

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
alright the best way to look at almost

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.170 
alright the best way to look at almost
anything<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.910> fitness<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.690> training<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.530> by

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
anything in fitness and training is by

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.119 
anything in fitness and training is by
understanding<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> continuum<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
understanding what a continuum is and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.299 
understanding what a continuum is and
where<00:00:38.640> certain<00:00:39.079> advice<00:00:40.079> would<00:00:40.440> fall<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.100> that

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
where certain advice would fall on that

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.450 
where certain advice would fall on that
continuum<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.510> example<00:00:43.140> an<00:00:43.460> insulin

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
continuum so for example an insulin

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.420 
continuum so for example an insulin
spike<00:00:44.940> all<00:00:45.329> depends<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.530> degree<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
spike all depends on the degree of the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
spike all depends on the degree of the
spike<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> straight<00:00:48.870> line<00:00:49.110> on

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
spike so if this is a straight line on

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.400 
spike so if this is a straight line on
this<00:00:50.219> end<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> continuum<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.809> high

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
this end of the continuum is a high

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.700 
this end of the continuum is a high
spike<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:54.030> end<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> continuum<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
spike on this end of the continuum is a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.729 
spike on this end of the continuum is a
low<00:00:56.100> spike<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.809> around<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.170> would<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> low

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
low spike in around here would be a low

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.799 
low spike in around here would be a low
spike<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.789> would<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> moderate<00:01:00.480> spike

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
spike and here would be a moderate spike

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.770 
spike and here would be a moderate spike
so<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.550> depends<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.329> define<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
so it all depends what you define a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.310 
so it all depends what you define a
spike<00:01:04.260> by<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> gallon<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.299> grape<00:01:06.630> juice<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
spike by so a gallon of grape juice is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.190 
spike by so a gallon of grape juice is
absolutely<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.600> spike<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.930> insulin

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
absolutely going to spike your insulin

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.010 
absolutely going to spike your insulin
levels<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.159> down<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.820> having<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.659> piece<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
levels way down here having a piece of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.310 
levels way down here having a piece of
chicken<00:01:13.290> breast<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> piece<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.030> meat<00:01:15.320> let's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
chicken breast or a piece of meat let's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.520 
chicken breast or a piece of meat let's
say<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> rib<00:01:17.100> eye<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.490> fatty<00:01:17.909> steak<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
say a rib eye a fatty steak is going to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.130 
say a rib eye a fatty steak is going to
be<00:01:19.680> way<00:01:19.890> down<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.700> protein<00:01:21.570> shake<00:01:21.630> is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
be way down here a protein shake is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.969 
be way down here a protein shake is
something<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.860> considered

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
something that would be considered

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.030 
something that would be considered
processed<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.509> breaks<00:01:24.900> down<00:01:25.049> quickly<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.740> it's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
processed it breaks down quickly so it's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.859 
processed it breaks down quickly so it's
going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.400> somewhere<00:01:27.000> probably<00:01:27.390> around

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
going to be somewhere probably around

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
going to be somewhere probably around
here<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.619> getting<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.890> guys<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
here I'm just getting you guys to you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.319 
here I'm just getting you guys to you
understand<00:01:30.420> visuals<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.320> ok<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.150> will<00:01:33.150> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
understand visuals here ok so will it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.649 
understand visuals here ok so will it
spike<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.350> insulin<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.450> gonna

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
spike your insulin but it's not gonna

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.929 
spike your insulin but it's not gonna
it's<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.070> down<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.280> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it's not going to be down here it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's not going to be down here it's
certainly<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.540> increase<00:01:40.020> insulin

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
certainly going to increase insulin

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.080 
certainly going to increase insulin
because<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> understand<00:01:42.000> how

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because you have to understand how

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.020 
because you have to understand how
insulin<00:01:42.570> works<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.340> want<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> understand

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
insulin works and you want to understand

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
insulin works and you want to understand
that<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.450> you're<00:01:45.780> spiking<00:01:46.560> your

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that just because you're spiking your

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130 
that just because you're spiking your
insulin<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.759> necessarily<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.780> bad

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
insulin that's not necessarily a bad

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.620 
insulin that's not necessarily a bad
thing<00:01:49.530> insulin<00:01:50.490> spikes<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.329> best

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
thing insulin spikes can be your best

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.710 
thing insulin spikes can be your best
friend<00:01:52.700> insulin<00:01:53.700> spikes<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.479> worst

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
friend insulin spikes can be your worst

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.499 
friend insulin spikes can be your worst
enemy<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.950> depends<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> context

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
enemy so it all depends on the context

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.050 
enemy so it all depends on the context
we're<00:01:57.659> talking<00:01:58.140> about<00:01:58.250> insulin<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.399> great<00:01:59.759> at

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
we're talking about insulin is great at

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.359 
we're talking about insulin is great at
the<00:02:00.570> end<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.960> workout<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:01.649> cortisol

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the end of a workout when cortisol

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.370 
the end of a workout when cortisol
levels<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:02.820> high<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.360> insulin<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.930> korzel

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
levels are high and insulin and korzel

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.840 
levels are high and insulin and korzel
can't<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> presence<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.460> each<00:02:05.610> other

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
can't be in the presence of each other

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.270 
can't be in the presence of each other
so<00:02:06.090> when<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.200> suppress<00:02:07.649> cortisol

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
so when we want to suppress cortisol

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.109 
so when we want to suppress cortisol
which<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.670> catabolic<00:02:09.209> hormone

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
which is a catabolic hormone

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.020 
which is a catabolic hormone
insulin<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.750> your<00:02:11.110> best<00:02:11.379> friend<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:12.670> then<00:02:12.730> on

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
insulin is your best friend but then on

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.240 
insulin is your best friend but then on
the<00:02:13.180> flip<00:02:13.420> side<00:02:13.450> we<00:02:14.080> don't<00:02:14.200> want<00:02:14.470> elevated

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the flip side we don't want elevated

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.759 
the flip side we don't want elevated
insulin<00:02:15.430> levels<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.959> an<00:02:17.080> extended<00:02:17.590> period

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
insulin levels so for an extended period

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.380 
insulin levels so for an extended period
of<00:02:17.950> time<00:02:18.010> because<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.670> know<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:18.879> God<00:02:19.060> can

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
of time because we know that God can

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.150 
of time because we know that God can
lead<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.750> obesity<00:02:20.110> they<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.800> lead<00:02:21.010> to

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
lead to obesity they can lead to

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.490 
lead to obesity they can lead to
specifically<00:02:21.790> excess<00:02:22.720> storage<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.319> belly<00:02:23.620> fat

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
specifically excess storage of belly fat

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.530 
specifically excess storage of belly fat
excess<00:02:26.500> storage<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.860> belly<00:02:27.010> fat<00:02:27.129> so<00:02:27.580> you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
excess storage of belly fat so you

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.600 
excess storage of belly fat so you
always<00:02:28.810> have<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.470> put<00:02:29.650> things<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.040> context<00:02:30.519> so

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
always have to put things in context so

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.270 
always have to put things in context so
as<00:02:30.760> protein<00:02:31.239> shakes<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.720> bad<00:02:31.900> thing<00:02:32.200> no<00:02:32.440> having

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
a protein shake yes is going to increase

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.479 
a protein shake yes is going to increase
your<00:02:34.959> insulin<00:02:35.290> but<00:02:35.739> if<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.980> don't<00:02:36.190> have<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
your insulin but if you don't have the

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.210 
your insulin but if you don't have the
frame<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.970> reference<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.930> what<00:02:38.170> degree<00:02:38.379> then

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
frame of reference to what degree then

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.470 
frame of reference to what degree then
you're<00:02:39.400> going<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.610> see<00:02:39.819> this<00:02:39.970> as<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> negative

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
you're going to see this as a negative

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.360 
you're going to see this as a negative
thing<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.530> where<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.950> lot<00:02:42.310> of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
thing and this is where a lot of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.240 
thing and this is where a lot of
fear-based<00:02:42.760> marketing<00:02:43.690> really<00:02:44.250> can

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
fear-based marketing really can

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.199 
fear-based marketing really can
influence<00:02:45.819> non<00:02:46.630> educated<00:02:47.380> people<00:02:47.590> online<00:02:48.209> and

in magazines and in you know
infomercials<00:02:52.269> etc<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.380> to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
infomercials etc so you have to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.680 
infomercials etc so you have to
understand<00:02:54.400> things<00:02:54.700> in<00:02:54.910> context<00:02:55.569> so<00:02:55.629> you

understand things in context so you

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.190 
understand things in context so you
always<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.510> first<00:02:58.720> question<00:02:59.110> or

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
always so so to the first question or

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.890 
always so so to the first question or
insulin<00:02:59.500> spikes<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.920> myth<00:03:00.690> absolutely<00:03:01.690> not<00:03:01.870> a

in<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.840> world<00:03:05.019> will<00:03:05.290> refute<00:03:05.769> that

in the world will refute that

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.619 
in the world will refute that
however<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:07.660> question<00:03:08.079> is<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.530> what<00:03:08.829> degree

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
however the question is to what degree

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.520 
however the question is to what degree
all<00:03:10.629> right

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
all right

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.930 
all right
the<00:03:11.799> thing<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.129> want<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.400> understand<00:03:12.790> about

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the thing you want to understand about

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.090 
the thing you want to understand about
insulin<00:03:13.540> is<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.260> hormone<00:03:14.829> that

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
insulin is that it's the hormone that

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.160 
insulin is that it's the hormone that
you<00:03:15.400> can<00:03:15.760> control<00:03:16.329> in<00:03:16.569> fact<00:03:16.750> it's<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.139> only

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
you can control in fact it's the only

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.099 
you can control in fact it's the only
hormone<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.430> can<00:03:18.609> control<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.269> insulin

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
hormone that you can control and insulin

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.920 
hormone that you can control and insulin
is<00:03:20.200> secreted<00:03:20.230> from<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.950> pancreas<00:03:21.340> as<00:03:21.940> what

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
is secreted from the pancreas as what

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.960 
is secreted from the pancreas as what
you<00:03:23.049> get<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.530> cool<00:03:23.889> way<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.130> understand<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.850> is

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
you get a cool way to understand it is

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.990 
you get a cool way to understand it is
out<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.540> an<00:03:25.630> emergency<00:03:26.310> response<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:27.670> when<00:03:27.849> you

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
out of an emergency response so when you

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.270 
out of an emergency response so when you
eat<00:03:28.239> something<00:03:28.569> and<00:03:28.930> there's<00:03:29.859> an<00:03:29.980> enormous
