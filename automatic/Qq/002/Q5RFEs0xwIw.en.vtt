 smart watch 2 against the samsung and the 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.449
 2002 excellent smart watch of his 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.880
 respective manufacturer here is sony 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.550
 versus samsung below by ai j 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.439
 dotcom once again welcome to this 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 dot com today I have the comparison 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.970
 of the samsung 2000 versus the sony smart 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.090
 work 2 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:42.900
 the most recent smart watch and 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.900
 with the latest version of samsung 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.820
 at first sight 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:53.329
 we have two watches that promise 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.579
 add functionality to your phone 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.780
 let's look at which of the two makes better 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.180
 from work 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.750
 let's look at what is the physical aspect 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.690
 in the sony we have a plastic strap 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.220
 with this the very traditional bija 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.220
 any kind of sporting reality 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.450
 simple 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.770
 we have an aluminum body 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.289
 and a single button on the right side 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.740
 of telefe this watch forgiveness is also 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.900
 Water resistant is ip67 here we have 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.830
 the microusb port 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.830
 to charge 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.950
 in this case this is the version was like 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.620
 move 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.870
 in a natural aluminum polish 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.460
 in the corners 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.159
 Grate very easy to let 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.159
 take a look we already have a first ray 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.830
 this is the smart watch 2 sound 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.460
 here we have certain children 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.460
 looking at the strap 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.860
 here we have the adjustments 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.460
 but this one has a little bit more 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.700
 modern 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.720
 Plastic logo always samsung e 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.000
 interchangeable 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.960
 we do not have any buttons on the side 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.560
 right no button on the left side 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.810
 here we have the home button 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.960
 an infrared transmitter to control 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.640
 the tl the air conditioning the / etc 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.580
 in the back we have the port 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.310
 for the charger and the rhythm sensor 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.550
 cardiac has this occasion to charge 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.290
 this device requires a device 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.860
 additional what would this be 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.860
 And enter 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.260
 there is the microusb port 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:17.490
 except to consider that we will have 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.490
 with this parasite 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.519
 we have both screens 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.879
 this keeps the sense showing us the 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.879
 hour 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.660
 a kind of zinc screen 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.760
 how to turn it on we are going to take care of them 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.280
 in this case, what are the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.590
 appearance of the face of the watch can be 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.730
 change in both 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.530
 we have an application drawer 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.450
 we have the jr 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.450
 and we have American applications 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.330
 remember that neither of us uses 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.820
 android this uses tyson and this one uses 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.100
 another operating system really does not 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.230
 I'm sure of what it is but the advantage 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.970
 of this is that it is compatible with 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.080
 any android device and while 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.510
 that is exclusively with devices 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.890
 samsung and in this case the most recent 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.890
 how is the s 5 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.030
 the basic functions of smart watchers 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.650
 have alarm notifications 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.560
 but 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.720
 the grass a little beyond has memory 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.840
 internal and can act as a 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.760
 mp3 player itself has a 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.449
 remote control 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.749
 that helps us control the atv 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.409
 and other devices navigation in the 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.770
 jr 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:54.089
 it is all by gestures the navigation in the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.800
 sony has the button home button back and 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:57.460
 the menu button more like what a 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.669
 navigate on android 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.430
 for the jr one goes to any kind of 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.900
 application and down sweeps 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.840
 coming 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.210
 As I told you in both, it's easy to change 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.689
 what is the face of the clock 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.209
 if I have a nova here 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.950
 to the adjustments in both understands says 

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:20.410
 watch countries 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.860
 although we have the different faces of 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.150
 clock 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.710
 this time we are going to try 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.570
 something more than the smart watch the samsung and 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.770
 we are finding out goals that we have 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.770
 seen this in the saint 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.199
 we select 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.199
 we already have in the mode off well 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.500
 cause or need this in this face we 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.690
 allows direct access lopez to 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.780
 control notifications and adjustments these 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.910
 can be accommodated according to both 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.940
 this does not multitask similar to that of 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.280
 any android in this case with the 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.780
 double is we access the latest 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.020
 open apps we grab you all 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.280
 of a single 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.530
 well we're going to sham blocks on that 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.320
 world keeps what the reader 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:15.830
 heart rate similar to what he has 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.720
 galaxy s 5 we give it to him and he goes to 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.720
 turn back 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.610
 what asks us to have it here 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.610
 there is light 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:37.780
 and we try to reinstate the 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.630
 can see this reflects having the skin and 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.249
 this produces the reading of our rhythm 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.289
 cardiac 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:46.310
 is more focused on what is health 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.280
 and the sport 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.950
 both are very nice very well 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.110
 built only that each of them 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.610
 will have a different orientation since 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.970
 in this for example we can answer 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:03.009
 calls to make calls inclusive since 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.760
 has a microphone and a speaker 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:08.490
 we have in the workshop 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.470
 the numeric keypad to make calls 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.169
 well this has been a brief comparison 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:16.319
 of what is guiding 2000 with the smart 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:18.449
 sony watch 2 I hope you liked it 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.889
 do not forget to stay subscribed the channel and 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:20.370
 water them with like this helps 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.270
 quite 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.270
 thank you very much for visiting
