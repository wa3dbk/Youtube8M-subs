00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 the week from 16 to 21 february 2015 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.500
 then let's see 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.660
 okay the hardware charts the last time 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.940
 yes the new 3ds has gone and it 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.759
 gave some confusions or comments 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.949
 the 3ds and new 3ds added together 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.020
 but I have it in the video 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.880
 already said that every time we too 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 though at gameboy and gameboy color though 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.939
 new games for the gameboy color gave 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.369
 or dsds 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.080
 you always count the models one 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.519
 single generation naturally together 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 There is also a playstation 3 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.450
 several models and and and and and because of that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.210
 I still have that way anyway 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.000
 written 3ds and wii 3ds have become 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.879
 19 sold 1450 times this is the second 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.829
 week let's see how that will be in the future 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.890
 develop as they stabilize 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.329
 he is still pretty fresh and me 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 guess this is going to be a tough fight 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.520
 between new 3ds and ps4 in the near future 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.739
 future and we can also talk about it 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.660
 happy that the nintendo wii at least 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.059
 the third place is occupied again 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.410
 Unfortunately no grandiose can pay 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.559
 do not expect it but it looks good 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.750
 like the ps4 from the consoles 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 is locked up and the rest is not 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.290
 great of importance 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
 There are some in the games 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 newcomers and the best is on it 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.799
 the top position made it or her 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.530
 18 86 for playstation 4 against around 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.110
 33,000 times over the shop counters and has 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.130
 So place one of the software charts 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.040
 Torn 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 legend of zelda majora's mask 3d on the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.280
 second place displaced 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 That has sold 12,000 times 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.500
 if the second week of sales and yes 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.659
 for comparison, a chance to mast ready 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.320
 The first week has been 52,000 times 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.909
 So you can still see how you order 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.460
 886 will claim next week 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.960
 yes and also wolf and monster hunter 4 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.939
 the last week to top three 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.360
 Of course, a few have to be heard 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.960
 is lose units a few places 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.270
 quite normal first release week and then 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.610
 the hype is mostly over if so 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.000
 There is a game of new charts 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.800
 huge upswing 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.370
 and soon newcomers on the spot 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.429
 eight of the 35 last round as far as I know 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.370
 is a hd remake who said wrong 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.870
 nevertheless the 35 was already hd but the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.030
 dollar 5 I also have let's play for 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.340
 xbox 360 was for the past 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.040
 console generation and now for ps4 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.530
 and xbox from has appeared and whole 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.280
 the ps4 version is found on space 8 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.320
 the xbox version on place 27 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.740
 furthermore we have a tombola 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.660
 pc game in ninth place and that 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.080
 are by and large the software 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.080
 charts 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.550
 it says week and if we are now 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.500
 only on the nintendo products 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.080
 then we'll look here 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.520
 the tenno despite mast at the alz engines 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.280
 3d of course still the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.250
 top rider followed by omega ruby 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.820
 and age we monster hunter 4 ultimate 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.580
 with 7001 units sold on the 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.160
 third place from vontobel eschborners 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.840
 3ds and wii u mario kart 8 on place 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.060
 seven and then we have animal 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.010
 crossing july again great 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.180
 mario brothers 2 has not been in for a long time 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.540
 the top ten welcome back 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.549
 and then pokÃ©mon y start on's 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.269
 which games are among the top ten for that 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.970
 walked out zelda ocarina of time 3d 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.430
 and Mario Kartart 7 have the sails 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.440
 I'll say goodbye for the next time 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.860
 would then have resident evil 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.120
 two revelations thinks about it 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.120
 that's how it should be 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.250
 that really and really counts 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.430
 that's why I'm curious if dragonballs 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.079
 universe interferes and that's why 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.620
 by no means the next charts 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.810
 miss 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.810
 thanks for watching and until then
