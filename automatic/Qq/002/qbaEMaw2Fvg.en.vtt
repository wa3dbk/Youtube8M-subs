00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Today I want to show you how 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.330
 sometime propeller the parrot ar.drone 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.900
 changes small propeller here a 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.080
 drone is defective that means we need 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.980
 the mb deluxe clipping tool for the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.020
 Parrot AR.Drone sees so on from there 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.109
 one side eroded a bit 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.170
 There are already often used 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.300
 here it is because there is the clip 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.609
 always an open side you try 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.160
 now here from the open side 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.440
 push the clip out with this 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 tool so here and there I already have it 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.250
 that was a nice one now 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 example, there is now on top and it 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.340
 you can just pull it off 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.100
 now we have done that too 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.930
 It's easy if you already have this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.739
 propeller is you can be quite 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.960
 Just replace the gearwheel one 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 can check the axes so they are 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 sometimes watch 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 you can easily do that after 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.780
 Pulling down to put down once 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 and see if it stops and then 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.660
 see if the grad is still the right one 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.920
 Axis that seems here too 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.299
 not to be the case that one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.680
 can also make that very fast 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.010
 swap ball position 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.960
 this is usually slip bearing when 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.280
 you have not done it yet 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.400
 In any case I recommend you there 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.430
 from amelie lux also ball bearings with it 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.070
 scored 25 percent longer flight time 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.140
 the drone is more stable in the air 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.280
 is quieter and all in all you have 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.229
 just more fun with it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.200
 what makes me tell with the upper one 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.610
 ball bearing is the out there so 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.909
 did not need a tool for but you take 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.729
 here simply the ball bearing at night times 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.470
 a bit circular movements and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.460
 it's easy to get out of here 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.450
 ball bearings you can easily 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.259
 use 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.189
 1 above the other is yes then synonymous 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:57.030
 Axis on it and then pushes the axis 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:02.909
 from below through as the below sets 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.560
 you yes the gear on it and then the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.930
 cellar on it again we have to 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.340
 note that she is such a notch 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.200
 This notch is a notch too 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.569
 that must fit into each other then it is 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.300
 correct and comes to a good conclusion 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.590
 Again this clip on that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.720
 whole attached and here comes again 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.269
 our clipping tool of luck to 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.920
 use the new tool now you push 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.660
 the same with this explanation 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.590
 sure you can then you could possibly 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.769
 make the propellers a bit high 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.069
 look it is on it and sets that 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.640
 It was so easy you can do it all 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.230
 switch 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.269
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.709
 I am now like a propeller changes 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.220
 I have to do this again here 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.940
 that is not the effects yet 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.079
 fast and as I said the left 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.450
 for the tool and for the 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.840
 ball bearings I just grab this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.959
 Video 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.220
 There is also a tuning battery 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.739
 from provider luxe with two 1000 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.260
 Milliamps of David are to 90 minutes 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.819
 flight time possible look at the things 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.819
 simply you have it all on Amazon
