have it down here over here I have my
hip<00:02:15.959> joint<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.220> money<00:02:17.430> hip

hip joint here and here I have money hip
joint<00:02:17.880> here<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.510> could<00:02:19.110> probably<00:02:19.320> come<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.650> with

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
joint here I could probably come up with

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.070 
joint here I could probably come up with
20<00:02:20.130> more<00:02:20.310> measurements<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.940> put<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.209> at<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.870> I'm

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
20 more measurements to put it at so I'm

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.430 
20 more measurements to put it at so I'm
telling<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.650> measuring<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:24.020> everything<00:02:25.020> and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
telling you measuring is everything and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.860 
telling you measuring is everything and
if<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.590> don't<00:02:25.830> never<00:02:25.980> measure<00:02:26.340> anybody<00:02:26.910> it's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
if you don't never measure anybody it's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.410 
if you don't never measure anybody it's
just<00:02:28.080> about<00:02:28.500> impossible<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.819> have<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.239> show

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
just about impossible but I have to show

here to here from here to here well I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.320 
here to here from here to here well I
got<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.140> bright<00:02:55.470> idea<00:02:55.500> today<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.000> could

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
got this bright idea today that I could

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.550 
got this bright idea today that I could
figure<00:02:57.570> my<00:02:58.440> crotch<00:02:58.860> depth<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.489> this<00:02:59.700> thing<00:03:00.030> so

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
figure my crotch depth of this thing so

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.810 
figure my crotch depth of this thing so
I<00:03:01.560> went<00:03:01.830> down<00:03:02.040> there<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.340> tried<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.700> figure

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
I went down there and I tried to figure

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.009 
I went down there and I tried to figure
out<00:03:03.090> what<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.360> do<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.959> is

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
out what to do with this this is

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.949 
out what to do with this this is
stationary<00:03:04.860> on<00:03:05.070> zebra<00:03:05.400> right<00:03:05.910> here<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.420> don't

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
stationary on zebra right here I don't

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.330 
stationary on zebra right here I don't
want<00:03:07.290> even<00:03:07.440> showing<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.070> probably

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
want even showing you this probably

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.240 
want even showing you this probably
nobody<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.760> earth<00:03:08.880> even<00:03:09.180> Hanselman<00:03:09.540> Jerry<00:03:09.900> and

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
nobody on earth even Hanselman Jerry and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.160 
nobody on earth even Hanselman Jerry and
this<00:03:11.250> parks<00:03:11.640> one<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.920> thought<00:03:14.489> I'd<00:03:14.640> okay

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
this parks one so I thought I'd okay

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.380 
this parks one so I thought I'd okay
I'll<00:03:16.170> put<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.680> between<00:03:17.190> my<00:03:17.370> legs<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.209> I'll

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
I'll put this between my legs and I'll

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.990 
I'll put this between my legs and I'll
put<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:18.930> my<00:03:19.380> ways<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.010> I'll<00:03:20.610> figure<00:03:20.820> out

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
put this in my ways and I'll figure out

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000 
put this in my ways and I'll figure out
how<00:03:21.180> much<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.840> okay<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.500> look<00:03:22.739> over<00:03:22.890> here

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
how much it is okay so I look over here

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.800 
how much it is okay so I look over here
and<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:24.090> says<00:03:24.329> 9<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.560> 3/4<00:03:26.100> inches<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:27.420> that's

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and it says 9 and 3/4 inches so that's

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.960 
and it says 9 and 3/4 inches so that's
completely<00:03:28.530> different<00:03:29.130> from<00:03:29.370> when<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.549> sit<00:03:29.850> on

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
completely different from when I sit on

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.970 
completely different from when I sit on
the<00:03:30.060> table<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.690> measure<00:03:30.959> from<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
the table and I measure from here to the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.490 
the table and I measure from here to the
table<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.370> comes<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.850> 10<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.510> half<00:03:33.540> 11<00:03:33.989> 12

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
table that comes a 10 and a half 11 12

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.660 
table that comes a 10 and a half 11 12
depending<00:03:34.829> on

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
depending on

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.710 
depending on
I'm<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.980> get<00:03:38.490> after<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.090> home<00:03:39.300> like<00:03:39.690> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
I'm in so I get after that home like a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.510 
I'm in so I get after that home like a
little<00:03:39.989> grab<00:03:40.170> them<00:03:43.220> okay

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
little grab them okay

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.839 
little grab them okay
so<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> decided<00:03:45.709> since<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.980> thing<00:03:47.250> doesn't

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
so I decided since this thing doesn't

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.970 
so I decided since this thing doesn't
really<00:03:47.970> go<00:03:48.599> in<00:03:48.900> there<00:03:49.080> far<00:03:49.319> enough<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.860> it

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
really go in there far enough and it

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.360 
really go in there far enough and it
gets<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:51.180> know<00:03:51.209> crooked<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.110> thought<00:03:53.069> that

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
gets you know crooked I thought that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.880 
gets you know crooked I thought that
this<00:03:53.520> brilliant<00:03:53.970> idea<00:03:54.090> I'd<00:03:54.840> stick<00:03:55.680> this

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
this brilliant idea I'd stick this

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.880 
this brilliant idea I'd stick this
yardstick<00:03:56.520> on<00:03:56.580> because<00:03:57.480> then<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.840> can<00:03:57.989> go<00:03:58.200> all

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
yardstick on because then it can go all

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.979 
yardstick on because then it can go all
the<00:03:58.950> way<00:03:59.220> between<00:03:59.790> my<00:03:59.940> legs<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.569> you<00:04:00.660> can<00:04:00.810> like

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
the way between my legs and you can like

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.330 
the way between my legs and you can like
write<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.620> horse

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
write it like a horse

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.040 
write it like a horse
okay<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:04.170> put<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:05.040> like<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.840> then<00:04:06.959> I

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
okay so I put it like that and then I

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.800 
okay so I put it like that and then I
pulled<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:07.650> left<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.239> stuck<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.660> in<00:04:09.780> my

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
pulled this left and I stuck it in my

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.640 
pulled this left and I stuck it in my
front<00:04:10.260> waist<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.450> kept<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.840> falling<00:04:13.140> like

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
front waist and it kept on falling like

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.020 
front waist and it kept on falling like
that<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.450> thought<00:04:15.889> okay<00:04:16.889> there's<00:04:17.669> my

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
there's my waist okay so then I can take

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.840 
there's my waist okay so then I can take
it<00:04:25.050> out<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.290> look<00:04:25.380> at<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.770> so<00:04:25.950> according<00:04:26.820> to

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
it out and look at it so according to

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.140 
it out and look at it so according to
that<00:04:27.090> my<00:04:27.360> crotch<00:04:27.630> depth<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.139> eight<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.560> half

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
that my crotch depth is eight and a half

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.790 
that my crotch depth is eight and a half
well<00:04:30.150> that's<00:04:30.419> absolutely<00:04:30.990> completely

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
well that's absolutely completely

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.650 
well that's absolutely completely
impossible<00:04:32.190> there's<00:04:32.700> no<00:04:32.850> what<00:04:33.030> about<00:04:33.180> my

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.650 
impossible there's no what about my
crotch<00:04:33.900> step<00:04:34.169> computing<00:04:34.650> in<00:04:34.740> half<00:04:34.979> I<00:04:35.660> guess

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
crotch step computing in half I guess

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.400 
crotch step computing in half I guess
the<00:04:36.900> idea<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:38.000> for<00:04:39.000> your<00:04:39.180> quad<00:04:39.360> steps<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:40.380> have

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
the idea is for your quad steps you have

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.860 
the idea is for your quad steps you have
to<00:04:40.710> take<00:04:40.919> into<00:04:41.220> account<00:04:41.340> your<00:04:41.850> curves<00:04:42.390> you

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
to take into account your curves you

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.390 
to take into account your curves you
know<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.110> have<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.289> curve<00:04:43.590> here<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.250> have

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
know you have a curve here and you have

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.360 
know you have a curve here and you have
curve<00:04:44.760> here<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.390> have<00:04:45.539> Kurt<00:04:45.870> here<00:04:46.200> so<00:04:46.890> anyway

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
curve here you have Kurt here so anyway

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.110 
curve here you have Kurt here so anyway
