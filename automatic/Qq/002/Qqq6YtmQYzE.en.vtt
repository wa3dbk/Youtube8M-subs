00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 all ardent greetings with you again I 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.540
 gear he and you watch channel heron craft 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.840
 and today I will tell you what 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.750
 Maykraft version 1.9 will be all from the words 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.730
 developers really if so 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.859
 google the internet well what i 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 and did that you can find yourself full 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.220
 a list of what they add there 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.230
 versions minecraft 1.9 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.210
 anyway i only used 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 verified sources information only 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.529
 application developers anyone all over there 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.710
 twitter reddit ah and other social 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.620
 networks ah so here's the first 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.210
 of course they will change the dragon battle 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.489
 and today I will talk about how 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.680
 it will be done but above all 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.969
 let's start as usual 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.640
 the simplest 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.620
 First I will try to survive about it and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.989
 parallel I am going to tell you so on 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.530
 I personally feel more comfortable firstly 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.690
 they are going to add new blocks 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.210
 decorative dark so-called more 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 dark versions of what is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 you can drink apparently I'm so 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 I begin to guess vaguely what will happen 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.400
 darker glass 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.979
 that is, not just a red joint 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.680
 such a darker red glass 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.250
 like cherry blossom or something 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.360
 something like this is the most important second 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.600
 have changed 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.810
 going to change models work 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.000
 different living creatures mobs there residents 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.520
 here are these on the sites come pens and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.340
 and so on and in such a way that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 resource on how you can change not 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.130
 only textures up create some 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.950
 new three-dimensional objects like this 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.250
 Maybe now version of Maycroft 1.8 and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.979
 higher but also newer models 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.320
 and mobs, that is, you can not just be 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.329
 change for example now 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.030
 using command blocks you can 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.710
 For example, change your characteristics 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.829
 zombies, that is, you can create zombies 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.770
 which will be 2002 million lives and there 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.600
 some awesome damage and he 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.020
 will be able to spit fireball there and 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.439
 Why not? 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.179
 but you can't change his model 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.920
 no way but you can of course 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.379
 change the texture but the model itself to 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.680
 she can not look now with 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:17.019
 these special technologies will be possible 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.540
 create a resource pack in which the zombies will be 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.430
 look like a rabbit or something 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.549
 differently that will allow developers 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.739
 cards use yours with custom 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.680
 models and create absolutely new mobs 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.840
 which will look like absolutely 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.299
 new creatures on the Pamirs to experience 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.430
 Can you imagine Cyclops from divine rpg without 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.730
 mods can be created or something 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.269
 like this here it is cool and it is good 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.470
 Of course in the same place they promised us that they would 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.510
 finally the options that are needed for 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.489
 mod developers who will allow 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.010
 simplify the process of creating mods 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.470
 but so far they have obtained with accuracy 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.560
 on the contrary because a version of minecraft 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.319
 1.8 so far nothing good from 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.690
 mods in general, and not created because 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.079
 Yes, we are about and create mods much 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.660
 complicate such dylan make manna 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.239
 unit promises and make new 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.519
 interface like as you know u command 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.950
 block now but very user-friendly interface 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:23.560
 let's show you what it is 7 teams 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.359
 block in general will not write it for a long time I 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.819
 already forgot how this command is done not 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.859
 important it is important that there will be more convenient 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.769
 interface of this command block and there 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.650
 you can see this code and not seeing 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.650
 these one single lines up what 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.549
 extremely uncomfortable as it is now and it is possible 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.019
 will see it as a whole text 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.019
 full text and a few 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.269
 lines to write which is very convenient also 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.760
 redo the render system that is 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.560
 cloud mapping is possible and done 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.180
 I hope so round because here 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.060
 these square clouds are not easy 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.290
 nerves really in 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.930
 some resource pack 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.730
 and shaders have ok clouds then 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.430
 there are round such looks like clouds 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.410
 they how the hell knows what is white as 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.540
 now but still remake 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.850
 the shader system they will finally be 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.769
 use technology open ji el i 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.610
 I don't know what that means, but I hope that 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.739
 neck 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.680
 who now has a built-in Mycroft 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.330
 as if someone does not remember to 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.040
 get access to vanilla shooters and 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.830
 maycroft need to go into options 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.670
 then super secret options and so 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.620
 here you can poke 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.540
 and get different and the court is like this 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.550
 this is just a masterpiece this is my 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.430
 favorite resource pack is not a damn thing 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.680
 where what's going on looks cool 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.830
 further it will now work correctly 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.500
 bosses if you all probably know 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.180
 if you call a few scrubber will 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.700
 display only one bar 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.310
 health center of the screen in the middle 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.700
 which will now be displayed 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.240
 several strips if you and zaspavneny 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.270
 few bosses no question now how a 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.490
 will be changed boevki with dragon 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.810
 firstly he will respawn himself by 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.180
 yourself without the need to wipe and easier 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.860
 saying delete for the world and for the end as you 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.260
 know in order now to sleep 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.330
 dragon you just need to remove 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.800
 corresponding folder and save the world 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:26.020
 and you get along with the contents of this 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.610
 the edge itself and after that you 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.260
 there is an opportunity to kill again 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.250
 the dragon now then the dragon will be 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.350
 reappear by itself without 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.330
 additional manipulations with your 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.330
 the sides are shorter very cool very 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.520
 cool more now crystal 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.190
 which is on the pillars of 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.190
 obsidian will be such special 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.080
 iron bars around these 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.440
 most crystals to them 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.020
 harder to get and it's just great 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.850
 the name there is even more like a beech 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.660
 dragon promised limits purple 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.570
 the particles 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.550
 but it is not specified where exactly I am so 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.910
 I strongly urge that well, according to the logic of things 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.910
 until the dragon code will breathe these very 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.760
 purple particles and sort of like 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.450
 become more realistic simulation 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.880
 dragon breathing 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.000
 goto speaking dragon will look 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.130
 more epic awesome awesome is very good 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.070
 but that's all for now 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.950
 dig on the Internet so here so 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.260
 drying I found a way to turn off all 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.380
 those damn shader i just clicked kno 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.330
 f5 changed view and shader disappeared 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.470
 Perhaps this is the way glitch and version 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.090
 minecraft 183 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.320
 well, if you didn't like it here 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.970
 forget like a mine a subscription is possible and 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.340
 dislike of he wants it so i'm not 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.060
 against here and of course do not forget 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.310
 write in the comments your thoughts on 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.080
 about this, where can they be? 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.470
 purple into particles to his ass 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.810
 going to attach I don't know here on 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.180
 all this good luck to all and while all hope 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.120
 you were interested and although of course 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.430
 video does not seem very interesting 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.770
 It turned out in my opinion all good luck 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.140
 don't forget to drop in yet 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.390
 description below this video where is waiting for you 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.730
 lots of interesting references to various 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.560
 interesting vidosiki because vidosikov 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.780
 cool on minecraft and not only 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.070
 Other games on the dofiga channel are therefore not 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.660
 forget to watch many different things at once 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.580
 vidosikov they one thing and ran 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.270
 somewhere like you usually do ha ha 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.270
 bye everyone
