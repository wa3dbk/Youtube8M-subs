00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
mine and that produces resources then

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
mine and that produces resources then
after<00:01:25.320> i<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.270> laboratory<00:01:28.340> normally

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
after i would do the laboratory normally

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
after i would do the laboratory normally
people<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.030> first<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.200> nice

whatever<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.670> would<00:02:06.570> always<00:02:07.049> use<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> elixir

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
whatever I would always use the elixir

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.380 
whatever I would always use the elixir
first<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:09.050> laboratory<00:02:10.280> before

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
first on laboratory before

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.730 
first on laboratory before
creating<00:02:12.750> barracks<00:02:13.230> ease<00:02:13.470> or<00:02:14.960> upgrading<00:02:15.960> the

you for the resources but I would
definitely<00:02:21.990> save<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:23.030> elixir<00:02:24.950> for<00:02:26.569> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
definitely save up elixir for the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.140 
definitely save up elixir for the
laboratory<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.780> after<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.320> got<00:02:31.740> your

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
laboratory so after you got your

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.550 
laboratory so after you got your
laboratory<00:02:33.150> fully<00:02:34.020> upgraded<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:35.280> yeah<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
laboratory fully upgraded well yeah and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.020 
laboratory fully upgraded well yeah and
you<00:02:37.560> already<00:02:37.830> started<00:02:38.250> your<00:02:38.459> main<00:02:38.670> troops

main guys Petra's and all that they're a

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.110 
main guys Petra's and all that they're a
bit<00:03:04.380> more<00:03:04.560> expensive<00:03:04.800> so<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.610> wouldn't<00:03:06.030> exactly

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
bit more expensive so I wouldn't exactly

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.890 
bit more expensive so I wouldn't exactly
always<00:03:07.110> bother<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:08.130> it's<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.430> good<00:03:08.610> idea<00:03:08.900> then

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
always bother but it's a good idea then

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.820 
always bother but it's a good idea then
after<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.530> have<00:03:10.820> let's<00:03:11.820> say<00:03:12.030> second<00:03:12.830> most

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
after you have let's say second most

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.940 
after you have let's say second most
important<00:03:14.310> troop<00:03:14.600> which<00:03:15.600> are<00:03:16.489> wizards

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
important troop which are wizards

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.789 
important troop which are wizards
healers<00:03:20.390> I'm<00:03:21.390> not<00:03:21.810> counting<00:03:22.019> potions<00:03:22.620> right

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
healers I'm not counting potions right

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.509 
healers I'm not counting potions right
now<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.180> would<00:03:24.180> say<00:03:24.450> golems<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:28.519> think

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
now I would say golems and I think

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.060 
now I would say golems and I think
that's<00:03:29.670> about<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.970> while<00:03:30.720> I'm<00:03:30.930> giants<00:03:31.500> don't

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
that's about it while I'm giants don't
