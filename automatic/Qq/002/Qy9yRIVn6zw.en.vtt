00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
crossover it is pretty pretty good the

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.450 
crossover it is pretty pretty good the
the<00:04:19.250> engine<00:04:19.609> is<00:04:19.730> prettier<00:04:20.090> than<00:04:20.329> I<00:04:20.510> remember

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
the engine is prettier than I remember

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.640 
the engine is prettier than I remember
this<00:04:22.460> is<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.120> larger<00:04:23.540> engine<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.380> two

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
this is the the larger engine of the two

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.090 
this is the the larger engine of the two
that<00:04:25.070> come<00:04:25.310> on<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.640> cx-5<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.920> is

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
that come on the cx-5 and it is it is

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.880 
that come on the cx-5 and it is it is
grittier<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:28.550> mean<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:28.910> has<00:04:29.030> sort<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.330> like<00:04:29.540> a

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
grittier I mean it has sort of like a

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.630 
grittier I mean it has sort of like a
house<00:04:30.890> sort<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:32.290> raspy<00:04:33.290> groan<00:04:33.560> but<00:04:34.520> the

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
house sort of a raspy groan but the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.880 
house sort of a raspy groan but the
transition<00:04:35.300> is<00:04:35.420> very<00:04:35.630> responsive<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.560> it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
transition is very responsive and it

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.980 
transition is very responsive and it
feels<00:04:37.190> really<00:04:37.400> torquing<00:04:38.030> unlike<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.690> lot<00:04:38.810> of

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
feels really torquing unlike a lot of

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.640 
feels really torquing unlike a lot of
four-cylinder<00:04:39.920> engines<00:04:40.340> which<00:04:40.580> are<00:04:40.910> not

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
four-cylinder engines which are not

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.760 
four-cylinder engines which are not
torquay<00:04:42.650> this<00:04:43.160> thing<00:04:43.400> feels<00:04:43.580> feels<00:04:44.270> very<00:04:44.690> very

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.500

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
transmission responses I'm there it's

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.180 
transmission responses I'm there it's
hard<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.720> sense<00:05:26.020> other<00:05:26.230> changes<00:05:26.680> instantly

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
hard to sense other changes instantly
