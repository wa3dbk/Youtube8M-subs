00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.130
 try to win in two matches are the 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.840
 two games that we're going to play today for 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.090
 see if we take a little more points 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.480
 and I do not know we almost planted the permanence of 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.480
 side 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:01:00.350

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.489
 two parties and I will not buy 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.489
 acting so we bought 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.650
 the match 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.050
 a team from a decent team the 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.820
 Mark our guy can compete with him 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.990
 so let's see let's see if we 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.310
 we took the second victory of the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.700
 selection that started many fouls 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.700
 to end 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.150
 these party all complicated the party 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.920
 but good for now no occasion 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.549

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.549

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.500

 90 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:50.879
 but the truth is that it has been 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:50.879
 there has been no victory 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.390
 carbon 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.650

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.650
 the lies of the direct had a ribÃ©ry 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.810

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.830
 let's measure now 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.950

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
 all right 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.479
 do not 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.479
 a memory 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.340
 too 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.070
 but no 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.700
 let's go up 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.130
 do not 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.270
 do not 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.580
 we follow 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:41.050
 Too much too much 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.249
 how 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.760
 h 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.380
 huge huge any I make you a son 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.380
 he does what he has to see 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:13.420
 how good what penalty without clear penalty 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.550
 clear penalty had gone away from his 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.440
 rival and it is a clear penalty we go 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.600
 there comes that we always have in front and 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.630
 we got the 2-0 and we took the 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.630
 victory 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.890
 but finally we have 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.510
 two 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.010
 2 but finally we ended up taking 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.800
 more to victory that come to us we're going 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.330
 scandal because we need it 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.640
 enormously and good for those as 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.680
 you have vargas is fine and they have 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.940
 finished all wrong things like 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.430
 only the truth has it that I 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.980
 failed but not quite 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.840
 save but I'm not going to go back anymore I'm going to 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.160
 go back to stops again in this 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.890
 episode has lost a match they have the 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.650
 another so on the other hand none because 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.670
 lost have won and good and sometimes they 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.950
 It is complicating attraction 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.680
 decisions are already two losses 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.750
 you have to try to give it all 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.340
 next matches although we remember that 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:31.070
 we still have six games left and that 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:36.990
 if we win two we have it 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:38.490
 but good but his thing is to win and win 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.500
 win so we're going to try the 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.090
 next episode in the prizes there will be 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.380
 liked is that you are fun and you 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.030
 I'm told to see if we get to the 

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.030
 four thousand laws that we have only arrived 

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:52.270
 do not forget
