00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.029 
video it was kind of private so I
thought<00:00:42.850> it'd<00:00:42.969> be<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.090> good<00:00:43.210> idea<00:00:43.300> to<00:00:43.539> like

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
thought it'd be a good idea to like

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.630 
thought it'd be a good idea to like
gonna<00:00:45.039> be<00:00:45.159> really<00:00:45.309> cool<00:00:45.579> to<00:00:45.940> do<00:00:46.149> a<00:00:47.550> kind<00:00:48.550> of

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and basically what that means is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.579 
and basically what that means is
I'll<00:01:01.640> give<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:03.420> viewers<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.780> challenge<00:01:04.350> like

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
like you know really complicated like I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.240 
like you know really complicated like I
was<00:02:15.640> just<00:02:15.730> say<00:02:15.850> oh<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.390> do<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> wheelie

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
but they don't realize that can even do

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.550 
but they don't realize that can even do
it<00:02:19.240> really<00:02:19.390> myself<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:19.990> would<00:02:20.290> kind<00:02:20.500> of

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
it really myself so that would kind of

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.060 
it really myself so that would kind of
be<00:02:21.430> stupid<00:02:22.410> now<00:02:23.410> let's<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.710> give<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.950> know

motorcycle<00:02:24.610> challenges<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.120> I've<00:02:25.320> I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
motorcycle challenges that I've I

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.780 
motorcycle challenges that I've I
recognize<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.190> most<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.730> my<00:02:27.820> viewers<00:02:29.790> either

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
recognize that most of my viewers either

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.850 
recognize that most of my viewers either
do<00:02:31.360> not<00:02:31.390> have<00:02:31.780> motorcycles<00:02:32.160> or<00:02:34.320> or<00:02:35.320> they're

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
do not have motorcycles or or they're

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.380 
do not have motorcycles or or they're
not<00:02:35.890> really<00:02:36.430> or<00:02:36.700> they're<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:36.910> like<00:02:37.150> really

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
not really or they're just like really

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.500 
not really or they're just like really
new<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.690> them<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.410> they<00:02:38.440> can't<00:02:38.830> really<00:02:39.209> do<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
new to them so they can't really do the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.199 
new to them so they can't really do the
challenges<00:02:41.250> anything<00:02:42.250> complex<00:02:42.670> which<00:02:43.030> which

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
challenges anything complex which which

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.560 
challenges anything complex which which
I<00:02:43.330> probably<00:02:43.510> can<00:02:43.750> do<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.930> anyway<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.870> anyway

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
I probably can do it anyway but anyway

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.809

motorcycle<00:03:31.629> about<00:03:33.329> he<00:03:34.329> started<00:03:34.629> telling

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
motorcycle about he started telling

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.530 
motorcycle about he started telling
about<00:03:35.169> what<00:03:35.439> how<00:03:36.069> he<00:03:36.129> created<00:03:36.549> noon<00:03:36.819> I<00:03:37.120> thought

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
about what how he created noon I thought

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.030 
about what how he created noon I thought
they'd<00:03:37.719> be<00:03:37.840> really<00:03:37.870> good<00:03:38.260> topic<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.739> he<00:03:38.799> asked

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
they'd be really good topic and he asked

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.210 
they'd be really good topic and he asked
me

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.670 

he<00:03:42.970> asked<00:03:43.150> me<00:03:44.730> how<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:45.760> came<00:03:46.030> with<00:03:46.360> my<00:03:46.450> name<00:03:46.750> and

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
he asked me how I came with my name and

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.810 
he asked me how I came with my name and
so<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.860> thought<00:03:48.040> that'd<00:03:48.250> be<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> good<00:03:48.610> challenge

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
so I thought that'd be a good challenge

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:57.350 
so I thought that'd be a good challenge
so<00:03:50.460> so<00:03:51.930> challenges<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:54.460> have<00:03:54.490> to<00:03:55.200> do<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.260> video

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
so so challenges you have to do a video

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.720 
so so challenges you have to do a video
however<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:58.420> wanna<00:03:58.570> do<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:59.640> talking<00:04:00.640> about

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
however you wanna do it talking about

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.400 
however you wanna do it talking about
how<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.450> came<00:04:02.110> up<00:04:02.170> with<00:04:02.380> your

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
how you came up with your

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.520 
how you came up with your
username<00:04:05.410> or<00:04:06.690> page<00:04:07.690> name<00:04:07.960> or<00:04:08.170> whatever<00:04:08.380> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
username or page name or whatever the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.230
