here about torn out grain torn out grain

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.900 
here about torn out grain torn out grain
is<00:00:10.420> a<00:00:10.590> terrible<00:00:11.590> thing<00:00:11.830> that<00:00:11.890> that<00:00:12.430> we<00:00:12.550> get<00:00:12.760> is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
is a terrible thing that that we get is

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.230 
is a terrible thing that that we get is
woodturners<00:00:13.540> and<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:15.219> it<00:00:15.340> does<00:00:15.520> is<00:00:15.790> is<00:00:16.030> just

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
woodturners and what it does is is just

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.380 
woodturners and what it does is is just
tears<00:00:16.770> pockets<00:00:17.770> of<00:00:17.980> little<00:00:18.369> grain<00:00:18.700> fibers<00:00:19.180> out

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
tears pockets of little grain fibers out

two main things that are going to help
you<00:00:29.650> with<00:00:29.920> torn<00:00:30.490> out<00:00:30.640> grain<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:31.179> one<00:00:31.660> is

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
you with torn out grain and one is

you with torn out grain and one is
having<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.619> sharp<00:00:32.830> tool<00:00:33.100> and<00:00:33.490> I<00:00:33.610> mean<00:00:33.850> very<00:00:33.880> very

having a sharp tool and I mean very very
sharp<00:00:34.990> when<00:00:35.770> I'm<00:00:35.890> doing<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.220> bowl<00:00:36.430> I'm<00:00:36.670> going<00:00:36.700> to

sharp when I'm doing a bowl I'm going to

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.810 
sharp when I'm doing a bowl I'm going to
sharpen<00:00:37.120> on<00:00:37.990> the<00:00:38.170> inside<00:00:38.530> of<00:00:38.560> a<00:00:39.250> bowl<00:00:39.460> I<00:00:39.490> may

sharpen on the inside of a bowl I may
sharpen<00:00:40.360> five<00:00:40.840> six<00:00:41.290> times<00:00:41.650> just<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.310> do<00:00:42.490> the

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
sharpen five six times just to do the

sharpen five six times just to do the
last<00:00:42.850> few<00:00:43.060> cuts<00:00:43.480> of<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:44.290> inside<00:00:44.590> of<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.770> bowl

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
last few cuts of the inside of the bowl

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.950 
last few cuts of the inside of the bowl
we<00:00:45.430> need<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.700> keep<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.060> tools<00:00:46.270> very<00:00:46.660> very

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
we need to keep the tools very very

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.560 
we need to keep the tools very very
sharp<00:00:47.290> after<00:00:48.160> they've<00:00:48.310> been<00:00:48.460> used<00:00:48.790> just<00:00:48.970> a<00:00:49.300> few

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
sharp after they've been used just a few

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.630 
sharp after they've been used just a few
times<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:49.930> got<00:00:50.080> thousands<00:00:50.860> of<00:00:50.980> feet<00:00:51.190> going<00:00:51.490> by

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
times you got thousands of feet going by

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.730 
times you got thousands of feet going by
the<00:00:51.700> one<00:00:52.060> little<00:00:52.360> sharp<00:00:52.660> edge<00:00:52.870> it's<00:00:53.440> going<00:00:53.620> to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
the one little sharp edge it's going to

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.040 
the one little sharp edge it's going to
get<00:00:53.890> dull<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.490> it's<00:00:55.180> not<00:00:55.360> going<00:00:55.660> to<00:00:55.750> cut<00:00:55.930> as

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
get dull and it's not going to cut as

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.570 
get dull and it's not going to cut as
cleanly<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.620> then<00:00:56.770> you<00:00:56.860> got<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.130> sand<00:00:57.400> all

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
cleanly and then you got to sand all

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.430 
cleanly and then you got to sand all
that<00:00:57.760> damage<00:00:58.180> so<00:00:58.420> sharp<00:00:58.720> tools<00:00:58.990> is<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.260> main

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
that damage so sharp tools is the main

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.040 
that damage so sharp tools is the main
thing<00:00:59.650> the<00:01:00.430> other<00:01:00.610> issue<00:01:00.880> that<00:01:01.060> people<00:01:01.720> don't

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
thing the other issue that people don't

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.600 
thing the other issue that people don't
take<00:01:02.230> seriously<00:01:02.470> enough<00:01:02.980> is<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.400> grain

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
take seriously enough is the grain

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.120 
take seriously enough is the grain
orientation<00:01:04.089> we<00:01:04.989> need<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.320> go<00:01:05.439> downhill<00:01:05.770> to

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
orientation we need to go downhill to

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.010 
orientation we need to go downhill to
the<00:01:06.400> fibers<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:07.150> having<00:01:07.420> supported

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
the fibers and so having supported

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.780 
the fibers and so having supported
fibers<00:01:08.409> when<00:01:08.590> we're<00:01:08.740> on<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.100> outside<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.729> the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
fibers when we're on the outside of the

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.540 
fibers when we're on the outside of the
bowl<00:01:10.000> we<00:01:10.720> need<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.990> go<00:01:11.140> from<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:12.130> bottom<00:01:12.460> of

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
bowl we need to go from the bottom of

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.670 
bowl we need to go from the bottom of
the<00:01:12.640> bowl<00:01:12.790> towards<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.300> rim<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:13.810> that'll<00:01:14.500> be

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
the bowl towards the rim and that'll be

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.460 
the bowl towards the rim and that'll be
supported<00:01:15.220> fibers<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:16.750> we<00:01:16.930> go<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.260> wrong<00:01:17.290> way

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
supported fibers if we go the wrong way

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.980 
supported fibers if we go the wrong way
it's<00:01:17.980> going<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.190> just<00:01:19.060> going<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.300> tear<00:01:19.630> them<00:01:19.870> up

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
it's going to just going to tear them up

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.500 
it's going to just going to tear them up
as<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.650> go<00:01:20.770> by<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.400> we<00:01:21.640> need<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.910> go<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.180> correct

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
as we go by so we need to go the correct

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.050 
as we go by so we need to go the correct
way<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:24.070> on<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.430> outside<00:01:24.730> it<00:01:24.880> takes

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
way and then on the outside it takes

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.700 
way and then on the outside it takes
special<00:01:25.180> cuts<00:01:25.690> we've<00:01:25.900> got<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.110> do<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.200> pull<00:01:26.470> cut

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
special cuts we've got to do a pull cut

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.130 
special cuts we've got to do a pull cut
and<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.010> sheer<00:01:27.250> scrape<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.730> outside<00:01:28.120> on<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
and a sheer scrape on the outside on the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.440 
and a sheer scrape on the outside on the
inside<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.650> bowl<00:01:29.830> we<00:01:30.760> have<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.060> go<00:01:31.210> from

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
inside of the bowl we have to go from

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.230 
inside of the bowl we have to go from
the<00:01:31.570> rim<00:01:31.780> towards<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.800> middle<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.310> by<00:01:34.030> doing

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
the rim towards the middle and by doing

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.710 
the rim towards the middle and by doing
that<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:36.280> go<00:01:36.460> downhill<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.180> fibers<00:01:37.570> again

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
that we go downhill to the fibers again

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.590 
that we go downhill to the fibers again
okay<00:01:38.620> and<00:01:41.010> what<00:01:42.010> happens<00:01:42.460> when<00:01:42.700> we're<00:01:43.030> we're

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
okay and what happens when we're we're

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.810 
okay and what happens when we're we're
on<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.840> inside<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.620> that<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.040> have<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.400> rely<00:01:45.790> on

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
on the inside is that we have to rely on

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.020 
on the inside is that we have to rely on
the<00:01:46.450> push<00:01:46.690> cut<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.409> rely<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
the push cut we have to rely on the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.360 
the push cut we have to rely on the
bevel<00:01:49.270> supported<00:01:49.990> push<00:01:50.229> cut<00:01:50.530> slicing<00:01:51.250> the

bevel supported push cut slicing the
fibers<00:01:51.790> as<00:01:51.940> clean<00:01:52.240> as<00:01:52.360> we<00:01:52.510> can<00:01:52.780> on<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> 45<00:01:53.500> degree

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
fibers as clean as we can on a 45 degree

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.370 
fibers as clean as we can on a 45 degree
angle<00:01:54.220> so<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:55.030> they're<00:01:55.330> sliced<00:01:55.630> off<00:01:55.870> cleanly

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
angle so that they're sliced off cleanly

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.440 
angle so that they're sliced off cleanly
and<00:01:56.530> going<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> right<00:01:57.010> direction<00:01:57.240> now<00:01:58.240> what

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
and going the right direction now what

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.539 
and going the right direction now what
happens<00:01:58.780> if<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.049> stick<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.380> scraper<00:01:59.770> in<00:02:00.010> there<00:02:00.250> or

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
happens if I stick a scraper in there or

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.690 
happens if I stick a scraper in there or
even<00:02:01.360> some<00:02:02.290> shear<00:02:02.530> scraping<00:02:02.680> methods<00:02:03.430> try<00:02:03.640> to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
even some shear scraping methods try to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.789 
even some shear scraping methods try to
use<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.150> there<00:02:04.360> always<00:02:05.260> with<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> scraper

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
use it in there always with a scraper

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.950 
use it in there always with a scraper
we'd<00:02:06.190> have<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.580> go<00:02:06.729> backwards<00:02:07.150> we'd<00:02:07.630> be<00:02:07.810> using

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
we'd have to go backwards we'd be using

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.559 
we'd have to go backwards we'd be using
the<00:02:08.319> tool<00:02:08.560> from<00:02:09.129> the<00:02:09.280> center<00:02:09.640> out<00:02:09.879> to<00:02:09.909> the<00:02:10.239> rim

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
the tool from the center out to the rim

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.690 
the tool from the center out to the rim
and<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.500> now<00:02:11.650> two<00:02:11.709> things<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.519> happened

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and so now two things have happened

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.720 
and so now two things have happened
differently<00:02:13.890> first<00:02:14.890> I'm<00:02:15.069> using<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.459> scraper

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
differently first I'm using a scraper

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.339 
differently first I'm using a scraper
which<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.299> going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.659> rough<00:02:16.959> up<00:02:17.109> the<00:02:17.319> surface

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
which is going to rough up the surface

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.680 
which is going to rough up the surface
because<00:02:18.129> it's<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.489> scraping

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
because it's just scraping

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.840 
because it's just scraping
rather<00:02:19.840> than<00:02:20.140> slicing<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.010> fibers<00:02:21.370> cleanly

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
rather than slicing the fibers cleanly

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.400 
rather than slicing the fibers cleanly
I'm<00:02:22.000> going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.240> rip<00:02:22.510> off<00:02:22.720> each<00:02:23.020> one<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.320> those

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
I'm going to rip off each one of those

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.160 
I'm going to rip off each one of those
little<00:02:23.620> end<00:02:23.860> grains<00:02:24.100> by<00:02:24.430> scraping<00:02:24.700> and

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
little end grains by scraping and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.570 
little end grains by scraping and
secondly<00:02:26.170> when<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> use<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.740> scraper<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.460> to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
secondly when I use a scraper I have to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.510 
secondly when I use a scraper I have to
go<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.850> wrong<00:02:28.090> way<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.470> never<00:02:29.710> scrape<00:02:30.190> from

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
go the wrong way I can never scrape from

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.810 
go the wrong way I can never scrape from
the<00:02:31.360> rim<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.830> bottom<00:02:33.160> you'll<00:02:33.340> always<00:02:33.550> get

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
the rim to the bottom you'll always get

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.450 
the rim to the bottom you'll always get
a<00:02:33.880> catch<00:02:34.150> going<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.690> direction<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:36.310> can

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
a catch going that direction so you can

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.850 
a catch going that direction so you can
never<00:02:36.670> scrape<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.210> way<00:02:37.500> another<00:02:38.500> thing

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
never scrape that way another thing

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.570 
never scrape that way another thing
that's<00:02:38.980> happening<00:02:39.750> when<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.960> get<00:02:41.230> into<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
that's happening when we get into the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.100 
that's happening when we get into the
rotary<00:02:42.940> forces<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.820> wood<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.450> coming

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
rotary forces of the wood is coming

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.740 
rotary forces of the wood is coming
around<00:02:47.730> here's<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.910> end<00:02:49.060> grain<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.540> here's

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
around here's the end grain and here's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.540 
around here's the end grain and here's
the<00:02:49.900> end<00:02:50.020> grain<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.380> twice<00:02:50.710> every<00:02:51.130> rotation

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
the end grain so twice every rotation

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.790 
the end grain so twice every rotation
that<00:02:52.480> end<00:02:52.780> grain<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.050> going<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.380> come<00:02:53.560> around

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
that end grain is going to come around

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.040 
that end grain is going to come around
by<00:02:54.520> our<00:02:54.790> sharp<00:02:55.120> edge<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:56.220> means<00:02:57.220> that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
by our sharp edge and that means that

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.350 
by our sharp edge and that means that
before<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.680> grain<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.490> woods<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:01.030> the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
before the in grain the woods going the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.800 
before the in grain the woods going the
wrong<00:03:01.570> way<00:03:01.840> by<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.170> tool<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.800> is<00:03:02.860> uphill

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
wrong way by the tool this is uphill

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.080 
wrong way by the tool this is uphill
unsupported<00:03:04.810> fibers<00:03:05.170> it's<00:03:05.350> going<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.560> go<00:03:06.090> just

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
unsupported fibers it's going to go just

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.880 
unsupported fibers it's going to go just
going<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.330> rip<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.600> out<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.960> then<00:03:08.470> when<00:03:08.650> we<00:03:08.770> get

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
going to rip it out and then when we get

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.440 
going to rip it out and then when we get
over<00:03:09.100> here<00:03:09.130> now<00:03:09.310> we're<00:03:09.670> going<00:03:09.700> downhill<00:03:10.090> to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
over here now we're going downhill to

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.940 
over here now we're going downhill to
the<00:03:10.540> grain<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.990> we<00:03:11.080> go<00:03:11.200> by<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.380> side<00:03:11.680> grain

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
the grain and we go by the side grain

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.690 
the grain and we go by the side grain
then<00:03:12.370> we<00:03:12.460> go<00:03:12.580> uphill<00:03:12.820> for<00:03:13.570> another<00:03:13.780> swatch

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
then we go uphill for another swatch

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.430 
then we go uphill for another swatch
just<00:03:15.700> going<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.210> rip<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.480> up<00:03:16.600> then<00:03:17.080> we<00:03:17.170> go<00:03:17.290> by

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
just going to rip it up then we go by

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.620 
just going to rip it up then we go by
the<00:03:17.500> in<00:03:17.740> grain<00:03:17.980> then<00:03:18.610> we<00:03:18.760> go<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.090> correct<00:03:19.420> way

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the in grain then we go the correct way

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.350 
the in grain then we go the correct way
we<00:03:19.780> go<00:03:19.900> downhill<00:03:20.200> this<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.770> great<00:03:21.040> here

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
we go downhill this is great here

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.030 
we go downhill this is great here
everything's<00:03:22.360> going<00:03:22.630> cool<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.380> then<00:03:23.770> we<00:03:23.890> get

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
everything's going cool and then we get

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.310 
everything's going cool and then we get
by<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.250> side<00:03:24.580> grain<00:03:24.850> which<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.690> neutral<00:03:25.840> and

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
by the side grain which is neutral and

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.920 
by the side grain which is neutral and
we<00:03:26.380> go<00:03:26.620> back<00:03:26.860> into<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.280> rough<00:03:27.790> area<00:03:28.209> again<00:03:28.480> so

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
we go back into that rough area again so

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.070 
we go back into that rough area again so
twice<00:03:29.380> every<00:03:29.830> rotation<00:03:30.270> we've<00:03:31.270> got<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.780> grain

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
twice every rotation we've got the grain

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.949 
twice every rotation we've got the grain
going<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> wrong<00:03:32.860> way<00:03:32.920> past<00:03:33.640> our<00:03:33.850> tool<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.780> we

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
going the wrong way past our tool and we

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.800 
going the wrong way past our tool and we
can't<00:03:35.260> control<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:36.130> rotary<00:03:36.459> forces<00:03:37.030> we<00:03:37.630> can

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
can't control the rotary forces we can

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.050 
can't control the rotary forces we can
only<00:03:37.989> control<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.950> fact<00:03:39.520> that<00:03:39.730> we're<00:03:39.850> going

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
only control the fact that we're going

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.790 
only control the fact that we're going
to<00:03:40.180> use<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:41.610> shearing<00:03:42.610> slicing<00:03:43.420> cut<00:03:43.690> going<00:03:44.650> the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
to use a shearing slicing cut going the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.370 
to use a shearing slicing cut going the
right<00:03:45.100> direction<00:03:45.310> across<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:46.090> tourists<00:03:46.540> all

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
right direction across the tourists all

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.979 
right direction across the tourists all
right<00:03:47.470> let's<00:03:47.709> go<00:03:47.890> over<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.610> bowl<00:03:48.820> on<00:03:49.120> the

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
right let's go over to the bowl on the

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.590 
right let's go over to the bowl on the
back<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.470> bowl<00:03:50.700> we<00:03:51.700> have<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:52.120> have<00:03:52.269> some

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
back of the bowl we have to have some

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.449 
back of the bowl we have to have some
different<00:03:52.780> cuts<00:03:53.140> we<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.680> have<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.890> pull

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
different cuts we have to have a pull

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.970 
different cuts we have to have a pull
cut<00:03:54.730> we<00:03:54.910> have<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.209> have<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:56.019> slicing<00:03:56.590> action

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
cut we have to have the slicing action

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.770 
cut we have to have the slicing action
happening<00:03:57.550> with<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.850> bit<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.360> handle

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
happening with the bit with the handle

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.810 
happening with the bit with the handle
down<00:03:58.959> writing<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.920> bevel<00:04:00.160> on<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.280> side<00:04:00.550> we're

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
down writing the bevel on the side we're

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.000 
down writing the bevel on the side we're
going<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:01.000> pull<00:04:01.269> this<00:04:01.600> direction<00:04:02.200> we<00:04:02.739> can<00:04:02.890> do

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
going to pull this direction we can do

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.699 
going to pull this direction we can do
that<00:04:03.160> in<00:04:03.340> slow<00:04:03.610> motion<00:04:03.850> we<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.900> see<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
that in slow motion we can see the

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.660 
that in slow motion we can see the
slicing<00:04:06.310> action<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.840> going<00:04:08.170> downhill<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.550> the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
slicing action is going downhill to the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.590 
slicing action is going downhill to the
fibers<00:04:10.090> alright<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.030> have<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.390> have<00:04:13.480> the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
fibers alright so I have to have the

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.790 
fibers alright so I have to have the
handle<00:04:13.840> down<00:04:13.900> what<00:04:14.110> happens<00:04:14.380> if<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.560> have<00:04:14.680> the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
handle down what happens if I have the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.680 
handle down what happens if I have the
handle<00:04:15.160> up<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.459> do<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.730> I'm<00:04:15.970> just<00:04:16.510> going<00:04:16.660> to

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
handle up and do that I'm just going to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.960 
handle up and do that I'm just going to
be<00:04:16.810> ripping<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.290> up<00:04:17.440> or<00:04:17.830> if<00:04:18.310> I'm<00:04:18.459> going<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.790> take

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
be ripping it up or if I'm going to take

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.449 
be ripping it up or if I'm going to take
a<00:04:19.000> cut<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.660> wrong<00:04:19.870> direction<00:04:20.109> with<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.220> cut

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
a cut the wrong direction with the cut

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.430 
a cut the wrong direction with the cut
happening<00:04:21.880> this<00:04:22.090> way<00:04:22.360> then<00:04:22.930> I'm<00:04:23.050> going<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.260> rip

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
happening this way then I'm going to rip

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.770 
happening this way then I'm going to rip
it<00:04:23.590> up<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.010> have<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.400> sand<00:04:24.669> all<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:24.880> damage<00:04:25.330> so

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
it up and have to sand all the damage so

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.690 
it up and have to sand all the damage so
I<00:04:25.810> want<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.169> go<00:04:26.320> from<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.770> foot<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.460> rim

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
I want to go from the foot to the rim

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.600 
I want to go from the foot to the rim
with<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.510> slicing<00:04:28.990> peeling<00:04:29.680> action<00:04:30.130> all<00:04:30.490> right

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
with a slicing peeling action all right

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.909 
with a slicing peeling action all right
and<00:04:30.850> that's<00:04:31.630> going<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.930> give<00:04:32.110> me<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.410> cleanest

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
and that's going to give me the cleanest

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:33.480 
and that's going to give me the cleanest
cut<00:04:33.130> that

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
cut that

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.900 
cut that
a<00:04:33.509> cannon<00:04:34.509> and<00:04:34.810> going<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.979> prevent<00:04:36.669> me<00:04:36.880> from

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
a cannon and going to prevent me from

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.550 
a cannon and going to prevent me from
having<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.389> sand<00:04:37.660> all<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:37.990> torn<00:04:38.229> up<00:04:38.349> grain

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
having to sand all that torn up grain

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.249 
having to sand all that torn up grain
when<00:04:39.370> we're<00:04:39.520> shear<00:04:39.759> scraping<00:04:39.910> we're<00:04:40.389> also<00:04:40.599> on

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
when we're shear scraping we're also on

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.159 
when we're shear scraping we're also on
a<00:04:41.319> steep<00:04:42.009> angle<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.150> we're<00:04:43.569> peeling

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
a steep angle so that we're peeling

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.900 
a steep angle so that we're peeling
downhill<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.009> fibers<00:04:45.430> with<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.639> sheer

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
downhill to the fibers with a sheer

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.719 
downhill to the fibers with a sheer
scrape<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.229> angle<00:04:47.590> is<00:04:47.949> going<00:04:48.490> the

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
scrape and that that angle is going the

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.870 
scrape and that that angle is going the
right<00:04:48.910> direction<00:04:49.180> it's<00:04:50.139> going<00:04:50.470> downhill<00:04:50.880> to

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
right direction it's going downhill to

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.040 
right direction it's going downhill to
the<00:04:52.000> fibers<00:04:53.970> with<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.000> very<00:04:55.330> sharp<00:04:55.569> tool<00:04:55.870> we're

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
the fibers with a very sharp tool we're

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.110 
the fibers with a very sharp tool we're
going<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.199> use<00:04:56.259> the<00:04:56.530> burr<00:04:56.770> on<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.220> on<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.880> wing

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
going to use the burr on the on the wing

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.659 
going to use the burr on the on the wing
to<00:04:58.960> make<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.139> nice<00:04:59.410> sheer<00:04:59.710> scrape<00:05:00.039> cut<00:05:00.509> okay<00:05:02.669> so

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
to make a nice sheer scrape cut okay so

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.600 
to make a nice sheer scrape cut okay so
on<00:05:03.759> the<00:05:03.880> outside<00:05:03.910> we<00:05:04.300> have<00:05:05.020> lots<00:05:05.289> of<00:05:05.500> tools<00:05:06.310> we

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
on the outside we have lots of tools we

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.180 
on the outside we have lots of tools we
have<00:05:06.729> a<00:05:06.759> pull<00:05:07.090> cut<00:05:07.389> we<00:05:08.259> have<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.530> shear<00:05:08.860> scrape

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
have a pull cut we have a shear scrape

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.760 
have a pull cut we have a shear scrape
we<00:05:09.729> can<00:05:09.880> clean<00:05:10.180> off<00:05:10.389> that<00:05:10.419> surface<00:05:10.960> so<00:05:11.620> it

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
we can clean off that surface so it

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.830 
we can clean off that surface so it
looks<00:05:12.009> like<00:05:12.069> it's<00:05:12.430> sandable<00:05:13.270> down<00:05:13.509> to<00:05:13.720> about

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
looks like it's sandable down to about

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.219 
looks like it's sandable down to about
320<00:05:14.500> grit<00:05:14.650> starting<00:05:15.190> with<00:05:15.699> about<00:05:15.819> 320<00:05:16.449> on<00:05:16.599> the

inside we cannot should scrape we cannot
shear<00:05:22.389> scrape<00:05:22.659> on<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:22.960> inside<00:05:23.669> because<00:05:24.669> we'd

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
shear scrape on the inside because we'd

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.059 
shear scrape on the inside because we'd
be<00:05:25.000> going<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.300> wrong<00:05:25.449> way<00:05:25.509> and<00:05:26.080> I<00:05:26.710> don't<00:05:26.770> want

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
be going the wrong way and I don't want

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.529 
be going the wrong way and I don't want
to<00:05:27.130> scrape<00:05:27.430> we<00:05:27.669> talked<00:05:27.880> about<00:05:28.000> that<00:05:28.300> on<00:05:28.449> the

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
to scrape we talked about that on the

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.559 
to scrape we talked about that on the
chalkboard<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:29.800> on<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.069> inside<00:05:30.460> if<00:05:31.419> you're

chalkboard so on the inside if you're

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.510 
chalkboard so on the inside if you're
going<00:05:31.780> downhill<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.500> fibers<00:05:32.919> with<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.250> push

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
to be a lot cleaner than we could with

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.149 
to be a lot cleaner than we could with

any kind of scraping mode scraping can

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.330 
any kind of scraping mode scraping can

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
get a nice smooth surface here but it's

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.189 
get a nice smooth surface here but it's
all<00:06:06.490> going<00:06:06.639> to<00:06:06.729> be<00:06:06.819> torn<00:06:07.120> up<00:06:07.360> on<00:06:07.509> the<00:06:07.870> in<00:06:07.990> grain

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
all going to be torn up on the in grain

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.719 
all going to be torn up on the in grain
and<00:06:08.440> then<00:06:08.680> we<00:06:08.770> have<00:06:08.889> to<00:06:09.009> go<00:06:09.130> sand<00:06:09.430> all<00:06:09.580> that

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
and then we have to go sand all that

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.320 
and then we have to go sand all that
damage<00:06:09.940> so<00:06:11.190> even<00:06:12.190> if<00:06:12.340> I've<00:06:12.520> got<00:06:12.759> bad<00:06:13.030> tool

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
damage so even if I've got bad tool

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.059 
damage so even if I've got bad tool
control<00:06:13.750> and<00:06:13.990> I<00:06:14.050> have<00:06:14.259> some<00:06:14.530> tool<00:06:14.770> marks

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069 
control and I have some tool marks

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.580 
control and I have some tool marks
involved<00:06:15.819> with<00:06:15.969> my<00:06:16.120> push<00:06:16.360> cut<00:06:16.599> it's<00:06:17.289> still

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
involved with my push cut it's still

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.080 
involved with my push cut it's still
going<00:06:17.740> to<00:06:17.800> be<00:06:17.889> easier<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.430> sand<00:06:18.639> out<00:06:18.849> those

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
going to be easier to sand out those

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.580 
going to be easier to sand out those
little<00:06:19.270> two<00:06:19.479> marks<00:06:19.780> that<00:06:19.930> it<00:06:20.110> is<00:06:20.199> to<00:06:20.319> sand

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
little two marks that it is to sand

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.770 
little two marks that it is to sand
through<00:06:20.800> some<00:06:21.069> POC<00:06:21.280> dough<00:06:21.490> torn<00:06:22.360> out<00:06:22.479> grain

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
through some POC dough torn out grain

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.809 
through some POC dough torn out grain
okay<00:06:23.590> so<00:06:23.740> let's<00:06:24.009> turn<00:06:24.190> the<00:06:24.310> lathe<00:06:24.460> on<00:06:24.669> and

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
okay so let's turn the lathe on and

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.339 
okay so let's turn the lathe on and
we'll<00:06:24.909> just<00:06:25.090> get<00:06:25.240> one<00:06:25.479> little<00:06:25.659> cut<00:06:25.960> here<00:06:26.199> so

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
we'll just get one little cut here so

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:31.670 
we'll just get one little cut here so
you<00:06:26.800> can<00:06:26.949> see<00:06:27.159> it<00:06:27.280> in<00:06:27.400> live-action<00:06:28.020> okay

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:40.010 

45<00:06:32.680> degrees<00:06:32.889> slicing<00:06:33.669> action<00:06:34.150> downhill

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.350 

you<00:06:40.560> notice<00:06:40.889> how<00:06:41.009> slow<00:06:41.370> I'm<00:06:41.580> going<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:42.180> nice

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
you notice how slow I'm going the nice

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.610 
you notice how slow I'm going the nice
slow<00:06:42.810> pace<00:06:43.069> means<00:06:44.069> that<00:06:44.340> the<00:06:45.470> fibers<00:06:46.470> are

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
slow pace means that the fibers are

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.770 
slow pace means that the fibers are
being<00:06:46.830> sliced<00:06:47.250> cleanly<00:06:47.879> I'm<00:06:48.030> patiently

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
being sliced cleanly I'm patiently

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.189 
being sliced cleanly I'm patiently
waiting<00:06:49.289> for<00:06:49.319> those<00:06:49.620> rotary<00:06:50.870> forces<00:06:51.870> to<00:06:52.020> come

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
waiting for those rotary forces to come

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.960 
waiting for those rotary forces to come
all<00:06:52.409> the<00:06:52.530> way<00:06:52.560> around<00:06:52.830> round<00:06:53.400> and<00:06:53.610> around<00:06:53.669> and

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
all the way around round and around and

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.879 
all the way around round and around and
around<00:06:54.060> and<00:06:54.330> around<00:06:54.449> again<00:06:54.810> going<00:06:55.620> by<00:06:55.830> the

around and around again going by the
tool<00:06:56.250> slowly<00:06:56.669> I<00:06:59.990> can<00:07:00.990> leave<00:07:01.110> a<00:07:01.139> nice<00:07:01.470> smooth

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
tool slowly I can leave a nice smooth

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.219 
tool slowly I can leave a nice smooth

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
going to be cleaner than the torn-up

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.800
