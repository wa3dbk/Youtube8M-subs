00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 my name is andrea vogelsang 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.610
 for 25 years old and was for the team 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.610
 Bergamont in the area there and slopestyle 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.300
 I actually ride a bike for so long 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.160
 I can think 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.480
 I started at the age of 15 with the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.949
 to build first small jumps 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.360
 Well, if the bulls over time then 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.500
 getting bigger and bigger in may this 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.110
 I had a pretty difficult year 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.370
 fall I am in turn with the front wheel 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.839
 slipped away and got me that 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.940
 shoulder joint and what can you do 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.050
 use 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.909
 I still have one with the karman 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.440
 a few problems but think that that 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.580
 with time and further training 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.580
 improve 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.100
 injury driving I believe for 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.170
 every athlete of his sport 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.350
 professionally operates something real 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.350
 bad 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.760
 I am really happy that this 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.410
 four and a half months are over now and 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.490
 I'm fully back on my feet 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.490
 cycling can concentrate 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.039
 Physiotherapy is the first thing done 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.689
 then you go to the trampoline that 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.380
 entire body demands and muscles 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.380
 thawing again 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.530
 besides , it coincides with my regularly 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.270
 trailer rehbocks from bergamo by the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.270
 to build up forest and condition again 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.430
 So four and a half months back on 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.580
 the wheel really sit us a hammer 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.580
 feeling 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.500
 finally the tricks to make 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.000
 Can you think of the whole time 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.860
 has and train again now 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.819
 to perfection so really cross a 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.819
 indescribable feeling 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.060
 but it feels good in the evening 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.600
 to be able to drive you get nothing 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.600
 away from it 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.180
 as long as I am healthy and can drive 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.180
 if I continue to drive anyway
