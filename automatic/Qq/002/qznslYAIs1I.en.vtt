outside<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.710> bugging<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.130> crap

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
outside of just like bugging the crap

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.570 
outside of just like bugging the crap
out<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> your<00:01:20.759> opponent's<00:01:21.890> minor<00:01:22.890> map<00:01:23.159> control

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
but maybe with a nerf to Oracle's will

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.950 
but maybe with a nerf to Oracle's will
he<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:25.860> insane<00:01:26.220> stupid<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.840> that's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
he be more insane stupid I think that's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.300 
he be more insane stupid I think that's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
probably why they got an ER from because

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.780 
probably why they got an ER from because
