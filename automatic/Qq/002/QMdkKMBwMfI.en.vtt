00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.700 

hello<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.570> welcome<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.320> slingshot

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
hello and welcome to the slingshot

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.189 
hello and welcome to the slingshot
channel<00:00:13.950> last<00:00:14.880> time<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.480> experimented<00:00:15.990> with

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
channel last time we experimented with

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.880 
channel last time we experimented with
this<00:00:17.010> spike<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:18.109> the<00:00:19.109> spike<00:00:19.439> actually

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
this spike and the spike actually

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.939 
this spike and the spike actually
injects<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.670> contents<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.619> 12<00:00:22.619> grams

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
injects the contents of this 12 grams

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.670 
injects the contents of this 12 grams
your<00:00:23.340> two<00:00:23.490> cartridge<00:00:23.970> into<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> skull<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
your two cartridge into a skull of a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.929 
your two cartridge into a skull of a
zombie<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.840> worked<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.849> we

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
zombie and it worked but I think that we

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
zombie and it worked but I think that we
can<00:00:30.119> max<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.140> true<00:00:31.470> slingshot

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
can max this out in true slingshot

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.479 
can max this out in true slingshot
channel<00:00:32.369> style<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.960> what<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.860> found<00:00:35.160> an

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
channel style so this is what I found an

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.350 
channel style so this is what I found an
88<00:00:36.390> gram<00:00:36.750> capsule<00:00:37.469> which<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.969> seven

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
88 gram capsule which is about seven

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
88 gram capsule which is about seven
times<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:40.050> content<00:00:40.559> than<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.610> this

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
times more content than this one so this

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
times more content than this one so this
has<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:42.210> six<00:00:42.450> letters<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.469> has<00:00:43.680> over

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
has about six letters and this has over

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.029 
has about six letters and this has over
forty<00:00:44.430> liters<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> gas<00:00:45.260> which<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.680> inject

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
forty liters of gas which we can inject

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.100 
forty liters of gas which we can inject
into<00:00:47.250> an<00:00:47.520> opponent<00:00:48.000> skull<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> big

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
into an opponent skull one of the big

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.170 
into an opponent skull one of the big
advantages<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.969> has<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
advantages of this is that it has a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.990 
advantages of this is that it has a
threaded<00:00:51.809> tip<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.860> don't<00:00:53.100> need<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.670> put<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
threaded tip so we don't need to put it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569 
threaded tip so we don't need to put it
inside<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.629> tube<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.980> attach<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
inside of a tube we just can attach the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.150 
inside of a tube we just can attach the
entire<00:00:56.850> spike<00:00:57.300> construction<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.859> let<00:00:59.010> me

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
entire spike construction here so let me

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
entire spike construction here so let me
show<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> came<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.180> turned<00:01:00.719> for

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
show you what I came up with turned for

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.670 
show you what I came up with turned for
massive<00:01:01.440> steel<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.750> remove<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
massive steel so I can remove the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
massive steel so I can remove the
cartridge<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:08.510> this<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.189> spike<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.900> as

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
cartridge and this is the spike and as

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.830 
cartridge and this is the spike and as
you<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:14.310> diameter<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.180> hole<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.630> here

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you see the diameter of the hole in here

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
you see the diameter of the hole in here
is<00:01:15.990> two<00:01:16.200> millimetres<00:01:16.710> instead<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.220> only<00:01:17.549> one

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
is two millimetres instead of only one

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
is two millimetres instead of only one
millimeter<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:19.380> this

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
millimeter and that is because this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.550 
millimeter and that is because this
allows<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> lot<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:21.150> Headroom<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.259> punch

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
allows for a lot more Headroom to punch

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.020 
allows for a lot more Headroom to punch
through<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.040> has<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.250> enough<00:01:26.820> Headroom

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
through so this has just enough Headroom

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.050 
through so this has just enough Headroom
to<00:01:27.360> punch<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> cartridge<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.670> these<00:01:29.670> four

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to punch the cartridge and these four

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.330 
to punch the cartridge and these four
ejector<00:01:30.570> holes<00:01:30.750> make<00:01:31.079> sure<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.710> enough<00:01:32.040> gas

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
ejector holes make sure that enough gas

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.240 
ejector holes make sure that enough gas
is<00:01:32.700> injected<00:01:33.540> into<00:01:34.020> these<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> skull<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
is injected into these on the skull and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.780 
is injected into these on the skull and
as<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.420> tip<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.500> hollow<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.579> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
as you see the tip is not hollow so that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.789 
as you see the tip is not hollow so that
this<00:01:38.970> won't<00:01:39.390> turn<00:01:39.600> into<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.869> rocket<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.530> last

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
this won't turn into a rocket like last

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.490 
this won't turn into a rocket like last
time<00:01:41.040> first<00:01:42.030> again<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.630> test<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.020> against<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
time first again we test it against the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.880 
time first again we test it against the
grapefruit

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
grapefruit

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.719 
grapefruit
Wow<00:01:47.860> hahahahahahaha

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.030 

while<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.600> cut<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> grapefruit<00:01:55.409> clean<00:01:55.799> in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
while we cut the grapefruit clean in

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
while we cut the grapefruit clean in
half<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.750> completely

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
half and you see that it's completely

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.130 
half and you see that it's completely
frosted<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.000> inside<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.720> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
frosted just like the inside of the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.200 
frosted just like the inside of the
grapefruit<00:02:01.619> that's<00:02:02.490> actually<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> lot<00:02:03.180> more

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
grapefruit that's actually a lot more

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
grapefruit that's actually a lot more
effective<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> small<00:02:04.590> 12<00:02:04.920> plain

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
effective than the small 12 plain

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.249 
effective than the small 12 plain
cartridge<00:02:05.580> next<00:02:06.210> test<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.659> fall<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> are

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
cartridge next test this fall it are

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:23.720 
cartridge next test this fall it are
plastic

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.970 

what<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> tough<00:02:24.690> plastic<00:02:25.230> bottle<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.709> did<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
what a tough plastic bottle but did you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.400 
what a tough plastic bottle but did you
see<00:02:26.220> how<00:02:26.640> much<00:02:26.880> pressure<00:02:27.180> was<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.290> it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
see how much pressure was on it and it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.960 
see how much pressure was on it and it
actually<00:02:28.560> squeezed<00:02:29.130> out<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.610> sides<00:02:29.819> but

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
actually squeezed out to the sides but

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.420 
actually squeezed out to the sides but
it<00:02:30.209> really<00:02:30.450> blew<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.810> up<00:02:31.020> that's<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.860> lot<00:02:32.099> of<00:02:32.130> gas

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
it really blew it up that's a lot of gas

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.449 
it really blew it up that's a lot of gas
look<00:02:33.000> how<00:02:33.180> cold<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.930> got<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.250> covered

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
look how cold it got it's just covered

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.400 
look how cold it got it's just covered
with<00:02:35.640> ice

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
with ice

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.350

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
okay now we will try this melon but I

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.460 
okay now we will try this melon but I
put<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.640> little<00:02:47.940> bit<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.209> plywood<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.930> top<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.319> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
put a little bit of plywood on top of it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.699 
put a little bit of plywood on top of it
to<00:02:49.620> simulate<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.700> bone<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.780> skull<00:02:54.709> okay

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
to simulate the bone of the skull okay

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.600 
to simulate the bone of the skull okay
that<00:02:56.100> was<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> miserable<00:02:56.519> hit<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.230> did

that was a miserable hit but it did
erupt<00:02:59.610> into<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.060> melon<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.690> actually

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
erupt into the melon and it actually

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.949 
erupt into the melon and it actually
split<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.470> melon

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.970 

now<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.349> ultimate<00:03:07.950> test<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:09.019> veritable<00:03:10.019> ivan

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
head from the zombie go boom guys that's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.399 
head from the zombie go boom guys that's
actually<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.129> fantastic<00:03:14.640> thing<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.540> has<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.959> real

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
actually a fantastic thing it has a real

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.610 
actually a fantastic thing it has a real
skull<00:03:16.950> simulation<00:03:17.640> inside<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.170> filled

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
skull simulation inside and it is filled

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.589 
skull simulation inside and it is filled
again<00:03:20.010> with<00:03:20.609> my<00:03:20.790> typical<00:03:21.060> blood

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
again with my typical blood

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.009 
again with my typical blood
we<00:03:22.230> selected<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.859> semen<00:03:23.400> sake<00:03:23.639> pinot<00:03:24.510> Tosh<00:03:24.750> from

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
we selected a semen sake pinot Tosh from

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.179 
we selected a semen sake pinot Tosh from
2001<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.829> time<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:28.650> should<00:03:28.859> be<00:03:29.010> as

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
2001 this time and this should be as

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.119 
2001 this time and this should be as
hard<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.700> as<00:03:29.849> tough<00:03:30.150> as<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.480> zombie<00:03:30.930> skull<00:03:31.409> so

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
hard and as tough as a zombie skull so

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.490 
hard and as tough as a zombie skull so
we'll<00:03:32.459> see<00:03:32.849> what<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.299> thing<00:03:33.659> can<00:03:33.689> do<00:03:34.049> against

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
we'll see what this thing can do against

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.619 
we'll see what this thing can do against
it<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.769> will<00:03:35.099> try<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.340> hit<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.819> monster<00:03:36.299> from

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
it I will try to hit the monster from

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.780 
it I will try to hit the monster from
the<00:03:36.719> back<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.170> its<00:03:37.349> head<00:03:37.439> we<00:03:38.219> have<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.370> discount

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the back of its head we have a discount

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:48.410 
the back of its head we have a discount
is<00:03:38.879> very<00:03:39.030> hard

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:04:14.650 

Wow<00:03:49.860> did<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:50.950> hear<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.250> boiling

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.770 

it<00:04:15.290> seems<00:04:15.680> like<00:04:16.040> that<00:04:16.850> skull<00:04:17.180> wasn't<00:04:17.570> really

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
it seems like that skull wasn't really

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.390 
it seems like that skull wasn't really
hard<00:04:17.930> enough<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.470> make<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.740> cartridge<00:04:19.130> really

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
hard enough to make the cartridge really

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.280 
hard enough to make the cartridge really
pop<00:04:19.610> this<00:04:20.090> means<00:04:20.330> I<00:04:20.450> can<00:04:20.600> make<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:21.080> little

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
pop this means I can make this a little

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.320 
pop this means I can make this a little
bit<00:04:21.470> more<00:04:21.620> blunt<00:04:21.950> or<00:04:22.130> despite<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.910> little<00:04:23.240> bit

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
bit more blunt or despite a little bit

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.360 
bit more blunt or despite a little bit
more<00:04:23.540> sharp<00:04:23.800> because<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:24.980> pierces<00:04:25.340> the

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
more sharp because it pierces the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.850 
more sharp because it pierces the
cartridge<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:26.060> not<00:04:26.240> all<00:04:26.420> the<00:04:26.600> way<00:04:26.720> but<00:04:27.710> still

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
cartridge but not all the way but still

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.370 
cartridge but not all the way but still
look<00:04:28.820> at<00:04:29.000> what<00:04:29.150> happened<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:29.720> mean<00:04:30.170> this

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
look at what happened I mean this

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.650 
look at what happened I mean this
probably<00:04:30.950> doesn't<00:04:31.250> even<00:04:31.370> need<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:32.210> cartridge

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
probably doesn't even need the cartridge

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.490 
probably doesn't even need the cartridge
to<00:04:32.900> be<00:04:33.500> deadly

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.560 

it<00:04:37.100> is<00:04:37.250> great<00:04:37.490> fun<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:37.880> test<00:04:38.060> all<00:04:38.270> kinds<00:04:38.540> of

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
it is great fun to test all kinds of

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.320 
it is great fun to test all kinds of
weapons<00:04:38.900> against<00:04:39.290> this<00:04:39.410> zombie<00:04:40.370> simulation

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
weapons against this zombie simulation

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.880 
weapons against this zombie simulation
and<00:04:41.750> actually<00:04:42.110> there's<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.410> whole<00:04:42.590> channel

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
and actually there's a whole channel

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.950 
and actually there's a whole channel
that<00:04:43.130> just<00:04:43.160> deals<00:04:43.610> with<00:04:43.910> this<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.630> says<00:04:44.840> only

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
that just deals with this it says only

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
for me away hurt myself somewhere in the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.620 
for me away hurt myself somewhere in the
process<00:04:54.230> of<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.500> tests<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.970> happens<00:04:56.390> when

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
process of the tests that happens when

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.980 
process of the tests that happens when
you<00:04:56.720> work<00:04:56.870> with<00:04:56.930> spiky<00:04:57.620> stuff<00:04:58.540> never<00:04:59.540> mind

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
you work with spiky stuff never mind

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.530 
you work with spiky stuff never mind
okay<00:05:00.650> as<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.040> see<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.280> thoroughly<00:05:01.730> wet<00:05:02.270> and

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
okay as you see I thoroughly wet and

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.400 
okay as you see I thoroughly wet and
smell<00:05:03.320> like<00:05:03.500> red<00:05:03.800> wine<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.990> is<00:05:06.050> rather

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
smell like red wine this is rather

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.980 
smell like red wine this is rather
effective<00:05:07.040> there's<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.430> lot<00:05:07.670> of<00:05:07.820> gas<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.300> think

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
effective there's a lot of gas I think

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.840 
effective there's a lot of gas I think
the<00:05:09.320> only<00:05:09.470> problem<00:05:09.680> is<00:05:10.010> that<00:05:10.040> this<00:05:10.340> spike<00:05:10.670> is

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
the only problem is that this spike is

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.730 
the only problem is that this spike is
just<00:05:11.150> too<00:05:11.300> effective<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:12.290> punches<00:05:12.680> through

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
just too effective it punches through

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.440 
just too effective it punches through
everything<00:05:13.130> without<00:05:13.580> popping<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.060> cartridge
