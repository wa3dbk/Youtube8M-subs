patterned<00:00:07.500> paper<00:00:08.120> which<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.300> need<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.480> flip

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
patterned paper which you need to flip

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.660 
patterned paper which you need to flip
over<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> pattern<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.740> facing<00:00:11.190> down<00:00:11.370> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
over so the pattern is facing down and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.529 
over so the pattern is facing down and
fold<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.360> half

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:25.290 

and<00:00:16.980> make<00:00:17.980> sure<00:00:18.160> you<00:00:18.279> have<00:00:18.429> a<00:00:18.460> strong<00:00:18.849> crease

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.210 

you

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.520 

then<00:00:44.820> flip<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> over<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.140> bring<00:00:48.200> these<00:00:49.200> two

then flip it over and bring these two

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.140 
then flip it over and bring these two
folds<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.550> middle

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.010 

you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.220 

and<00:01:02.490> again<00:01:03.490> with<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.760> other<00:01:03.850> side

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.360 

these<00:01:11.230> two<00:01:11.410> fold<00:01:11.650> should<00:01:11.800> meet<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.250> middle

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
these two fold should meet in the middle

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.460 
these two fold should meet in the middle
and<00:01:12.730> give<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.960> sort<00:01:14.260> of<00:01:14.350> trough<00:01:14.860> shape

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.630 

then<00:01:18.370> flip<00:01:18.670> over<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.210> fold<00:01:19.570> almost<00:01:20.170> in<00:01:20.350> half

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
then flip over and fold almost in half

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.250 
then flip over and fold almost in half
but<00:01:21.640> leaving<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.060> 1<00:01:22.210> centimeter<00:01:22.600> gap<00:01:23.050> at<00:01:23.230> the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
but leaving a 1 centimeter gap at the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.780 
but leaving a 1 centimeter gap at the
top<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.710> crease<00:01:24.340> down<00:01:24.550> firmly<00:01:24.910> at<00:01:25.120> the<00:01:25.180> bottom

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.429 

so<00:01:29.790> keeping<00:01:30.149> this<00:01:30.299> small<00:01:30.689> apart<00:01:31.079> at<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so keeping this small apart at the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.870 
so keeping this small apart at the
bottom<00:01:31.909> fold<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.810> back<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.409> itself

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
bottom fold this in and back on itself

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.859 
bottom fold this in and back on itself
to<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:36.060> about<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> centimeter<00:01:37.110> fold<00:01:38.869> which

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to make about a centimeter fold which

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.710 
to make about a centimeter fold which
looks<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.060> will<00:01:42.240> become<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
looks like this so this will become the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.350 
looks like this so this will become the
waistband<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.680> dress<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> pitch<00:01:45.210> that

v-neck<00:02:37.659> shape

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.640 

once<00:02:44.240> that's<00:02:44.510> done<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.370> fold<00:02:46.370> over<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:47.000> sides

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
once that's done you fold over the sides

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.610 
once that's done you fold over the sides
all<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.680> way<00:02:48.860> down<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.320> make<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
all the way down and then you make the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.420 
all the way down and then you make the
angle<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.460> dress<00:02:53.380> by<00:02:54.380> folding<00:02:54.740> down<00:02:54.980> the
