00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.140
 morinade battle heat young tone 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.059
 horse I discover it still a little 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.710
 that's what for now 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.750
 what are you feeling for now 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.660
 so that on horseback really a case 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.099
 a lot of energy limits even times 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.740
 too much because he can skip a whole 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.210
 little bit forward open of the blow 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.279
 and open up a little bit of second 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.920
 jump so I put a little bit 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.110
 device or with some bars 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.670
 before and behind to just be able to 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.670
 mechanized it happens a little bit to make a 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.320
 sarre jump in a decade years that depart 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.879
 a little in length the bars that go 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.129
 do the work for you almost 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.629
 that's exactly we just know by 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.609
 compared to what happened to him 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.829
 position in his battue of parks 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.929
 the horse fasts his jump and that behind 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.579
 there is this second bar they 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.379
 Be behind for precisely obliged 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.309
 horse to round on the jump is not 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.710
 jump too long 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.910
 well you watch us that you know me 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.910
 say what you feel after 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.550
 Freche it's the choices out a little 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.080
 little watched the basement second 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.430
 so just for the trust they 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.420
 trivialize just a little bit 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.420
 bedrock 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.630
 ok it was already better 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.790
 the goal is really to take his 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.350
 time at the entrance there and that trivializes all 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.570
 the others that I manage to make 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.790
 little jumps after I do not mind 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.310
 to really blow it up 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.050
 the ice dispatch a little here is just 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.690
 that he manages to trivialize a 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.700
 little bit slow sleep on his bars there 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.590
 who are not for him to get to do 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.490
 easy jumps and that he uses well 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.490
 his body okay 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.450
 I'm not so banal so week it 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.250
 has been almost too long for now 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.989
 there is a little bit of freshness but by 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.280
 against despite all the jump is good there 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.500
 it's just a little bit of fun so 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.150
 it's not what it is not very well be the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 modern it's a wish horse had 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.980
 full of blood and a lot of strikes
