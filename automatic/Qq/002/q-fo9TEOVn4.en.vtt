00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.999 
does but this is actually a lot more
difficult<00:01:19.020> than<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.200> thought<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.439> would<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.799> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
difficult than I thought it would be I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.560 
difficult than I thought it would be I
look<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> sam<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.909> first<00:01:21.180> breaking<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
look at the sam is first breaking the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
look at the sam is first breaking the
match<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.200> he<00:01:22.380> scores<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
match and he scores you know it's so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.340 
match and he scores you know it's so
difficult<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.810> close<00:01:24.990> them<00:01:25.170> down<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
difficult like you can close them down a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.649 
difficult like you can close them down a
bit<00:01:25.439> using<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> B<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.310> our<00:01:26.490> paper<00:01:26.759> it's

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
bit using the a B in our paper it's

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.880 
bit using the a B in our paper it's
still<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:27.960> difficult<00:01:28.439> especially<00:01:28.560> when

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
still really difficult especially when

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.109 
still really difficult especially when
you<00:01:28.979> can't<00:01:29.100> move<00:01:29.340> them<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> man's<00:01:30.060> not

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you can't move them on if the man's not

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.520 
you can't move them on if the man's not
really<00:01:30.390> close<00:01:30.600> enough<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.960> use<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> or

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
really close enough to use the a or

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
really close enough to use the a or
something<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.220> don't<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.820> hard<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
something or I don't know it's hard to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.280 
something or I don't know it's hard to
explain<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.600> really<00:01:33.780> difficult<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
explain it's really difficult if and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.899
