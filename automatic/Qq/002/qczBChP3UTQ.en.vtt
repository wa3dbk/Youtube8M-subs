even easier flew I'm doing on the
hardest<00:01:41.250> difficulty<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> game<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.560> know<00:01:43.560> he

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
hardest difficulty in the game I know he

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.889 
hardest difficulty in the game I know he
does<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.100> down<00:01:44.130> without<00:01:44.610> yeah<00:01:45.000> take<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.689> any

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
doing this to keep looking around in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.130 
doing this to keep looking around in
case<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.740> lurkers<00:01:53.220> come<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.579> his<00:01:53.960> whilst<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
case the lurkers come with his whilst of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.389 
case the lurkers come with his whilst of
trying<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> record<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.860> method<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.280> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
trying to record this method up I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.020 
trying to record this method up I
figured<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.700> out

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
figured it out

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
figured it out
happen<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> few<00:01:57.780> times<00:01:58.200> where<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.560> we

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
happen a few times where I like we

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.289 
happen a few times where I like we
caught<00:01:58.920> behind<00:01:59.250> me<00:01:59.490> while<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.820> shooting<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
caught behind me while so shooting it

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450 
caught behind me while so shooting it
and<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> lurker<00:02:00.780> would<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.259> set<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and the lurker would then set the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.069 
and the lurker would then set the
crusher<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.180> make<00:02:03.299> him<00:02:03.450> run<00:02:03.570> forward<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
crusher up and make him run forward and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.870 
crusher up and make him run forward and
then<00:02:04.200> once<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.009> guy<00:02:05.219> comes<00:02:05.430> running<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.700> few

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
then once that guy comes running a few

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.359 
then once that guy comes running a few

base I'm doing this on my own this was

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.140 
base I'm doing this on my own this was
single-player<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.580> don't<00:02:11.790> need<00:02:11.879> people

pretty<00:02:17.970> hard<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> other<00:02:19.650> way

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
pretty hard to do and the other way

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.050 
pretty hard to do and the other way
unless<00:02:20.310> there's<00:02:20.549> a<00:02:20.580> way<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.849> haven't

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
unless there's a way that I haven't

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
unless there's a way that I haven't
figured<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.420> yet<00:02:21.680> yeah<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.159> way<00:02:23.280> I
