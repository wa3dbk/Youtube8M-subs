part washing today first task well
yesterday<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.369> ran<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.300> holes<00:00:18.510> all<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.750> way

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
yesterday I ran my holes all the way

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.080 
yesterday I ran my holes all the way
down<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> barn<00:00:19.439> which<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> good<00:00:20.340> length

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
down to the barn which is a good length

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.750 
down to the barn which is a good length
and<00:00:23.390> got<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> car<00:00:24.720> all<00:00:24.750> staged<00:00:25.320> ready<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.220> get

and got the car all staged ready to get

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.740 
and got the car all staged ready to get
pulled<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:28.699> step<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:29.939> today<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.630> get

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
pulled out and step one today is to get

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.720 
pulled out and step one today is to get
the<00:00:30.869> car<00:00:31.019> outside<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> got<00:00:32.700> going

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the car outside so see what I got going

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
the car outside so see what I got going
on<00:00:33.030> farmers<00:00:33.600> are<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.750> across<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> street

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
on farmers are out across the street

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.770 
on farmers are out across the street
today<00:00:34.890> they're<00:00:35.329> injecting<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.600> smells

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
today they're injecting so it smells

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.220 
today they're injecting so it smells
real<00:00:37.260> nice<00:00:37.469> today<00:00:38.059> but<00:00:39.059> that's<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.110> gonna

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
real nice today but that's not gonna

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
real nice today but that's not gonna
affect<00:00:40.320> us<00:00:40.649> tonight

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
affect us tonight

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.520 
affect us tonight
so<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> driveway<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:43.020> has<00:00:43.140> got<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
so the driveway here has got a little

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.910 
so the driveway here has got a little
bit<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> downward<00:00:44.399> slope<00:00:45.559> it's<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:46.710> too

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
bit of a downward slope it's not too

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.619 
bit of a downward slope it's not too
steep<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.700> car<00:00:47.879> will<00:00:48.030> pick<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> little

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
steep but the car will pick up a little

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.170 
steep but the car will pick up a little
bit<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.129> momentum<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.730> come<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
bit of momentum as they come on the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.700 
bit of momentum as they come on the
garage<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.570> got<00:00:51.719> no<00:00:51.840> brakes<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.350> already

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
garage I got no brakes that's already

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.459 
garage I got no brakes that's already
been<00:00:52.860> pulled

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
been pulled

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:03.540 
been pulled
Cessna<00:00:55.469> flying<00:00:55.829> already<00:00:57.050> good<00:00:58.050> Martin

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.210 

there's<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.090> little<00:01:04.810> small-town<00:01:05.620> airport<00:01:06.130> a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
there's a little small-town airport a

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.580 
there's a little small-town airport a
couple<00:01:06.390> miles<00:01:07.390> from<00:01:07.480> here<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:07.930> anyway<00:01:09.540> yeah<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
couple miles from here so anyway yeah so

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.350 
couple miles from here so anyway yeah so
once<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:12.070> could<00:01:12.310> once<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.730> comes<00:01:12.910> out<00:01:13.090> off<00:01:13.300> the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
once it could once it comes out off the

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.240 
once it could once it comes out off the
concrete<00:01:13.660> under<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.560> driveway<00:01:14.950> it's<00:01:15.070> going

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
concrete under the driveway it's going

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.790 
concrete under the driveway it's going
to<00:01:15.930> probably<00:01:16.930> not<00:01:17.230> pick<00:01:17.410> up<00:01:17.500> too<00:01:17.650> much

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
to probably not pick up too much

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.350 
to probably not pick up too much
momentum<00:01:18.190> but<00:01:18.400> what<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.640> front<00:01:18.820> wheels<00:01:19.060> come

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
momentum but what the front wheels come

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.210 
momentum but what the front wheels come
out<00:01:19.510> it'll<00:01:19.870> pick<00:01:20.110> up<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.290> little<00:01:20.380> momentum<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:21.190> I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
out it'll pick up a little momentum so I

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.270 
out it'll pick up a little momentum so I
got<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.460> little<00:01:22.320> stop<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.560> just<00:01:23.860> stop<00:01:24.010> a<00:01:24.040> half

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
got a little stop to just stop a half

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.440 
got a little stop to just stop a half
way<00:01:24.520> so<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.790> doesn't<00:01:24.820> pick<00:01:25.090> up<00:01:25.150> too<00:01:25.210> much

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
way so it doesn't pick up too much

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.840 
way so it doesn't pick up too much
momentum<00:01:25.660> and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:28.800> after<00:01:29.800> that<00:01:29.920> I'll<00:01:30.160> pull

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
momentum and then after that I'll pull

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.220 
momentum and then after that I'll pull
I'll<00:01:31.270> push<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.570> forward<00:01:31.810> little<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.050> pull

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
I'll push it forward little and pull

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.480 
I'll push it forward little and pull
that<00:01:32.410> one<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.770> then<00:01:32.860> come<00:01:33.130> down<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
that one and then come down to the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.700 
that one and then come down to the
second<00:01:33.850> stop<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.600> I'll<00:01:35.050> chalk<00:01:35.230> both<00:01:35.470> wheels

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
second stop and I'll chalk both wheels

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.500 
second stop and I'll chalk both wheels
and<00:01:35.979> I'm<00:01:36.070> gonna<00:01:36.490> get<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:36.760> up<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.000> jack<00:01:37.240> stands

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
and I'm gonna get it up on jack stands

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.320 
and I'm gonna get it up on jack stands
out<00:01:37.690> in<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.900> driveway<00:01:38.140> too<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.120> can<00:01:40.240> get

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
out in the driveway too so I can get

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.320 
out in the driveway too so I can get
that<00:01:40.420> underneath<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.200> little<00:01:41.320> bit<00:01:41.500> better<00:01:41.619> but

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
that underneath a little bit better but

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.900 
that underneath a little bit better but
hopefully<00:01:43.330> this<00:01:43.690> will<00:01:43.750> go<00:01:43.930> well<00:01:44.400> if<00:01:45.400> not<00:01:45.640> my

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
hopefully this will go well if not my

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.330 
hopefully this will go well if not my
car<00:01:46.150> will<00:01:46.270> be<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.350> ditch<00:01:47.560> over<00:01:47.740> there<00:01:47.890> so

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
car will be in that ditch over there so

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.900 
car will be in that ditch over there so
let's<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:50.170> if<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.290> can<00:01:50.410> find<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.680> good<00:01:50.880> spot<00:01:51.880> to

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
let's see if I can find a good spot to

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:31.930 
let's see if I can find a good spot to
put<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.240> camera

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.050 

that's<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:34.430> no<00:02:35.430> problem

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
that's that no problem

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.140 
that's that no problem
yeah<00:02:36.570> ah<00:02:37.190> that's<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.370> first<00:02:38.670> time<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
yeah ah that's the first time and the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.820 
yeah ah that's the first time and the
only<00:02:39.270> time<00:02:39.390> you'll<00:02:39.780> receive<00:02:39.990> my<00:02:40.260> car<00:02:40.560> up<00:02:40.680> off

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
only time you'll receive my car up off

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.670 
only time you'll receive my car up off
the<00:02:41.040> ground<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:42.830> nice<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:44.850> shaky<00:02:45.240> I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the ground like nice a little shaky I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.810 
the ground like nice a little shaky I
wouldn't<00:02:46.680> trust<00:02:46.830> getting<00:02:47.130> underneath<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.610> but

I<00:06:24.510> think<00:06:24.570> they<00:06:24.750> come<00:06:24.930> from<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.169> factory<00:06:25.440> with

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
I think they come from the factory with

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.100 
I think they come from the factory with
pitting<00:06:26.070> so<00:06:26.430> I'm<00:06:27.330> not<00:06:27.510> too<00:06:27.660> concerned<00:06:28.020> about

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
pitting so I'm not too concerned about

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.280 
pitting so I'm not too concerned about
that<00:06:28.440> I'll<00:06:28.650> just<00:06:29.120> give<00:06:30.120> a<00:06:30.150> nice<00:06:30.419> thick<00:06:30.990> coat<00:06:31.169> of

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
that I'll just give a nice thick coat of

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:38.390 
that I'll just give a nice thick coat of
paint<00:06:32.750> yeah<00:06:36.050> so<00:06:37.050> this<00:06:37.889> is<00:06:37.950> all<00:06:38.130> looking<00:06:38.310> good

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
paint yeah so this is all looking good

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.280 
paint yeah so this is all looking good
up<00:06:38.550> here<00:06:38.580> I<00:06:38.910> did<00:06:39.360> the<00:06:39.479> underneath<00:06:39.840> the<00:06:39.990> best<00:06:40.169> I

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
up here I did the underneath the best I

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.990 
up here I did the underneath the best I
could<00:06:40.350> laying<00:06:40.800> in<00:06:40.950> the<00:06:41.040> mud<00:06:41.190> but<00:06:41.490> you<00:06:41.910> know

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
could laying in the mud but you know

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.969 
could laying in the mud but you know
what<00:06:42.419> can<00:06:42.540> you<00:06:42.570> do<00:06:42.720> I<00:06:42.930> was<00:06:43.440> hoping<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:43.770> trunk

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 
what can you do I was hoping the trunk

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:45.830 
what can you do I was hoping the trunk
would<00:06:44.100> come<00:06:44.250> a<00:06:44.280> little<00:06:44.460> cleaner

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
would come a little cleaner

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.530 
would come a little cleaner
but<00:06:46.320> the<00:06:46.410> trunk<00:06:46.800> is<00:06:47.010> just<00:06:47.310> gross<00:06:47.760> I<00:06:48.150> mean
