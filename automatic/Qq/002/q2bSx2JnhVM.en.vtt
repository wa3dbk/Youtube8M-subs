00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello youtube beauty ball 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 for you today as what does the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 configuration of this increment is a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.119
 observer in 7 to 7 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.380
 Okay, what are you doing with the configuration of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.859
 correct measures would be a sukuk in the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.590
 a dream that the other side will pay 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.109
 this but to correctly hit the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.510
 encounter is that the tire does not fall 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.670
 dream at the entrance was already isolated and more 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 swim there in the lake there and make the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 The correct measure here is going 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.800
 You , you do there, okay? 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.370
 It's good here, my job closing the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.030
 painting 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.220
 like so I will thus closing O can 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.160
 linked to the favela have an open account 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.950
 so the flash here I have here 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.750
 My closes soon burn there and back there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.030
 open in the other 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.610
 then the work always running open a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.100
 closing or opening and closing the other is 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 I then I do not make a new 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.640
 piece arrives at the head of the bedside there and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:47.100
 already attracted 9 at the other date in the year or 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:48.690
 then a new mother and in the ds3 with this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.550
 the configuration of the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.070
 venture there as did previous or 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.900
 other grid there you take the measurements 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.020
 right up to the drawing here 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.090
 because there is no way you can only make mistakes 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.370
 sic what is written here the example of 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 drawing here on the grid there you have one 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.080
 people you put on the right for 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.360
 the left where your grid has more like 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.530
 watcher you leave the 0 here like her 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.530
 also in the previous film of 60 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.780
 there he has an average of 2 90 to watch 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.440
 to asia 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.150
 I already left it with 3 50 depending on 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.299
 width of your irregular equipment 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.450
 art you can leave with more or less 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.130
 the grill you always leave gets the grill 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.330
 previous video type was or was 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.790
 with 130 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.950
 I left her with 5 80 paper the line of 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.410
 I find a record with two days of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.940
 they used them unlike you 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.850
 You have to leave the most 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.670
 so if you have 2 92 80 you 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.790
 increases increases there increases by one 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.400
 peacock you will increase here until you hit 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.310
 Right there, hit the right rendezvous. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.820
 there it is the measure that you need is 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.880
 so here's it you that as 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.340
 It was the planet I 'm working on here. 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.430
 may be more I may be less but the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.050
 That's the secret, that 's the subsoil solution. 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:23.460
 It's more the grid is less the one here ok 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:27.090
 the width line here beauty show the 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:33.980
 you now not working here I 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.980
 I'm using itec using etec 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.580
 so I use leverage sudden Pope 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.780
 Passion only time you can be that 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.590
 I said now the use 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.630
 so I'm using etec 121 to 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.160
 come in two to leave 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.130
 So how do you get in here? 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.640
 He's going to lower the player to me and he's going to 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:06.390
 change your heart there, I am 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:10.020
 using 22 thousand in 2050 there are 2,500 and 2 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.480
 500 2.50 p.m. 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.210
 I'm not using two and without it going 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.570
 until later it's 2 200 there but it does not have 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.690
 this data is what I 'm using is that fat 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.390
 15 so if I increase the acceleration the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.430
 what happens I'll have more consumer 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.690
 diesel production is the same 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.520
 work and at least a little less 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.250
 I went back to the same final production of the day 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.410
 or less days spent Amazon gas 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:42.870
 say in our work here ok 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.690
 show you work the 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.870
 coach my way to go there're 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.630
 stopped there is a show with you guys at 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.700
 I start the video there and I do it 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:00.930
 I think it's a rule of all work 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:04.140
 pump that goes on the floor and right in 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.180
 method of selling in the middle you start 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.940
 again the working code 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.560
 ok then i'll only use itec 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:22.039
 autopilot 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:22.039
 he would already know the number 1 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.600
 passed on 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.710
 ae 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:49.759
 the squid 2 you will see that it raised 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.520
 even threatened the tractor for me there 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.580
 I saw you closing a painting that no longer holds 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.350
 Here I open here O 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.350
 It was you opened it here. 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:12.500
 the reading until the control again 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.349
 that way without opening maneuver and 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.669
 closing or opening and closing the ok 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:18.669
 a hug you there
