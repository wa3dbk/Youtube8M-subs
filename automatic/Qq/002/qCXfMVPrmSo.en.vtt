moonlight stones heart shaped stones

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.620 
moonlight stones heart shaped stones
pretty<00:02:25.260> much<00:02:25.410> are<00:02:25.590> being<00:02:26.010> gathered<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.270> do

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
pretty much are being gathered to do

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.030 
pretty much are being gathered to do
something<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.350> don't<00:02:28.560> know<00:02:28.680> necessarily

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
something now we don't know necessarily

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.940 
something now we don't know necessarily
what<00:02:29.610> they're<00:02:30.120> being<00:02:30.239> gathered<00:02:30.720> for<00:02:31.050> we<00:02:31.620> still

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
what they're being gathered for we still

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.100 
what they're being gathered for we still
don't<00:02:32.220> know<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:33.300> we<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.780> assume<00:02:34.050> that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
don't know that but we can assume that

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.900 
don't know that but we can assume that
it<00:02:34.350> gives<00:02:34.500> some<00:02:34.680> form<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.040> power<00:02:35.310> that's<00:02:35.730> what

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
it gives some form of power that's what

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.580 
it gives some form of power that's what
we<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.180> assume<00:02:36.480> from<00:02:36.780> these<00:02:36.959> stones<00:02:37.230> which<00:02:37.470> is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
we can assume from these stones which is

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.350 
we can assume from these stones which is
kind<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:37.800> obvious<00:02:37.980> already<00:02:38.550> but<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.150> can

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
kind of obvious already but we can

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.300 
kind of obvious already but we can
assume<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.810> gives<00:02:39.989> them<00:02:40.530> some<00:02:40.800> kind<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.130> power

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
assume it gives them some kind of power

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.759 
assume it gives them some kind of power
and<00:02:41.550> also<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.360> helps<00:02:42.540> out<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.080> best<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.620> we

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
and also it helps out the best like we

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.229 
and also it helps out the best like we
know<00:02:43.890> about<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> vest<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> rest<00:02:45.000> the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.759 
should really expect amazing

series for

series for
action<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.350> episode<00:04:22.770> most<00:04:23.040> likely<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.340> was

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
action this episode most likely it was

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.640 
action this episode most likely it was
going<00:04:23.640> to<00:04:23.730> be<00:04:23.850> very<00:04:24.120> very<00:04:24.270> dull<00:04:24.870> because<00:04:25.110> there

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
going to be very very dull because there

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.150 
going to be very very dull because there
was<00:04:25.740> barely<00:04:25.890> any<00:04:26.430> plot<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.800> know<00:04:28.920> there

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
was barely any plot and you know there

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.190 
was barely any plot and you know there
was<00:04:29.220> non-existent<00:04:29.820> action<00:04:30.600> so<00:04:30.750> anything<00:04:31.170> that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
was non-existent action so anything that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.720 
was non-existent action so anything that
you<00:04:31.380> like<00:04:31.560> from<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.770> first<00:04:32.040> two<00:04:32.190> episodes<00:04:32.340> if

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
you like from the first two episodes if

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.220 
you like from the first two episodes if
you<00:04:32.790> didn't<00:04:32.940> care<00:04:33.090> for<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.360> plot<00:04:33.600> pretty<00:04:34.110> much

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
you didn't care for the plot pretty much

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.900 
you didn't care for the plot pretty much
that<00:04:34.410> was<00:04:34.530> absent<00:04:35.100> in<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.400> episode<00:04:35.700> which

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
that was absent in this episode which

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.940 
that was absent in this episode which
would<00:04:36.090> cause<00:04:36.240> probably<00:04:36.900> majority<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.590> the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
would cause probably majority of the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.950 
would cause probably majority of the
episode<00:04:38.520> 1<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:38.790> 2<00:04:38.880> fans<00:04:39.180> do<00:04:39.450> not<00:04:39.600> really<00:04:39.780> like

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
episode 1 and 2 fans do not really like

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.770 
episode 1 and 2 fans do not really like
this<00:04:40.110> episode<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.370> they<00:04:42.210> need<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.600> do

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
this episode and so they need to do

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.690 
this episode and so they need to do
something<00:04:43.230> about<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.040> that's<00:04:44.460> this

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
something about that so that's this

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.520 
something about that so that's this
episode<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.390> The<00:04:45.690> Rolling<00:04:45.810> girls<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.290> mean<00:04:46.410> it's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
episode of The Rolling girls I mean it's

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.680 
episode of The Rolling girls I mean it's
a<00:04:46.590> good<00:04:46.710> episode<00:04:46.830> it's<00:04:47.670> enjoyable<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.300> had<00:04:48.450> fun

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
a good episode it's enjoyable I had fun

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.110 
a good episode it's enjoyable I had fun
watching<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.320> art<00:04:49.530> style<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:49.980> just<00:04:50.370> enough

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
watching it the art style is just enough

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.550 
watching it the art style is just enough
for<00:04:51.270> me<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.600> actually<00:04:51.750> take<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.230> initiative

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
for me to actually take the initiative

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.110 
for me to actually take the initiative
to<00:04:52.800> watch<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.370> series<00:04:53.550> because<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:53.940> art
