so<00:00:11.410> what'd<00:00:11.559> you<00:00:11.590> think<00:00:11.740> of<00:00:11.860> the<00:00:11.950> car

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
so what'd you think of the car

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.490 
so what'd you think of the car
I<00:00:12.430> think<00:00:12.969> initial<00:00:13.809> reaction<00:00:14.200> is<00:00:14.289> I'm<00:00:14.469> very

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
I think initial reaction is I'm very

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500 
I think initial reaction is I'm very
very<00:00:14.889> impressed<00:00:15.039> by<00:00:15.459> it<00:00:15.490> I<00:00:15.730> think<00:00:15.820> great

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
very impressed by it I think great

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.570 
very impressed by it I think great
this<00:00:17.080> is<00:00:17.230> very<00:00:17.410> bold<00:00:17.619> statement<00:00:17.860> and<00:00:18.250> forward

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
this is very bold statement and forward

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.359 
this is very bold statement and forward
very<00:00:19.539> dramatic<00:00:20.110> got<00:00:20.470> a<00:00:20.500> nice<00:00:20.680> shape<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.010> it<00:00:21.340> a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
very dramatic got a nice shape to it a

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.790 
very dramatic got a nice shape to it a
nice<00:00:21.550> nice<00:00:22.060> appear<00:00:22.599> and<00:00:22.810> external<00:00:23.349> appearance

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
nice nice appear and external appearance

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.519 
nice nice appear and external appearance
it's<00:00:24.779> interesting<00:00:25.779> that<00:00:26.109> you<00:00:26.320> know<00:00:26.410> the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
it's interesting that you know the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.890 
it's interesting that you know the
Front's<00:00:27.039> not<00:00:27.220> to<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.150> square<00:00:28.419> on<00:00:28.599> slap

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
Front's not to to the square on slap

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.939 
Front's not to to the square on slap
side<00:00:29.140> there's<00:00:29.349> quite<00:00:29.470> a<00:00:29.499> bit<00:00:29.619> of<00:00:29.710> curvature

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
side there's quite a bit of curvature

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.490 
side there's quite a bit of curvature
they're<00:00:30.279> quite<00:00:30.759> sculpted<00:00:31.330> I<00:00:31.539> think<00:00:32.200> at<00:00:32.380> the

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
they're quite sculpted I think at the

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.440 
they're quite sculpted I think at the
front<00:00:32.710> of<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:32.950> car<00:00:33.130> I<00:00:33.160> think<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.610> grille<00:00:34.180> is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
front of the car I think the grille is

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.770 
front of the car I think the grille is
very<00:00:35.350> very<00:00:35.620> bold<00:00:35.860> we<00:00:36.430> basically<00:00:37.120> playing<00:00:37.420> up<00:00:37.660> a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
very very bold we basically playing up a

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.779 
very very bold we basically playing up a
little<00:00:37.960> bit<00:00:38.110> more<00:00:38.289> the<00:00:38.559> lower<00:00:38.739> in<00:00:39.520> better

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
little bit more the lower in better

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.119 
little bit more the lower in better
trapezoid<00:00:40.420> and<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:41.350> fact<00:00:41.559> that<00:00:41.680> we<00:00:41.829> have<00:00:41.949> an<00:00:42.039> A

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
trapezoid and the fact that we have an A

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.849 
trapezoid and the fact that we have an A
grade<00:00:42.160> on<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.360> upper<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:43.809> lower<00:00:43.870> also<00:00:44.590> gives

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
grade on the upper and lower also gives

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.770 
grade on the upper and lower also gives
a<00:00:45.010> certain<00:00:46.890> elegant<00:00:47.890> abut<00:00:48.309> sporty<00:00:49.300> look<00:00:49.480> to<00:00:49.660> it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
a certain elegant abut sporty look to it

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.689 
a certain elegant abut sporty look to it
it<00:00:50.379> seems<00:00:50.649> that<00:00:50.859> you<00:00:51.190> know<00:00:51.280> things<00:00:51.489> like<00:00:51.640> the

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
it seems that you know things like the

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.700 
it seems that you know things like the
lights<00:00:51.910> are<00:00:52.030> quite<00:00:52.239> highly<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.899> designs<00:00:53.289> bit

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
lights are quite highly to designs bit

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.110 
lights are quite highly to designs bit
of<00:00:53.800> intricate<00:00:54.280> detail<00:00:54.699> there

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
of intricate detail there

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.419 
of intricate detail there
I<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.289> interior<00:00:56.829> is<00:00:56.980> one<00:00:57.129> of<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.280> most

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
I think the interior is one of the most

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.430 
I think the interior is one of the most
striking<00:00:57.699> elements<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.870> car<00:00:59.050> as<00:00:59.230> well

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
striking elements of the car as well

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.979 
striking elements of the car as well
yeah<00:00:59.920> I<00:00:59.949> think<00:01:00.070> we<00:01:00.429> wanted<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.780> make<00:01:01.960> sure

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
yeah I think we wanted to to make sure

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.869 
yeah I think we wanted to to make sure
that<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.500> kinetic<00:01:02.739> design<00:01:02.980> went<00:01:03.429> into<00:01:03.760> the

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
that the kinetic design went into the

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.240 
that the kinetic design went into the
interior<00:01:04.239> as<00:01:04.360> well<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:04.870> the<00:01:05.199> fluidity<00:01:05.620> of<00:01:05.920> the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
interior as well and the fluidity of the

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.710 
interior as well and the fluidity of the
cut<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.610> center<00:01:06.820> console<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.450> know<00:01:07.570> that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
cut the center console you know that

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.590 
cut the center console you know that
very<00:01:07.930> nice<00:01:08.590> flow<00:01:08.950> school<00:01:09.310> from<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.270> center

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
very nice flow school from the center

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600 
very nice flow school from the center
sparkling<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.380> console<00:01:11.830> area<00:01:12.010> it's<00:01:12.310> quite

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
sparkling to the console area it's quite

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.090 
sparkling to the console area it's quite
nicely<00:01:12.910> done<00:01:13.330> lot<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:13.990> more<00:01:14.200> space<00:01:14.530> than<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:14.950> was

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
nicely done lot of more space than I was

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.690 
nicely done lot of more space than I was
expecting

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
expecting

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.520 
expecting
certainly<00:01:16.420> amongst<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.990> compared<00:01:17.470> with

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
certainly amongst is compared with

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.890 
certainly amongst is compared with
competitors<00:01:18.160> I<00:01:18.520> think<00:01:19.030> this<00:01:19.150> is<00:01:19.300> very<00:01:19.630> clever

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
competitors I think this is very clever

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.870 
competitors I think this is very clever
use<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.350> space<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.490> sculptured

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
use of the space and the sculptured

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.460 
use of the space and the sculptured
seats<00:01:22.120> and<00:01:22.330> so<00:01:22.450> on<00:01:22.570> seem<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.840> maximize<00:01:23.260> the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
seats and so on seem to maximize the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.660 
seats and so on seem to maximize the
space<00:01:23.560> they've<00:01:23.890> got<00:01:24.040> then<00:01:24.280> there's<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> lot<00:01:24.580> of

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
space they've got then there's a lot of

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.810 
space they've got then there's a lot of
space<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.090> -<00:01:25.860> showroom<00:01:26.860> appeal<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.460> terms

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
space in the - showroom appeal in terms

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.400 
space in the - showroom appeal in terms
of<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.210> will<00:01:28.300> be<00:01:28.390> in<00:01:28.420> modern<00:01:28.870> and<00:01:29.080> everything

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
of it will be in modern and everything

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.080 
of it will be in modern and everything
and<00:01:29.560> I'd<00:01:29.680> give<00:01:30.160> it<00:01:30.250> 10<00:01:30.430> out<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.550> 10

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
and I'd give it 10 out of 10

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.460 
and I'd give it 10 out of 10
well<00:01:31.300> I'd<00:01:31.390> set<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.750> throat<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.110> percent

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
well I'd set the throat to the percent

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.010 
well I'd set the throat to the percent
because<00:01:32.710> that's<00:01:32.860> only<00:01:33.130> afford<00:01:33.610> or<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:34.030> think<00:01:34.930> it

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
because that's only afford or I think it

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.140 
because that's only afford or I think it
looks<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.230> lot<00:01:35.350> nicer<00:01:35.500> than<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.860> Vectra<00:01:36.190> it's

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
looks a lot nicer than the Vectra it's

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.420 
looks a lot nicer than the Vectra it's
miles<00:01:37.720> ahead<00:01:37.900> certainly<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.620> terms<00:01:38.650> of<00:01:39.040> you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
miles ahead certainly in terms of you

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.150 
miles ahead certainly in terms of you
know<00:01:39.460> designer<00:01:39.880> looks<00:01:40.240> quality<00:01:41.160> hopefully

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
know designer looks quality hopefully

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.010 
know designer looks quality hopefully
will<00:01:42.340> be<00:01:42.520> poured<00:01:43.030> back<00:01:43.210> from<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.600> dorrance

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
will be poured back from the dorrance

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.160 
will be poured back from the dorrance
hopefully

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
hopefully

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.039 
hopefully
but<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> major<00:01:47.700> improvement<00:01:48.179> so<00:01:48.840> overall

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
but it is a major improvement so overall

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.980 
but it is a major improvement so overall
I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:50.100> car<00:01:50.340> comes<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.359> quite<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
I think the car comes up to be quite a
