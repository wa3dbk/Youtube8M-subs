00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
literally a week from today and we might

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.709 
literally a week from today and we might
get<00:03:07.469> more<00:03:07.650> information<00:03:08.189> before<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.269> if

get more information before then so if

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.059

you<00:03:09.989> want<00:03:10.139> to<00:03:10.169> consistent<00:03:10.560> past<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.919> would<00:03:11.040> say

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
you want to consistent past I would say

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.580 
you want to consistent past I would say
go<00:03:11.340> for<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.609> but<00:03:12.419> if<00:03:12.719> you're<00:03:13.260> kind<00:03:13.439> of

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
go for it but if you're kind of

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.280 
go for it but if you're kind of
skeptical<00:03:13.919> like<00:03:14.159> I<00:03:14.370> am<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.790> would<00:03:15.209> hold<00:03:16.019> on<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
skeptical like I am I would hold on a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.349 
skeptical like I am I would hold on a
little<00:03:16.560> bit<00:03:16.799> wait<00:03:17.340> until<00:03:17.669> maybe<00:03:17.909> some<00:03:18.239> news

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
little bit wait until maybe some news

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.069 
little bit wait until maybe some news
comes<00:03:18.599> out<00:03:18.720> for<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.109> second<00:03:19.409> pack<00:03:20.750> if<00:03:21.750> nothing

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
comes out for the second pack if nothing

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.539 
comes out for the second pack if nothing
comes<00:03:22.169> out<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.590> then<00:03:22.739> they<00:03:22.889> just<00:03:23.069> release<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
comes out and then they just release the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.949 
comes out and then they just release the
pack<00:03:23.760> but<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.150> know<00:03:24.269> whatever

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
pack but you know whatever

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.780 
pack but you know whatever
then<00:03:25.620> whatever<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.519> guess<00:03:28.010> but<00:03:29.010> yeah<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:29.489> a

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
then whatever I guess but yeah it's a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.729 
then whatever I guess but yeah it's a
little<00:03:29.939> like<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.989> don't<00:03:31.109> know<00:03:31.260> how<00:03:31.349> to<00:03:31.409> describe

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
little like I don't know how to describe

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.409 
little like I don't know how to describe
it<00:03:31.889> like<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.220> want<00:03:32.669> to<00:03:32.760> get<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.000> season<00:03:33.269> pass

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
it like I want to get the season pass

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.939 
it like I want to get the season pass
but<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:33.989> again<00:03:34.109> I'm<00:03:34.439> kind<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.799> like

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
but then again I'm kind of like

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:35.839 
but then again I'm kind of like
skeptical<00:03:35.400> because<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.579> don't<00:03:35.699> know<00:03:35.760> what

happens if it is the community is going

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.640 
happens if it is the community is going
to<00:07:20.140> enrage<00:07:21.040> but<00:07:22.170> let's<00:07:23.170> hope<00:07:23.290> it<00:07:23.380> doesn't<00:07:23.500> come

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
to enrage but let's hope it doesn't come

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.030 
to enrage but let's hope it doesn't come
to<00:07:23.710> that

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
to that
