be<00:01:20.970> talking<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.210> today<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
be talking about today is the one that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.350 
be talking about today is the one that
keeps<00:01:22.650> tension<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> chains<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
keeps tension on the chains for the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
keeps tension on the chains for the
exhaust<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> intake<00:01:25.830> cam<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.670> how<00:01:27.030> do

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
exhaust and the intake cam so how do

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
exhaust and the intake cam so how do
these<00:01:27.240> work<00:01:27.570> well<00:01:27.780> basically<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.890> tensioner

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
these work well basically the tensioner

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.789 
these work well basically the tensioner
pushes<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> guide<00:01:30.570> rail<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.350> guide<00:01:31.590> rail

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
pushes on a guide rail that guide rail

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.399 
pushes on a guide rail that guide rail
pushes<00:01:32.280> tension<00:01:32.729> onto<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.299> chain<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.869> keeps

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
pushes tension onto the chain and keeps

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.690 
pushes tension onto the chain and keeps
the<00:01:34.560> chain<00:01:34.770> nice<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> tight

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the chain nice and tight

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
the chain nice and tight
they're<00:01:35.909> both<00:01:36.060> spring<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.750> hydraulic

controls as well as safety latches to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.280 
controls as well as safety latches to
make<00:01:39.210> sure<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> tensioner<00:01:39.990> doesn't

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
make sure that the tensioner doesn't

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
make sure that the tensioner doesn't

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
squeeze all the way in again keeping

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
squeeze all the way in again keeping
consistent<00:01:43.049> tension<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.100> chain<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
consistent tension on the chain that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.830 
consistent tension on the chain that
goes<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> crankshaft<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
goes from the crankshaft to the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
goes from the crankshaft to the
camshafts<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.189> fail<00:01:47.490> well<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> guess

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
camshafts how do they fail well I guess

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.609 
camshafts how do they fail well I guess
it<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.390> depends<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:48.960> which<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> four

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it really depends on which of the four

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.350 
it really depends on which of the four
generations<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.759> installed<00:01:51.180> in

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
generations that you have installed in

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.090 
generations that you have installed in
the<00:01:51.450> vehicle<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:52.049> particular<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.770> which<00:01:52.950> is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the vehicle this particular one which is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.340 
the vehicle this particular one which is
the<00:01:53.220> N<00:01:53.369> suffix<00:01:54.149> generally<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> ring

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the N suffix generally we see the ring

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260 
the N suffix generally we see the ring
come<00:01:55.590> off<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:56.189> allows<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:57.060> latch

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
come off which allows this little latch

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
come off which allows this little latch
to<00:01:57.570> pop<00:01:57.780> off<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.290> basically<00:01:58.710> causes<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to pop off and basically causes the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
to pop off and basically causes the
tensioner<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.759> collapse<00:02:00.240> basically<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.259> can

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
tensioner to collapse basically it can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.170 
tensioner to collapse basically it can
be<00:02:01.469> any<00:02:01.680> failure<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.490> latch<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.700> keeps

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
be any failure of the latch that keeps

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.450 
be any failure of the latch that keeps
the<00:02:03.329> tensioner<00:02:03.719> from<00:02:03.930> collapsing<00:02:04.469> back<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.950> we

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the tensioner from collapsing back in we

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.920 
the tensioner from collapsing back in we
also<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.939> consider<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.390> oil<00:02:06.630> pressure

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
also have to consider that oil pressure

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
also have to consider that oil pressure
may<00:02:07.170> actually<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> contributing<00:02:08.190> factor<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
may actually be a contributing factor to

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.520 
may actually be a contributing factor to
this<00:02:09.060> failure<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.229> some<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
this failure so what are some of the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.170 
this failure so what are some of the
symptoms<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.129> timing<00:02:11.370> chain<00:02:11.520> tensioner

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
symptoms of a timing chain tensioner

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.760 
symptoms of a timing chain tensioner
well<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.959> most<00:02:13.140> common<00:02:13.530> one

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
well the most common one

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.920 
well the most common one
is<00:02:13.860> basically<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.370> dead<00:02:14.700> engine<00:02:15.090> either<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.660> no

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
is basically a dead engine either a no

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.740 
is basically a dead engine either a no
start<00:02:16.260> or<00:02:16.530> car<00:02:17.520> died<00:02:17.730> while<00:02:17.970> driving<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.570> then

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
start or car died while driving and then

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.450 
start or car died while driving and then
won't<00:02:18.960> start<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.590> that's<00:02:19.830> almost<00:02:20.160> always

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
won't start and that's almost always

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.880 
won't start and that's almost always
accompanied<00:02:21.060> by<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.270> really<00:02:21.780> fast<00:02:22.170> crank<00:02:22.680> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
accompanied by a really fast crank and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.800 
accompanied by a really fast crank and
that<00:02:23.310> really<00:02:23.490> fast<00:02:23.760> crank<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.270> actually<00:02:24.720> an

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
that really fast crank is actually an

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.840 
that really fast crank is actually an
indication<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.530> no<00:02:25.920> compression<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.820> your

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
indication of no compression in your

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.600 
indication of no compression in your
engine<00:02:27.570> we<00:02:28.080> might<00:02:28.290> also<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.130> check<00:02:29.430> engine

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
engine we might also get a check engine

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.310 
engine we might also get a check engine
light<00:02:29.850> for<00:02:30.240> something<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> camshaft

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
light for something like a camshaft

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.910 
light for something like a camshaft

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
advance timing overly retarded we might

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.810 
advance timing overly retarded we might
also<00:02:37.350> hear<00:02:37.650> our<00:02:37.800> battle<00:02:38.100> from<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> passenger

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
also hear our battle from the passenger

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.880 
also hear our battle from the passenger
side<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.300> engine<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> most<00:02:40.410> common

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
side of the engine but the most common

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.860 
side of the engine but the most common
failure<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.430> definitely<00:02:41.910> either<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.630> car

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
failure is definitely either the car

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.500 
failure is definitely either the car
died<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.530> won't<00:02:43.950> restart<00:02:44.430> or<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:45.270> plain

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
died and won't restart or just plain

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.750 
died and won't restart or just plain
won't<00:02:45.750> start<00:02:46.230> again<00:02:46.950> accompanied<00:02:47.610> by<00:02:47.640> a

won't start again accompanied by a
really<00:02:48.180> fast<00:02:48.450> crank<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.170> how<00:02:49.290> do<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:49.410> diagnose

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
really fast crank so how do we diagnose

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.930 
really fast crank so how do we diagnose
the<00:02:50.040> failure<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.580> timing<00:02:50.910> chain

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940

the failure of the timing chain
tensioner<00:02:51.630> well<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.350> really<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.770> depends<00:02:53.130> on

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
tensioner well it really all depends on

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.160 
tensioner well it really all depends on
what<00:02:53.460> we're<00:02:53.610> experiencing<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.960> have<00:02:55.140> a

have<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> second<00:03:17.730> person<00:03:17.850> crank<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.450> car<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
have a second person crank the car and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.780 
have a second person crank the car and
we'll<00:03:19.230> look<00:03:19.350> down<00:03:19.620> at<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.890> camshafts<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.640> see

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
we'll look down at the camshafts to see

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.760 
we'll look down at the camshafts to see
if<00:03:20.910> they're<00:03:21.030> even<00:03:21.180> turning<00:03:21.780> most<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> time

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
if they're even turning most of the time

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.020 
if they're even turning most of the time
when<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.100> just<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.400> failure<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
when it's just a failure of the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.030 
when it's just a failure of the
tensioner<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> engine<00:03:25.530> components

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
tensioner all of the engine components

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.830 
tensioner all of the engine components
will<00:03:26.130> still<00:03:26.400> turn<00:03:26.670> they're<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.209> all<00:03:27.360> turning

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
will still turn they're just all turning

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.930 
will still turn they're just all turning
at<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.080> wrong<00:03:28.260> time<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.920> we<00:03:29.459> probably<00:03:29.730> have

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
at the wrong time and we probably have

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.090 
at the wrong time and we probably have
catastrophic<00:03:30.450> engine<00:03:31.170> failure<00:03:31.200> which<00:03:31.860> means

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
catastrophic engine failure which means

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.370 
catastrophic engine failure which means
we<00:03:32.340> may<00:03:32.580> have<00:03:32.790> been<00:03:33.120> twelves<00:03:33.720> as<00:03:34.020> far<00:03:34.290> as

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
we may have been twelves as far as

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.960 
we may have been twelves as far as
normal<00:03:34.770> time<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.130> failure<00:03:35.490> it<00:03:35.580> really<00:03:35.850> all

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
normal time of failure it really all

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.900 
normal time of failure it really all

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
miles is about the lowest that I've seen

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.960

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
so is this a DIY job or not well it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.870 
so is this a DIY job or not well it
actually<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.810> be<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:49.050> DIY<00:03:49.350> if<00:03:49.950> you're<00:03:50.430> doing<00:03:50.640> it

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
actually can be a DIY if you're doing it

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.510 
actually can be a DIY if you're doing it
as<00:03:51.000> part<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.450> maintenance<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.709> once<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.340> bad

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
as part of maintenance but once this bad

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.370 
as part of maintenance but once this bad
boys<00:03:53.730> failed<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.420> probably<00:03:54.900> better<00:03:55.050> left<00:03:55.290> to

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
boys failed it's probably better left to

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.050 
boys failed it's probably better left to
professionals<00:03:56.010> because<00:03:56.070> it's<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.430> really<00:03:56.880> big

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
I know that from experience we had a guy

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.390 
I know that from experience we had a guy
do<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.540> in<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.750> shop<00:04:36.990> years<00:04:37.290> ago<00:04:37.650> when<00:04:38.280> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
do that in the shop years ago when the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.700 
do that in the shop years ago when the
CCT<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:38.970> first<00:04:39.360> came<00:04:39.570> out<00:04:39.690> didn't<00:04:40.350> follow<00:04:40.500> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
CCT a first came out didn't follow the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.410 
CCT a first came out didn't follow the
instructions<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.370> we<00:04:41.640> wound<00:04:41.850> up<00:04:41.940> timing<00:04:42.300> that

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
instructions and we wound up timing that

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.090 
instructions and we wound up timing that
engine<00:04:42.720> about<00:04:42.930> seven<00:04:43.290> times<00:04:43.530> before<00:04:43.800> we

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
engine about seven times before we

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.950 
engine about seven times before we
finally<00:04:44.490> got<00:04:44.640> it<00:04:44.820> right<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.420> this<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.720> one<00:04:45.870> of

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
finally got it right so this is one of

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.330 
finally got it right so this is one of
those<00:04:46.050> parts<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:46.680> probably<00:04:46.950> worth

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
those parts that it's probably worth

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.580 
those parts that it's probably worth
