00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
need to be nerfed the fast mag is

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.110 
need to be nerfed the fast mag is
something<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> almost<00:00:50.129> needed<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.640> gun<00:00:50.879> it

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
something you almost needed this gun it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.150 
something you almost needed this gun it
has<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> pretty<00:00:52.020> slow<00:00:52.320> reload<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.739> mean<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.039> can

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
has a pretty slow reload I mean you can

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.290 
has a pretty slow reload I mean you can
kind<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> deal<00:00:53.610> without<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
kind of deal without it but it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
kind of deal without it but it
definitely<00:00:54.420> reloads<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.230> little<00:00:55.770> slower<00:00:56.039> than

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
definitely reloads a little slower than

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.750 
definitely reloads a little slower than
what<00:00:56.460> I'd<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.859> fast<00:00:58.859> mag<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.460> very

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
what I'd like so fast mag is just very

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.630 
what I'd like so fast mag is just very
very<00:01:00.090> useful<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.770> grip<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.160> sure<00:01:02.370> why

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
very useful and grip I'm not sure why

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.219 
very useful and grip I'm not sure why
they<00:01:02.820> made<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.239> gun<00:01:03.449> work<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
they made this gun work like this in

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.899 
they made this gun work like this in
this<00:01:04.350> game<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.890> has<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> decent<00:01:05.519> amount<00:01:05.729> of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this game but it has a decent amount of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.399 
this game but it has a decent amount of
recoil<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> whole<00:01:06.689> lot<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.110> enough<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
recoil not a whole lot but enough to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
recoil not a whole lot but enough to
fuck<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.159> you're<00:01:08.430> gonna<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> put

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
grip on there some optional things you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
grip on there some optional things you
could<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.080> added<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> laser<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.490> added

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
could have added on or a laser for added

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
could have added on or a laser for added
hipfire<00:01:15.060> accuracy<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.689> you're<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.140> kind<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
hipfire accuracy if you're that kind of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.620 
hipfire accuracy if you're that kind of
a<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:17.130> kind<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.430> play<00:01:17.880> style<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> have

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
a that kind of play style if you have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.050 
a that kind of play style if you have
that<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> hit<00:01:19.229> fire<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> lot<00:01:19.680> or<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
that you like to hit fire a lot or a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.460 
that you like to hit fire a lot or a
reflex<00:01:21.060> item<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> don't<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:21.900> mind<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
reflex item that I don't really mind the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.780 
reflex item that I don't really mind the
sights<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.100> use<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.700> they

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
sights I can use them but they

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.060 
sights I can use them but they
definitely<00:01:23.880> could<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.540> bit<00:01:24.720> better

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
definitely could be a little bit better

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.710 
definitely could be a little bit better
so<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:27.000> gun<00:01:27.210> has<00:01:27.509> such<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> high<00:01:28.470> rate<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> fire

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
so this gun has such a high rate of fire

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.539 
so this gun has such a high rate of fire
honestly<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.840> don't<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.860> putting<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> laser

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
honestly I don't I think putting a laser

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.580 
honestly I don't I think putting a laser
on<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> messes<00:01:33.180> me<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.329> more<00:01:33.659> because<00:01:34.320> it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
on it messes me up more because it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
on it messes me up more because it's
almost<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:35.000> you're<00:01:36.000> being<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.450> accurate<00:01:36.930> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
almost like you're being so accurate you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
almost like you're being so accurate you
can<00:01:37.320> shoot<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:37.979> left<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.369> someone

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
can shoot kind of to the left of someone

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.440 
can shoot kind of to the left of someone
and<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.329> shooting

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and you're going to be shooting

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850 
and you're going to be shooting
definitely<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.079> left<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> someone<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
definitely to the left of someone and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.170 
definitely to the left of someone and
none<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.250> bolts<00:01:41.430> actually<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.060> hit

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
none of your bolts actually go and hit

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.960 
none of your bolts actually go and hit
them<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.540> hipfire<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:44.520> allows<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.939> to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
them if your hipfire it allows you to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819 
them if your hipfire it allows you to
actually<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.960> doesn't<00:01:46.110> allow<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.619> spray

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
actually it doesn't allow you to spray

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.810 
actually it doesn't allow you to spray
and<00:01:46.950> pair<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> laser<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> that's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
and pair it with the laser on it that's

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.969 
and pair it with the laser on it that's
why<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.000> didn't<00:01:48.240> put<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.740> rate<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
why I didn't put it on it the rate of

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.260 
why I didn't put it on it the rate of
fire<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.310> high<00:01:50.460> enough<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.090> where<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
fire is high enough as is to where you

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.319 
fire is high enough as is to where you
can<00:01:51.390> hit<00:01:51.479> fire<00:01:51.720> without<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.170> being<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> problem

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
can hit fire without it being a problem

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.760 
can hit fire without it being a problem
now<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.570> said<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.229> gun<00:01:55.439> does<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
now like I said this gun does have a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.980 
now like I said this gun does have a
decent<00:01:55.950> mount<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.310> recoil<00:01:56.579> why<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.119> why<00:01:57.780> they

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
decent mount of recoil why they why they

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.380 
decent mount of recoil why they why they
did<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.320> I'm<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.740> entirely<00:01:59.009> sure<00:01:59.219> fun<00:02:00.180> fact

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
did this I'm not entirely sure fun fact

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.700 
did this I'm not entirely sure fun fact
of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> day<00:02:00.600> I've<00:02:00.810> gotten<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> chance<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.500> shoot

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
of the day I've gotten a chance to shoot

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
of the day I've gotten a chance to shoot
it<00:02:01.860> real<00:02:02.009> crisp<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> those<00:02:02.729> things<00:02:02.969> hardly

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it real crisp and those things hardly

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.480 
it real crisp and those things hardly
kick<00:02:03.509> at<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.860> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:04.979> pretty<00:02:05.130> much<00:02:05.219> put

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
kick at all you can pretty much put

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.100 
kick at all you can pretty much put
every<00:02:05.939> single<00:02:06.060> round<00:02:06.390> right<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.840> target

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
every single round right on the target

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.600 
every single round right on the target
if<00:02:07.200> you're<00:02:07.320> holding<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:08.129> long<00:02:08.310> burst

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
if you're holding just one long burst

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.249 
if you're holding just one long burst
even<00:02:09.060> though<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.360> rate<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.599> fire<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.080> high

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
even though the rate of fire is so high

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.020 
even though the rate of fire is so high
just<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.979> way<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.250> gun<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.520> made<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.879> doesn't

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
just the way the gun is made it doesn't

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.699 
just the way the gun is made it doesn't
have<00:02:12.239> any

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
have any

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.649 
have any
well<00:02:12.829> now<00:02:13.609> like<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:13.939> said<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> got<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.299> chance<00:02:14.510> to

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
well now like I said I got a chance to

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.839 
well now like I said I got a chance to
shoot<00:02:14.810> one<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.890> was<00:02:15.980> obviously<00:02:16.280> not<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.609> own<00:02:16.730> as

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
shoot one it was obviously not my own as

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.630 
shoot one it was obviously not my own as
out<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.030> class<00:02:17.239> your<00:02:17.510> weapon<00:02:17.750> shoot<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.640> there

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
out of class your weapon shoot and there

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.280 
out of class your weapon shoot and there
are<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.730> lot<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.939> fun<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.120> shoot<00:02:20.269> I'll<00:02:20.900> say<00:02:21.109> that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
are a lot of fun to shoot I'll say that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.759 
are a lot of fun to shoot I'll say that
much<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.939> really<00:02:23.659> like<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.930> Chris<00:02:24.140> it's<00:02:24.469> a

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
much so I really like the Chris it's a

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.420 
much so I really like the Chris it's a
gun<00:02:24.950> I've<00:02:25.159> always<00:02:25.609> really<00:02:25.879> liked<00:02:26.180> but<00:02:27.430> yeah

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
gun I've always really liked but yeah

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.280 
gun I've always really liked but yeah
it's<00:02:29.000> usable<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:29.659> definitely<00:02:30.019> not<00:02:30.109> one<00:02:30.260> of

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
it's usable it's definitely not one of

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.449 
it's usable it's definitely not one of
the<00:02:30.409> best<00:02:30.560> guns<00:02:30.799> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.040> game<00:02:31.069> but<00:02:31.310> it's

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
the best guns in the game but it's

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.860 
the best guns in the game but it's
definitely<00:02:31.760> usable<00:02:32.060> let's<00:02:32.420> say<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.689> much

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
definitely usable let's say that much

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.690 
definitely usable let's say that much
but<00:02:33.319> other<00:02:33.560> SMGs<00:02:34.099> are<00:02:34.189> definitely<00:02:34.519> going<00:02:34.639> to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
but other SMGs are definitely going to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.929 
but other SMGs are definitely going to
be<00:02:34.790> better<00:02:35.030> say<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.439> Scorpion<00:02:36.439> Evo<00:02:36.829> 3<00:02:37.159> or<00:02:37.400> the

be better say the Scorpion Evo 3 or the

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.879 
be better say the Scorpion Evo 3 or the
the<00:02:38.389> 3<00:02:38.599> round<00:02:38.750> burst<00:02:38.780> weapon<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.379> shakaal<00:02:39.709> I

instead<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.669> toys<00:03:08.349> God<00:03:09.349> did<00:03:09.500> he<00:03:09.530> doesn't<00:03:10.010> know

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
instead of toys God did he doesn't know

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.449 
instead of toys God did he doesn't know
how<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.370> not<00:03:10.700> do<00:03:10.909> that

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
how to not do that

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.970 
how to not do that
so<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:14.359> SMG<00:03:14.810> there's<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.409> lot<00:03:15.560> of<00:03:15.650> maps<00:03:15.799> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
so this SMG there's a lot of maps you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.800 
so this SMG there's a lot of maps you
can<00:03:16.129> use<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.400> on<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:17.269> definitely<00:03:17.510> one<00:03:17.780> of

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
can use it on this is definitely one of

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.180 
can use it on this is definitely one of
the<00:03:17.959> best<00:03:18.109> maps<00:03:18.349> and<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.530> found<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.799> best<00:03:18.979> way

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
the best maps and I found the best way

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.439 
the best maps and I found the best way
to<00:03:19.220> do<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.579> is<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.940> kind<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.150> do<00:03:20.239> what<00:03:20.269> I'm

doing<00:03:20.479> and<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.019> don't<00:03:21.079> know<00:03:21.199> how<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.290> didn't<00:03:21.590> get

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
doing and I don't know how I didn't get

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.319 
doing and I don't know how I didn't get
that<00:03:21.829> kills<00:03:22.040> kind<00:03:22.909> of<00:03:22.970> do<00:03:23.060> what<00:03:23.180> I'm<00:03:23.299> doing

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329

that kills kind of do what I'm doing
where<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.979> just<00:03:25.129> go<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.549> between<00:03:25.669> the<00:03:25.849> two

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090

hallways<00:03:26.479> into<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.310> kind<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.489> overpass<00:03:29.359> a

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
hallways into the kind of the overpass a

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.179 
hallways into the kind of the overpass a
little<00:03:29.810> bit<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.290> just<00:03:30.560> keep<00:03:30.829> going<00:03:31.040> back<00:03:31.129> and

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.039 
little bit and just keep going back and
forth<00:03:31.489> or<00:03:31.639> keep<00:03:31.849> yourself<00:03:32.150> real<00:03:32.389> up<00:03:32.599> close<00:03:32.870> to

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
forth or keep yourself real up close to

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.839 
forth or keep yourself real up close to
the<00:03:33.229> rail<00:03:33.829> of<00:03:33.919> close<00:03:34.069> to<00:03:34.189> the<00:03:34.280> enemies<00:03:34.609> and

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
the rail of close to the enemies and

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.159 
the rail of close to the enemies and
just<00:03:35.030> make<00:03:35.209> sure<00:03:35.239> that<00:03:35.479> they're<00:03:35.810> going<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.079> be

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
just make sure that they're going to be

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.439 
just make sure that they're going to be
within<00:03:36.349> engagement<00:03:37.340> distances<00:03:37.760> because<00:03:38.239> this

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
within engagement distances because this

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.610 
within engagement distances because this
gun<00:03:38.659> doesn't<00:03:38.900> do<00:03:39.109> very<00:03:39.319> well<00:03:39.379> on<00:03:39.560> long<00:03:39.889> ranges

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
gun doesn't do very well on long ranges

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.719 
gun doesn't do very well on long ranges
even<00:03:42.620> if<00:03:42.709> you're<00:03:42.829> controlling<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.489> rate<00:03:43.579> of

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
even if you're controlling the rate of

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:44.800 
even if you're controlling the rate of
fire<00:03:43.879> even<00:03:43.909> if<00:03:44.239> you're<00:03:44.359> just<00:03:44.569> kind<00:03:44.720> of

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
fire even if you're just kind of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.749 
fire even if you're just kind of
shooting<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.169> in<00:03:45.259> bursts<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:46.400> kind<00:03:46.579> of<00:03:46.609> hard

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:46.759 
shooting it in bursts it's kind of hard

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.339 
shooting it in bursts it's kind of hard
to<00:03:46.819> control<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.209> at<00:03:47.329> very<00:03:47.540> far<00:03:47.750> away<00:03:47.870> even<00:03:48.139> with

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
to control it at very far away even with

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.409 
to control it at very far away even with
a<00:03:48.409> grip<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.949> like<00:03:49.579> I<00:03:49.669> said<00:03:49.729> you<00:03:49.849> want<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.239> stay
