right here these are the cross members

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.710 
right here these are the cross members
there's<00:00:31.050> two<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> them<00:00:32.090> right<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> right

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
out with my sharpie get a 3/8 drill bit

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.969 
out with my sharpie get a 3/8 drill bit
and<00:01:14.450> drill<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:16.170> drill<00:01:16.289> out<00:01:16.560> those<00:01:16.709> holes

and drill the drill out those holes
drill<00:01:17.490> through<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> frame<00:01:17.910> then<00:01:18.479> I've<00:01:18.630> got

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
drill through the frame then I've got

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.029 
drill through the frame then I've got
hardware<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.319> everything<00:01:19.349> to<00:01:19.709> put<00:01:19.830> them<00:01:19.979> all

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
hardware and everything to put them all

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.100 
hardware and everything to put them all
back<00:01:20.190> together<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.630> we'll<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.929> these

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
back together and then we'll have these

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.249 
back together and then we'll have these
mounted<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.709> then<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.160> start<00:01:23.399> working<00:01:23.550> on

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
mounted and then we can start working on

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
mounted and then we can start working on
how<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.319> want<00:01:25.709> the<00:01:26.190> cross<00:01:26.550> members<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> go

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
how we want the cross members to go

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.779 
how we want the cross members to go
across<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.950> ahead<00:01:29.099> and<00:01:29.250> drill<00:01:29.580> those<00:01:29.729> holes

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
across so go ahead and drill those holes

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.460 
across so go ahead and drill those holes
and<00:01:31.009> then<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.130> guys<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:33.229> we're<00:01:34.229> gonna<00:01:34.349> go

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and then you guys can see we're gonna go

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.109 
and then you guys can see we're gonna go
from<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:40.310> give<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.399> a<00:01:41.459> little<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:41.880> light

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
from there give this a little more light

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:58.429 
from there give this a little more light
to<00:01:42.300> work<00:01:42.479> with

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.279 

so<00:01:59.439> my<00:01:59.560> mountain<00:02:00.009> right<00:02:00.189> here<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.899> what<00:02:05.170> they

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
so my mountain right here that what they

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:29.449 
so my mountain right here that what they
put<00:02:05.530> still<00:02:05.799> there<00:02:09.690> okay<00:02:11.489> begin<00:02:12.489> drilling

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:55.990 

drilling<00:02:30.459> down

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.910 

one

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:32.200 

ask<00:03:03.550> your<00:03:03.880> other<00:03:04.060> one

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.420 

there's<00:03:33.210> two<00:03:33.800> one<00:03:34.800> thing<00:03:34.950> I'm<00:03:35.040> thinking<00:03:35.370> of

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
there's two one thing I'm thinking of

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.120 
there's two one thing I'm thinking of
now<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.060> hope<00:03:36.270> those<00:03:36.480> holes<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.170> mean

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
now is that I hope those holes I mean

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.940 
now is that I hope those holes I mean
that<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.430> pretty<00:03:38.670> thick<00:03:39.150> metal<00:03:39.510> there<00:03:39.890> but<00:03:40.890> I'm

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
that is pretty thick metal there but I'm

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.380 
that is pretty thick metal there but I'm
just<00:03:41.130> hoping<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.400> those<00:03:41.580> holes<00:03:41.850> aren't<00:03:42.090> too

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
just hoping that those holes aren't too

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.310 
just hoping that those holes aren't too
close<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:44.210> you<00:03:45.210> know<00:03:45.360> where<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.720> ends<00:03:46.110> there<00:03:46.290> I

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
close to you know where it ends there I

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.540 
close to you know where it ends there I
hope<00:03:46.620> there's<00:03:46.800> enough<00:03:46.950> strength<00:03:47.280> there<00:03:47.520> I

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
hope there's enough strength there I

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.220 
hope there's enough strength there I
think<00:03:47.670> there<00:03:47.940> should<00:03:48.150> be<00:03:48.330> though<00:03:49.610> so<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:51.230> should

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
think there should be though so I should

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.070 
think there should be though so I should
mount<00:03:52.410> up<00:03:52.710> right<00:03:53.100> like<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:54.200> nice<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:57.420> should

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
mount up right like that nice and should

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.970 
mount up right like that nice and should
be<00:03:58.200> able<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.410> go<00:03:58.470> from<00:03:58.620> there<00:03:58.800> hopefully

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
be able to go from there hopefully

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.880 
be able to go from there hopefully
everything's<00:03:59.490> well<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.330> think<00:04:01.230> those<00:04:01.650> holes

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
everything's well I think those holes
