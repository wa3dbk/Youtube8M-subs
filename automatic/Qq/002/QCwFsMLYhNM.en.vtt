00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
reason it's a fail is because when i

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.780 
to be honest I didn't get along with the
whole<00:01:29.740> team<00:01:30.010> I<00:01:30.070> think<00:01:30.340> there's<00:01:30.490> some<00:01:30.640> really

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
whole team I think there's some really

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.880 
whole team I think there's some really
dodgy<00:01:31.090> spots<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.810> i<00:01:31.870> mean<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.230> defense<00:01:32.650> and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
dodgy spots in it i mean the defense and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.620 
dodgy spots in it i mean the defense and
the<00:01:32.920> attack<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.430> fine<00:01:33.700> it's<00:01:34.210> really<00:01:34.540> the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
the attack of fine it's really the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.970 
the attack of fine it's really the
midfield<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.200> goalkeeper<00:01:35.590> where<00:01:35.770> i<00:01:35.800> had

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
midfield and the goalkeeper where i had

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.760 
midfield and the goalkeeper where i had
issues<00:01:36.400> also<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.600> fact<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.020> i<00:01:38.050> don't<00:01:38.350> really

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
issues also the fact is i don't really

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.290 
issues also the fact is i don't really
like<00:01:39.010> to<00:01:39.130> play<00:01:39.280> three<00:01:39.520> at<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.610> back<00:01:39.760> squads<00:01:40.120> I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
like to play three at the back squads I

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.430 
like to play three at the back squads I
did<00:01:40.510> because<00:01:40.660> I<00:01:40.870> see<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.200> lot<00:01:41.230> of<00:01:41.350> people

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
did because I see that a lot of people

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.900 
did because I see that a lot of people
having<00:01:41.740> success<00:01:42.220> with<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.640> wanted<00:01:42.820> to

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
having success with it and I wanted to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.000 
having success with it and I wanted to
try<00:01:43.090> out<00:01:43.270> but<00:01:43.900> personally<00:01:44.410> for<00:01:44.530> me<00:01:44.680> I'm<00:01:44.830> going

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
try out but personally for me I'm going

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.380 
try out but personally for me I'm going
to<00:01:45.100> be<00:01:45.220> sticking<00:01:45.520> with<00:01:45.610> for<00:01:45.850> at<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:45.970> back<00:01:46.150> i

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
to be sticking with for at the back i

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.150 
to be sticking with for at the back i
just<00:01:46.900> don't<00:01:47.050> really<00:01:47.200> get<00:01:47.530> how<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.920> defend

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
just don't really get how you can defend

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.770 
just don't really get how you can defend
with<00:01:48.460> three<00:01:48.610> at<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.760> back<00:01:48.910> it<00:01:49.120> just<00:01:49.150> doesn't

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
with three at the back it just doesn't

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.450 
with three at the back it just doesn't
really<00:01:49.870> make<00:01:50.050> much<00:01:50.110> sense<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.500> me<00:01:50.620> anyway<00:01:51.400> for

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
really make much sense to me anyway for

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
much better than I was a couple of days

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.540 
much better than I was a couple of days
ago<00:03:38.230> before<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.740> started<00:03:39.040> asking<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.430> to

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550

thumbs<00:03:40.360> up<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.750> fathead<00:03:41.320> squads<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.800> I

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
thumbs up the fathead squads and I

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.120 
thumbs up the fathead squads and I
really<00:03:43.210> appreciate<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.410> think<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.920> team

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
really appreciate it so I think the team

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.190 
really appreciate it so I think the team
ended<00:03:45.370> up<00:03:45.490> costing<00:03:45.760> about<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.930> only<00:03:47.080> two

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
ended up costing about the only two

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.110 
ended up costing about the only two
expensive<00:03:47.650> players<00:03:48.010> are<00:03:48.160> really<00:03:48.220> Falcao<00:03:48.820> who

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
expensive players are really Falcao who

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.220 
expensive players are really Falcao who
is<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.270> think<00:03:50.400> 29,000<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.760> Chiellini<00:03:52.510> who<00:03:52.960> was

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
is I think 29,000 and Chiellini who was

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.640 
is I think 29,000 and Chiellini who was
I<00:03:53.560> think<00:03:54.430> about<00:03:54.610> 20,000<00:03:55.450> so<00:03:55.960> it<00:03:56.350> was<00:03:56.470> probably

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
I think about 20,000 so it was probably

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.860 
I think about 20,000 so it was probably
about<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:56.980> 30-foot<00:03:57.940> like<00:03:58.510> you're<00:03:58.720> probably

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
about a 30-foot like you're probably

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.770 
about a 30-foot like you're probably
about<00:03:59.050> a<00:03:59.430> 60k<00:04:00.430> squad<00:04:00.790> after<00:04:01.000> all<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.660> other

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
about a 60k squad after all the other

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.150 
about a 60k squad after all the other
players<00:04:02.020> because<00:04:02.200> they're<00:04:02.320> all<00:04:02.440> about<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.710> 1k

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
players because they're all about the 1k

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.760 
players because they're all about the 1k
