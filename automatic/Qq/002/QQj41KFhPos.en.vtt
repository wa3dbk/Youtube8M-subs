first<00:00:15.000> impressions<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> game<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:16.230> played

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
first impressions of the game I played

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.470 
first impressions of the game I played
it<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.130> like<00:00:17.250> about<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> minute<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.300> see

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
it for like about a minute just to see

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.870 
it for like about a minute just to see
if<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.660> would<00:00:18.750> work<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.520> it<00:00:20.520> looks<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:22.880> one

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
if it would work but it looks like one

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.849 
if it would work but it looks like one
thing<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.269> sucks<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> buttons<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.590> are

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
thing that sucks is the buttons like are

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.670 
thing that sucks is the buttons like are
so<00:00:26.189> tiny<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.730> they're<00:00:26.849> kind<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.090> hard<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> read

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
so tiny and they're kind of hard to read

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.500 
so tiny and they're kind of hard to read
Network<00:00:28.680> let's<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:29.240> see<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.390> can

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
Network let's see see if you can

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.280 
Network let's see see if you can
actually<00:00:32.510> see<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> don't<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.110> would

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
actually see I don't know if this would

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.810 
actually see I don't know if this would
work<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.780> it's<00:00:36.780> kind<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> online

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
work or not it's kind of like the online

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.130 
work or not it's kind of like the online
maybe<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.149> work<00:00:41.329> let's<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.780> join

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
maybe you would work let's see it's join

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.389 
maybe you would work let's see it's join
a<00:00:43.170> random<00:00:43.620> room<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:47.899> haven't<00:00:48.899> done<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.170> yet

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
a random room I haven't done this yet

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.420 
a random room I haven't done this yet
this<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.610> online<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:52.010> so

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this is online I think so

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.799 
this is online I think so
looks<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> difference<00:00:54.360> between<00:00:54.510> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
looks like the difference between this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.130 
looks like the difference between this
game<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.500> PC<00:00:55.829> game<00:00:56.780> maybe<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.870> didn't

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
game and the PC game maybe you didn't

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.700 
game and the PC game maybe you didn't

it<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.789> little<00:02:10.330> laggy<00:02:10.569> but<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:10.959> think<00:02:11.410> it's

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
it is a little laggy but I think it's

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.550 
it is a little laggy but I think it's
just<00:02:11.800> because<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.550> big<00:02:12.760> world<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.470> I

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
just because it's a big world and and I

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.440 
just because it's a big world and and I
do<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.980> pretty<00:02:15.160> powerful<00:02:15.510> fundal<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:18.450> don't

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
do have a pretty powerful fundal I don't

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.270 
do have a pretty powerful fundal I don't
know<00:02:22.260> looks<00:02:23.260> like<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.560> could<00:02:23.680> shoot<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
know looks like you could shoot the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.650 
know looks like you could shoot the
weapon<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:27.310> game<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.550> think<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.480> an

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
weapon this game I think is just just an

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.620 
weapon this game I think is just just an
early<00:02:29.050> access<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:31.600> it's<00:02:31.870> early<00:02:32.440> game<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.570> I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
early access like it's early game so I

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.400 
early access like it's early game so I
don't<00:02:34.810> wanna<00:02:36.570> say<00:02:37.570> anything<00:02:37.600> bad<00:02:38.080> about<00:02:38.260> it
