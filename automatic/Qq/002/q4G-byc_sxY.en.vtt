00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.860
 all riders and get so Bundesliga z 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 Nineteenth game day 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.370
 and the last matchday did not stay that good for me 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.119
 but also for 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.359
 the opening game this is the 19 game days is 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.840
 in the Hamburger SV and 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.449
 a procedure before and the top match between the FFC Cologne and 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.579
 Werder Bremen 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.599
 Admont used 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.819
 the opening game 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.249
 besides said 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.950
 Hamburg and Frankfurt 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.770
 the report also 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.770
 two to-zero victories 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.280
 since the HSV 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.690
 at home against Frankfurt destroyed with Nantes Forint 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.470
 I think so 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.700
 soon that continues 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 the first Samsung meeting 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000
 is between 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.210
 Hannover 96 and FC Schalke 04 and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.290
 Hannover 96 is currently second in the table who would have a start of the season 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.480
 thought 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.480
 where a first Hannover second 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.700
 for many a surprise 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.250
 do not clean up either 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.300
 and 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.710
 the relegated 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.770
 lost to Hamburg 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.550
 Hannover on the other hand 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.390
 3 0 against Frankfurt 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.600
 and 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.160
 that's why 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 the TecDax lost 4 2 0 against Schalke wins 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.050
 we know Cottbus between Borussia Dortmund and the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.530
 on the Stuttgart 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.870
 and Dortmund have lost as the last home against Stuttgart as 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.530
 Stuttgart became German champion 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.780
 that's a bit 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.620
 Erbs 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.800
 So it could not lost the last games against Stuttgart at home 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.650
 Stuttgart is 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.870
 a return round team 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.460
 This has been seen in recent years that in the first round is not too smooth 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.870
 but ran super in the second half 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.570
 but Dortmund 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.969
 they will win against heathens 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.969
 already there 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.259
 The meeting is between the FSV Mainz 05 and the 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.609
 Folger Wolfsburg 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.759
 Let's go to BASF now 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.899
 the players continue to draw well 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:33.579
 and that's why I also say that these games draw 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.869
 one to one 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.989
 even if it last in the first round a 3 0 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.780
 a 3 0 halftime 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.489
 for Wolfsburg and 1 turned the game completely 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.650
 At the moment I do not think that is cowardly in this condition 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.669
 either 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.809
 first to play well and then to play so badly or too badly too 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:02.459
 then play so well 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.459
 therefore 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.799
 the next meeting 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.719
 between the SC Freiburg and the perfect underground 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:15.719
 what such 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.580
 Large locations 16 percent 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.299
 that Friborg wins 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.299
 2 to 1 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.819
 Commander and thus next game 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.229
 that's where Virgin is against Kaiserslautern 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.279
 Worms 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.279
 Lautern had in the first round 2 0 against Bayern want 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.199
 that would be one 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.289
 you expected 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.979
 not myself either 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.039
 Lautern has after 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:44.419
 no more 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.339
 so play and then again 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:51.149
 but against Bayern succeed this time not the victory 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:52.469
 Bayern wins 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.409
 Zeltweg 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.409
 with a 2 0 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.419
 in the Acer opponent and it is the top match 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.839
 their first mentioned between September 11th 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.249
 Werder Bremen 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.689
 and 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.689
 Werder Bremen is pretty much from Eschbach in this song 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.719
 and what can lay 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:22.019
 because of the money, they are not changing that against Cologne 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.779
 Cologne tries to hold against it as against Lautern 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:27.509
 but creates 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.499
 is not 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:32.360
 make the decisive goal and therefore this game would have one 

00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:35.359
 one 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.580
 Spices first missed meeting more with Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.849
 Bayer Leverkusen 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:44.790
 and 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.790
 in the group there was a surprising 6 to 3 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.490
 Of course, many comments 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.110
 Forward Gladbach 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.380
 it is 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.370
 home should not be the power 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.180
 Leverkusen away already and 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.349
 therefore 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.189
 I think times that Leverkusen wins Â» 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.099
 nothing 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.099
 but with a 2 0 0 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.610
 the next meeting is between 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.860
 TSG Hoffenheim 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.279
 the FC St Pauli 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.439
 Pauli has finally scored again goals striker 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.370
 against Friborg and 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.190
 Hoffenheim 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.939
 proved that the 11 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.680
 Coach change nothing to call 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.870
 and that the 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.080
 Departures easily 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.529
 are too strong 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:38.480
 and 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.729
 therefore 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.500
 In this case, I tend to be on 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.210
 draw 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.900
 with the encounter 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.900
 one to one 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.210
 that was nothing now this 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.419
 our third party 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.400
 if he does 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.439
 Suggestions for improvement resin 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.819
 Kocka Pieper word 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.819
 short-term sparrow down 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.469
 See you again the next matchday and before I do that again 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.469
 forget you can 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.709
 Vaske downstairs use each time down the game day 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.669
 Comment box 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.199
 for the use 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.330
 for knight test case for wanting to deliver and 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:27.819

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.339
 then next monday again 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:31.410

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.390
 So stir again the best
