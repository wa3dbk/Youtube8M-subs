00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.579
 it was okay, it's not fable dal-soto orla 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.060
 already the advertiser his office 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.499
 I'm here to promote my books here by agehab go 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.529
 it's not a career started at a distant date in 1992 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
 when I threw my first book my guardian angel's trail 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.550
 and at that time there was a whole emo movement 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.450
 guardian angels are in the book that sold a lot 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.070
 from now until number 2 the footpath spends two million guards reported 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.520
 claimed that the oil did not stop 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 more than 1 2 centimeters in japan to 0 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.300
 After the game I play 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.570
 who also sold 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.210
 fairly united 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.620
 Fantastic 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.750
 and there was a succession of 13 years without writing 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.810
 I came back now in 2006 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.100
 with the closing the eyes knows in the heart and with all a work also 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 attached to this earth 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.100
 books are spiritual spiritualist nicolau 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.150
 in his book of spirits 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.280
 What I think is nice that at work I can talk about themes without participating 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.250
 without giving up any religion 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.720
 so I speak of reality pessalli even because I speak of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.520
 Jesus 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.370
 I kept my eye on the water 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.890
 but are not tied to any religion 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.150
 for example in this book of mourning closed the eyes the pain in the heart I count one 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
 history of reincarnation of past lives 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.080
 where I went back in time through a process I learned to do and I 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.440
 I could see 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.969
 I had lived 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.420
 already at that time 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.030
 in jerusalem 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.030
 next to all the facts that happened there 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.809
 maybe got rid of this here 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.099
 and hit the corner in the harbor 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.360
 this book here deals with what nagib tells 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.119
 for many years with each other 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.489
 I have 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.039
 performance since the year 2000 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.039
 as it is known that the US does not give a new dimension 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:48.039
 also provides some evidence for the skeptics who do not believe 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.039
 I suspected that I would be a person to sell books 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.679
 the most skeptical will have a test 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.679
 proving here in this book 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:08.169
 Look, it's a very long subject. 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.559
 is the contacts happen in various ways 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.579
 the killings are not presential because there is still this possibility 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:21.059
 They even like it but the question is, am I 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:25.049
 so they are contacts where there is telepathy 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.129
 there are no recorded parties 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.249
 in my subtle body 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.259
 here I can access 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.419
 there is also the possibility of it being 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.659
 fields 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.120
 the natives 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.359
 let's say like this 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.049
 which are outside the area of ​​our size and that is why people 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.639
 call me a lot of your office is scaled 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.509
 because I can gravitate 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:55.439
 in this world that we do not have contact because he is out of materiality 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.579
 it's a death penalty 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.809
 no www a gm 20 by procon 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.579
 both you can find 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.049
 the vast majority of books 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.389
 they did an amazing job, I'm very impressed with the 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.779
 printing with quality 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.789
 and I do not want to know anymore of conventional victory did not see come here because 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.050
 here is the river 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.210
 I wish you want to sell me and listen to me. 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.210
 if you read it right 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.740
 because it's a book that you have later 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.400
 a new vision 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.730
 new knowledge a new way of seeing successes 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.300
 so it's very different from us 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.820
 but they pension very much 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.360
 basically of our values 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.439
 was also important to them 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.499
 This is a big hug for everyone
