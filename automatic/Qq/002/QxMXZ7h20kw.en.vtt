00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello people in today's video I show 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.380
 you again 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.360
 the last time was for this sector and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.240
 I wanted to show you how to do it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.300
 So this hand chain can do parts 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.359
 the here and that I was just recently 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.170
 htm and also at the office and then I have 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.599
 That's how it is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.430
 look out for you already horny and navis 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.290
 has looked like that makes euro 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.140
 I just thought so when I 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.760
 looked at exactly 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.320
 It's not that hard for her 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.950
 that 's why I am on the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.090
 Idea come to make it easy and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.620
 I'll show you how they did it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.309
 have I think that there is anything league 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.050
 easy and many things you do for it 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.590
 you need your home 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 So yes, if you want to look 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 just keep reading this video 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.010
 thumb and maybe even or and me 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.080
 would say yes everything you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.689
 needed is a chain certainly has 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 somewhere at home a pair of pliers and 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.760
 a bit of jewelry than in papers 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.760
 or so 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.880
 now he takes the chain which should already 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.880
 be a little bit longer 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.859
 He winds her once in the other finger 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.250
 and thus can cut off from it 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.250
 leaves 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.150
 The easiest way to do this is with a pair of pliers 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.940
 Now the chain wrapped wrist and 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.750
 can thus measure where you are 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.750
 cut off measures 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.269
 and the rest of the part should be 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.120
 this connection therefore be chain 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.120
 between the ringfinger and between 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.120
 bracelet 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.620
 First, this connection part 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.469
 and your pearl so I have to 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.499
 part of the chosen out knows certainly 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.239
 These watches chain those out of these 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.209
 different songs exist and there 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.139
 I took out science and 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.340
 content of this connection is a 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.609
 to make it a little bit more beautiful 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.730
 I use this should be about 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.060
 see where that is dangerous to you 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:26.430
 rest could show here 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:30.689
 it deprives the all share what you before 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.449
 cut it off and do it somehow 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.299
 connect to this beads part 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:38.310
 So I have to go with it 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:43.280
 Imitated from the wire and got that 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.280
 then together 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.250
 ok and now they are this again 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.159
 remaining pieces of this 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.729
 Connection part cuts it again so 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.729
 deal 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.790
 yes and that does connect again ans 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:23.830
 another end to your pearl or whatever 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:36.850
 always you used there so that should be 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:38.949
 then it's okay now she takes 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.500
 this part that you cut off 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.960
 however, for your fingers and now 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.650
 you have to connect that and that 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.260
 this connection part works best 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:55.740
 stepped up to take pen it is so 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.740
 have formed 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.150
 and then you close it 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.400
 That's what it should look like 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.420
 Now this bracelet has to be with this 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.020
 Connection part was silent on the part 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:48.630
 still be connected and that works too 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:54.570
 best with such a zone solve this 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:06:02.820
 sparked best you take the middle 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:09.540
 free from a bracelet so like me 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:11.460
 see here is like when you can not 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.090
 you still want to know the ugly ones 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.870
 ali karimi diana k 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:22.919
 the locking carabiner 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:26.630
 I believe that you can then 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.630
 attach there to your bracelet 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.790
 and that's it already 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.790
 could wear it 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.289
 because I was so bored then I have 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:45.710
 made another and what is what 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:49.599
 same a silver chain and I have 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:53.169
 since three share so connected together 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.169
 otherwise it is the same 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:07:01.749
 and then I did one more thing here 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:04.739
 I also used such a chopsticks 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:04.739
 And so three pearls 

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:12.689
 yes I hope you liked it and 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.689
 See you in the next video
