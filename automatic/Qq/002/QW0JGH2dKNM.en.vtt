take a shot of light bulb at my house
which<00:03:10.439> is<00:03:10.470> pure<00:03:10.950> white<00:03:11.129> it's<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.519> fluorescent

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
which is pure white it's a fluorescent

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.289 
which is pure white it's a fluorescent
lamp<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.799> see<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.579> comparison<00:03:14.879> with

pitch-black area now with the night

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.479 
pitch-black area now with the night
raker<00:03:26.879> bulbs<00:03:27.359> installed<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.890> can<00:03:28.920> see<00:03:29.280> that

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
raker bulbs installed you can see that

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
the light is really really good it's

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.789 
the light is really really good it's
very<00:03:33.420> wide<00:03:33.689> and<00:03:35.690> illuminates<00:03:36.690> very<00:03:36.930> well<00:03:37.200> it's

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
very wide and illuminates very well it's

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.430 
very wide and illuminates very well it's
the<00:03:38.190> second<00:03:38.579> best<00:03:38.760> thing<00:03:38.909> to<00:03:39.209> having<00:03:39.480> xenon<00:03:40.260> or

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
the second best thing to having xenon or

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.369 
the second best thing to having xenon or
HID<00:03:40.950> headlights<00:03:41.700> which<00:03:42.030> may<00:03:42.420> be<00:03:42.480> illegal<00:03:43.139> in

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
HID headlights which may be illegal in

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.800 
HID headlights which may be illegal in
your<00:03:43.409> car<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.489> these<00:03:44.730> lamps<00:03:45.060> are<00:03:45.239> perfectly

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
your car so these lamps are perfectly

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.619 
your car so these lamps are perfectly
legal<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.430> will<00:03:47.609> not<00:03:47.790> have<00:03:48.090> any<00:03:48.239> trouble

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
legal and you will not have any trouble

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.590 
legal and you will not have any trouble
in<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> MOT<00:03:49.500> for<00:03:49.709> example

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.120 

so<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.900> place<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> special<00:03:55.860> emphasis<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
so I place a special emphasis in the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.890 
so I place a special emphasis in the
comparing<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.220> color<00:03:59.430> because<00:03:59.910> if<00:04:00.690> you're

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
comparing the color because if you're

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.660 
comparing the color because if you're
like<00:04:01.050> me<00:04:01.230> you're<00:04:01.440> not<00:04:01.590> looking<00:04:01.980> for<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.250> xenon

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
like me you're not looking for a xenon

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.450 
like me you're not looking for a xenon
or<00:04:02.880> tuning<00:04:03.420> like<00:04:04.080> headlights<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.280> a

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
or tuning like headlights it's just a

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.790 
or tuning like headlights it's just a
personal<00:04:06.390> matter<00:04:06.570> of<00:04:06.990> personal<00:04:07.320> taste<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.770> like

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
my lights to be perfectly white because

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.840 
my lights to be perfectly white because
they<00:04:11.190> will<00:04:11.460> enhance<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:12.930> my<00:04:13.860> eyesight's<00:04:14.610> of

they will enhance the my eyesight's of

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.160 
they will enhance the my eyesight's of
the<00:04:15.060> road<00:04:15.260> I'm<00:04:16.260> not<00:04:16.470> interested<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.130> books<00:04:17.400> I

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
the road I'm not interested in books I

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.240 
the road I'm not interested in books I
respect<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.260> people<00:04:19.290> who<00:04:19.560> are<00:04:19.709> interested<00:04:20.220> in

respect the people who are interested in

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.340 
respect the people who are interested in
books<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.580> course<00:04:20.790> but<00:04:21.480> these<00:04:21.720> Ostrom

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350

nitrogen valves are not like very blue

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.040 
nitrogen valves are not like very blue
so<00:04:26.430> they're<00:04:26.730> not<00:04:26.880> for<00:04:27.240> tuning<00:04:27.840> purposes

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
so they're not for tuning purposes

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.730 
so they're not for tuning purposes

installed<00:05:18.120> them<00:05:18.330> on<00:05:18.360> my<00:05:18.750> car<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.169> even<00:05:19.770> though

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
installed them on my car and even though

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.540 
installed them on my car and even though
there<00:05:20.100> is<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.220> compromise<00:05:20.730> in<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.390> light<00:05:22.050> bulb

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
there is a compromise in the light bulb

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.330 
there is a compromise in the light bulb
lifetime<00:05:23.550> because<00:05:24.060> these<00:05:24.270> lights<00:05:24.600> will<00:05:24.900> last

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
lifetime because these lights will last

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.080 
lifetime because these lights will last
less<00:05:26.340> than<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:27.060> original<00:05:28.010> headlights<00:05:29.090> this

be<00:05:59.690> sure<00:05:59.870> to<00:05:59.900> check<00:06:00.199> out<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.500> new<00:06:00.620> model<00:06:00.949> even

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
be sure to check out the new model even

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.310 
be sure to check out the new model even
though<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.610> new<00:06:01.699> model<00:06:02.360> will<00:06:02.690> be<00:06:02.810> a<00:06:03.020> little

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
though the new model will be a little

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.110 
though the new model will be a little
bit<00:06:03.440> more<00:06:03.620> expensive<00:06:03.889> and<00:06:04.250> I<00:06:04.370> got<00:06:04.699> my<00:06:04.880> lights

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
bit more expensive and I got my lights

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.600 
bit more expensive and I got my lights
that<00:06:05.690> discounts<00:06:06.199> precisely<00:06:06.979> because<00:06:07.280> they

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
that discounts precisely because they

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.730 
that discounts precisely because they
mainly<00:06:08.060> maybe<00:06:08.449> because<00:06:09.110> they<00:06:09.260> are<00:06:09.350> clearing

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
mainly maybe because they are clearing

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.770 
mainly maybe because they are clearing
stock<00:06:10.130> for<00:06:10.639> the<00:06:10.760> new<00:06:10.850> model<00:06:11.180> so<00:06:11.630> I<00:06:11.900> hope<00:06:12.830> this

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
stock for the new model so I hope this

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.980 
stock for the new model so I hope this
has<00:06:14.780> been<00:06:14.810> a<00:06:16.000> comprehensive<00:06:17.000> review<00:06:17.630> and

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
has been a comprehensive review and

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.230 
has been a comprehensive review and
comparison<00:06:18.290> even<00:06:19.130> though<00:06:19.250> I<00:06:19.280> did<00:06:19.820> this<00:06:19.940> with<00:06:20.210> a

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
comparison even though I did this with a

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.560 
comparison even though I did this with a
mobile<00:06:20.570> phone<00:06:20.630> and<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.199> was<00:06:21.500> sure<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:22.389> check<00:06:23.389> out

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
mobile phone and I was sure to check out

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.830 
mobile phone and I was sure to check out
that<00:06:24.160> to<00:06:25.160> film<00:06:25.370> that<00:06:25.610> fluorescent<00:06:26.030> bulb<00:06:26.419> to

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
that to film that fluorescent bulb to

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.450 
that to film that fluorescent bulb to
give<00:06:27.020> you<00:06:27.110> a<00:06:27.139> reference<00:06:27.620> point<00:06:27.830> because<00:06:28.220> every

give you a reference point because every

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.830 
give you a reference point because every
mobile<00:06:28.729> phone<00:06:29.000> every<00:06:29.330> camera<00:06:29.360> is<00:06:29.690> different

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
mobile phone every camera is different

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.650 
mobile phone every camera is different
in<00:06:30.199> the<00:06:30.290> color<00:06:30.470> balance<00:06:30.710> of<00:06:31.040> the<00:06:31.479> filming<00:06:32.479> and

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
in the color balance of the filming and

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.840 
in the color balance of the filming and
that<00:06:33.169> may<00:06:33.380> produce<00:06:33.680> an<00:06:34.070> interpreter<00:06:34.550> the

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
that may produce an interpreter the

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.180 
that may produce an interpreter the
results<00:06:35.479> that's<00:06:35.960> why<00:06:36.169> I<00:06:36.199> put<00:06:36.470> that<00:06:36.650> that

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
results that's why I put that that

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.330 
results that's why I put that that
fluorescent<00:06:37.550> white<00:06:38.360> wall<00:06:38.600> which<00:06:38.780> is<00:06:38.810> a

fluorescent white wall which is a
