video and how to clean up a little bit

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.230 
video and how to clean up a little bit
though<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.250> starters<00:00:14.370> we'll<00:00:14.790> go<00:00:14.910> into<00:00:15.179> our

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
though so for starters we'll go into our

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.029 
though so for starters we'll go into our
normal<00:00:15.480> minecraft<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.619> has<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.890> been

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
normal minecraft that has not been

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.700 
normal minecraft that has not been
altered<00:00:17.600> you<00:00:18.600> know<00:00:18.720> create<00:00:19.050> new<00:00:19.170> world<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
altered you know create new world and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.870 
altered you know create new world and
I'm<00:00:19.770> also<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> be<00:00:20.250> demonstrating

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
I'm also going to be demonstrating

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.450 
I'm also going to be demonstrating
explosives<00:00:21.480> plus<00:00:21.779> mod<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.619> demonstrate<00:00:23.250> how

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
explosives plus mod to demonstrate how

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.189 
explosives plus mod to demonstrate how
more<00:00:23.939> ram<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.480> pretty<00:00:24.930> more<00:00:25.050> efficient<00:00:27.199> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
more ram is pretty more efficient to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.960 
more ram is pretty more efficient to
create<00:00:28.439> new<00:00:28.619> world

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.520 

okay

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.049 

I'm<00:00:42.920> going<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.160> be<00:00:43.219> using<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.579> vortex

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
I'm going to be using the vortex

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.860 
I'm going to be using the vortex
explosion<00:00:44.840> it<00:00:45.440> caused<00:00:45.649> a<00:00:45.680> lot<00:00:46.039> of<00:00:46.219> lag<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.449> we

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
explosion it caused a lot of lag and we

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.990 
explosion it caused a lot of lag and we
just<00:00:48.079> pull<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.769> top<00:00:49.460> right<00:00:49.640> corner<00:00:49.969> you

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
just pull in the top right corner you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.639 
just pull in the top right corner you
see<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.329> he's<00:00:50.449> only<00:00:50.570> about<00:00:50.780> 500<00:00:51.289> megabytes

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
see a he's only about 500 megabytes

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.939 
see a he's only about 500 megabytes
memory<00:00:52.550> allocated<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.920> with<00:00:55.309> this<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.550> normal

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
memory allocated so with this a normal

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.160 
memory allocated so with this a normal
having<00:00:57.949> bigger<00:00:58.219> bites<00:00:58.430> this<00:00:58.930> explosions<00:00:59.930> it's

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
having bigger bites this explosions it's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.110 
having bigger bites this explosions it's
caused<00:01:00.409> a<00:01:00.680> crash<00:01:01.040> you'll<00:01:01.610> see<00:01:01.790> here<00:01:02.000> in<00:01:02.059> a

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
caused a crash you'll see here in a

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.229 
caused a crash you'll see here in a
second<00:01:02.589> what<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:03.829> explosion<00:01:04.670> does<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.149> it

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
second what this explosion does is it

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.180 
second what this explosion does is it
sucks<00:01:05.570> in<00:01:05.810> like<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.080> vortex<00:01:06.530> everything<00:01:06.950> around

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
sucks in like a vortex everything around

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.700 
sucks in like a vortex everything around
it<00:01:07.460> like<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:08.000> big<00:01:08.210> circle<00:01:08.570> pulls<00:01:09.259> it<00:01:09.380> into<00:01:09.500> its

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
it like a big circle pulls it into its

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.830 
it like a big circle pulls it into its
center<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.190> then<00:01:10.759> we'll<00:01:10.970> basically<00:01:11.180> cast<00:01:11.630> it

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
center and then we'll basically cast it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.520 
center and then we'll basically cast it
out<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:16.580> is<00:01:16.820> where<00:01:17.060> only<00:01:17.750> 500<00:01:18.170> megabytes

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
out and this is where only 500 megabytes

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.830 
out and this is where only 500 megabytes
of<00:01:18.890> Minecraft<00:01:19.340> Ram<00:01:19.880> allocated<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.539> it<00:01:20.659> has<00:01:20.810> a

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
of Minecraft Ram allocated to it has a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.279 
of Minecraft Ram allocated to it has a
problem<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:21.830> not<00:01:21.979> enough<00:01:22.220> memory<00:01:22.429> for<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:23.060> to

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
problem it's not enough memory for it to

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.109 
problem it's not enough memory for it to
do<00:01:24.289> all<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.610> information<00:01:25.610> needs<00:01:25.819> to<00:01:25.850> process

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
do all the information needs to process

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.690 
do all the information needs to process
this<00:01:26.690> explosion<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:28.220> we're<00:01:28.369> going<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.520> see<00:01:28.670> a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
this explosion so we're going to see a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.590 
this explosion so we're going to see a
crashing<00:01:29.210> moment<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:33.440> there<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.190> is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
crashing moment and there it is

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.940 
crashing moment and there it is
minecraft<00:01:35.600> ran<00:01:35.750> out<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.869> memory<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:37.210> handle<00:01:38.210> it

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
minecraft ran out of memory so handle it

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.460 
minecraft ran out of memory so handle it
now<00:01:39.950> I'll<00:01:40.069> go<00:01:40.340> into<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.759> modded<00:01:41.240> minecraft<00:01:41.470> so

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
now I'll go into the modded minecraft so

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.600 
now I'll go into the modded minecraft so
I<00:01:42.530> allocated<00:01:43.130> three<00:01:43.460> gigs<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:44.390> memory<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:48.610> will

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
I allocated three gigs of memory to will

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:00.420 
I allocated three gigs of memory to will
create<00:01:49.879> a<00:01:49.940> new<00:01:50.090> world

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.980 

right

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.800 

this'll<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:08.069> sorry<00:02:08.280> pigs<00:02:08.670> part<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.720> an

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
this'll do sorry pigs part of an

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.370 
this'll do sorry pigs part of an
experiment<00:02:10.520> okay<00:02:14.660> oops<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.900> forgot<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> show

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
experiment okay oops I forgot the show

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.850 
experiment okay oops I forgot the show
something<00:02:17.069> just<00:02:17.819> show<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> fter<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.569> guess

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
something just show a fter this I guess

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.020 
something just show a fter this I guess
all<00:02:19.860> right<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.340> what<00:02:20.490> three<00:02:20.670> gigs<00:02:20.880> is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
all right this is what three gigs is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.970 
all right this is what three gigs is
still<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.450> ASL<00:02:21.930> that's<00:02:22.500> because<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.920> a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
still like ASL that's because it's a

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.040 
still like ASL that's because it's a
pretty<00:02:23.220> big<00:02:23.370> explosion<00:02:23.630> but<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.810> case

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
pretty big explosion but in this case

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.740 
pretty big explosion but in this case
I'll<00:02:25.319> show<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.920> actual<00:02:26.250> full<00:02:26.750> velocity

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
I'll show you the actual full velocity

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.350 
I'll show you the actual full velocity
of<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.350> now<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.069> can<00:02:29.370> see<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.640> sucking<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.180> all

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
of it now you can see it sucking in all

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.710 
of it now you can see it sucking in all
of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.819> blocks<00:02:32.819> around<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.510> make<00:02:33.690> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
of the blocks around it and make a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080 
of the blocks around it and make a
circle<00:02:34.110> radius<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:35.400> upload<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.790> into<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
circle radius and then upload it into a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.009 
circle radius and then upload it into a
ball

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019

we're<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:10.860> loving<00:03:10.980> two<00:03:11.130> megabytes<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.549> RAM<00:03:11.790> I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
we're just loving two megabytes of RAM I

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.310 
we're just loving two megabytes of RAM I
wouldn't<00:03:12.329> do<00:03:12.480> all<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.019> would<00:03:13.140> see<00:03:13.290> a

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
wouldn't do all this you would see a

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.770 
wouldn't do all this you would see a
hole<00:03:13.560> here<00:03:13.860> from<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.280> explosion<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:15.450> since<00:03:15.660> I

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
hole here from the explosion but since I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.720 
hole here from the explosion but since I
like<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.500> crashed<00:03:16.769> all<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.250> aftermath

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
like that and crashed all the aftermath

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.330 
like that and crashed all the aftermath
the<00:03:17.760> blocks<00:03:18.150> will<00:03:18.390> not<00:03:18.540> be<00:03:18.690> here<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:20.280> is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the blocks will not be here this is

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.520 
the blocks will not be here this is
basically<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.910> full<00:03:22.850> example<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:24.150> this

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
basically the full example of this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.199 
basically the full example of this
explosion<00:03:25.530> with<00:03:25.799> more<00:03:26.010> memory<00:03:26.340> allocated<00:03:27.000> to

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
explosion with more memory allocated to

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.110 
explosion with more memory allocated to
it<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.200> see<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.410> full<00:03:28.590> effects<00:03:29.060> now<00:03:30.060> to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
it so you see the full effects now to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.270 
it so you see the full effects now to
show<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.450> how<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.470> get<00:03:31.650> more<00:03:31.769> memory<00:03:31.980> to

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
show you how to get more memory to

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
now where you see X MX + XM s 4x MS this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.870 
now where you see X MX + XM s 4x MS this
is<00:03:55.590> where<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:55.799> would<00:03:55.890> have<00:03:56.010> put<00:03:56.160> how<00:03:56.280> much<00:03:56.430> RAM

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
is where you would have put how much RAM

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.120 
is where you would have put how much RAM
you<00:03:56.910> want<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.359> use<00:03:57.570> for<00:03:57.720> Minecraft<00:03:58.170> so<00:03:58.859> in<00:03:58.920> my

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
you want to use for Minecraft so in my

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.180 
you want to use for Minecraft so in my
case<00:03:59.190> three<00:03:59.760> gigs<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.390> RAM<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.980> number

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
case three gigs of RAM and this number

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.130 
case three gigs of RAM and this number
is<00:04:02.340> double<00:04:02.760> how<00:04:03.120> much<00:04:03.299> RAM<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.570> want<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.930> use

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
is double how much RAM you want to use

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.800 
is double how much RAM you want to use
and<00:04:04.650> RAM<00:04:05.370> isn't<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.820> simple<00:04:06.060> number<00:04:06.239> life<00:04:06.660> is

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
and RAM isn't a simple number life is

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.120 
and RAM isn't a simple number life is
3,000<00:04:07.440> megabytes

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
3,000 megabytes

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.150 
3,000 megabytes
it's<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.880> set<00:04:09.390> number<00:04:09.570> almost<00:04:10.410> all<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.859> numbers

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
it's a set number almost all the numbers

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.330 
it's a set number almost all the numbers

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
much RAM you allocate here then double

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.770 
much RAM you allocate here then double
its<00:04:16.199> here<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.799> then<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.370> pathway<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.600> the
