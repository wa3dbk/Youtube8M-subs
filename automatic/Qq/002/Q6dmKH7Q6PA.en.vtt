00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
it's great to be back in Tuscaloosa I've

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.400 
it's great to be back in Tuscaloosa I've
let<00:00:17.790> it<00:00:17.820> slip<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.150> lot<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.599> Legion<00:00:18.900> Field<00:00:19.110> but

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
let it slip a lot the Legion Field but

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.439 
let it slip a lot the Legion Field but
if<00:00:19.529> that's<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.040> new<00:00:20.279> thing<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.420> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
if that's the new thing about it but I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
if that's the new thing about it but I
think<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.199> more<00:00:22.680> or<00:00:22.770> less<00:00:22.800> exciting<00:00:23.400> for

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
think it's a more or less exciting for

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
think it's a more or less exciting for
the<00:00:23.609> fans<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.119> exciting<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> players<00:00:25.019> I

the fans and exciting for the players I

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.019

here's<00:03:12.780> something<00:03:13.200> new<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.440> think<00:03:13.800> with<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
here's something new I think with the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.590 
here's something new I think with the
kids<00:03:14.370> because<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:14.730> holding<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.060> group<00:03:15.269> kids

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
kids because it's holding you group kids

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.949 
kids because it's holding you group kids
you<00:03:16.050> know<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.170> mean<00:03:17.269> most<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.420> those<00:03:18.540> kids<00:03:18.750> have

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you know I mean most of those kids have

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.660 
you know I mean most of those kids have
been<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.140> part<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.040> know<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.370> they've

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
been a part of it you know and they've

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.120 
been a part of it you know and they've
been<00:03:20.850> there<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.329> had<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.320> chance<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.799> be<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> part

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
been there and had a chance to be a part

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.949 
been there and had a chance to be a part
of<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.640> think<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.000> big<00:03:24.180> thing<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.420> it's

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
of it but I think the big thing is it's

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.449 
of it but I think the big thing is it's
going<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.200> change<00:03:25.230> every<00:03:25.709> year<00:03:25.739> your<00:03:26.220> kids

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
going to change every year your kids

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.520 
going to change every year your kids
chemistry<00:03:26.970> changed<00:03:27.360> personality<00:03:28.019> changes<00:03:28.380> so

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
chemistry changed personality changes so

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.870 
chemistry changed personality changes so
it<00:03:28.650> makes<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.010> little<00:03:29.100> bit<00:03:29.280> tougher<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.730> get

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
it makes it a little bit tougher to get

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.850 
it makes it a little bit tougher to get
there<00:03:30.120> every<00:03:30.810> year<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.230> know<00:03:31.320> people<00:03:31.709> talk
