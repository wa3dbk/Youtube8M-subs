00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.269
 topic 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 cold and blizzard and you can see neither damn nor 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.490
 damn it is not clear everywhere people are dying 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.779
 bullets projectiles fly from everywhere and where 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.289
 anywhere from that bank of the river they plant mg-42 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.119
 and the mortars ice from plowed it that tank not 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.420
 just to walk 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.040
 seemingly all end of the rocket are boiled with 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.730
 the sky and from the earth in response break out 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.190
 pillars of snow dirt and meat falling asleep fallen 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.500
 and living of the last forces fighting people 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.320
 squeezed into a corner because to go already 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.960
 just nowhere with a wild cry 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.180
 flank rushing allied infantry squad 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.520
 burr flamethrowers beat bottles with 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 Molotov and Germans wildly screaming throw 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.770
 wounded and dead retreat headlong 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.100
 without looking at for as if not to return 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 all the victory here he is in your hands 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 traces it faster than wanted and erases 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.210
 mute 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.049
 and the Germans will return after new because you 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.930
 did not have time 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.060
 did not dodavil with what to return the unknown 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 may again from the last forces have 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.299
 teeth to tear and howl hold just 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.659
 because there is nothing left 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.659
 need to win 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 company of heroes 2 ladies and gentlemen 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.520
 beta abode more despair good 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.920
 welcome to it now seems like this 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.140
 the distant 2006 relic company 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.090
 back in heat, the light rolled out first 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.460
 part of your own or this company of heroes 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.259
 only 6 years have passed the first part of it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.970
 time left two additions set 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.310
 mods for a while even existed 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.680
 company of heroes online more at night 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.939
 not among us boring and therefore the second 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.920
 the part itself is highly rated on 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.899
 metacritic ortiz now vodka i'm not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.450
 controversial statement was okay second 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.880
 the part is just a cool ortis releasing 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.189
 sega should immediately say that the game is something 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 pleased with something saddened example 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.549
 all gameplay innovations are extremely 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.380
 deliver but recycled 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.930
 the interface is poor but 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.849
 let 's stand out in order 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 innovation is the effect of weather 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.670
 namely low temperature infantry 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.319
 breaking through drifts dead 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.390
 in open spaces snowfall 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.489
 reduces visibility to a minimum orico 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
 one big potential aqua coffin 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.940
 the lid which slams skillfully 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.530
 piled burst pack or crazy 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.150
 mortar projectile to breach his 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.489
 delicious crisp ice under multi-ton 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.930
 by cars but other than that while playing on 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.760
 battlefield can randomly 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.830
 burst blizzard is a natural phenomenon 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.569
 makes the arrival of Ukraine helpless and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.580
 often in such moments the game is like 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.470
 both sides freeze trying to save 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.810
 soldier from death and a few short 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.280
 moments there is a lull which 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.069
 then it turns into earthly hell 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.480
 especially if your team bulls if 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.400
 there is such a person you then be 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.900
 ready to fight on two fronts and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.600
 in no case let him 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.080
 mortar-gunners especially 120 mm 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.030
 because in general why can you see 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.250
 in the recording of our broadcast zbt 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.410
 she on site there bulls us this saw 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.390
 I killed and then I bought Katyushas and in general 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.450
 horror and what was before layde anyway 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.370
 beautiful even well for you probably yes and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.720
 here for the already played in the last part on 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.549
 first look at and introduction can 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.830
 seem strange though in fact 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.959
 they make the game much more sudden 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.579
 and dynamic 1 blizzard can play 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.049
 the key role of the battle is to ensure 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.799
 long-awaited losing side 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.930
 respite 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.489
 and then unexpected comeback exactly 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.049
 how can she cause loss 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.000
 a few forgotten on the edge of the card 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.310
 mortar that is extremely unpleasant for 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.320
 you and very useful for the enemy no less 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.970
 important review system soldiers 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.250
 no longer see what is behind 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.870
 obstacles above their growth it means that 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.730
 you can hide behind these barriers 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.290
 just watch over and enemy 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.570
 sniper overlooking the firing position 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.609
 a squad of engineers sitting in a pair of bushes 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.829
 you will understand what I am talking about 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.720
 convey all the despair that 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.150
 experiencing taking to the base beaten 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.739
 a veteran tiger with three stars suddenly 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.720
 it turns out that here is behind this building 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.100
 stood and waited for you issue 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.900
 but here again, it's not just about 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.060
 the opportunity to lead almost 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.859
 guerrilla war any obri it 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.340
 the nest can turn into a deep 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.500
 crater 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.540
 and all that you hid just disappear 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.670
 after a powerful artud and so after 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.319
 even more successful in the plumbing in 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.480
 people always need to enter 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.370
 in addition, the mass should be considered 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.109
 new fichechek so now soldiers can 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.180
 use a moving technique like 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.250
 cover jump over fences and 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.050
 sandbags but for some reason not yet 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.470
 if you do not say that you need to jump 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.810
 run away 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.030
 minefields and barbed wire work 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.770
 and now it looks like they should be alone 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.570
 the surviving engineer will build bunkers and 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.610
 barriers where much longer than full 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.770
 squad tanks learned to include reverse yes 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.690
 and generally open yourself a new less like 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.550
 and all the other units by the way each 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.050
 experience meter or experience meter appeared 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.060
 which shows how much is left 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.020
 enhance after which the combat capability 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.820
 detachment increases 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.930
 so after getting one squad star 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.820
 may open additional 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.770
 veteran skill with a second star 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.210
 he will become more tenacious still abandoned 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.280
 enemy vehicles can be captured 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.320
 repair and return the fight but already on 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.150
 your side resource points now 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.979
 bring him no fuel but also 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.909
 can be improved to specific 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.770
 to the wish of the player 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.450
 by the way the capture of these very points now 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.550
 produced in a small radius from not 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.500
 that is, the squad is an exciting point more 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.599
 not helpless abandoned meat 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.340
 at the mercy of a machine gun and also very 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.229
 pleased with the detailed statistics after 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.880
 Battle there can be Glen who what orders 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.070
 water at what minute how many 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.960
 when was the units of which they are all a hundred or 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.150
 how many people were killed and also all this 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.919
 and in the charts but we will not look 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.510
 it will be enough 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.419
 something bad must be something bad 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.940
 the friend just wasn't there but the interface became 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.280
 more coarsely we drawn and voices and 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.870
 unit replicas are far from this standard 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.880
 that passed the first part is some 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.110
 subjective too cons at all possible 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.070
 it would not mention anything else 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.659
 some kind of artificial intelligence 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.700
 intelligence needs to be improved 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.680
 you're drunk on artificial intelligence 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.810
 bore us like children just go this 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.510
 there were only two lungs and one 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.640
 standard you miss me no he a little 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.890
 lightweight comp is not balanced and why are you 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.900
 makes experts and by the way about 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.430
 balance it would also tweak a little bit 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.320
 although by and large it is also possible 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.630
 write off on beta in general before us 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.700
 You do not see vashpe minuses to in 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.430
 Generally if you are deft loving life cancer 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.669
 the game goat's out is not quite though not so 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.890
 the game is not for you at all for us company 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.810
 starcraft on normal and gibling hordes 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.300
 rolling on enemies for all why 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.630
 all from the fact that too much of this as 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.419
 him 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.490
 well micro control up it's impossible to get along 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.409
 kontrolom and a click of the mouse in this 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.360
 If your troops go somewhere 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.550
 wander into the trap will get bream 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.589
 ingloriously die here must be right here 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.950
 literally manage virtually 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:36.440
 each unit 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.300
 zagazhivat captured by names and all 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.490
 other obstacles to the advancement of the enemy 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.530
 follow to tanks stood frontal armor 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.240
 to the enemy to sniper by dragonfly 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.430
 did not shoot then crucified because 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.100
 mortars on their own did not beat the squad mobile 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.470
 switch weapons on constantly 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.480
 push hire send send no 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.110
 stick in general very stressful such 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.970
 game process 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.530
 why of course after winning 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.570
 pleasure is simply unimaginable 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.160
 huge amount altogether though for 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.530
 casuals have niches at least for 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.540
 I found it myself and this is artillery 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.610
 stand in their rear and herach them through 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.320
 half a map on points Katyusha my dick yelling 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.300
 true with the appearance of something 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.370
 enemy near you that is to the minus and 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.170
 you can write hardcore the whole process 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.560
 games well because it is far from 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.020
 of all 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.020
 but it is worth being drawn in and there are no cons
