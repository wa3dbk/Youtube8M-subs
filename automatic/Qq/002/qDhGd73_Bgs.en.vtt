okay<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.269> step<00:00:10.230> number<00:00:10.260> four<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
okay and this is step number four of the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.419 
okay and this is step number four of the
hello<00:00:12.240> editing<00:00:12.570> process<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.860> step<00:00:14.219> we're

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
hello editing process in this step we're

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.070 
hello editing process in this step we're
actually<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.880> be<00:00:15.000> editing<00:00:15.420> up<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
actually going to be editing up the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720 
actually going to be editing up the
surface<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.529> makes<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.949> grass<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.550> then

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
surface that makes the grass and then

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.450 
surface that makes the grass and then
the<00:00:17.789> surrounding<00:00:19.010> borders<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.189> cliffs

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the surrounding borders of the cliffs

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.490 
the surrounding borders of the cliffs
that<00:00:20.580> were<00:00:20.760> not<00:00:20.910> raised<00:00:21.180> before<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.410> we're

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
that were not raised before so we're

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.740 
that were not raised before so we're
going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.680> want<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.890> make<00:00:23.789> sure<00:00:23.850> our<00:00:24.029> box<00:00:24.600> is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
going to want to make sure our box is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.230 
going to want to make sure our box is
stuck<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.140> our<00:00:25.260> skybox<00:00:25.939> we're<00:00:26.939> gonna<00:00:27.029> go

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
stuck with our skybox we're gonna go

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.339 
stuck with our skybox we're gonna go
back<00:00:27.390> into<00:00:27.630> editable<00:00:28.050> edit<00:00:28.590> mesh<00:00:28.949> mode<00:00:29.250> and

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
back into editable edit mesh mode and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.370 
back into editable edit mesh mode and
we're<00:00:31.349> gonna<00:00:31.439> select<00:00:31.920> by<00:00:32.309> vertex<00:00:33.079> now<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.140> want

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
we're gonna select by vertex now we want

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.010 
we're gonna select by vertex now we want
to<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.530> able<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.250> bitmap<00:00:35.610> that's

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
to be able to see the bitmap that's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.840 
to be able to see the bitmap that's
applied<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.260> surface<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.520> are<00:00:38.579> going

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
applied to the surface so we are going

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.290 
applied to the surface so we are going
to<00:00:39.079> turn<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.620> toggle<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.879> show<00:00:42.059> end

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
to turn the toggle on for show end

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.250 
to turn the toggle on for show end
result<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> second<00:00:44.280> icon<00:00:44.789> over

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
result and that is the second icon over

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.190 
result and that is the second icon over
underneath<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.770> modifier<00:00:47.430> stack<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.140> we

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
underneath your modifier stack so now we

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.880 
underneath your modifier stack so now we
can<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:51.350> surface<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.500> been<00:00:52.680> applied

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
can see the surface that's been applied

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
can see the surface that's been applied
to<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.610> we're<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.960> ahead

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to this and we're just going to go ahead

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.710 
to this and we're just going to go ahead
and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.840 

move<00:00:59.500> up<00:00:59.770> the<00:01:01.080> vertices<00:01:02.080> that<00:01:02.550> make<00:01:03.550> up<00:01:03.700> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
move up the vertices that make up the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:02:25.830 
move up the vertices that make up the
cliff<00:01:04.059> area

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.449 

okay<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.590> once<00:02:26.739> you're<00:02:26.860> satisfied<00:02:26.980> with<00:02:27.280> that

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
okay and once you're satisfied with that

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.210 
okay and once you're satisfied with that
we're<00:02:27.849> going<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.270> pull<00:02:29.020> up<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> verticals<00:02:29.680> of

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
we're going to pull up the verticals of

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.120 
we're going to pull up the verticals of
the<00:02:30.340> vertices<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:31.140> make<00:02:32.140> up<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.620> grounds

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
the vertices that make up the grounds

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.250 
the vertices that make up the grounds
will<00:02:33.310> add<00:02:33.489> some<00:02:33.700> hills<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.120> here<00:02:34.360> we're<00:02:35.170> gonna

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
will add some hills in here we're gonna

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.580 
will add some hills in here we're gonna
stay<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.830> vertex<00:02:36.370> selection<00:02:36.610> mode<00:02:37.590> we're

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
stay in vertex selection mode we're

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.860 
stay in vertex selection mode we're
gonna<00:02:38.680> select<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.310> vertex<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.660> case

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
gonna select a vertex and in this case

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.250 
gonna select a vertex and in this case
we<00:02:41.050> do<00:02:41.319> want<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.890> more<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.000> hill<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.569> not<00:02:44.050> so

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
we do want a more of a hill and not so

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.350 
we do want a more of a hill and not so
much<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.680> sharp<00:02:44.980> edge<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:46.150> we're<00:02:46.239> gonna

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
much a sharp edge on it so we're gonna

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.740 
much a sharp edge on it so we're gonna
go<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.599> soft<00:02:47.200> selection<00:02:48.239> turn<00:02:49.239> on<00:02:49.450> soft

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
go to soft selection turn on soft

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.390 
go to soft selection turn on soft
selection<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:51.720> turn<00:02:52.720> up<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.019> fall<00:02:53.260> up<00:02:53.470> or<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
selection and turn up the fall up or the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:05.089 
selection and turn up the fall up or the
fall<00:02:54.580> off

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.510 

and<00:03:05.640> we'll<00:03:05.730> turn<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.030> fall-off

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.830 

to<00:03:09.120> about<00:03:09.360> 700

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.440 

we're<00:03:16.290> going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.500> turn<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.770> pinch

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
we're going to turn the pinch

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.119 
we're going to turn the pinch
down<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.590> negative<00:03:20.099> point<00:03:20.910> 18<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.830> bubble

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
down to negative point 18 and the bubble

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:34.730 
down to negative point 18 and the bubble
up<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.610> point<00:03:24.030> 15

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.620 

and<00:03:34.980> then<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.580> select<00:03:35.880> one<00:03:36.090> vertical<00:03:36.510> at<00:03:36.600> a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
and then just select one vertical at a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.760 
and then just select one vertical at a
time<00:03:36.870> or<00:03:37.050> one<00:03:37.140> vertice<00:03:37.560> at<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> time<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.770> don't

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
time or one vertice at a time and don't

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.000 
time or one vertice at a time and don't
raise<00:03:40.980> them<00:03:41.160> up<00:03:41.310> too<00:03:41.520> extreme<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.830> can

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
raise them up too extreme and you can

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.590 
raise them up too extreme and you can
mess<00:03:44.130> around<00:03:44.160> with<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:45.030> fall-off<00:03:47.210> to<00:03:48.210> effect

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
mess around with the fall-off to effect

00:03:48.600 --> 00:04:34.780 
mess around with the fall-off to effect
fewer<00:03:50.030> vertices

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.970 

okay<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.720> once<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.110> are<00:04:36.260> satisfied<00:04:36.470> with<00:04:36.800> the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
okay and once you are satisfied with the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.530 
okay and once you are satisfied with the
Hills<00:04:37.220> we're<00:04:37.610> gonna<00:04:37.730> go<00:04:37.910> ahead<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.090> save<00:04:38.510> it

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
Hills we're gonna go ahead and save it

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.880 
Hills we're gonna go ahead and save it
at<00:04:38.750> this<00:04:38.870> point<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:43.460> we're<00:04:43.670> gonna<00:04:43.760> move<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.270> to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
at this point and we're gonna move on to

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.410 
at this point and we're gonna move on to
step<00:04:45.890> number<00:04:45.950> five<00:04:46.430> then<00:04:46.730> which<00:04:47.000> will<00:04:47.240> be

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
step number five then which will be

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.880 
step number five then which will be
actually<00:04:47.930> creating<00:04:48.500> very<00:04:49.220> simple<00:04:49.640> day
