00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 we have today 110 615 that no 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 they light 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.289
 let's see the power button yes no no 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.039
 there is no behavior at all 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:13.039
 we connect the charger 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.500
 shows that a consumption 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.930
 but they do not show me on the screen 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.930
 they do not load 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.490
 then if he showed me loading but not 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.500
 I could turn on the power button 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 he did not show that he is loading he does not understand 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.020
 with the battery we check the battery 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.750
 has 3.8 is ok battery is not charging 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.890
 it's not the phone is still not on 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.780
 now let's connect the source 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 feed and let's see it was consummated 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.330
 have if they have consumption before the button 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.460
 power there is an important short in the hour 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.010
 there we see that it is being fed 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.829
 with 4 volts 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.520
 and one shows me a consumption of 0.5 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.320
 amps or 4 500 milliamps then 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.600
 without hitting the powell button , it's already 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.310
 showing a consumption and when I heard it at 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.170
 power button does not show any 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.500
 behavior in the oscillation of the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.869
 needle then here we have a 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
 short in water what we proceed is to 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.830
 uncover what 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.830
 here is its entire casing 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.590
 and we will review disconnecting all 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.860
 the peripherals we do we go here to 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:41.380
 disconnect the flex load the camera 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.180
 the touch elias audio display and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.190
 let's see if he still has the same 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.410
 consumption if you do not have the same consumption 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.360
 any of these that we disconnect is the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.340
 cause of the failure and we would begin to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.500
 analyze which of them is but 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.770
 disconnect everything if you continue to consume 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.570
 same amperage which is in the work 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.780
 now let's disconnect the uar from there 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:06.670
 let's take it out and let's study it 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:10.149
 here to see what behavior is 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.700
 well here we see already is the temperature going 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.489
 in 45 degrees of this component of which 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.770
 more then everything that warms me 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.260
 wants to indicate is what 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.210
 happy e power in this case because 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.370
 we know that says the power always has 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.200
 a helper and close and has a series 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.840
 of big coils how are you high 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.150
 frequency around where which 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.160
 indicates each of its quality and sometimes 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.010
 they are berets that are accompanying 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.780
 leo circuits or reducers or elevators 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.330
 in some cases depending on the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.800
 internal configuration power list there 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.390
 we can analyze it 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.330
 we can see how a crack in 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.770
 helix which with this diagnosis I 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.860
 I can already from 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.810
 that is to say that the propeller failure power and 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.700
 I'm not going to solve this sheet 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.770
 I'm not going to do maintenance 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.290
 nor to review any other component 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.250
 because we see that the icp power as it is 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.170
 this cracked in several parts by the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.800
 half here also down here too 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.780
 is is I did power in some short 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.700
 that had some news many times 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.830
 customers usually let them fold 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.990
 that now is not loading in some 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.970
 moment that yes the phone overheated 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.770
 and the client did not realize 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.050
 he kept reheating a lot and he 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.170
 the temperature increased and it exploded in 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.030
 this case and already at this moment I have to 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.850
 get propeller power to power 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.500
 fix it at hand I do not have it in the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.240
 moment for which I already have the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.880
 diagnosis this phone does not have 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.070
 solution until it does not get propeller 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.690
 power service arauca technical service 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.500
