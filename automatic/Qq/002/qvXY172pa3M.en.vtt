00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but there's really nothing to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470

feature phones that don't have a qwerty
keyboard<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.230> missed

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
keyboard and I think that's a missed

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
keyboard and I think that's a missed
opportunity<00:00:58.530> people<00:00:59.280> who<00:00:59.520> want<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.850> phone
