00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
worked I did a video about how all these

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.539 
worked I did a video about how all these
bones<00:03:21.910> work<00:03:22.709> if<00:03:23.709> you're<00:03:23.889> not<00:03:24.010> sure<00:03:24.220> pair<00:03:24.459> and

bones work if you're not sure pair and

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.520 
bones work if you're not sure pair and
have<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.669> look<00:03:24.879> at<00:03:25.000> that

drawing<00:03:52.479> horses<00:03:53.280> I've<00:03:54.280> been<00:03:54.459> thinking<00:03:54.790> what

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
drawing horses I've been thinking what

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.619 
drawing horses I've been thinking what
shall<00:03:55.299> I<00:03:55.419> do

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
shall I do

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.830 
shall I do
here<00:03:57.030> I've<00:03:58.030> been<00:03:58.209> thinking<00:03:58.510> what<00:03:58.659> to

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
here I've been thinking what to

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.559 
here I've been thinking what to
illustrate<00:03:59.319> all<00:03:59.500> this<00:03:59.680> time<00:04:00.269> it's<00:04:01.269> gonna<00:04:01.419> be

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
illustrate all this time it's gonna be

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.710 
illustrate all this time it's gonna be
something<00:04:01.989> like<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:04.859> but<00:04:06.419> I'm<00:04:07.419> really

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
something like that but I'm really

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.260 
something like that but I'm really
uncomfortable<00:04:08.049> drawing<00:04:08.560> horses

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.570 

because<00:04:11.630> they're<00:04:11.870> really<00:04:12.250> kind<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.310> hard

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
because they're really kind of hard

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.979 
because they're really kind of hard
things<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.060> draw<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:16.130> I'm<00:04:16.280> going<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.580> kind<00:04:17.480> of

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.910 

maybe<00:04:20.989> make<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.650> little<00:04:22.100> bit<00:04:22.460> more<00:04:23.920> so

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
maybe make that a little bit more so

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.250 
maybe make that a little bit more so
this<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:28.210> mean<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:29.720> is<00:04:29.780> what<00:04:30.050> I<00:04:30.080> would

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
this is I mean that this is what I would

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.830 
this is I mean that this is what I would
do<00:04:30.590> if<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.890> was<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.340> illustration<00:04:32.300> I'd<00:04:32.480> say<00:04:32.660> this

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
do if I was to illustration I'd say this

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.700 
do if I was to illustration I'd say this
kind<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:33.850> it's<00:04:34.850> basic<00:04:35.830> kind<00:04:36.830> of<00:04:36.980> drawing<00:04:38.710> and

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
kind of it's basic kind of drawing and

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.110 
kind of it's basic kind of drawing and
then<00:04:40.010> I'm<00:04:40.160> going<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.460> put<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.610> light<00:04:40.850> box

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
then I'm going to put a light box

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.030 
then I'm going to put a light box
underneath<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:42.110> shined<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.560> light<00:04:42.590> through

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
underneath it shined the light through

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.480 
underneath it shined the light through
and<00:04:43.220> kind<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.430> trace<00:04:43.670> over<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.030> top<00:04:45.490> because

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
and kind of trace over the top because

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.780 
and kind of trace over the top because
that's<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.210> way<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.600> do<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:49.490> we're<00:04:49.670> gonna

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
that's the way I do it so we're gonna

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.940 
that's the way I do it so we're gonna
want<00:04:49.970> these<00:04:51.910> kind<00:04:52.910> of<00:04:52.970> main<00:04:53.210> coming<00:04:53.720> down<00:04:53.950> like

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
want these kind of main coming down like

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.430 
want these kind of main coming down like
that<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.340> then<00:04:55.760> we're<00:04:56.000> gonna<00:04:56.090> want<00:04:57.430> some<00:04:58.430> bits

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
that and then we're gonna want some bits

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.760 
that and then we're gonna want some bits
going<00:05:02.050> interesting<00:05:03.050> angles<00:05:03.970> like<00:05:04.970> that

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
going interesting angles like that

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.690 
going interesting angles like that
probably<00:05:06.770> want<00:05:06.890> mountains<00:05:07.490> in<00:05:07.670> the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
probably want mountains in the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:24.610 
probably want mountains in the
background<00:05:08.420> or<00:05:08.600> something<00:05:21.970> make<00:05:22.970> it<00:05:23.150> look<00:05:23.620> now

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
background or something make it look now

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.000 
background or something make it look now
I<00:05:24.650> think<00:05:26.080> because<00:05:27.080> it's<00:05:27.290> a<00:05:27.380> unicorn<00:05:27.770> I<00:05:27.860> can

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
I think because it's a unicorn I can

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.080 
I think because it's a unicorn I can
actually<00:05:28.250> draw<00:05:28.400> whatever<00:05:28.550> I<00:05:28.760> like<00:05:28.940> because

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
actually draw whatever I like because

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.050 
actually draw whatever I like because
you<00:05:29.330> know<00:05:29.390> there<00:05:29.840> is<00:05:29.930> no<00:05:30.080> such<00:05:30.290> thing<00:05:30.590> as<00:05:31.060> and
