00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
hmm that actually works for me it's an

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.080

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
easier commute to work from here it's so

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.500 
easier commute to work from here it's so
difficult<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.720> commute<00:02:31.140> alene<00:02:31.470> box<00:02:32.420> maybe<00:02:33.420> I

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
difficult to commute alene box maybe I

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.150 
difficult to commute alene box maybe I
could<00:02:33.750> build<00:02:33.870> up<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.170> fan<00:02:34.410> base<00:02:34.590> around<00:02:34.890> here

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
could build up a fan base around here

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.520 
could build up a fan base around here
for<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.489> while<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:36.060> that's<00:02:36.780> okay

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
for a while if that's okay

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.800 
for a while if that's okay
then<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.459> suppose<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.269> good<00:02:39.510> exercise

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
then I suppose this is a good exercise

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.180 
then I suppose this is a good exercise
to<00:02:40.080> get<00:02:40.440> sheep<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.920> goats<00:02:41.250> and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
to get sheep and goats and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.130 
to get sheep and goats and
you<00:02:43.190> would<00:02:43.370> oppose<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> hero<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.690> justice

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
you would oppose to a hero in of justice

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.370 
you would oppose to a hero in of justice
protecting<00:02:45.770> your<00:02:45.920> home<00:02:46.210> if<00:02:47.210> not<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.810> really

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
protecting your home if not that really

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.630 
protecting your home if not that really
this<00:02:49.310> might<00:02:49.640> be<00:02:49.820> kind<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.210> fun<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:51.640> little

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
this might be kind of fun a little
