 sports 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.650
 important since we can reproduce

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.340
 to connect of course the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.110
 airpod headphones that are some of the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.590
 novelties that apple presented together with 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.590

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.849
 Click on the icon and quickly search 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.909
 local stations or search 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.069
 manually we can as we say pause 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.959
 the live production throw him a little bit 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.739

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.630
 80 percent smaller than the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.310
 traditional 30-pin connector also
