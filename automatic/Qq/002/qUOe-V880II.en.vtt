don't know on the on the screen here
this<00:01:44.649> looks<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:45.009> lot<00:01:45.190> better<00:01:45.610> than<00:01:46.420> on<00:01:46.750> the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
this looks a lot better than on the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.990 
this looks a lot better than on the
kodak<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.500> both<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.280> them<00:01:48.490> were<00:01:48.549> supposed<00:01:48.940> to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
kodak and both of them were supposed to

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.430 
kodak and both of them were supposed to
be<00:01:49.060> HD<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.560> not<00:01:51.100> sure<00:01:51.430> why<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.630> maybe<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
be HD so not sure why that is maybe the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.719 
be HD so not sure why that is maybe the
lens<00:01:53.680> or<00:01:53.950> whatnot<00:01:54.569> okay<00:01:55.569> so<00:01:57.000> come<00:01:58.000> back<00:01:58.179> in<00:01:58.679> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
lens or whatnot okay so come back in and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.410 
lens or whatnot okay so come back in and
i<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:01.750> that's<00:02:01.929> it<00:02:02.110> for<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:03.390> canon<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:04.990> i'll

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
i think that's it for the canon so i'll

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.530 
i think that's it for the canon so i'll
shut<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.630> okay<00:02:08.170> bye<00:02:08.350> back
