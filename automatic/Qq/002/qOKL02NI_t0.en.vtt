00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.259
 is 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.820
 with institutions 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.340
 of movement to take television out 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.590
 José Miguel Viñuela was created through 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.420
 social networks singular initiative 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.699
 best community shared that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 seeks to gather a million signatures with the 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.690
 goal of leaving the screen without 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.690
 national television animator of chile 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.300
 I believe that people are on television 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.520
 or in your own ai who is always 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.980
 evaluating there is someone who is always 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.010
 looking at it now after he is nice 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.929
 fun and that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.970
 they are enjoying it that wolves in 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.290
 Careful but other things you have 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.630
 real effects 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.100
 that there are people who do not seem not to me 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.880
 I would campaign against it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.660
 would lift that heavy Internet 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.260
 good is nice twitter makes the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.390
 people do not confirm because in the end the 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.550
 people have to listen to it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.470
 it may seem neither good nor bad is like 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.159
 if we saw signatures of each one I do not know 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.590
 how many would each one 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.679
 I believe that television needs a 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.789
 replacement is very drastic to get someone out 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.850
 of television and it seems strong to me 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.860
 an unnecessary bad band 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.009
 listen the jose quizanda has touched 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.850
 well the sweet part that has generally 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.850
 there was in his career 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.390
 the cybernetic group that claims 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.860
 take TVn's face off TVn 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.440
 has posters against the animator 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.080
 and even a pretty official statement 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.210
 striking we create self-determination 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.040
 of the peoples and the democratic order and 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.110
 institutionally in line with the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.520
 international law that's why we say 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.520
 just viñuelas 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.690
 I feel surprised with what you 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.990
 are you counting I had no idea that existed 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.930
 this movement when terrible pathetic 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.420
 I think it does not correspond so that very 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.190
 bad wave I had no idea of ​​existed 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.760
 this 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.430
 I do not think that all the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.520
 Negative things looks better to look for 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.440
 someone that if they want to get him to look 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.420
 someone to replace him but does 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.670
 a campaign to get someone out not 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.290
 I am totally I am a fan of my novel 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:55.770
 of the coupe s chat the cyber world 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.950
 nobody gives the face then it's like 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.760
 pick up days ask him to demand someone 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.530
 without messing about this movement 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.730
 social that the vineyard wants to 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.260
 tradition put together a million signatures 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.260
 like a joke that you think 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.470
 campaign led by ignacio gag more 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.720
 known in the cybernetic environment as 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.980
 the white fuck who tells us how 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.140
 why this particular is born 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.140
 initiative against the tvn animator 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.230
 good this movement a feeling a 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.550
 feeling of many citizens to 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.140
 through the page must be shared 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.850
 dotcom we made 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.570
 we wanted to collect one million signatures 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.570
 take out this driver 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.760
 so we 're hiding the signature on a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.409
 feeling is difficult to explain 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.849
 when things have to do with that 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.569
 with things that are from the most 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.569
 deep in our hearts 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.110
 movement that even has a song 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.050
 of the campaign interpreted by the singular 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.050
 national rapper pay attention and listen 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.210
 and someday this is going in car play from 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.210
 now only 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.470
 je 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.449
 I believe that citizenship is 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.729
 in this position because today 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.189
 the faces and figures have to 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.409
 committing to something is not necessary 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:51.020
 so much and the channel is having a bad time and 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.020
 I think I do not like listening 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.279
 total rejection of the internet 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.589
 I hear that it is very hard, I think that each 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:04.039
 one has to have his space his 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.039
 space on television 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.010
 remember that this is not the first time 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.810
 that josé miguel viñuela his object of 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.550
 ridicule and criticism through 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.160
 cyberspace a while ago 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.960
 some creatives of the network pointed out 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.750
 that the view of the animator caused 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.580
 cancer although it was used to 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.580
 torture the prisoners in Guantánamo 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.650
 and you hit the hour 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.620
 I have 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.330
 if laughter and not the one plus that has 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:53.110
 a lot of empathy from a lot of desire to 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.110
 listen to it 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.740
 télam always see I see him queen in the 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.740
 yellow 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.519
 Without a doubt, particular movement 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.309
 to remove from screen josé miguel 

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:12.529
 viñuela that clearly must be taken 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:14.629
 with humor to finish you so that 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:17.089
 say nothing do not come with tricks 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.459
 I prefer that I get smallpox before 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.529
 see again to hurt today grandfather leave 

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:23.059
 this animator on the floor Juan Pablo 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.189
 queraltó citizens are already fed up 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:26.989
 like not seeing a more apt animator tupac 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:31.359
 appears in the very first a third act 

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:31.359
 so now it will be that standard or
