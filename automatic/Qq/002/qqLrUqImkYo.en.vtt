00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
cut it off orange orange wires and you

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.480 
cut it off orange orange wires and you
connect<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.329> to<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.630> red<00:01:28.990> wire<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:30.430> goes

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
connect that to the red wire that goes

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.609 
connect that to the red wire that goes
to<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.240> fog<00:01:31.479> light<00:01:31.750> no<00:01:32.710> wires<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:35.409> this

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
to the fog light no wires that that this

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.990 
to the fog light no wires that that this
red<00:01:35.829> wire<00:01:36.009> connects<00:01:36.340> with<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:36.579> orange<00:01:36.820> one

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
red wire connects with this orange one

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.219 
red wire connects with this orange one
and<00:01:37.299> you<00:01:37.930> can<00:01:38.140> make<00:01:38.219> these<00:01:39.219> to<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.090> fog<00:01:40.329> light

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.319 

that's<00:01:49.710> pretty<00:01:49.920> much<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:52.909> that's<00:01:53.909> how<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
that's pretty much it that's how it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
that's pretty much it that's how it
sensing<00:01:54.780> painting<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.380> drag<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.070> wire<00:01:56.280> all

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
sensing painting you drag the wire all

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.389 
sensing painting you drag the wire all
the<00:01:56.700> way<00:01:56.789> down<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> cross<00:01:57.420> over<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:59.009> do

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the way down the cross over here and do

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.950 
the way down the cross over here and do
the<00:01:59.520> same<00:01:59.700> thing<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.210> side<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.630> connect

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the same thing on this side and connect

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.080 
the same thing on this side and connect
it<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.799> having<00:02:02.579> fog<00:02:02.850> lights

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it to this side and having fog lights

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.570 
it to this side and having fog lights
next<00:02:03.299> over
