00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.880 
Blake's lashes looked more full than
long<00:04:14.030> in<00:04:14.360> these<00:04:14.570> photos<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.170> decided<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.710> use

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
long in these photos so I decided to use

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.699 
long in these photos so I decided to use
false<00:04:16.250> eyelashes<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.080> these<00:04:18.080> are<00:04:18.200> just<00:04:18.380> short

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
false eyelashes and these are just short

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.430 
false eyelashes and these are just short
I<00:04:18.920> think<00:04:19.190> there<00:04:19.340> are<00:04:19.480> 747s<00:04:20.480> in<00:04:20.600> short<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.260> you

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
I think there are 747s in short and you

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.020 
I think there are 747s in short and you
want<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.650> apply<00:04:21.739> this<00:04:21.920> as<00:04:22.250> close<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.880> your<00:04:23.000> lash

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
want to apply this as close to your lash

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.060 
want to apply this as close to your lash
line<00:04:23.390> as<00:04:23.540> possible<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:24.110> like<00:04:24.530> to<00:04:24.680> use<00:04:24.800> tweezers

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
line as possible I like to use tweezers

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.010 
line as possible I like to use tweezers
when<00:04:25.460> applying<00:04:25.760> false<00:04:26.090> eyelashes<00:04:26.690> because<00:04:26.840> I

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
when applying false eyelashes because I

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.810 
when applying false eyelashes because I
just<00:04:27.320> feel<00:04:27.470> like<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.890> easiest<00:04:27.950> way<00:04:28.580> to

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
lips I'll be using two lipsticks for

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.840 
lips I'll be using two lipsticks for
this<00:05:29.600> look<00:05:29.960> both<00:05:30.320> by<00:05:30.530> Urban<00:05:30.830> Decay<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.610> first

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
this look both by Urban Decay the first

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.180 
this look both by Urban Decay the first
one<00:05:32.030> is<00:05:32.210> called<00:05:32.510> f<00:05:32.870> bomb<00:05:33.260> which<00:05:33.620> is<00:05:33.770> this<00:05:33.950> color

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
one is called f bomb which is this color

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.920 
one is called f bomb which is this color
and<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:34.760> think<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.180> if<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.390> leave<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.900> way

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
and I think that if you leave it the way

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.650 
and I think that if you leave it the way
it<00:05:36.050> looks<00:05:36.500> right<00:05:36.710> now<00:05:36.860> it<00:05:37.550> is<00:05:37.850> pretty<00:05:38.210> true<00:05:38.480> to

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
it looks right now it is pretty true to

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.840 
it looks right now it is pretty true to
her<00:05:38.810> color<00:05:39.080> but<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.740> felt<00:05:40.250> like<00:05:40.370> hers<00:05:40.610> had<00:05:40.820> a

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
her color but I felt like hers had a

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.780 
her color but I felt like hers had a
little<00:05:41.210> more<00:05:41.360> orange<00:05:41.600> so<00:05:41.900> I<00:05:41.930> decided<00:05:42.320> to<00:05:42.500> add

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
little more orange so I decided to add

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.150 
little more orange so I decided to add
bang<00:05:43.790> which<00:05:44.060> is<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.360> second<00:05:44.870> color<00:05:45.110> on<00:05:45.770> top<00:05:46.010> of

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
bang which is the second color on top of

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.770 
bang which is the second color on top of
it<00:05:46.250> so<00:05:46.280> it<00:05:46.460> kind<00:05:46.610> of<00:05:46.669> gives<00:05:46.790> it<00:05:47.060> that<00:05:47.090> orange

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
it so it kind of gives it that orange

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.590 
it so it kind of gives it that orange
--red<00:05:48.169> feel<00:05:48.470> so<00:05:48.830> once<00:05:49.790> you've<00:05:49.970> done<00:05:50.180> with<00:05:50.450> the

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
--red feel so once you've done with the

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.010 
--red feel so once you've done with the
lips<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:51.260> look<00:05:51.560> is<00:05:51.770> complete<00:05:52.190> I<00:05:52.840> always<00:05:53.840> like

to<00:05:54.169> clean<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:54.560> edges<00:05:54.710> using<00:05:55.220> a<00:05:55.580> concealer

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
to clean the edges using a concealer

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.550
