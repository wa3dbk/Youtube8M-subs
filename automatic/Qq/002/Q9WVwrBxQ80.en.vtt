00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.490
 when considering the houses of the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.959
 future has very clear preferences 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:14.330
 in my opinion I am small it is not enough to be 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:16.309
 small and smart is much better 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.310
 his vision of the future he has baptized 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.340
 as rotor house makes the small thing 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.010
 very efficient 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.080
 he designed a house of only 35 meters 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.130
 squares 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.439
 about the size of a garage 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.490
 of two places but that seem much more 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.520
 broad 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.680
 I have had a dear trick 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.840
 to make it look like the house has the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.470
 double square meters of those that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.260
 has really 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.690
 the colom trick and eliminated the spaces 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.700
 unusable as the lobby and fit 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.910
 the essential furniture within a 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.989
 rotating cylinder 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.700
 nobody had ever done something like that inside 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.020
 of the cylinder a small project 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.970
 bedroom a kitchen and a bathroom 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.940
 if you want to make the dinner selection in the 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.770
 kitchen take a nap selection in 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.980
 the bedroom and to take a shower 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.650
 choose in the bathroom 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.180
 It is the smallest big house in the world 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.610
 the service is in an area 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.200
 independent this and its components are 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.380
 a reflection of the soft shapes and 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.770
 fluid of corani cars 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.280
 all components and features 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.649
 of the rotor house are conscientiously 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.649
 sculpted around the human being 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.450
 a space that can be extended by adding 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.360
 more houses we can place another one over or 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.130
 on one side to create a great house 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.990
 with the rotor house is colÃ¡n and wait 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.479
 that your small house inspires great 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.490
 ideas and be an incentive for others 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.479
 designers dare with their own 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.630
 designs I'm convinced that a good 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.539
 design has a profound influence on 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.380
 those who inhabit it and that is the 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.290
 objective that I basically pursue that 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.610
 people are better than they are for 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.299
 the fact of living in places 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.299
 wonderful quiet and exemplary
