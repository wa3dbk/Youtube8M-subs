00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Churchill, Manitoba, the polar bear capital of the world 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 When you see polar bears sitting on the shores of Hudson Bay, you feel awe. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 They feel the impact of climate change. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 As temperatures increase in the world, we are seeing a decline in sea ice. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Polar bears rely on sea ice to survive. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.000
 The bear uses sea ice to reach its main source of food 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 In some cases, bears are used to build their holes. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 At the International Polar Preservation Organization, our mission is to rescue polar bears by saving their habitat from sea ice. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 The International Polar Preservation Organization has its headquarters here in Churchill 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 We are in town for public education of citizens 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 But most of our work is abroad in Tundra. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 [Do you see one?] [Where?] [Yes I see, it's far away!] 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 I approached the cart, this is what we call "love the cart" 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Once you get close to the polar bear and look at it, holding your breath is an amazing moment. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 One of the unique things you experience while trying to preserve the polar bear habitat 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.000
 That in many other species you can only build a fence around her home and warn people "forbidden entry here and forbidden to cut." 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Polar bears live on sea ice. 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.000
 If a fence is built around the ice, it does not matter, you will not save the ice fence, 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.000
 But people in the south can reduce carbon emissions and reduce their presence on the sea ice 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.000
 This in turn will help save the sea ice. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 So bringing all of this together visually to be explored by people themselves may be the solution 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I think Google Maps and Virtual Tour allow people to roam freely here 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 As if they were already here 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.500
 But they are still in the south, comfortable in their homes. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Frontiers North Adventures has provided us with a dedicated vehicle to meet our needs and objectives 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 It is used by the International Polar Preservation Organization as a mobile broadcasting studio 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 We are really happy to share our resources 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.500
 So that Polar Polar International can deliver its message from the Tundra region around Churchill to people around the world 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And awareness of the importance of better understanding the impacts of climate change on polar bears in the Arctic. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 We have a lot of awareness and education campaigns and one of the most important campaigns we are conducting now is Tundra Connections. 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.000
 So that students learn more about polar bears, prompting them to help and take action. 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.000
 This is the research vehicle used by all scientists and they travel all over and study polar bears 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.000
 Now, we want to show you something, there is a polar bear outside our window 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.000
 It's coming to greet you guys. 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.500
 Children are dazzled the first time they see the polar bear on the camera 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 "Look there's a polar bear!" Or are very excited 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.000
 It is really wonderful that we can bring this experience to them. 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.000
 How did you feel when you first saw the polar bear? 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.000
 I saw him from a distance and I was excited to see him 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.000
 But this is not comparable to the first time I actually dealt with the polar bear. 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.500
 Then you realize the size of his large shoulders 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 So, it was a very wonderful experience! 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Given the awareness of climate change and the possibility of the disappearance of this animal, in my opinion it may now lead people to the environment in which they live. 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.000
 The fact that this beautiful big white bear may disappear completely within 50-60 years 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.750
 The fact that polar bears are major species, at the top of the food chain. 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Without it, everything else collapses. 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.500
 It is a global issue. It is also difficult to solve easily. Its solution will require the participation of all. 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.500
 So we use the polar bear to get people excited about it 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 By making simple changes in their lives that must be made by everyone 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.000
 We owe it to our generation and future generations. 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.500
 Hello Churchill 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Hello World 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Walk around the tundra with polar bears on g.co/treks 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
