00:03:50.709 --> 00:04:08.049
 same final 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:10.640
 this all the time is not very long there and 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:15.010
 it is possible in one breath to create where these 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:20.739
 If you follow a clear plan to our 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.739

 finished oh let's go there we'll see 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:32.870
 there I feel that the ring there was delayed until 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.300
 and it became a bit annoying 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:41.539
 monotony small I did not say that 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:44.870

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.580
 the dynamics were easy to kill at first. 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.070
 of enemies. dodge him there 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.490
 defend themselves later like every skeleton 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.349
 everyone there bison or whatever else these 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.060
 the giants sent the kans punched 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.960
 count no longer defend not 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.099
 magical to unusual shield 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.750
