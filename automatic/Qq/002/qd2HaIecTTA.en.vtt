surely<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:04.769> transportable<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
surely some of that's transportable is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
surely some of that's transportable is
that<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.030> case<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.570> working<00:01:06.930> iPad<00:01:07.320> must

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that not the case like working iPad must

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.399 
that not the case like working iPad must
be<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.700> working<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.210> Star<00:01:09.510> Trek<00:01:09.540> pad<00:01:09.960> yes
