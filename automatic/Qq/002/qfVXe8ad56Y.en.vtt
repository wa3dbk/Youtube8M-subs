00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.859
 nine people i am the city to one 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.779
 new video marginal today it should be 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.639
 little bit around the world four singleplayer 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.200
 go and so should the elements of the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.940
 Multiplayer shares was straight 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.599
 now confirmed two days ago that 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.310
 also elements from the bad company 2 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.750
 single player should contain but there 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.699
 there is still no confirmation that could 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 Now you want to speculate wildly 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.439
 now not four times to the few facts 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.050
 this is already the stand of the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.630
 band four multiplayer in any one 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.329
 wise in the battlefield 4 single player 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.180
 of course, that will be transferred 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.890
 scott gameplay in set four scott das 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 yes , we have five people now 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.239
 singleplayer always had four we have 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.730
 yes in the gameplay a new complete 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.870
 was a donor in the fish gbagbo 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.820
 Gameplay and keeps you going for it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 of course, as a replacement was provided 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.719
 again in four ascot is and you could 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.949
 yes already partially see how the scott 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.420
 you act it is always four 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.930
 on the way there was not yet 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.570
 this alone run around one man army 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.719
 superheroes he toned these sets god 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.640
 exception 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.809
 in the beginning however in fischingen baku where one 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.129
 But this house alone is the only one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.720
 does not take too long after you are 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.510
 there consistently as a board on the way 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 just like they use gameplay consistently 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.189
 his three colleagues on the way 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.479
 yes and you can give such orders 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.400
 weekends from the fish in baku 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.770
 Gameplay with the helicopter where we are 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.479
 was a lot has forward and helicopter 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.430
 So then again this is a butchered 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.689
 example for it is still essential 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.640
 give more 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.119
 That's why it's what it is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.650
 it already has a thing and you should 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.000
 apparently also reusable possibilities 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.000
 then we should also flank 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.400
 can and old junk is not yet 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.040
 not so noticed break in gameplay 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.659
 anyway that was not allowed to be quite linear 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.979
 you just had that one away 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.200
 but the possibility was through 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.079
 this by just sliding down the jet 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 to trick the opponent, therefore 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.180
 To start, that 's a good one 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.579
 Beginning 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.840
 we come to the vehicles and weapons 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.159
 Although they have said again 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.780
 that mati vehicles can use 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.490
 Surprises but that you do not stop 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.229
 Every single vehicle is forced to 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.579
 one should say voluntarily 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.070
 also wants to take the vehicle or 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.350
 not vehicles already seen 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.810
 so buggy we had meanwhile baku 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.490
 Gameplay men like normal car and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.530
 we had angry gameplay 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.820
 this patrol boat you can already 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.250
 there is the antesten 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.770
 questionable is whether jets again or 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.610
 I come from Cologne 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.560
 they are determined 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.420
 but if you fly them yourself now 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.070
 can ghana or whatever 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.560
 keep battlefield 3 for example 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.510
 jet there I could only shoot that 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.070
 moment it was against the super epic 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.750
 but then it was somehow shortly afterwards 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.860
 was boring as only in there and sat 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.420
 shot and of course loving 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.670
 would like to fly himself 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.440
 let's see how they do it there and you 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.150
 there fechner selection option gets 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.680
 that one says funny anna his 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.270
 Do you want to fly and you will not 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.390
 Fly can take takes place in Ghana and 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.980
 we can fly the fly as hold 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.410
 six things that have to wait but the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.880
 time is still open but it would be 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.970
 already nice if I have the jetta yet 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.140
 once should fly itself and the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.700
 Vehicles should be quiet 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.920
 a bit more to the multiplayer enel 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.840
 eco 43 it was the jet with the so there 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.280
 there were two people in it that is in 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.580
 not multiplayer and that would be nice 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.990
 nice if the vehicles somehow too 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.790
 those of the multiplayer equal and not 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.160
 to be adjusted extra because if you are 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.360
 already say you want multiplayer elements 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.730
 has taken care so tolerated 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.440
 We still said that with a sitting patsche 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.580
 The freedom of decision should it 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.050
 give a little more 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.390
 probably now and forever 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.730
 but a few end soon 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.280
 freedom of choice has never been 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.500
 damaged replay value came over it 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.150
 think about a thing and 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.990
 divides the one now at what they play 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.060
 called that one now with 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.480
 sneaking through soundproofed weapons 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.000
 can 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.260
 that means a lot like I could mean 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.030
 simply adapt weapons that is 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.590
 maybe I'm off to mission 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.940
 state and menu where I can say then 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.360
 I am the one we hear and the one in the 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.920
 essays after unconfirmed tvo if one 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.540
 probably his weapons can adapt that 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.160
 hold yourself when you say something like that 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.420
 the teams sneak through 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.040
 You probably can not do that here 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.180
 Master overrides or so but also 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.340
 that you can really change something 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.810
 say water at the double sights 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.030
 Could they take them away or maybe 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.610
 I would prefer the weapon 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.800
 very nice and ultimately have 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.620
 we also battlelog you can 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.209
 always see the top right is supposed to be such 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.370
 probably also like the battlefield 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.260
 3 corp are running after one 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.680
 mission richard points like the coup 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.120
 then and they are then split up 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.400
 battlelog I compare who has us 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.290
 our points there 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.490
 I never did myself 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.979
 really interested in this 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.840
 basket points but now which determines 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.030
 First of all it will always be in life like that 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.740
 happy that the happy for the constantly 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.539
 bad but I would be too 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.190
 again if you want that 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.750
 could disable because it would me 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.490
 otherwise out of the game 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.650
 If I'm on a mission, that's enough 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.600
 once it works on the top right 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.550
 invitation to play the mission 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.729
 to top a score or after 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.440
 mission I'm just following story 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.000
 there is at once so our klose 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.840
 Points made up can only be third from 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.860
 a friend will do it again 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.660
 Try it when it happens for 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.300
 the layout is nonsense it can not 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.400
 be that I'm curious but missing 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.550
 probably that would be easy 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.020
 that could not fit well 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.669
 hopefully you will like it yourself 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.669
 at the next video also three people
