00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.779
 samsung condenser microphone 01 good 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.180
 Well, as you can see from the box this 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.500
 we bought it in amazon and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.090
 Well, as usual 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.279
 I will leave the description of the video or a 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.199
 link so you can buy it if you 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.310
 interesting and good you have to know by 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.110
 what this microphone has a value 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.260
 approximate of about 80 euros with shipping 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.480
 included 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.269
 good this microphone is a microphone 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.100
 usb capacitor this is a microphone 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.710
 study and the audio quality is going to be 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.620
 very good what the box contains 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.059
 The first is a small case that we 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.530
 will allow you to transport it to the truth 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.750
 that this is pretty good is going to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 Serve a lot to take it to 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.940
 save it and so on also has 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.350
 this small stand a support for 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.140
 tripod that we will also see 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.659
 then how do you have the legs by 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.060
 here are some small metal legs 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.490
 it seems they do not have very good 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.310
 quality but yes that the animals are 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.200
 quite solid when you touch them and 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.580
 you will see that they weigh and that they are good 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.979
 they easily support the weight of the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.810
 microphone over here we have also the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.759
 usb cable that will allow us to connect it to 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.530
 computer as well as manuals and 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.720
 introduction guide 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.840
 Finally, we have to take out of the box the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.330
 installation cd I want to tell you that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.920
 it is not essential that with connecting it 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.780
 the computer is enough but good 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.610
 that brings a program to record and others 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.680
 and finally here we have the microphone 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.140
 that I already tell you is excellent 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.640
 good quality and here we have a summary 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.640
 of everything the box brings here 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.530
 we have the microphone that weighs a lot 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.350
 here we have the tripod and this piece 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.450
 to also hold the tripod and nothing 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.450
 we have the usb cable and the case 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.740
 well, let's explain how the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.060
 microphone on your tripod 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.330
 here you have the tripod that I can 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.890
 say it's pretty solid that it's from 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.660
 steel is it hard and that although 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.300
 seem to have a sensitive appearance 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.370
 it is not and this little piece here 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.930
 so you have to remove it, it's worth it 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.390
 we can remove it by doing pressure 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.920
 ourselves with the finger or well as 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.290
 a coin or anything that we 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.780
 help to turn it is worth to remove it 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.030
 because simply a support a help 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.470
 which is here to place another 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.300
 type of tripods or whatever it is a 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.470
 adapter so we removed it because in 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.600
 this case we do not need to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.210
 use the standard support that brings 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.280
 this good microphone once we have 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.010
 removed already this piece we are going to screw 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.200
 the above the tripod is pretty 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.050
 simple vale goes with a thread 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.000
 screw the mohsén on the tripod and once 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.360
 that is castled we will simply have 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.740
 that turn a little this little hoop that 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.540
 have in the end we look towards 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.210
 down and it is as perpendicular 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.920
 to the ground in this way we can already 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.720
 place the microphone we will use as 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.180
 support and we're going to have to 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.170
 unscrew the microphone voucher edge 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.569
 here you can see how it is 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.640
 looking for the edge to be able to place it 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.200
 because it has a pretty subjection 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.239
 This is very good so that the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.270
 microphone fall out so we place it 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.010
 well and we support it on top of the stand and 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.690
 so we screw the piece that 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.060
 we just removed the rolled up 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.100
 new below and in this way we set 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.330
 the microphone completely the tripod and we 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.010
 We ensure that it will not fall to 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.900
 give a little blow a little touch or 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.430
 whatever this is well worth it is 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.260
 Pretty sure it's good that he's like that 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.160
 we could also place the micro 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.020
 even upside down 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.100
 they supported a foot or whatever and they 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.100
 I would endure without any problem 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.590
 well once we have mounted the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.420
 microphone on his tripod and we just 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.489
 it remains to connect it to the pc to be able 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.930
 use it so well then first thing 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.359
 obviously it is to remove these small 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.519
 clips these plastics that brings the 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.900
 usb cable to be able to extend it 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.730
 truth is that it is a fairly long cable 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.709
 and that in case we had to 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.170
 plug it in and be a little away from 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.159
 computer, we can connect it without 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.709
 no problem 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.049
 we will connect this end here in the 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.090
 micro and the usb end because the pc is 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.730
 fairly simple voucher is connected to 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.560
 here below as you can see and good without 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.510
 no problem would connect the other 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.200
 end to the pc let's see an example 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.320
 so you can see it more clearly 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.139
 we connect here the cable in the port 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.690
 usb as you can see here on the side 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.310
 let's plug it in and the micro is 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.710
 plug play would be ready to be 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.569
 used immediately 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.360
 I would also like to tell you about the 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.009
 tripod that as you can see you can 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.330
 move vale you can lower the micro and 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.880
 put it in the position that we most 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.680
 interest could be put almost upside down 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.900
 you can turn it you can put mouth 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.310
 above you can see how good that if 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.660
 we had a mic stand we could 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.580
 put it completely upside down as in 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.710
 the recording studios you can see 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.840
 that thanks to the thread can rotate on 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.460
 its own axis and good because it allows us 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.050
 this gives us many possibilities 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.490
 so we have a radio studio 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.770
 we have a recording studio 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.930
 in any type of audio recording 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.120
 so we can adapt the microphone to 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.410
 let us serve what I want to show in 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.509
 this part of the video is that once 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.849
 we connect you can see how the green led 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.830
 it turns on and already it means that it is 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.599
 available to use it is worth 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.560
 we would have to open any program 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:16.330
 audio and start using it myself 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.250
 personally to record the audio I've 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.389
 used the adobe audition program that 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.490
 is the one that I always use to 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.659
 this kind of thing but good that every 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.159
 one can use any vale 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.159
 you can use from the recorder 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.990
 windows audacity or any other type 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.980
 of program that allows us to edit the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.430
 audio or record it 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.290
 and nothing really the analysis of this 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.570
 microphone I can say that the quality of 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.520
 audio is very good and you will tell me 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.410
 I can not finish this analysis without 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.580
 do a test before the good audio 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.560
 Well, I want to tell you that you can be 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.420
 quiet because all this video has been 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.630
 entirely recorded with the microphone 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.790
 So, well, you know the quality 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.950
 that has more or less besides I'm going to 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.230
 leave below a small link to 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.550
 a video of a girl that I found by 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.100
 internet when I was looking 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.120
 information about this microphone and good 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.320
 because she behaves well this 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.140
 microphone also did an analysis 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.480
 although in English and well he sang a 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.460
 good song I sang enough you see that 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.830
 the girls upload their songs to youtube 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.360
 and I really liked it personally 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.010
 one of the ones that I saw and well I'm going to 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.590
 leave a link to your video if you want 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.050

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.180
 screen that you are seeing right now and 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.560
 there you can see it and really that you 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.640
 I recommend that you listen to it and you will see 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.020
 that the audio quality very good and 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.150
 Obviously the girl because she sings very well 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.700
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.470

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:41.129
 of this microphone we obviously have 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.930
 purchased to improve the quality of 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.759
 videos and then then let's hope that
