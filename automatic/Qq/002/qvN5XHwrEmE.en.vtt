I<00:00:14.620> finally<00:00:15.130> got<00:00:15.370> my<00:00:15.430> new<00:00:15.670> servos<00:00:16.150> ready<00:00:16.450> so<00:00:17.080> I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
I finally got my new servos ready so I

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.140 
I finally got my new servos ready so I
can<00:00:17.800> do<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.039> video<00:00:18.310> for<00:00:18.550> the<00:00:18.610> dual<00:00:18.789> steering

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
can do the video for the dual steering

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.140 
can do the video for the dual steering
servo<00:00:19.450> for<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.690> savage<00:00:20.080> flux<00:00:20.940> I'm<00:00:21.940> gonna

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
servo for a savage flux I'm gonna

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.850 
servo for a savage flux I'm gonna
waterproof<00:00:22.570> my<00:00:22.720> new<00:00:22.840> servo<00:00:23.199> for<00:00:23.380> my<00:00:23.470> ball<00:00:23.680> huh

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
waterproof my new servo for my ball huh

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.609 
waterproof my new servo for my ball huh
it's<00:00:24.520> pretty<00:00:24.730> simple<00:00:25.030> to<00:00:25.090> do<00:00:25.240> you<00:00:25.449> just<00:00:26.050> don't

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
it's pretty simple to do you just don't

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.400 
it's pretty simple to do you just don't
get<00:00:26.740> right<00:00:26.920> in<00:00:27.100> there<00:00:27.250> mm-hmm

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
get right in there mm-hmm

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.190 
get right in there mm-hmm
get<00:00:29.410> it<00:00:29.529> in<00:00:29.619> there<00:00:34.620> give<00:00:35.620> it<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:35.800> little<00:00:35.950> shake

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
get it in there give it a little shake

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.229 
get it in there give it a little shake
and<00:00:38.200> there<00:00:38.500> you<00:00:38.590> go

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and there you go

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.950 
and there you go
may<00:00:40.239> want<00:00:40.450> to<00:00:40.510> do<00:00:40.630> that<00:00:40.829> once<00:00:41.829> or<00:00:41.980> twice<00:00:42.160> I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
may want to do that once or twice I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.410 
may want to do that once or twice I
usually<00:00:43.960> do<00:00:44.050> it<00:00:44.140> twice<00:00:44.850> then<00:00:45.850> just<00:00:46.030> hang<00:00:46.180> it<00:00:46.329> on

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
usually do it twice then just hang it on

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.979 
usually do it twice then just hang it on
something<00:00:46.690> so<00:00:46.899> it<00:00:47.020> can<00:00:47.140> dry<00:00:48.540> all<00:00:49.540> you<00:00:49.750> need<00:00:49.899> to

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
something so it can dry all you need to

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.049 
something so it can dry all you need to
do<00:00:50.140> this<00:00:50.320> is<00:00:50.500> just<00:00:50.530> basically<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.370> second<00:00:51.820> set

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
do this is just basically a second set

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.350 
do this is just basically a second set
of<00:00:52.090> servo<00:00:52.510> saver<00:00:53.430> everything<00:00:54.430> made<00:00:55.030> by<00:00:55.180> each

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
of servo saver everything made by each

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.470 
of servo saver everything made by each
guy<00:00:55.660> just<00:00:56.440> bolts<00:00:56.739> right<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.180> I'll<00:00:58.180> put<00:00:58.360> the

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
guy just bolts right in I'll put the

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.810 
guy just bolts right in I'll put the
part<00:00:58.690> numbers<00:00:58.960> in<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.170> description

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
part numbers in the description

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.709 
part numbers in the description
one<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.000> things<00:01:01.120> you're<00:01:01.239> gonna<00:01:01.390> need<00:01:01.570> to

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
one of the things you're gonna need to

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.039 
one of the things you're gonna need to
do<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.379> radio<00:01:02.680> box<00:01:02.950> is<00:01:03.280> just<00:01:04.180> make<00:01:04.659> just<00:01:04.930> a

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
do to the radio box is just make just a

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.859 
do to the radio box is just make just a
little<00:01:05.260> notch<00:01:05.500> right<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:06.520> here<00:01:06.790> so<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:07.750> the

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
little notch right in here so that the

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.630 
little notch right in here so that the
wire<00:01:08.049> will<00:01:08.350> fit<00:01:08.560> through<00:01:08.770> easily<00:01:09.250> when<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.520> go

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
wire will fit through easily when you go

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:24.420 
wire will fit through easily when you go
to<00:01:09.700> slide<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.090> servo<00:01:10.420> in<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.920> used

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
to slide the servo in there I just used

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.730 
to slide the servo in there I just used
some<00:01:24.670> nitro<00:01:25.060> fuel<00:01:25.299> line<00:01:25.540> on<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.320> screws<00:01:26.560> to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
some nitro fuel line on the screws to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.190 
some nitro fuel line on the screws to
act<00:01:26.830> as<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.040> spacer<00:01:27.520> this<00:01:28.450> side<00:01:28.780> here<00:01:29.110> is

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
act as a spacer this side here is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.230 
act as a spacer this side here is
actually<00:01:29.560> where<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.920> throttle<00:01:30.700> servo<00:01:30.850> goes

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
actually where the throttle servo goes

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.770 
actually where the throttle servo goes
on<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.080> Nitro<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:34.330> go<00:01:34.420> ahead<00:01:34.540> and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
on and on the Nitro so just go ahead and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.870 
on and on the Nitro so just go ahead and
slide<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.530> little<00:01:36.369> bit<00:01:36.549> of<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.670> tight

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
slide that in a little bit of a tight

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.700 
slide that in a little bit of a tight
fit<00:01:36.909> when<00:01:37.330> it's<00:01:37.450> all<00:01:37.770> plastidip<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.530> then

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
fit when it's all plastidip and then

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.230 
fit when it's all plastidip and then
just<00:01:41.890> go<00:01:42.009> ahead<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.280> screw<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.729> now<00:01:43.180> you

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
just go ahead and screw it in now you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.429 
just go ahead and screw it in now you
don't<00:01:43.360> have<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.509> screw<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> servo<00:01:44.049> all<00:01:44.320> the

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
don't have to screw the servo all the

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.840 
don't have to screw the servo all the
way<00:01:44.530> down<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:44.920> there<00:01:45.040> because<00:01:45.280> your<00:01:45.430> mounting

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
way down in there because your mounting

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.670 
way down in there because your mounting
it<00:01:45.939> upside<00:01:46.210> down<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.990> mounting<00:01:47.320> plates<00:01:47.530> are

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
it upside down the mounting plates are

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.609 
it upside down the mounting plates are
really<00:01:48.070> up<00:01:48.189> here<00:01:48.549> but<00:01:49.420> those<00:01:49.570> that<00:01:50.049> nitro<00:01:50.380> fuel

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
really up here but those that nitro fuel

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.969 
really up here but those that nitro fuel
line<00:01:50.829> acts<00:01:51.130> as<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:52.229> stiffener<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.740> doesn't

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
line acts as a stiffener so it doesn't

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.160 
line acts as a stiffener so it doesn't
go<00:01:54.100> anywhere<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.790> for<00:01:55.150> inside<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.630> truck<00:01:55.869> all

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
go anywhere and for inside the truck all

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.859 
go anywhere and for inside the truck all
you<00:01:56.350> do<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:56.619> you<00:01:56.740> just<00:01:56.770> pop<00:01:57.070> this<00:01:57.340> part<00:01:57.640> out

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you do is you just pop this part out

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.060 
you do is you just pop this part out
then<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:58.960> just<00:01:59.110> put<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.380> new<00:01:59.500> servo<00:01:59.860> saver

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
then you just put the new servo saver

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.030 
then you just put the new servo saver
setup<00:02:00.579> in<00:02:00.759> there<00:02:01.570> it's<00:02:02.259> exactly<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.829> same

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
setup in there it's exactly the same

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.560 
setup in there it's exactly the same
like<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.520> set<00:02:03.670> up<00:02:03.700> with<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.970> part<00:02:04.180> numbers<00:02:04.420> in

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
like I set up with the part numbers in

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.219 
like I set up with the part numbers in
the<00:02:04.630> description

the<00:02:05.590> next<00:02:05.829> step<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.130> just<00:02:06.159> as<00:02:06.430> simple<00:02:06.729> as

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
the next step is just as simple as

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.469 
the next step is just as simple as
remount<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.659> Box<00:02:07.930> hooking<00:02:08.709> up<00:02:08.829> the<00:02:08.950> servos

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
remount in the Box hooking up the servos

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
using a YK bowl to your receiver

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.840 
using a YK bowl to your receiver
you<00:02:14.630> don't<00:02:14.870> need<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.200> have<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> special<00:02:15.850> reverse

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
you don't need to have a special reverse
