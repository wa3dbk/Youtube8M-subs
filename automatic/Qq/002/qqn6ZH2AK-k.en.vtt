00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.640 
there was one on the wall there last
time<00:01:32.180> think<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.200> time<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> idea<00:01:36.650> by

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
time think not this time so the idea by

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.899 
time think not this time so the idea by
the<00:01:37.680> looks<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.520> actually

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the looks of it there are actually

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.670 
the looks of it there are actually
tactics<00:01:39.360> doing<00:01:39.720> well<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.170> thing<00:01:40.470> it's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
tactics doing well in this thing it's

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.679 
tactics doing well in this thing it's
not<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.100> too<00:01:41.670> scary<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.240> safety<00:01:42.450> if

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
not just too scary for the safety if

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.690 
not just too scary for the safety if
there<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> way<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> playing<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.920> help<00:01:44.579> you

may lie about 12 or something and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.660 
may lie about 12 or something and
