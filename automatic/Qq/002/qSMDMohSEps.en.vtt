got a bit of a disaster on my hands
today<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.639> got<00:00:15.120> up<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.450> morning<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.049> was

any<00:00:21.990> old<00:00:22.199> pressure<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.460> shut<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> motor<00:00:24.000> off

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
any old pressure so I shut the motor off

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.420 
any old pressure so I shut the motor off
went<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.170> look<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.560> see<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.099> going

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
adapter where it screws on it blew the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.830 
adapter where it screws on it blew the

shouldn't<00:00:36.570> happen<00:00:37.340> I've<00:00:38.340> heard<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.760> people

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
shouldn't happen I've heard of people

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
shouldn't happen I've heard of people
who<00:00:39.540> said<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:40.020> had<00:00:40.590> problems<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
who said that they had problems in the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.860 
who said that they had problems in the
past<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:42.440> their<00:00:43.440> old<00:00:43.710> filter<00:00:43.980> adapter

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
past with their old filter adapter

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.510 
past with their old filter adapter
leaking<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> blown-out<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.280> cold

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
leaking on a blown-out and really cold

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.720 
leaking on a blown-out and really cold
weather<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.739> mind<00:00:50.039> that's<00:00:50.340> not

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
weather but in my mind that's not

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
weather but in my mind that's not
acceptable<00:00:51.149> engine<00:00:52.020> oil<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.829> lifeblood

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
acceptable engine oil is the lifeblood

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.950 
acceptable engine oil is the lifeblood
of<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.969> engine<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> should<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:56.960> that's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
of the engine and it should be that's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540 
of the engine and it should be that's
something<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.590> you're<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> make<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> part

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
something if you're going to make a part

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.970 
something if you're going to make a part
for<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:01.109> need<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.320> make<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.710> ride

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
for that you need to make one ride

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.650 
for that you need to make one ride
because<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.640> cost<00:01:02.850> somebody<00:01:03.090> hundreds

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
because you can cost somebody hundreds

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.810 
because you can cost somebody hundreds
of<00:01:03.780> dollars<00:01:04.199> even<00:01:05.159> thousands<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.760> dollars

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
of dollars even thousands of dollars

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.179 
of dollars even thousands of dollars
depending<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.810> engine<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.920> I'm<00:01:08.040> going

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
depending on your engine what I'm going

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
depending on your engine what I'm going
to<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> went<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> hardware<00:01:09.479> store<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to do I went to the hardware store I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.969 
to do I went to the hardware store I
picked<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.240> coupling<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.960> put<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
picked up just a coupling to put in the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.850 
picked up just a coupling to put in the
line<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> bypass<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.420> oil<00:01:15.570> filter<00:01:15.990> adapter<00:01:16.650> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
line to bypass my oil filter adapter I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
line to bypass my oil filter adapter I
think<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> problem<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
think I know what the problem is on the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.280 
think I know what the problem is on the
surface<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:19.580> MP<00:01:20.580> made<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.479> it's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
surface of it when MP made it it's it's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.980 
surface of it when MP made it it's it's
not<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:23.030> really<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.330> mind<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> good

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
not it's really in my mind not a good

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.469 
not it's really in my mind not a good
product<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:26.250> I'm<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.270> you

kind of a separate issue how to fix it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.899 
kind of a separate issue how to fix it
right<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.680> gonna<00:01:49.860> bypass<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
right now I'm just gonna bypass it and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
right now I'm just gonna bypass it and
get<00:01:51.360> around<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.049> need<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.740> an<00:01:52.860> oil<00:01:53.009> change

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
get around it I need to do an oil change

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.670 
get around it I need to do an oil change
anyway<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.180> I've<00:01:54.869> had<00:01:55.140> about<00:01:55.409> maybe

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
anyway it's a I've had about maybe

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.219 
anyway it's a I've had about maybe
thousand<00:01:56.460> miles<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.030> new<00:01:57.240> engine<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.960> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
thousand miles on this new engine so I
