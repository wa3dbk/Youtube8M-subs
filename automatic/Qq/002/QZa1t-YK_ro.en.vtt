00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
could have used tape for this part if

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.310 
could have used tape for this part if
you<00:01:50.700> wanted<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.570> when<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> apply<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> eye

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.490 
in my eyebrows like I normally would I
didn't<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.209> anything<00:02:12.660> special<00:02:13.110> or<00:02:13.200> different

didn't do anything special or different
to<00:02:13.620> them<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.790> applied<00:02:15.060> some<00:02:15.239> concealer

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.830 

now<00:03:07.950> I'm<00:03:08.130> taking<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.790> tulip<00:03:09.180> contour<00:03:09.660> brush

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
now I'm taking the tulip contour brush

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.620 
now I'm taking the tulip contour brush
and<00:03:10.170> I'm<00:03:10.320> going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.620> use<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.070> set<00:03:11.250> my<00:03:11.340> powder

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
and I'm going to use it to set my powder

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.760 
and I'm going to use it to set my powder
obviously<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.930> use<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.200> as<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.350> contour

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
obviously you can use it as a contour

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.740 
obviously you can use it as a contour
brush<00:03:13.950> as<00:03:14.130> well<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.240> don't<00:03:15.270> have<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.630> use

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
brush as well but you don't have to use

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
brush as well but you don't have to use
all<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.050> brushes<00:03:16.260> exactly<00:03:16.860> what<00:03:16.980> they're<00:03:17.130> for

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
all the brushes exactly what they're for

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.700 
all the brushes exactly what they're for
so<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:18.120> used<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.690> set<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.500> foundation

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
so I just used it to set my foundation

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.610 
so I just used it to set my foundation
and<00:03:20.490> now<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.030> applying<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.630> silver<00:03:22.380> glitter

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
and now I'm applying a silver glitter

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.680 
and now I'm applying a silver glitter

putting<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.380> lot<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.920> inner<00:03:26.070> corners<00:03:26.520> and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
putting a lot in the inner corners and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.310 
putting a lot in the inner corners and
then<00:03:26.850> I'm<00:03:26.940> just<00:03:27.090> dragging<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.630> out<00:03:27.840> towards

then I'm just dragging it out towards

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.490 
then I'm just dragging it out towards
