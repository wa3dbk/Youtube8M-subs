you're<00:00:08.790> not<00:00:08.910> American<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.780> would<00:00:09.960> be<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.320> herb

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070

on<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> regular<00:00:24.090> basis<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.380> example<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.949> is

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
on a regular basis for example this is

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.210 
on a regular basis for example this is
oregano<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.570> cement<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.410> chives<00:00:28.800> and

herbs that I want to grow in my
windowsill<00:00:35.340> herb<00:00:35.790> garden<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:37.020> can

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
windowsill herb garden and you can

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.770 
windowsill herb garden and you can
either<00:00:37.410> buy<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> herbs<00:00:38.190> already<00:00:38.730> growing<00:00:39.420> or

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
either buy the herbs already growing or

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.680 
either buy the herbs already growing or
you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.500> start<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:41.010> by<00:00:41.040> seed<00:00:41.219> yourself<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you can start them by seed yourself and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.569 
you can start them by seed yourself and
the<00:00:42.780> easiest<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.460> just

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the easiest way to do that is with just

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
the easiest way to do that is with just
a<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:44.940> seed<00:00:45.180> tray<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.469> use<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
a little seed tray and you just use a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.100 
a little seed tray and you just use a
little<00:00:47.010> bit<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.399> some<00:00:47.789> seed<00:00:48.059> starter<00:00:48.539> mix<00:00:48.570> with

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
little bit of some seed starter mix with

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.770 
little bit of some seed starter mix with
this<00:00:49.260> which<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.370> nice<00:00:50.579> mix<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this which is just a nice mix of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.520 
this which is just a nice mix of
vermiculite

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
vermiculite

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.520 
vermiculite
and<00:00:52.860> peat<00:00:53.340> moss<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.079> times<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> can

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and peat moss and a lot of times you can

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.529 
and peat moss and a lot of times you can
use<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:56.010> any<00:00:56.219> type<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.699> potting<00:00:57.090> soil<00:00:57.360> as

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
use just any type of a potting soil as

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.010 
use just any type of a potting soil as
well<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:58.440> even<00:00:58.739> sand<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.690> started

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
well or even sand and you just started

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.959 
well or even sand and you just started
in<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> trays<00:01:01.469> put<00:01:01.920> some<00:01:02.160> seeds<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.760> there

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
in the trays put some seeds in there

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.270 
in the trays put some seeds in there
keep<00:01:03.750> them<00:01:03.930> watered<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.619> don't<00:01:04.799> let<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.040> sit

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
keep them watered but don't let them sit

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.100 
keep them watered but don't let them sit
in<00:01:05.430> water<00:01:05.610> they'll<00:01:06.000> eventually<00:01:06.180> sprout<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
in water they'll eventually sprout and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
in water they'll eventually sprout and
you<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.799> take<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> strongest<00:01:08.729> plants<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you just take the strongest plants and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
you just take the strongest plants and
thin<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> smallest<00:01:10.439> ones<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.340> they

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
thin out the smallest ones and they

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.789 
thin out the smallest ones and they
eventually<00:01:12.000> grow<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> nice<00:01:13.200> mat<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
eventually grow and make a nice mat of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.679 
eventually grow and make a nice mat of
roots<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> turn<00:01:14.970> around<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.509> take

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
roots then you turn around and take

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.649 
roots then you turn around and take
those<00:01:16.320> roots<00:01:16.590> into<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> larger<00:01:17.369> container<00:01:17.790> so

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
those roots into a larger container so

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.929 
those roots into a larger container so
any<00:01:18.930> herb<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.530> grow<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> windowsill<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
any herb can grow on a windowsill but it

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.030 
any herb can grow on a windowsill but it
should<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> very<00:01:21.600> very<00:01:22.140> sunny<00:01:22.619> windowsill

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
should be a very very sunny windowsill

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
should be a very very sunny windowsill
because<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.520> need<00:01:23.700> lots<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.090> Sun<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.659> some

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
because they need lots of Sun and some

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
because they need lots of Sun and some
artificial<00:01:25.650> light<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.280> always<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.729> bonus<00:01:27.180> as

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
artificial light is always a bonus as

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
artificial light is always a bonus as
well<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> light<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.159> at

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
well because if you have a light on at

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
well because if you have a light on at
night<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:30.030> any<00:01:30.329> type<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:31.079> fluorescent<00:01:31.740> light

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
night or any type of a fluorescent light

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.859 
night or any type of a fluorescent light
or<00:01:32.220> any<00:01:32.400> type<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> light<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.509> them<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
or any type of light that's on them and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.810 
or any type of light that's on them and
the<00:01:34.409> night<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.829> during<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> day<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> give

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the night or during the day just to give

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
the night or during the day just to give
them<00:01:35.939> extra<00:01:36.320> light<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.740> always<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> good

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
them extra light it's always a good

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760 
them extra light it's always a good
thing<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.659> trim<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:40.590> off

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
thing and you can trim and take off

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
thing and you can trim and take off
