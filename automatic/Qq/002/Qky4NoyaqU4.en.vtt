00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
control it's a knobby but I don't know

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.029 
control it's a knobby but I don't know
if<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.430> hear<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
if you can hear this but it's got a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
if you can hear this but it's got a
click<00:00:59.520> setting<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:01.109> like

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
click setting on it not it's not like

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.709 
click setting on it not it's not like
the<00:01:01.530> shuttle<00:01:01.949> which<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.640> rotate<00:01:03.120> several

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the shuttle which you rotate several

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.020 
the shuttle which you rotate several
revolutions<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> completely<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
revolutions to get it completely on to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.469 
revolutions to get it completely on to
off<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.479> has<00:01:06.630> got<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.460> minimum<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.850> maximum

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
off this has got a minimum to maximum

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.240 
off this has got a minimum to maximum
looks<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.680> ten<00:01:11.159> or<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:13.250> denominations

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
looks like about ten or so denominations

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210 
looks like about ten or so denominations
or<00:01:14.540> clicks<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.810> between<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> senate<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.159> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
or clicks in between the senate so you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.630 
or clicks in between the senate so you
can<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.640> fine<00:01:18.119> tune<00:01:18.150> into<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.689> cast<00:01:19.640> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
can really fine tune into your cast this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.050 
can really fine tune into your cast this
reel<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.270> bone<00:01:21.930> stock<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.979> took<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
reel is bone stock I took it out of the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.649 
reel is bone stock I took it out of the
box<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.540> couple<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> hours<00:01:25.229> ago<00:01:26.299> what<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> have

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
box a couple of hours ago what I have

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
box a couple of hours ago what I have
done<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.290> put<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> line<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
done to it is put a line on it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.880 
done to it is put a line on it
it<00:01:29.909> came<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.360> four<00:01:30.689> brake<00:01:31.079> blocks<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it came with four brake blocks in it I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
it came with four brake blocks in it I
removed<00:01:32.490> two<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> brake<00:01:33.060> blocks<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.840> it's

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
removed two of the brake blocks so it's

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.880 
removed two of the brake blocks so it's
got<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.259> brake<00:01:34.470> blocks<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> bearings

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
got to brake blocks in the bearings

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.620 
got to brake blocks in the bearings
appeared<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.189> full<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.549> grease<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> took

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
appeared to be full of grease so I took

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.740 
appeared to be full of grease so I took
the<00:01:39.840> bearings<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.680> put<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.750> dome

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the bearings out I put them in a dome

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
the bearings out I put them in a dome
canister<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.470> lighter<00:01:43.710> fluid<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.520> 45

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
canister with lighter fluid for about 45

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.600 
canister with lighter fluid for about 45
minutes<00:01:45.740> cleaned<00:01:46.740> him<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:46.950> some<00:01:47.310> they're<00:01:47.490> not

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
minutes cleaned him out some they're not

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.100 
minutes cleaned him out some they're not
thoroughly<00:01:48.090> clean<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> did<00:01:48.750> clean<00:01:48.990> them

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
thoroughly clean but I did clean them

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.530 
thoroughly clean but I did clean them
dried<00:01:49.680> them<00:01:49.890> put<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> drop<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> red<00:01:51.030> rocket<00:01:51.420> all

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
dried them put a drop of red rocket all

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.440 
dried them put a drop of red rocket all
on<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.170> very<00:01:53.130> minimal<00:01:53.850> work<00:01:54.000> done<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
on them so very minimal work done to the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080 
on them so very minimal work done to the
bearings<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.320> were<00:01:55.579> they<00:01:56.579> had<00:01:56.759> grease

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
bearings but they were they had grease

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.219 
bearings but they were they had grease
and<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.509> would<00:01:57.689> barely<00:01:57.930> spend<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.600> that

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and it would barely spend so that that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.929 
and it would barely spend so that that
I've<00:02:01.380> done<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.369> basically<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
I've done but that's it it's basically a

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.929 
I've done but that's it it's basically a
bone<00:02:03.119> stock<00:02:03.329> wheel<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.729> brake<00:02:05.729> blocks

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
bone stock wheel to the for brake blocks

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.059 
bone stock wheel to the for brake blocks
removed<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.340> twenty<00:02:08.340> pound<00:02:08.580> test<00:02:10.009> Sakuma<00:02:11.009> for

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
removed and twenty pound test Sakuma for

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.479 
removed and twenty pound test Sakuma for
so<00:02:12.849> we're<00:02:13.090> gonna<00:02:13.180> see<00:02:13.450> what<00:02:13.480> you'll<00:02:13.749> do<00:02:13.930> again

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
so we're gonna see what you'll do again

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.520 
so we're gonna see what you'll do again
