00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
spotter we followed from this is your

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
way to move forward is that the answer I

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.660 
way to move forward is that the answer I
think<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:19.119> sport<00:00:19.450> has<00:00:19.810> moved<00:00:20.140> forward<00:00:20.670> from

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
think the sport has moved forward from

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.170 
think the sport has moved forward from
the<00:00:21.820> Lance<00:00:22.029> Armstrong<00:00:22.540> here<00:00:22.750> and<00:00:23.760> we're<00:00:24.760> we're

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
the Lance Armstrong here and we're we're

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.030 
the Lance Armstrong here and we're we're
a<00:00:25.210> testament<00:00:25.810> of<00:00:25.869> that<00:00:26.020> this<00:00:26.439> team<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:26.890> what

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
a testament of that this team and what

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.510 
a testament of that this team and what
we<00:00:27.160> achieved<00:00:27.460> last<00:00:27.640> year<00:00:28.029> I<00:00:28.350> think<00:00:29.520> what

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
we achieved last year I think what

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.729 
we achieved last year I think what
happens<00:00:30.940> now<00:00:31.240> with<00:00:31.720> all<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:32.050> information<00:00:32.290> and

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
happens now with all the information and

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.590 
happens now with all the information and
everything<00:00:33.059> obviously<00:00:34.059> that<00:00:34.210> happened<00:00:34.540> a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
everything obviously that happened a

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.799 
everything obviously that happened a
long<00:00:34.720> time<00:00:34.780> ago<00:00:35.140> all<00:00:35.379> this<00:00:35.500> stuff<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:36.809> think

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
long time ago all this stuff I think

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.880 
long time ago all this stuff I think
what<00:00:38.140> we<00:00:38.260> need<00:00:38.470> now<00:00:38.710> as<00:00:39.070> riders<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:39.850> we<00:00:40.090> need<00:00:40.890> we

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
what we need now as riders is we need we

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.310 
what we need now as riders is we need we
need<00:00:41.920> some<00:00:42.550> leadership<00:00:42.730> from<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:44.080> powers

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
need some leadership from the powers

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.829 
need some leadership from the powers
that<00:00:44.440> be<00:00:44.620> which<00:00:44.920> of<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.159> UCI<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:46.390> I<00:00:46.629> think

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
that be which of the UCI and I think

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.180 
that be which of the UCI and I think
they're<00:00:46.989> obviously<00:00:47.440> picking<00:00:47.800> up<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.040> pieces

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
they're obviously picking up the pieces

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.910 
they're obviously picking up the pieces
now<00:00:48.640> for<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.629> people<00:00:49.930> that<00:00:49.960> were<00:00:50.290> running<00:00:50.650> the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
now for the people that were running the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.160 
now for the people that were running the
UCI<00:00:51.220> 10<00:00:51.670> 15<00:00:52.059> years<00:00:52.300> ago<00:00:52.479> when<00:00:52.690> obviously<00:00:52.870> the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
UCI 10 15 years ago when obviously the

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.430 
UCI 10 15 years ago when obviously the
Lance<00:00:53.350> Armstrong<00:00:53.769> I<00:00:53.830> think<00:00:54.040> was<00:00:54.129> going<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.260> now

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
Lance Armstrong I think was going so now

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.610 
Lance Armstrong I think was going so now
it's<00:00:56.620> what<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.670> UCI<00:00:58.030> now<00:00:58.360> do<00:00:58.420> with<00:00:59.409> that

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
it's what the UCI now do with that

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.380 
it's what the UCI now do with that
information<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.430> everything<00:01:00.820> that's<00:01:01.030> been

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
information and everything that's been

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.090 
information and everything that's been
revealed<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.930> last<00:01:02.140> couple<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.650> weeks<00:01:02.710> and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
revealed the last couple of weeks and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.580 
revealed the last couple of weeks and
how<00:01:03.850> we<00:01:03.909> move<00:01:04.210> forward<00:01:04.420> even<00:01:04.839> further<00:01:05.049> now<00:01:05.379> as

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
how we move forward even further now as

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.440 
how we move forward even further now as
a<00:01:05.620> sport<00:01:06.010> but<00:01:06.250> in<00:01:06.340> terms<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.640> anti-doping<00:01:07.150> in

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
a sport but in terms of anti-doping in

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.539 
a sport but in terms of anti-doping in
that<00:01:07.630> I<00:01:07.840> think<00:01:08.650> we're<00:01:08.799> certainly<00:01:08.979> leading<00:01:09.460> the

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
that I think we're certainly leading the

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.910 
that I think we're certainly leading the
way<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:10.720> a<00:01:10.780> sport<00:01:12.119> certainly<00:01:13.470> more<00:01:14.470> so<00:01:14.530> than

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
way as a sport certainly more so than

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.850 
way as a sport certainly more so than
any<00:01:15.040> other<00:01:15.280> sport<00:01:15.580> really<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.240> think<00:01:16.450> we're

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
any other sport really and I think we're

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.860 
any other sport really and I think we're
you<00:01:17.860> know<00:01:17.920> we're<00:01:18.130> an<00:01:18.220> example<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.790> that<00:01:18.910> you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
you know we're an example of that you

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.140 
you know we're an example of that you
okay<00:01:20.080> taking<00:01:20.380> on<00:01:20.590> responsibilities<00:01:21.310> up<00:01:21.550> to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
okay taking on responsibilities up to

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.670 
okay taking on responsibilities up to
the<00:01:22.240> front<00:01:22.390> women<00:01:22.750> yeah<00:01:23.700> yeah<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.730> think<00:01:25.680> there

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
the front women yeah yeah I think there

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.230 
the front women yeah yeah I think there
is<00:01:28.410> people<00:01:29.410> get<00:01:29.590> very<00:01:29.740> kind<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.370> so<00:01:30.580> why<00:01:31.000> don't

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
is people get very kind of so why don't

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.230 
is people get very kind of so why don't
you<00:01:31.270> do<00:01:31.420> this<00:01:31.600> while<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:31.870> do<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.350> think<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
you do this while you do that I think it

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.550 
you do this while you do that I think it
would<00:01:34.330> be<00:01:34.420> very<00:01:34.570> easy<00:01:34.780> for<00:01:34.930> me<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.170> sit<00:01:35.530> here

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
would be very easy for me to sit here

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.980 
would be very easy for me to sit here
and<00:01:35.800> say<00:01:36.310> all<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> same<00:01:36.790> things<00:01:37.150> that<00:01:37.450> we

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
and say all the same things that we

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.380 
and say all the same things that we
heard<00:01:38.140> Lance<00:01:38.410> say<00:01:38.680> for<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:39.040> long<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:40.090> be<00:01:40.180> very

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
heard Lance say for so long and be very

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.480 
heard Lance say for so long and be very
convincing<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.260> and<00:01:41.830> I<00:01:41.920> think<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:42.220> it

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
convincing of that and I think it's it

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.390 
convincing of that and I think it's it
takes<00:01:42.970> more<00:01:43.270> than<00:01:43.330> just<00:01:43.540> words<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:45.190> takes

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
takes more than just words and it takes

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.180 
takes more than just words and it takes
actions<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.240> leading<00:01:47.230> by<00:01:47.260> example<00:01:47.950> on<00:01:47.980> that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
actions and leading by example on that

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.240 
actions and leading by example on that
and<00:01:48.580> I<00:01:49.180> think<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:50.050> this<00:01:50.260> day<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.560> age<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:51.010> think

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
and I think in this day and age I think

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
and I think in this day and age I think
that<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.610> going<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.910> go<00:01:52.030> much<00:01:52.360> further<00:01:52.830> than

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that is going to go much further than

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.530 
that is going to go much further than
them<00:01:55.840> polit<00:01:56.380> politically<00:01:57.130> been<00:01:57.540> fantastic

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
them polit politically been fantastic

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.000 
them polit politically been fantastic
and<00:01:58.720> saying<00:01:58.900> all<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.110> right<00:01:59.230> things<00:01:59.290> because

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
and saying all the right things because

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.170 
and saying all the right things because
you<00:02:00.100> can<00:02:00.159> say<00:02:00.400> all<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> thing<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.060> right

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
you can say all the thing the right

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.910 
you can say all the thing the right
things<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.750> blue<00:02:01.930> in<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.110> face<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.800> lot

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
things to you blue in the face and a lot

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.230 
things to you blue in the face and a lot
of<00:02:02.980> people<00:02:03.250> still<00:02:03.430> won't<00:02:03.610> believe<00:02:03.909> you

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
of people still won't believe you

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.970 
of people still won't believe you
so<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:05.020> think<00:02:05.110> it's<00:02:05.320> going<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.500> take<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.710> lot<00:02:05.950> more

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
so I think it's going to take a lot more

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.619 
so I think it's going to take a lot more
than<00:02:06.370> that<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.810> think<00:02:08.470> it's<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.629> long-term

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
than that and I think it's a long-term

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.330 
than that and I think it's a long-term
thing<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.319> isn't<00:02:11.680> something<00:02:12.040> that's<00:02:12.159> going

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
thing this isn't something that's going

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.140 
thing this isn't something that's going
to<00:02:12.400> be<00:02:12.459> fixed<00:02:12.790> overnight<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:14.909> think<00:02:15.909> the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
to be fixed overnight and I think the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.119 
to be fixed overnight and I think the
actions<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.720> team<00:02:16.959> have<00:02:17.110> taken<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.099> last

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
actions this team have taken in the last

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.940 
actions this team have taken in the last
few<00:02:18.550> months<00:02:18.989> are<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.290> things<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.709> are<00:02:20.799> going

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
few months are the things that are going

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.860 
few months are the things that are going
to<00:02:21.010> last<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.579> long<00:02:21.700> time<00:02:21.999> really<00:02:22.209> in<00:02:22.510> ten<00:02:22.719> years

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
to last a long time really in ten years

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.119 
to last a long time really in ten years
time<00:02:23.139> we'll<00:02:23.290> probably<00:02:23.409> we'll<00:02:23.650> look<00:02:23.769> back<00:02:23.920> at

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
time we'll probably we'll look back at

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:24.480 
time we'll probably we'll look back at
this

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
this

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.490 
this
God<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.820> sky<00:02:25.030> paved<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.480> way<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:26.470> think

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
God the sky paved the way and I think

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.200 
God the sky paved the way and I think
that's<00:02:26.860> that's<00:02:27.250> more<00:02:27.580> important<00:02:28.000> at<00:02:28.090> this

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
that's that's more important at this

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.990 
that's that's more important at this
stage<00:02:28.270> it's<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.080> long<00:02:29.290> haul<00:02:29.530> now<00:02:29.770> it's<00:02:30.070> not<00:02:30.310> some

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
stage it's a long haul now it's not some

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.550 
stage it's a long haul now it's not some
it's<00:02:31.180> just<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.570> flip<00:02:31.780> them<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.230> change

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
it's just going to flip them and change

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's just going to flip them and change
in<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.800> couple<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.100> days
