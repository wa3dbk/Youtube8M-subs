logical<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> layperson<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:22.110> from<00:00:22.259> a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
logical to the layperson but from a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.920 
logical to the layperson but from a
referees<00:00:22.830> viewpoint<00:00:23.450> expand<00:00:24.450> on<00:00:24.599> that<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:24.779> me

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
referees viewpoint expand on that for me

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
David yeah no I mean again in all of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.260 
David yeah no I mean again in all of
these<00:00:27.869> examples<00:00:28.259> that<00:00:28.919> that<00:00:29.130> we'll<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:30.090> is

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
these examples that that we'll see it is

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.150 
these examples that that we'll see it is
back<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.470> say<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.680> again<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
back to and I know we say it again and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.970 
back to and I know we say it again and
again<00:00:32.400> but<00:00:32.580> it<00:00:32.699> is<00:00:32.730> back<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.269> delivers<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.739> like

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
again but it is back to delivers so like

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
again but it is back to delivers so like
you<00:00:35.129> know<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> player<00:00:35.670> two<00:00:36.210> players<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.720> be

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you know a player two players can be

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.619 
you know a player two players can be
going<00:00:37.170> tackling<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.949> ball<00:00:38.220> and<00:00:39.030> their<00:00:39.210> legs

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
going tackling for a ball and their legs

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.299 
going tackling for a ball and their legs
can<00:00:39.840> get<00:00:39.989> entwined<00:00:40.470> and<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
can get entwined and that's not a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.640 
can get entwined and that's not a
deliberate<00:00:41.820> foot<00:00:42.090> trip<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.440> see

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
deliberate foot trip and but we will see

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.950 
deliberate foot trip and but we will see
some<00:00:43.860> examples<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.580> where<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.750> did

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
some examples here where they really did

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.899 
some examples here where they really did
they<00:00:46.170> certainly<00:00:46.680> are<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.309> let's<00:00:47.519> look<00:00:47.699> at<00:00:47.790> our

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
they certainly are but let's look at our

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.119 
they certainly are but let's look at our
first<00:00:48.150> example<00:00:48.330> that<00:00:48.659> yeah<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.979> you'd

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
first example that yeah I think you'd

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.350 
first example that yeah I think you'd
the<00:00:50.250> player<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.610> possession<00:00:50.790> here<00:00:51.239> was

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the player in possession here was

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
the player in possession here was
calling<00:00:51.690> infield<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.409> yeah<00:00:52.650> you<00:00:53.040> have<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
calling infield and yeah you have the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.100 
calling infield and yeah you have the
defending<00:00:53.729> player<00:00:53.760> who<00:00:54.210> puts<00:00:54.449> his<00:00:54.600> left<00:00:54.900> foot

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
defending player who puts his left foot

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.490 
defending player who puts his left foot
out<00:00:55.400> and<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.540> that's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.930> deliberate

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
out and you know that's a deliberate

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.640 
out and you know that's a deliberate
trip<00:00:59.010> there's<00:00:59.640> no<00:00:59.900> attempt<00:01:00.900> here<00:01:01.019> made<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> get

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
trip there's no attempt here made to get

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.859 
trip there's no attempt here made to get
a<00:01:01.710> hand<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.339> ball<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.790> it's<00:01:02.909> you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.690> it's

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
a hand on the ball so it's you know it's

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.820 
a hand on the ball so it's you know it's
a<00:01:04.049> deliberate<00:01:04.559> trip<00:01:06.140> yeah<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.500> coming

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
a deliberate trip yeah and then coming

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280 
a deliberate trip yeah and then coming
on<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.520> example<00:01:08.940> Marty<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
on to this example Marty we can see that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.880 
on to this example Marty we can see that
the<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.130> player<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.610> blue<00:01:11.820> they're<00:01:12.119> trying<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
the the player in blue they're trying to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
the the player in blue they're trying to
take<00:01:13.890> possession<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> ball<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.180> he's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
take possession of the ball and he's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.050 
take possession of the ball and he's
deliberately<00:01:16.110> hand<00:01:16.680> tripped<00:01:17.100> by<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
deliberately hand tripped by the the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
deliberately hand tripped by the the
player<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.450> green<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.200> again<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:20.010> it's<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
player in green so again it's it's a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.640 
player in green so again it's it's a
black<00:01:20.610> heart<00:01:20.850> offense<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> player<00:01:22.500> in

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
black heart offense that the player in

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.130 
black heart offense that the player in
green<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.400> making<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:24.000> genuine<00:01:24.510> attempt

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
green is is not making a genuine attempt

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.980 
green is is not making a genuine attempt
to<00:01:25.320> tackle<00:01:26.330> within<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> rules<00:01:27.660> of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> game

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
to tackle within the rules of the game

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.770 
to tackle within the rules of the game
so<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:28.950> we've<00:01:29.160> clearly<00:01:29.580> seen<00:01:29.780> deliberate

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so now we've clearly seen deliberate

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.870 
so now we've clearly seen deliberate
fouls<00:01:31.050> which<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.770> course<00:01:31.830> are<00:01:32.310> punished<00:01:32.670> by<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
fouls which of course are punished by a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
fouls which of course are punished by a
black<00:01:33.210> heart<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:34.320> what<00:01:34.470> about<00:01:34.680> accidental

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
black heart but what about accidental

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.990 
black heart but what about accidental
fouls

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
fouls

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.300 
fouls
what<00:01:36.120> about<00:01:36.240> non<00:01:36.660> deliberate<00:01:37.200> fouls<00:01:37.470> perhaps

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
what about non deliberate fouls perhaps

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.830 
what about non deliberate fouls perhaps
you<00:01:38.460> could<00:01:38.610> explain<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.390> would<00:01:39.660> be

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you could explain what these would be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710 
you could explain what these would be
David<00:01:40.230> yeah<00:01:40.950> absolutely<00:01:41.130> Marty<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.000> suppose<00:01:42.600> if

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
David yeah absolutely Marty I suppose if

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.470 
David yeah absolutely Marty I suppose if
we<00:01:42.840> look<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.380> clip<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:44.150> you<00:01:45.150> can<00:01:45.330> see

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
we look at this clip here you can see

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.560 
we look at this clip here you can see
that<00:01:45.659> both<00:01:45.990> players<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:47.000> 100%<00:01:48.000> with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
that both players are going 100% with

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.510 
that both players are going 100% with
the<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.260> ball<00:01:49.470> being<00:01:49.860> their<00:01:50.040> primary

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the with the ball being their primary

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.580 
the with the ball being their primary
focus<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.120> just<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.750> player<00:01:51.990> gets<00:01:52.290> there<00:01:52.560> on

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
focus and just one player gets there on

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.210 
focus and just one player gets there on
front<00:01:53.010> of<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> other<00:01:53.400> and<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.480> it<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> an

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
front of the other and so it is a an

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.430 
front of the other and so it is a an
accidental<00:01:56.970> foul<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.450> foul<00:01:57.659> nonetheless<00:01:57.930> and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
accidental foul a foul nonetheless and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.630 
accidental foul a foul nonetheless and
the<00:01:58.500> referees<00:01:58.830> positioning<00:01:59.400> here<00:01:59.520> is

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the referees positioning here is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.090 
the referees positioning here is
excellent<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:01.050> it's<00:02:01.260> not<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.860> not

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
excellent and but it's not it's not

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.430
