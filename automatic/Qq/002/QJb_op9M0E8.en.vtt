00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.750
 here came the third day of my pope not 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:11.429
 shooting this video yesterday grandfather do not let 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.960
 brewed exhaust pipe today I 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:20.140
 intend there still finished on paints 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:24.080
 air caps on and proceed to 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.730
 clear when cleaning old paint 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:32.110
 Well, the compartment will now demonstrate that 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.360
 there grandfather said own let's see 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.460
 Navara year as generally told 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.989
 hesitated the whole thing cooks because 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.239
 that the metal has turned into very thin 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.320
 since he explained what it is 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.739
 low part of the exhaust system and there 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.739
 time to pile up 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:01:02.630
 hole brewed and yesterday I still painted 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:04.280
 missing parts of the car here they are 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.880
 self-defense. 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.230
 decided to paint somehow an economizer that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.510
 I am not for what is called correctly 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.700
 very this thing on the carburetor 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.270
 here it is on some nondescript they 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.100
 beautifully two more pieces of iron were started 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:28.680
 before painting here, in principle, everything is so 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.350
 left now I will begin to collect 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.800
 quietly and cleaned the engine compartment 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.900
 space has already begun quietly 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:51.030
 remove various parts of the engine compartment 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:52.740
 clean bold now we will 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.710
 quietly everything else 5 in the spring 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:02.190
 clean so as not to interfere with regret 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:05.580
 it is drizzling . I hope that people do not 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.780
 will be all the same today I will do 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.350
 conceived because paint vozduhan 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.450
 I've already painted astrum like that sleep 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.640
 glitters but abashkina silverfish seems 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.890
 to light 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.360
 Now will once again go second 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.630
 a layer of sweat and a third fan gathered 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.870
 so some parts also assembled here 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.850
 while we are engaged podkapotka here 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.260
 I have now cleared this one a little 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.739
 halts 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:45.319
 try cleaning the wash while here 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.709
 jokingly we will try with us while on 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.000
 fight well the process has begun 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.099
 paint blows me another corner too 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.629
 here I did not defend anything at the request 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:01.280
 here, too, went see but it leads 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.180
 in those places where is any 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.260
 serious corrosion was the main paint 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.940
 on the president 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.400
 it is even good to stop everything and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.239
 it will be better to keep on top of the old 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.359
 paint new color so here so 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.879
 now cleared up all the better already 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.480
 metal 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:30.920
 that's how pretty 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:35.140
 these are the places I decided to ask for the thread yet 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.140
 yet there is no such silicone usually 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.420
 silicone and then on top I'll paint 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.030
 itâ€™s not just water to paint 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.940
 left and no longer cute here think 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:54.650
 patch to do the same as this all 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:58.190
 they asked for konig like that 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.049
 the fourth day of recording video I write 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.000
 did not like painting 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.569
 the other side and this too we must 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.360
 long and tedious 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.750
 I 'll show you the result right away 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.410
 what else have I done there a little bit it's me 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.470
 rubbed all the wires and washed the engine here 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.970
 so this color is well in the natural bit 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.710
 slightly darker 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:30.200
 just do not have the sun's engine wash 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:35.610
 how much was the box possible 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.590
 the wires from the steel cleaner there did not become 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.660
 steal because there is well and practically 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.870
 it is not visible and it is necessary not to crawl all 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.430
 shoot here started side too 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.760
 painted here put a patch for 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:55.560
 silicone that's all about silicone 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:58.020
 the paint began to tie it not very for 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.780
 now I can go a little sprinkle 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.550
 it is well and when I put everything because 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.790
 Now she will be hurt 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.560
 be selected even more now all this 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.770
 the case will be returned to its rightful 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.770
 place as well as what lies in the garage 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.050
 Here is the video that completes its 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.080
 parts all painted all delivered to 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.920
 place the engine and cooling system 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.510
 Best washed with distilled water 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.210
 In principle, everything is normal thermostat this 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.040
 the most work that is somewhere around 80 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.600
 degrees he 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.350
 opened and went on the lower pipe 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.800
 water all right machine now them 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:44.820
 grumbles everything works with wet ok 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.590
 now pour antifreeze now let 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:52.230
 the car so that it worked a little bit 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:55.160
 and then write the sound itself, you can then 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.080
 let's go ride this space 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.130
 with me there are two people who 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.880
 help absolutely this denis yo yo suddenly 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.490
 with a carpet well and that grandfather 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.100
 me and yawning buy this one 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.460
 brewed my pipe and helped you 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.010
 everything else is now dolim and 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.650
 start the engine you look like it 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:23.770
 has become rumbling 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.910
 everything is flooded we are ready to start now 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.610
 will shoot 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:34.000
 like this 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:38.199
 everything is painted everything is clean white white and 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.840
 what is missing washer reservoir I'll call 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.840
 set start 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:49.830
 the key to start the fan is blowing 3 2 1 a 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.639
 for a long time 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.159
 like that now he works quietly 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.770
 basically I think since the engine 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:11.120
 warmed up you can gas 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.120
 very much interest what the sound will be 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:19.050
 rr straight cool burchanie no important 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.030
 very nice 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.300
 no wonder the work done 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.510
 now everything will be fine hope 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.770
 now 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.460
 one washer 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:34.130
 he will run for a ride 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:37.660
 finally this series ends video 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.660
 good luck everyone all bye
