gun like I made in my which I've shown

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.709 
gun like I made in my which I've shown
how<00:01:34.219> to<00:01:34.280> make<00:01:34.520> before<00:01:34.789> in<00:01:35.240> other<00:01:35.390> videos<00:01:35.950> and

how to make before in other videos and

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.179 
how to make before in other videos and
attach<00:01:38.719> it<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:38.990> one<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.350> these<00:01:40.479> small<00:01:41.479> pieces

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
attach it to one of these small pieces

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.510 
attach it to one of these small pieces
the<00:01:43.189> hole<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.140> attach<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.439> like<00:01:45.649> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
battle droid arms can i just stuck them

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.630 
battle droid arms can i just stuck them
in<00:02:32.100> there<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.510> legs<00:02:36.780> aren't<00:02:37.140> wonderful<00:02:39.200> but

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
in there the legs aren't wonderful but

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.580 
in there the legs aren't wonderful but
it's<00:02:41.640> kind<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.090> hard<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.510> make<00:02:42.840> something<00:02:43.140> that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
it's kind of hard to make something that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.790 
it's kind of hard to make something that
looked<00:02:44.160> skinny<00:02:44.670> enough<00:02:44.880> for<00:02:45.240> him<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.680> was

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
looked skinny enough for him and it was

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.560 
looked skinny enough for him and it was
worked<00:02:47.250> really<00:02:47.490> well<00:02:47.610> too<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.300> might<00:02:48.420> have

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
worked really well too so you might have

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.360 
worked really well too so you might have
to<00:02:48.630> fiddle<00:02:49.020> around<00:02:49.170> with<00:02:49.500> those<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.770> little<00:02:50.130> bit

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
to fiddle around with those a little bit

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.860 
to fiddle around with those a little bit
especially<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.240> you're<00:02:51.360> trying<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.720> actually

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
especially if you're trying to actually

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.110 
especially if you're trying to actually
stand<00:02:52.320> him<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.820> on<00:02:53.820> like<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.610> ground<00:02:56.850> or

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
stand him up on like the ground or

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.970 
stand him up on like the ground or

before portal 2 came out so that was the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.009
