this car too has a mascot in the form of
a<00:00:58.130> garfield<00:00:58.610> we<00:00:58.760> call<00:00:58.940> mr.<00:00:59.270> grumpy<00:00:59.600> in<00:00:59.690> the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
a garfield we call mr. grumpy in the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.410 
a garfield we call mr. grumpy in the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.550 

we<00:01:05.420> wanted<00:01:05.780> something<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.110> little<00:01:06.140> bit<00:01:06.380> better

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560

than<00:01:06.770> standard<00:01:07.220> wheels<00:01:07.460> even<00:01:07.700> though<00:01:07.909> the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
than standard wheels even though the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.520 
than standard wheels even though the
idea<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.540> keep<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:08.869> car<00:01:09.020> relatively

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
idea is to keep the car relatively

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.770 
idea is to keep the car relatively
standard<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.640> we<00:01:10.760> found<00:01:11.030> some<00:01:11.240> speed<00:01:11.510> light

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
standard so we found some speed light

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.010 
standard so we found some speed light
wheels<00:01:12.050> that<00:01:12.409> are<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:14.090> era<00:01:14.330> although

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
wheels that are of the era although

they're<00:01:15.320> brand<00:01:15.560> new<00:01:16.210> once<00:01:17.210> again<00:01:17.479> we've<00:01:17.690> gone

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810
