rating<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.179> AMD<00:00:15.809> FX<00:00:16.049> 6300<00:00:16.920> processor<00:00:17.699> and

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
rating for my AMD FX 6300 processor and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.230 
rating for my AMD FX 6300 processor and
how<00:00:19.670> somehow<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.970> 6.2<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:23.180> personally<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
how somehow it's a 6.2 and personally I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
how somehow it's a 6.2 and personally I
think<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.720> processor<00:00:25.350> benchmark<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
think this processor benchmark is just a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.240 
think this processor benchmark is just a
load<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.519> crap<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:27.119> bunk<00:00:27.510> because<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.099> an

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
load of crap it's bunk because I have an

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.450 
load of crap it's bunk because I have an
AMD<00:00:29.550> APU<00:00:30.090> which<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> same<00:00:31.679> architecture

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
AMD APU which is the same architecture

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.569 
AMD APU which is the same architecture
has<00:00:33.030> four<00:00:33.510> cores<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:35.070> gets<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.340> 7.3<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
has four cores and it gets a 7.3 and

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.010 
has four cores and it gets a 7.3 and
it's<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> same<00:00:38.969> architecture<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.780> less

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
it's the same architecture just less

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's the same architecture just less
cores<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> less<00:00:40.620> cash<00:00:40.860> yeah<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.090> has<00:00:42.360> two

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
cores and less cash yeah this has two

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.860 
cores and less cash yeah this has two
more<00:00:43.110> cores<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:44.430> cache<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.629> gets<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
more cores and more cache and it gets a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
more cores and more cache and it gets a
lower<00:00:46.020> score<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:47.370> benchmark<00:00:47.700> makes

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
lower score this benchmark makes

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.760 
lower score this benchmark makes
absolutely<00:00:48.600> no<00:00:48.719> sense<00:00:49.100> not<00:00:50.100> only<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.610> but

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
absolutely no sense not only that but

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.819 
absolutely no sense not only that but
the<00:00:52.770> performance<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:54.949> AMD<00:00:55.949> FX<00:00:56.719> 6300

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
the performance of this AMD FX 6300

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.680 
the performance of this AMD FX 6300
falls<00:00:58.829> somewhere<00:00:59.250> between<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.789> core<00:01:00.090> i3<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
falls somewhere between a core i3 and a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.110 
falls somewhere between a core i3 and a
Core<00:01:00.899> i5<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> core<00:01:01.949> i3<00:01:02.100> scores<00:01:02.789> better

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
Core i5 and the core i3 scores better

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.910 
Core i5 and the core i3 scores better
than<00:01:03.329> 6.2<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:06.540> makes<00:01:07.110> no<00:01:07.380> sense<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.890> mean

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
than 6.2 so that makes no sense I mean

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.679 
than 6.2 so that makes no sense I mean
this<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> probably<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> reason<00:01:09.570> they're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
this is probably the reason they're

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.940 
this is probably the reason they're
getting<00:01:09.990> rid<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> windows<00:01:10.619> experience

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
getting rid of the windows experience

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.730 
getting rid of the windows experience
index<00:01:11.460> scores<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> Windows<00:01:12.330> 8.1<00:01:12.740> because

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
index scores and Windows 8.1 because

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
index scores and Windows 8.1 because
some<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> benchmarks<00:01:15.000> sometimes<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.570> don't

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
some the benchmarks sometimes just don't

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.080 
some the benchmarks sometimes just don't
make<00:01:15.869> any<00:01:16.020> sense<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.530> CPU<00:01:17.189> mark<00:01:17.460> would

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
make any sense I think CPU mark would

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.219 
make any sense I think CPU mark would
probably<00:01:18.509> give<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:19.049> accurate

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
probably give you more accurate

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.190 
probably give you more accurate
performance<00:01:19.830> result<00:01:20.369> than<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.700> does<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.869> for

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
performance result than this does so for

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
performance result than this does so for
those<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.799> those<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> who<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.340> looking

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
those for those of you who are looking

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.789 
those for those of you who are looking
at<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.820> 6.2<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.600> actually<00:01:25.080> believing<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
at this 6.2 and actually believing it I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.609 
at this 6.2 and actually believing it I
wouldn't<00:01:26.490> bother<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.619> after

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
wouldn't bother because I after

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.210 
wouldn't bother because I after
exporting<00:01:29.070> videos<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.119> exports

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
exporting videos with this it exports

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.810 
exporting videos with this it exports
but<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> tad<00:01:32.909> slower<00:01:33.420> than<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> i7<00:01:34.380> did

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
but just a tad slower than the i7 did

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.429 
but just a tad slower than the i7 did
but<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.909> still<00:01:36.119> exports<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:36.960> fast<00:01:37.200> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
but it still exports them really fast so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.460 
but it still exports them really fast so
the<00:01:37.530> performance<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.189> still<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:39.470> this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the performance is still there this

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
the performance is still there this
benchmark<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:42.360> doesn't<00:01:42.659> say

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
benchmark just is just doesn't say

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
benchmark just is just doesn't say
anything<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:44.479> yeah<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:46.200> listen<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> this

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
anything so yeah don't listen to this

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.940 
anything so yeah don't listen to this
benchmark<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.750> Dan<00:01:49.049> sum<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
benchmark so Dan sum it all up the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.399 
benchmark so Dan sum it all up the
processor<00:01:50.490> benchmark<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.390> Windows<00:01:52.110> gave

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
processor benchmark that Windows gave

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.859 
processor benchmark that Windows gave
this<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.340> bunk<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.000> makes<00:01:54.240> no<00:01:54.509> sense

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this one is just bunk it makes no sense

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.670 
this one is just bunk it makes no sense
and<00:01:55.399> isn't<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.520> accurate<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:57.299> all<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.689> in

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and isn't really accurate at all and in

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.899 
and isn't really accurate at all and in
the<00:01:58.740> comments<00:01:59.189> people<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.520> told<00:01:59.640> me<00:01:59.759> they

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the comments people have told me they

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.050 
the comments people have told me they
have<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.090> same<00:02:00.390> issue<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.829> they<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
have the same issue that they get a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.490 
have the same issue that they get a
pretty<00:02:03.060> terrible<00:02:03.420> processor<00:02:04.020> rating<00:02:04.320> that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
pretty terrible processor rating that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.109 
pretty terrible processor rating that
doesn't<00:02:04.799> really<00:02:04.950> reflect<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.460> performance

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
doesn't really reflect the performance

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.090 
doesn't really reflect the performance
so

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
so

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.910 
so
ignore<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.120> for<00:02:09.480> the<00:02:09.630> fur<00:02:10.230> I<00:02:10.260> guess<00:02:10.680> for

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
ignore that for the fur I guess for

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.400 
ignore that for the fur I guess for

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.940 
is an a-10 6700 quad-core APU it gets a
7.3<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:27.060> clearly<00:02:27.890> sometimes<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.340> processor

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
7.3 so clearly sometimes the processor

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.500 
7.3 so clearly sometimes the processor
benchmark<00:02:31.950> really<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.460> makes<00:02:32.640> no<00:02:32.910> sense<00:02:33.270> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
benchmark really just makes no sense and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.240 
benchmark really just makes no sense and
doesn't<00:02:33.810> actually<00:02:33.990> reflect<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> performance

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
doesn't actually reflect the performance

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.740 
doesn't actually reflect the performance
and<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.670> definitely<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.180> case<00:02:36.270> with<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and that is definitely the case with the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.740 
and that is definitely the case with the
FX<00:02:37.080> 6300<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.250> does<00:02:38.430> not<00:02:38.640> reflect<00:02:39.060> what

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
FX 6300 it just does not reflect what

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.830 
FX 6300 it just does not reflect what
the<00:02:39.840> actual<00:02:40.200> performance<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.310> use<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.210> so

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the actual performance is so use it so

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.190 
the actual performance is so use it so
base<00:02:43.590> your<00:02:44.300> opinions<00:02:45.300> about<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.630> processor

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
base your opinions about that processor

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.080 
base your opinions about that processor
on<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.380> different<00:02:46.650> benchmark<00:02:47.160> like<00:02:47.310> CPU<00:02:47.760> mark

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
on a different benchmark like CPU mark

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.940 
on a different benchmark like CPU mark
for<00:02:48.360> example<00:02:48.870> because<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> Windows

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
for example because the Windows

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.520 
for example because the Windows
Experience<00:02:50.280> Index<00:02:50.610> one<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.150> bunk<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.960> don't

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
Experience Index one is bunk just don't

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.170 
Experience Index one is bunk just don't
even<00:02:52.800> look<00:02:52.950> at<00:02:53.100> it

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.400 

just<00:02:57.180> thought<00:02:57.300> I'd<00:02:57.450> mention<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.110> video

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
just thought I'd mention that in a video

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.870 
just thought I'd mention that in a video
I<00:02:58.680> have<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.670> good<00:02:59.850> one<00:02:59.940> everybody<00:03:00.270> Joe
