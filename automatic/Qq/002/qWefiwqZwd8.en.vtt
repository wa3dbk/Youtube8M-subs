so<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.670> low<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.060> tac-19<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:18.220> simply<00:02:19.220> pull

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
so the low of the tac-19 I simply pull

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.479 
so the low of the tac-19 I simply pull
this<00:02:19.580> mechanism<00:02:19.910> now<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:21.680> spacing<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.129> track

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.270 

there's<00:02:25.489> two<00:02:25.760> pin<00:02:26.060> lock<00:02:26.330> knots<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.560> here<00:02:27.830> this

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
there's two pin lock knots is here this

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.040 
there's two pin lock knots is here this
one<00:02:28.550> goes<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.970> deep<00:02:29.150> blue<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.870> is
