okay folks in this clip I'm going to

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.450 
okay folks in this clip I'm going to
teach<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.060> draw<00:00:03.360> flames<00:00:04.069> now<00:00:05.069> flames

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
teach you how to draw flames now flames

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.629 
teach you how to draw flames now flames
are<00:00:06.470> relatively<00:00:07.470> simple<00:00:08.250> if<00:00:08.340> you're<00:00:08.460> drawing

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
are relatively simple if you're drawing

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.220 
are relatively simple if you're drawing
them<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:08.970> cartoon<00:00:09.389> form<00:00:09.420> if<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:09.900> really

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
them in cartoon form if you really

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.990 
them in cartoon form if you really
wanted<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.530> go<00:00:10.769> into<00:00:10.800> graphic<00:00:11.400> detail<00:00:11.519> that

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
wanted to go into graphic detail that

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.730 
wanted to go into graphic detail that
would<00:00:12.150> take<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> great<00:00:12.990> deal<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.290> time<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
would take a great deal of time and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.200 
would take a great deal of time and
practice<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.549> anybody<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.030> draw

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
practice but just about anybody can draw

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.450 
practice but just about anybody can draw
flames<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> main<00:00:16.980> ways<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.430> it

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
flames and one of the main ways we do it

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.800 
flames and one of the main ways we do it
is<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.789> go<00:00:17.910> like<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.240> you're<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> start

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
is to go like this you're going to start

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.160 
is to go like this you're going to start
with<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.650> outer<00:00:19.890> edge<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> flame<00:00:21.170> start

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
with the outer edge of the flame start

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.870 
with the outer edge of the flame start
at<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> base<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.340> work<00:00:23.640> your

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
at the base and kind of just work your

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.359 
at the base and kind of just work your
way<00:00:23.939> up<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.480> zigzaggy<00:00:25.230> lines<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> always<00:00:26.160> kind

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
way up in zigzaggy lines and always kind

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.189 
way up in zigzaggy lines and always kind
of<00:00:26.430> come<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> point<00:00:28.939> one<00:00:29.939> thing<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
of come to a point one thing to do is to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.520 
of come to a point one thing to do is to
always<00:00:31.590> keep<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:36.090> zig<00:00:36.450> zaggy<00:00:36.780> pattern

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
always keep the zig zaggy pattern

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
always keep the zig zaggy pattern
consistent<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.730> obviously<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
consistent and you're obviously going to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.850 
consistent and you're obviously going to
build<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:41.390> you<00:00:42.390> draw<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.620> fire<00:00:44.780> but

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
build on this as you draw this fire but

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
build on this as you draw this fire but
just<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.070> work<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:47.489> way<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.239> almost

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
just kind of work your way up and almost

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.959 
just kind of work your way up and almost
like<00:00:49.110> little<00:00:49.350> horns<00:00:50.149> come<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:53.460> draw<00:00:53.730> these

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
like little horns come in and draw these

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.660 
like little horns come in and draw these
fingers<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> licking<00:00:55.500> toward<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
fingers just kind of licking toward the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:06.700 
fingers just kind of licking toward the
sky<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.420> flames<00:00:57.809> would<00:00:58.140> do<00:01:02.989> something

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.970 

like<00:01:07.280> that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.820 

and<00:01:12.510> then<00:01:13.510> what<00:01:13.690> you<00:01:13.780> will<00:01:13.870> do<00:01:14.050> at<00:01:14.410> this<00:01:14.590> point

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
and then what you will do at this point

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.320 
and then what you will do at this point
is<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.640> create<00:01:15.910> sort<00:01:16.150> of<00:01:16.210> a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
is the to create sort of a

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.170 
is the to create sort of a
three-dimensional<00:01:17.050> look<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.440> flames<00:01:17.740> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
three-dimensional look to the flames you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.310 
three-dimensional look to the flames you
would<00:01:19.180> kind<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.450> come<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.050> sort<00:01:20.260> of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
would kind of come in and sort of

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.020 
would kind of come in and sort of
lightly<00:01:21.130> now<00:01:21.340> follow<00:01:21.910> your<00:01:22.180> lines<00:01:22.510> up<00:01:23.970> now<00:01:24.970> the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
lightly now follow your lines up now the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.680 
lightly now follow your lines up now the
outer<00:01:25.480> line<00:01:25.870> again<00:01:26.410> should<00:01:26.650> be<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.890> thickest

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
outer line again should be the thickest

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.150 
outer line again should be the thickest
the<00:01:28.690> inner<00:01:28.900> lines<00:01:29.170> just<00:01:29.530> kind<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.740> lightly

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
the inner lines just kind of lightly

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.760 
the inner lines just kind of lightly
trace<00:01:30.910> where<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:31.510> were<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.200> outer<00:01:32.470> edge

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
trace where you were on the outer edge

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.340 
trace where you were on the outer edge
if<00:01:33.760> you<00:01:33.850> follow<00:01:34.120> up<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.690> little<00:01:34.870> bit<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.170> see

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
if you follow up a little bit you see

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.950 
if you follow up a little bit you see
how<00:01:35.500> I'm<00:01:35.590> doing<00:01:35.830> this<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.670> just<00:01:40.180> follow<00:01:40.540> the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
how I'm doing this and just follow the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.050 
how I'm doing this and just follow the
line<00:01:41.230> right<00:01:41.860> around<00:01:42.190> like<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:42.970> you're

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
line right around like that and you're

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.910 
line right around like that and you're
going<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.210> do<00:01:43.360> two<00:01:43.750> or<00:01:43.780> three<00:01:44.260> layers<00:01:44.470> like

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
going to do two or three layers like

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.200 
going to do two or three layers like
this<00:01:45.130> then<00:01:45.340> you're<00:01:45.430> going<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.640> come<00:01:45.790> in<00:01:45.970> and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
this then you're going to come in and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.000 
this then you're going to come in and
this<00:01:46.600> would<00:01:46.840> be<00:01:47.020> if<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.320> were<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.590> draw<00:01:47.770> of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
this would be if you were to draw of

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.540 
this would be if you were to draw of
them<00:01:48.250> in<00:01:48.400> color<00:01:48.640> you<00:01:49.510> draw<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:50.260> few<00:01:51.220> different

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
them in color you draw a few different

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.640 
them in color you draw a few different
shades<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.870> would<00:01:52.990> make<00:01:53.170> this<00:01:53.500> inner<00:01:53.890> portion

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
shades you would make this inner portion

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.680 
shades you would make this inner portion
yellow<00:01:56.650> or<00:01:56.890> almost<00:01:57.220> white<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:58.030> show<00:01:58.060> like<00:01:58.480> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
yellow or almost white to show like the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.440 
yellow or almost white to show like the
white<00:01:58.930> heat<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.650> flame<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:01.150> make<00:02:01.330> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
white heat of the flame and you make the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.530 
white heat of the flame and you make the
outer<00:02:01.600> portion<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.260> most<00:02:02.440> orange<00:02:02.860> orange

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
outer portion the most orange orange

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.570 
outer portion the most orange orange
slightly<00:02:04.540> less<00:02:04.720> orange<00:02:05.140> yellow<00:02:05.620> or<00:02:05.770> white<00:02:06.220> is

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
slightly less orange yellow or white is

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.310 
slightly less orange yellow or white is
to<00:02:06.700> show<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.090> intensity<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:07.810> then<00:02:08.110> if<00:02:08.230> you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
to show the intensity and then if you

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.630 
to show the intensity and then if you
really<00:02:08.560> want<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.770> make<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.980> flames<00:02:09.280> kind<00:02:09.580> of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
really want to make the flames kind of

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.670 
really want to make the flames kind of
licking<00:02:10.060> like<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.480> lot<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.750> folks<00:02:10.960> too<00:02:11.140> you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
licking like a lot of folks too you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.520

they kind of marry the motion of the

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.930 
they kind of marry the motion of the
outer<00:02:20.130> line<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.430> you've<00:02:21.550> drawn<00:02:21.760> already
