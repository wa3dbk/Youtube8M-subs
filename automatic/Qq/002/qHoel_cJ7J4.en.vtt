00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
you've been talking about storytelling a

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.700 
you've been talking about storytelling a
bunch<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.390> you<00:00:34.540> are<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:34.780> storyteller<00:00:35.560> with

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
bunch and you are a storyteller with

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.130 
bunch and you are a storyteller with
images<00:00:36.100> can<00:00:37.030> you<00:00:37.090> talk<00:00:37.239> about<00:00:37.300> just<00:00:37.810> what<00:00:38.110> that

images can you talk about just what that

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.190 
images can you talk about just what that
looks<00:00:38.440> like<00:00:38.560> an<00:00:38.830> approach<00:00:39.130> to<00:00:39.460> what<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:39.880> do

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
looks like an approach to what you do

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.460 
looks like an approach to what you do
well<00:00:41.200> I<00:00:41.230> think<00:00:41.350> that<00:00:41.710> storytelling<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:43.600> like

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
well I think that storytelling is like

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.369 
well I think that storytelling is like
this<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:45.190> secret<00:00:45.540> key<00:00:46.540> to<00:00:46.720> success<00:00:47.080> in<00:00:47.200> many

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
this the secret key to success in many

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.869 
this the secret key to success in many
ways<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.620> think<00:00:47.650> that<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:48.129> lot<00:00:48.400> of<00:00:48.460> people<00:00:48.550> don't

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
ways I think that a lot of people don't

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.970 
ways I think that a lot of people don't
use<00:00:49.120> search<00:00:49.330> allegan<00:00:49.690> off<00:00:49.780> I<00:00:49.960> think<00:00:49.989> we<00:00:50.800> should

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
use search allegan off I think we should

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.930 
use search allegan off I think we should
we<00:00:51.340> should<00:00:51.550> start<00:00:51.970> yeah<00:00:53.489> well<00:00:54.489> I<00:00:54.520> think<00:00:54.640> that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
we should start yeah well I think that

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.079 
we should start yeah well I think that
storytelling<00:00:55.269> sort<00:00:55.780> of<00:00:55.839> is<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.670> everything<00:00:58.059> we

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
storytelling sort of is in everything we

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.020 
storytelling sort of is in everything we
do<00:00:58.330> so<00:00:58.570> for<00:00:58.870> branding<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.970> how<00:01:00.970> we

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
do so for branding and how we

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.479 
do so for branding and how we
communicate<00:01:01.570> with<00:01:01.690> clients<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:02.470> it's<00:01:03.309> not

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
communicate with clients and it's not

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.310 
communicate with clients and it's not
just<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.000> images<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.570> their<00:01:04.690> blog<00:01:04.839> posts<00:01:05.260> and

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
just the images and their blog posts and

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.590 
just the images and their blog posts and
the<00:01:05.470> slideshows<00:01:05.890> it's<00:01:06.190> literally<00:01:06.760> in

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
the slideshows it's literally in

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.270 
the slideshows it's literally in
everything<00:01:08.020> we<00:01:08.050> do<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.590> more<00:01:08.620> you<00:01:08.860> sort

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
everything we do and the more you sort

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.100 
everything we do and the more you sort
of<00:01:09.340> engage<00:01:10.120> in<00:01:10.360> storytelling<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.930> more<00:01:11.050> you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
of engage in storytelling the more you

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.660 
of engage in storytelling the more you
will<00:01:11.229> connect<00:01:11.530> with<00:01:11.650> people<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.280> think<00:01:12.460> the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
will connect with people and I think the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.250 
will connect with people and I think the
more<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:12.909> connect<00:01:13.210> with<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.720> easier<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.200> is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
more you connect with the easier it is

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.840 
more you connect with the easier it is
to<00:01:14.320> charge<00:01:15.100> whatever<00:01:15.370> you<00:01:15.520> want<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.700> charge

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
to charge whatever you want to charge

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.960 
to charge whatever you want to charge
and<00:01:16.060> all<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.240> sort<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.450> thing<00:01:17.040> yeah<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.729> for

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
and all that sort of thing yeah so for

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.789 
and all that sort of thing yeah so for
me<00:01:19.030> that's<00:01:19.210> sort<00:01:19.659> of<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.750> why<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.380> talked<00:01:20.710> about

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
me that's sort of the why I talked about

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:21.780 
me that's sort of the why I talked about
it<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.280> think<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.580> a<00:01:21.610> lot<00:01:21.729> of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
it and I think that a lot of

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.020 
it and I think that a lot of
photographers<00:01:22.350> miss<00:01:23.350> out<00:01:24.040> on<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.610> lot<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.790> that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
photographers miss out on a lot of that

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.730 
photographers miss out on a lot of that
they<00:01:25.210> think<00:01:25.510> I'm<00:01:25.690> not<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:25.930> writer<00:01:26.170> I'm<00:01:26.560> not<00:01:26.710> a

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
they think I'm not a writer I'm not a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.900 
they think I'm not a writer I'm not a
listen<00:01:27.730> that<00:01:27.880> but<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:29.190> good<00:01:30.190> brands<00:01:30.760> are<00:01:30.880> good

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
listen that but all good brands are good

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.880 
listen that but all good brands are good
storytellers<00:01:31.570> that's<00:01:31.780> what<00:01:32.260> good<00:01:32.470> brands<00:01:32.740> do

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
storytellers that's what good brands do

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.230 
storytellers that's what good brands do
so<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:33.220> think<00:01:33.370> photographers<00:01:33.970> should<00:01:34.090> focus

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
so I think photographers should focus

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.990 
so I think photographers should focus
more<00:01:34.390> on<00:01:34.540> that<00:01:34.690> absolutely<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:36.190> then<00:01:36.610> your

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
more on that absolutely and then your

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.420 
more on that absolutely and then your
background<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.530> commercial<00:01:39.010> photography

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430

was a little bit of storytelling in
itself<00:02:05.830> yeah<00:02:06.190> i<00:02:06.220> mean<00:02:06.430> i've<00:02:06.730> written

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
itself yeah i mean i've written

literally<00:02:07.570> hundreds<00:02:07.900> of<00:02:07.990> commercials<00:02:08.470> and

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
literally hundreds of commercials and

stories in some way or another and I
think<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.790> that's<00:02:13.019> why<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.050> focused<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.769> it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
think that that's why I focused on it

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.220 
think that that's why I focused on it
heavily<00:02:15.129> not<00:02:15.670> because<00:02:15.940> I'm<00:02:16.540> trained<00:02:16.959> in<00:02:17.080> it

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
heavily not because I'm trained in it

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.710 
heavily not because I'm trained in it
but<00:02:17.379> because<00:02:17.620> i<00:02:17.879> am<00:02:18.879> passionate<00:02:19.330> about<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.629> and

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
but because i am passionate about it and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720 
but because i am passionate about it and
i<00:02:19.810> enjoy<00:02:20.080> enjoy<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:21.099> craft<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.459> telling

different<00:03:06.660> well<00:03:07.660> it's<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:08.260> difficult<00:03:08.890> to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
different well it's it's difficult to

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.360 
different well it's it's difficult to
unlearn<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:11.080> it's<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.590> constant<00:03:11.739> challenge<00:03:11.980> i

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
unlearn so it's a constant challenge i

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.050 
unlearn so it's a constant challenge i
think<00:03:12.610> but<00:03:12.730> i<00:03:12.790> do<00:03:13.480> i<00:03:14.280> arrived<00:03:15.280> generally<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.880> day

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
think but i do i arrived generally a day

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.820 
think but i do i arrived generally a day
or<00:03:16.180> two<00:03:16.330> early<00:03:17.050> for<00:03:17.200> whatever<00:03:17.470> i'm<00:03:17.560> shooting

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
for me it's important to sort of get a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.320 
for me it's important to sort of get a
feel<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:23.830> where<00:03:23.950> ever<00:03:24.130> i'm<00:03:24.220> going<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:24.910> and

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
i have to be very careful about the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.429 
i have to be very careful about the
frames<00:05:18.669> that<00:05:18.849> I<00:05:18.909> capture<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:19.569> and<00:05:20.110> all<00:05:20.289> that

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
and I'm going to try and cut that down
