00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
to create an infinite water source you

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.840 
to create an infinite water source you
need<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.540> buy<00:00:35.690> two<00:00:35.750> grid<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.550> just<00:00:37.550> basically

to need cobblestone about 120 we'll do a

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.740 
to need cobblestone about 120 we'll do a
bunch<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.890> TNT<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.910> set<00:00:56.090> off<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.300> cannon<00:00:56.600> with

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
bucket for the water source bunch of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.240 
bucket for the water source bunch of
redstone<00:01:00.700> prevented<00:01:01.700> much<00:01:01.880> new<00:01:02.420> um<00:01:03.250> some

levers to set it off steps and steps and
I've<00:01:09.770> swallowed<00:01:10.040> redstone<00:01:10.759> torches<00:01:11.180> I'll

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
I've swallowed redstone torches I'll

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.520 
I've swallowed redstone torches I'll
admit<00:01:12.200> redstone<00:01:13.450> right<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:14.780> let's<00:01:15.109> build<00:01:15.409> it

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
admit redstone right so let's build it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.639 
admit redstone right so let's build it
facing<00:01:16.450> where<00:01:17.450> all<00:01:17.600> these<00:01:17.719> pigs<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.200> cows<00:01:18.380> are

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
facing where all these pigs and cows are

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.499 
facing where all these pigs and cows are
over<00:01:18.859> there<00:01:19.009> easier<00:01:21.369> so<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:23.030> watching<00:01:23.329> dude

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
over there easier so you watching dude

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.910 
over there easier so you watching dude
yep<00:01:26.319> so<00:01:27.319> we're<00:01:27.560> going<00:01:27.679> to<00:01:27.889> build<00:01:28.249> the<00:01:28.399> barrel

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
yep so we're going to build the barrel

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.849 
yep so we're going to build the barrel
she's<00:01:30.920> basically<00:01:31.130> free<00:01:31.729> by<00:01:32.170> seven<00:01:33.170> I<00:01:33.380> mean<00:01:33.740> you

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
she's basically free by seven I mean you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.620 
she's basically free by seven I mean you
could<00:01:34.039> build<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:34.639> on<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.789> ground<00:01:35.030> but<00:01:35.420> we

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
could build it on the ground but we

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.929 
could build it on the ground but we
haven't<00:01:35.810> tried<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:36.200> yet<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:36.889> then<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.490> TNT

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
haven't tried that yet and then the TNT

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.139 
haven't tried that yet and then the TNT
might<00:01:38.119> blow<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.840> hole<00:01:39.679> in<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.950> ground<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:40.549> best

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
might blow a hole in the ground so best

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.989 
might blow a hole in the ground so best
if<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:41.389> just<00:01:41.420> do<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:43.539> yep<00:01:44.770> right<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.159> build

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
cover up the end of the water supply so

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.080 
cover up the end of the water supply so
it's<00:02:38.389> difficult<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.870> accidentally<00:02:39.469> ruin<00:02:39.920> it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
we're going to put a redstone torch on

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.289 
we're going to put a redstone torch on
the<00:03:11.299> corner<00:03:11.689> like<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.459> year<00:03:13.459> they'll

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
the corner like this year they'll

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.610 
the corner like this year they'll
indicate<00:03:14.840> when<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.139> circuits<00:03:15.560> alive<00:03:15.889> and<00:03:17.620> a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
indicate when the circuits alive and a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.339 
indicate when the circuits alive and a
lever<00:03:19.189> on<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:20.049> block<00:03:21.049> like<00:03:21.409> this<00:03:23.290> okay<00:03:24.290> so

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
lever on the block like this okay so

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.199 
lever on the block like this okay so
that<00:03:24.620> should<00:03:24.650> turn<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.310> they're<00:03:25.939> working

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
that should turn the they're working

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.140 
that should turn the they're working
this<00:03:26.269> time<00:03:26.419> yeah<00:03:26.750> that's<00:03:27.199> nice<00:03:27.699> the<00:03:28.699> switches

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
then we'll put redstone going to the end

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.860 
then we'll put redstone going to the end
like<00:03:54.769> that

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.800 

okay<00:03:57.590> let's<00:03:58.069> just<00:03:58.280> test<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:58.879> these<00:03:59.269> switches

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
okay let's just test that these switches

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.250 
okay let's just test that these switches
work<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:01.069> yeah<00:04:01.280> there<00:04:01.909> we<00:04:02.000> go<00:04:02.030> we'll<00:04:02.480> get<00:04:02.690> ya

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.920 
careful of is you want to make sure that
the<00:04:09.470> switches<00:04:09.920> are<00:04:10.040> turned<00:04:10.430> off<00:04:10.640> arise<00:04:11.120> if<00:04:11.420> you

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
the switches are turned off arise if you

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.930 
the switches are turned off arise if you
add<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.530> tnt<00:04:13.040> and<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.250> switches<00:04:13.670> are<00:04:13.700> turned

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
as soon as you hit that switch it will

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.379 
as soon as you hit that switch it will
just<00:04:18.829> screw<00:04:19.190> everything<00:04:19.430> up<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:19.880> you'll<00:04:20.150> have

just screw everything up and you'll have
no<00:04:20.449> cannon<00:04:20.959> raft<00:04:21.490> so<00:04:22.490> just<00:04:22.669> make<00:04:22.850> sure<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
no cannon raft so just make sure the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.650 
no cannon raft so just make sure the
switches<00:04:23.810> are<00:04:23.840> turned<00:04:24.260> off<00:04:25.210> all<00:04:26.210> right<00:04:26.389> I'll

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
switches are turned off all right I'll

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.260 
switches are turned off all right I'll
be<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:27.010> okay<00:04:28.010> so<00:04:28.130> let's<00:04:28.370> try<00:04:28.669> loading<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:29.180> with

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
be it okay so let's try loading it with

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.500 
be it okay so let's try loading it with
just<00:04:29.570> two<00:04:29.960> TNT<00:04:30.500> in<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.680> barrel<00:04:31.010> yeah<00:04:31.400> so<00:04:32.300> if<00:04:32.389> it

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
just two TNT in a barrel yeah so if it

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.939 
just two TNT in a barrel yeah so if it
well<00:04:32.660> at<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.840> end<00:04:32.870> on<00:04:33.169> top<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.530> step<00:04:33.740> and

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
well at the end on top of the step and

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.920 
well at the end on top of the step and
it'll<00:04:34.190> sort<00:04:34.340> of<00:04:34.460> hover<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:34.760> bit<00:04:34.940> curves<00:04:35.810> and

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
it'll sort of hover a bit curves and

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170 
it'll sort of hover a bit curves and
edges<00:04:36.080> are<00:04:36.350> movin<00:04:36.470> yep<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.760> then<00:04:37.910> we'll<00:04:38.030> put

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
edges are movin yep and then we'll put

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.730 
edges are movin yep and then we'll put
two<00:04:38.780> inside<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:40.190> actual<00:04:40.340> water<00:04:41.380> as<00:04:42.380> we<00:04:42.590> make

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
two inside the actual water as we make

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.409 
two inside the actual water as we make
sure<00:04:42.860> not<00:04:43.039> ruin<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.520> water<00:04:43.729> source<00:04:44.030> with<00:04:44.360> the

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
sure not ruin the water source with the

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.770 
sure not ruin the water source with the
TNT<00:04:44.780> yeah<00:04:45.430> okay<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.729> you're<00:04:47.270> done<00:04:47.479> I<00:04:47.510> should

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
TNT yeah okay and you're done I should

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.760 
TNT yeah okay and you're done I should
try<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:49.360> Tom<00:04:50.360> will<00:04:50.570> do<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.810> honors<00:04:51.080> yep

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
try that so Tom will do the honors yep

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.520 
try that so Tom will do the honors yep
we<00:04:52.220> pull<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.610> left<00:04:52.820> which<00:04:53.030> first<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.660> then

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
we pull the left which first and then

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.920 
we pull the left which first and then
wait<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:55.039> few<00:04:55.520> seconds<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.120> then<00:04:56.660> pull<00:04:56.840> the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
wait a few seconds and then pull the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.080 
wait a few seconds and then pull the
right<00:04:57.110> switch<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:58.010> then<00:04:58.100> we<00:04:58.220> do<00:04:58.430> remember<00:04:58.699> get

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
right switch and then we do remember get

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.460 
right switch and then we do remember get
there<00:04:59.479> we<00:04:59.570> go<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:01.190> that's<00:05:01.460> one<00:05:01.669> dead<00:05:01.880> pig<00:05:02.470> nice

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
there we go and that's one dead pig nice

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.320 
there we go and that's one dead pig nice
to<00:05:03.889> kill<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.130> pig<00:05:04.310> oh<00:05:04.550> yeah<00:05:04.789> I<00:05:04.820> didn't<00:05:05.090> see<00:05:05.240> it

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
to kill the pig oh yeah I didn't see it

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.379 
to kill the pig oh yeah I didn't see it
or<00:05:05.810> goes<00:05:06.050> ever<00:05:06.440> go<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:07.490> get<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.760> year<00:05:08.150> in<00:05:08.330> a

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
or goes ever go and get the year in a

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.469 
or goes ever go and get the year in a
minute<00:05:08.630> have<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.139> look<00:05:09.639> so<00:05:10.639> yeah<00:05:10.760> um<00:05:10.910> basically

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
minute have a look so yeah um basically

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.050 
minute have a look so yeah um basically
we<00:05:11.840> only<00:05:12.220> use<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.669> maximum<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.210> 40<00:05:14.810> s<00:05:15.169> because

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
we only use the maximum of 40 s because

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.370 
we only use the maximum of 40 s because
well<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.180> don't<00:05:17.360> need<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:17.660> much<00:05:18.080> really

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
well you don't need that much really

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.430 
well you don't need that much really
advise<00:05:19.039> goes<00:05:19.430> miles<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:21.080> then<00:05:21.229> there<00:05:21.410> are

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
advise goes miles and then there are

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.490 
advise goes miles and then there are
other<00:05:21.620> designs<00:05:22.070> which<00:05:22.580> have<00:05:23.570> double<00:05:24.110> barrels

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
other designs which have double barrels

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.010 
other designs which have double barrels
that<00:05:25.430> with<00:05:25.610> this<00:05:25.729> design<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.449> have<00:05:26.660> a<00:05:26.720> single

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
that with this design you have a single

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.510 
that with this design you have a single
barrel<00:05:27.260> it's<00:05:27.470> only<00:05:27.680> really<00:05:27.860> effective<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.400> our

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
barrel it's only really effective to our

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.230 
barrel it's only really effective to our
for<00:05:28.760> ya<00:05:29.419> so<00:05:30.349> uploaded<00:05:30.860> in<00:05:30.949> for<00:05:31.160> now<00:05:31.400> where'd

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
for ya so uploaded in for now where'd

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.400 
for ya so uploaded in for now where'd
you<00:05:32.300> go<00:05:32.449> edema<00:05:32.900> well<00:05:35.860> so<00:05:37.780> 14th<00:05:38.780> he'll<00:05:38.990> go<00:05:39.199> quite

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
you go edema well so 14th he'll go quite

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.939 
you go edema well so 14th he'll go quite
far<00:05:39.620> so<00:05:40.460> I'm<00:05:40.639> going<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:40.970> switch<00:05:41.720> time<00:05:41.990> is<00:05:42.229> the

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
far so I'm going to switch time is the

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.200 
far so I'm going to switch time is the
amount<00:05:43.039> of<00:05:43.190> seconds<00:05:43.580> between<00:05:43.729> putting<00:05:44.060> the

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
amount of seconds between putting the

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.300 
amount of seconds between putting the
left<00:05:44.389> switch<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:44.900> right<00:05:45.050> switch<00:05:45.310> ideal

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
left switch and the right switch ideal

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.570 
left switch and the right switch ideal
switch<00:05:46.460> time<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:46.970> about<00:05:47.300> four<00:05:47.599> seconds

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
switch time is about four seconds

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.140 
switch time is about four seconds
because<00:05:49.580> then<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.539> TNT<00:05:51.110> will<00:05:51.680> blow<00:05:52.460> up<00:05:52.639> as<00:05:52.940> it

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
because then the TNT will blow up as it

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.080 
because then the TNT will blow up as it
hits<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.539> ground<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:53.960> not<00:05:54.050> midair<00:05:54.669> so<00:05:55.669> that's

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
hits the ground and not midair so that's

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.939 
hits the ground and not midair so that's
let's<00:05:56.360> try<00:05:56.630> it<00:05:56.690> with<00:05:56.810> 14<00:05:57.229> too<00:05:57.410> because<00:05:57.620> this<00:05:57.740> is

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
let's try it with 14 too because this is

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.560 
let's try it with 14 too because this is
gonna<00:05:58.610> go<00:05:58.789> miles<00:06:00.370> okay<00:06:01.370> so<00:06:01.430> ready<00:06:02.030> think<00:06:02.389> it'll

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
gonna go miles okay so ready think it'll

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.529 
gonna go miles okay so ready think it'll
probably<00:06:03.070> go<00:06:04.070> further<00:06:04.340> than<00:06:04.520> I<00:06:04.789> can<00:06:04.880> see<00:06:05.270> but

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
probably go further than I can see but

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.800 
probably go further than I can see but
yep

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
yep

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:15.810 
yep
barring<00:06:08.810> oh<00:06:12.550> I<00:06:14.050> wasn't<00:06:15.050> that<00:06:15.200> far<00:06:15.530> actually

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
barring oh I wasn't that far actually

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.440 
barring oh I wasn't that far actually
well<00:06:16.820> anyway<00:06:17.150> yeah<00:06:17.570> that's<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.960> general<00:06:18.260> idea

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
well anyway yeah that's the general idea

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
well anyway yeah that's the general idea
just<00:06:20.450> make<00:06:20.600> sure<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:20.900> switches<00:06:21.260> are<00:06:21.290> all

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
just make sure the switches are all

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.440 
just make sure the switches are all
damage<00:06:21.740> and<00:06:22.010> yeah<00:06:23.000> we're<00:06:23.150> going<00:06:23.270> to<00:06:23.330> go<00:06:23.420> out

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
damage and yeah we're going to go out

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.060 
damage and yeah we're going to go out
damage<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.320> I<00:06:24.440> hope<00:06:24.590> you<00:06:24.740> enjoyed<00:06:24.950> this<00:06:25.100> video
