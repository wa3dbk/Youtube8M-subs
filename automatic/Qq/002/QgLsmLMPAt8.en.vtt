now<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.770> water<00:00:05.160> carries<00:00:06.029> molecules<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.960> are

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
now the water carries molecules that are

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.049 
now the water carries molecules that are
with<00:00:07.410> your<00:00:07.560> 12:6<00:00:08.069> plenty<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.429> stars<00:00:09.710> molecule

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
with your 12:6 plenty of stars molecule

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.430 
with your 12:6 plenty of stars molecule
some<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.389> understand<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.049> with<00:00:13.259> in

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
some of you understand this with in

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.980 
some of you understand this with in
chemistry<00:00:14.070> or<00:00:14.099> you're<00:00:15.059> working<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> lab

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
chemistry or you're working in the lab

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.480 
chemistry or you're working in the lab
and<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:18.660> are

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
and you are

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.010 
and you are
what<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.789> seventy<00:00:21.240> five<00:00:21.270> seventy

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
what is that seventy five seventy

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.480 
what is that seventy five seventy
percent<00:00:22.289> water<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.359> earth<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:25.490> it's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
percent water and this earth is it's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.179 
percent water and this earth is it's
basically<00:00:26.960> racial<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.140> basically<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.920> as

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
basically racial is basically that as

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.950 
basically racial is basically that as
well<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.970> universe<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:31.460> 75%<00:00:32.460> water<00:00:32.960> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
well and the universe is 75% water so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.590 
well and the universe is 75% water so
what<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.860> water<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.239> were<00:00:36.360> brought

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
what we do with water is we were brought

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
what we do with water is we were brought
up<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.960> pray<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.350> water<00:00:37.620> when<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.700> take<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
up to pray with water when you take a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.229 
up to pray with water when you take a
drink<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.750> say<00:00:39.960> say<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> prayer<00:00:41.000> I'm<00:00:42.000> good

house and you go beyond to say thank you
and<00:00:45.570> talk<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:45.930> water<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.530> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and talk to that water because that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.760 
and talk to that water because that
water<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.780> this<00:00:48.780> water<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
water is you this water is the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650 
water is you this water is the
experience<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.700> mother<00:00:50.910> experience<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660

experience and the mother experience of
this<00:00:51.809> universe<00:00:52.340> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.789> water<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.510> six

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
this universe in the water the six

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.220 
this universe in the water the six
pointed<00:00:55.140> star<00:00:56.480> metabolisms<00:00:57.480> are<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> your

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
pointed star metabolisms are in your

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.439 
pointed star metabolisms are in your
systems<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.600> star<00:01:01.079> people<00:01:02.449> that's

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
