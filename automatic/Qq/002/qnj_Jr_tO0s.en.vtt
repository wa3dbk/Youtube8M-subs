00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
of that incident it just turned me off
about<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.430> entire<00:01:26.729> series<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
about the entire series and I just

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
about the entire series and I just
didn't<00:01:27.840> watch<00:01:27.960> any<00:01:28.200> more<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.470> them<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:28.890> keep

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
didn't watch any more of them now keep

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.069 
didn't watch any more of them now keep
in<00:01:29.250> mind<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.970> saw<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> last<00:01:30.479> trailer

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
in mind that when I saw the last trailer

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.960 
in mind that when I saw the last trailer
it<00:01:31.259> was<00:01:31.560> pretty<00:01:31.890> exciting<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> me<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it was pretty exciting to me and it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.999 
it was pretty exciting to me and it
looks<00:01:33.119> very<00:01:33.180> action<00:01:33.720> packed<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.860> just

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
looks very action packed but I'm just

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.530 
looks very action packed but I'm just
worried<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> did<00:01:35.880> watch<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
worried that if I did watch it I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
worried that if I did watch it I
probably<00:01:36.900> won't<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.320> able<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> follow<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
probably won't be able to follow it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.170 
probably won't be able to follow it
because<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.220> didn't<00:01:38.490> watch<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.670> previous

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
because I didn't watch the previous

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.080 
because I didn't watch the previous
movies<00:01:39.630> anyways<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.070> said<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.759> nothing

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
movies anyways like I said it's nothing

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460 
movies anyways like I said it's nothing

friday and saturday but not Sundays

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.969 
friday and saturday but not Sundays
because<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.330> box<00:02:09.539> office<00:02:09.899> numbers<00:02:10.140> actually

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
because the box office numbers actually

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.540 
because the box office numbers actually
come<00:02:11.580> out<00:02:11.610> around

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
come out around

come out around
noon<00:02:12.880> on<00:02:13.210> Sundays<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.140> anything<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.010> you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
noon on Sundays so anything that you

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.090 
noon on Sundays so anything that you
watch<00:02:15.610> after<00:02:16.090> doesn't<00:02:17.050> really<00:02:17.200> affect<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.800> so

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
watch after doesn't really affect it so

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.770 
watch after doesn't really affect it so
it's<00:02:18.280> actually<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.700> better<00:02:18.940> idea<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.450> watch<00:02:19.600> it

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
it's actually a better idea to watch it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's actually a better idea to watch it
on<00:02:19.870> friday<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.380> saturday<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.070> if<00:02:21.130> you're
