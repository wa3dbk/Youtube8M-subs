object and click on sphere so once
you're<00:00:42.949> done<00:00:42.980> with<00:00:43.160> that<00:00:43.309> you<00:00:43.879> want<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.120> go

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
you're done with that you want to go

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.750 
you're done with that you want to go
ahead<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.750> go<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.050> type<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:45.769> click<00:00:46.220> on<00:00:46.640> the

ahead and go to type and click on the
fifth<00:00:47.030> option<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:47.960> separates<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:49.010> circle

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
fifth option this separates the circle

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.240 
fifth option this separates the circle
into<00:00:49.910> little<00:00:50.180> triangles<00:00:50.540> which<00:00:51.379> gives<00:00:51.980> it<00:00:52.129> the

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
into little triangles which gives it the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.549 
into little triangles which gives it the
legitimate<00:00:52.730> effect<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:53.989> now<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:54.350> does

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
legitimate effect so now that you does

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.899 
legitimate effect so now that you does
with<00:00:54.710> that<00:00:54.890> what<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.220> want<00:00:55.369> to<00:00:55.430> go<00:00:55.519> ahead<00:00:55.640> and

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
with that what you want to go ahead and

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.350 
with that what you want to go ahead and
do<00:00:56.059> is<00:00:56.239> go<00:00:56.269> to<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.690> mograph<00:00:57.309> poly<00:00:58.309> FX<00:00:58.820> we're

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
do is go to the mograph poly FX we're

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.660 
do is go to the mograph poly FX we're
gonna<00:00:59.479> drag<00:00:59.720> poly<00:01:00.049> effects<00:01:00.470> under<00:01:00.739> sphere<00:01:01.309> and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
gonna drag poly effects under sphere and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.670 
gonna drag poly effects under sphere and
then<00:01:02.390> you<00:01:02.510> want<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.750> go<00:01:02.839> to<00:01:02.900> mograph<00:01:03.320> again

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
then you want to go to mograph again

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.160 
then you want to go to mograph again
click<00:01:03.979> on<00:01:04.100> sector<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:04.879> click<00:01:05.119> on<00:01:05.269> formula

click on sector and click on formula
this<00:01:06.650> is<00:01:06.950> what's<00:01:07.220> going<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.490> give<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.850> the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
this is what's going to give it the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.210 
this is what's going to give it the
effect<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.780> you're<00:01:08.990> pretty<00:01:09.140> much<00:01:09.350> done<00:01:10.159> with

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
effect and you're pretty much done with

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.640 
effect and you're pretty much done with
the<00:01:10.400> actual<00:01:10.640> effect<00:01:11.360> now<00:01:12.020> it's<00:01:12.200> just<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.530> get

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
the actual effect now it's just to get

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.679 
the actual effect now it's just to get
on<00:01:12.799> with<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.070> natural<00:01:13.790> logo<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:14.479> want<00:01:14.630> about
