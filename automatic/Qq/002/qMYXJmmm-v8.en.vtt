00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
because basically every defense is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.680

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
because oftentimes when I do this I get

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.490 
because oftentimes when I do this I get
hit<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:29.850> three<00:01:30.360> times<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> row<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.290> most

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
people don't get any darker laser so it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
people don't get any darker laser so it
doesn't<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.420> matter<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.470> actually

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
doesn't really matter but I actually

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.859 
doesn't really matter but I actually
want<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> replays<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.600> want<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> be
