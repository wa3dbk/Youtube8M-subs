00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
let's get a little bit into transitions

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.680 
let's get a little bit into transitions
now<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:08.730> let's<00:00:09.730> see<00:00:10.769> let's<00:00:11.769> say<00:00:11.950> you've<00:00:12.160> got

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
now so let's see let's say you've got

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:25.310 
now so let's see let's say you've got
this<00:00:13.690> part<00:00:13.990> of<00:00:14.110> the<00:00:14.200> song

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.660 

okay<00:00:26.320> so<00:00:26.710> we've<00:00:26.860> got<00:00:27.010> that<00:00:27.040> part<00:00:27.370> of<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.520> song

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
okay so we've got that part of the song

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.160 
okay so we've got that part of the song
we<00:00:27.880> might<00:00:28.060> want<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.330> get<00:00:28.420> into<00:00:28.600> a<00:00:28.690> different

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
we might want to get into a different

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.050 
we might want to get into a different
song<00:00:29.410> well<00:00:30.070> not<00:00:30.220> a<00:00:30.280> different<00:00:30.640> song<00:00:30.820> but<00:00:31.030> a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
song well not a different song but a

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.510 
song well not a different song but a
different<00:00:31.360> tune<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:33.010> different<00:00:33.340> chord

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
different tune and a different chord

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.150 
different tune and a different chord
progression<00:00:34.000> now<00:00:34.540> I<00:00:34.870> chord<00:00:35.350> progression<00:00:35.830> that

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
progression now I chord progression that

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.690 
progression now I chord progression that
will<00:00:36.340> go<00:00:36.460> nicely<00:00:36.790> with<00:00:37.920> D<00:00:38.920> minor<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:42.460> still

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
will go nicely with D minor we're still

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.950 
will go nicely with D minor we're still
using<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.120> key<00:00:43.300> of<00:00:43.420> C<00:00:45.330> so<00:00:46.330> you<00:00:46.390> can<00:00:46.660> pretty

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
using the key of C so you can pretty

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.049 
using the key of C so you can pretty
much<00:00:47.050> use<00:00:47.230> any<00:00:47.500> chord<00:00:48.220> progression<00:00:48.700> you<00:00:48.820> want

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
much use any chord progression you want

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.670 
much use any chord progression you want
so<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:49.960> could<00:00:50.320> pick<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.930> a<00:00:55.350> nice<00:00:56.350> see

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
so you could pick see a nice see

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.740 
so you could pick see a nice see
progression<00:00:56.940> chord<00:00:57.940> progression<00:00:58.420> would<00:00:58.570> work

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
progression chord progression would work

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:11.830 
progression chord progression would work
nicely<00:00:58.930> s<00:00:59.290> e-g<00:01:00.330> a<00:01:01.500> minor<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:03.390> C

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:47.910 

so<00:01:12.840> let's<00:01:13.050> say<00:01:13.200> we've<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:13.530> our<00:01:13.680> tune<00:01:14.010> there

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:58.120 

you

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.750 

okay<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.760> this<00:01:59.940> C<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.400> nice<00:02:02.580> little

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
okay so this C so that's a nice little

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.160 
okay so this C so that's a nice little
chord<00:02:03.060> progression<00:02:03.480> there<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.020> want

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
chord progression there now if we want

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.950 
chord progression there now if we want
to<00:02:04.230> get<00:02:04.320> into<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.650> from<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.100> part<00:02:05.450> okay<00:02:06.450> let's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
to get into it from this part okay let's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.780 
to get into it from this part okay let's
let's<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.410> how<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.130> so<00:02:08.460> we've<00:02:08.610> got

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
let's see how we can do it so we've got

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:27.680 
let's see how we can do it so we've got
d<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:25.310> seat<00:02:26.310> there's<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.580> G<00:02:26.820> chord<00:02:27.090> now<00:02:27.480> that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
d my seat there's a G chord now that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.030 
d my seat there's a G chord now that
will<00:02:27.810> go<00:02:27.930> nicely<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.710> C<00:02:29.040> chord<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.950> we

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
will go nicely to the C chord so here we

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.560 
will go nicely to the C chord so here we
go<00:02:32.070> let's<00:02:32.430> try<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.760> put<00:02:32.880> them<00:02:33.030> together<00:02:33.150> oh

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
go let's try and put them together oh

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.140 
go let's try and put them together oh
but<00:02:34.500> first<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.010> all<00:02:35.100> we'll<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.550> go<00:02:35.700> straight

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
but first of all we'll just go straight

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.640 
but first of all we'll just go straight
into<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.600> so

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.850 

you

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:03:13.210 

you

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.560 

see<00:03:14.220> now<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:15.450> works<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.700> little<00:03:18.090> bit<00:03:18.330> a

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
see now it works but it's a little bit a

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
see now it works but it's a little bit a
big<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:20.340> big<00:03:21.060> contrast<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.960> it's<00:03:22.170> like<00:03:22.380> you're

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
big a big contrast that it's like you're

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.770 
big a big contrast that it's like you're
going<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.130> nice<00:03:23.490> soft<00:03:24.060> bit<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.660> then

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
going on this nice soft bit and then

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.650 
going on this nice soft bit and then
boom<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.500> hits<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.130> straight<00:03:26.520> away<00:03:26.670> now<00:03:27.450> that

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
boom it hits you straight away now that

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.660 
boom it hits you straight away now that
can<00:03:27.840> work<00:03:28.020> as<00:03:28.230> well<00:03:28.440> but<00:03:29.040> if<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.280> want<00:03:29.490> a<00:03:29.640> more

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
can work as well but if you want a more

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.000 
can work as well but if you want a more
like<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> transition<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.440> make<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.830> little

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
like a transition to make it a little

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.270 
like a transition to make it a little
bit<00:03:32.220> less<00:03:32.460> less<00:03:32.910> harsh<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:34.410> could<00:03:34.620> maybe<00:03:34.830> put

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
bit less less harsh you could maybe put

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
bit less less harsh you could maybe put
in<00:03:35.810> let's<00:03:36.810> see<00:03:37.020> after<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.410> D<00:03:37.560> minor<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:54.060> from

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
in let's see after the D minor so from

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.060 
in let's see after the D minor so from
here<00:03:54.950> we<00:03:55.950> could<00:03:56.130> use<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:57.950> remember<00:03:58.950> this

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
here we could use that remember this

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.310 
here we could use that remember this
transition<00:03:59.700> i<00:03:59.760> showed<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.420> philly<00:04:00.900> for

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
transition i showed you to philly for

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.770 
transition i showed you to philly for
the<00:04:01.440> ending<00:04:01.830> which<00:04:02.130> was<00:04:02.340> there<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.210> gene<00:04:03.750> and

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
the ending which was there and gene and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.320 
the ending which was there and gene and
then<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> few<00:04:04.530> other<00:04:04.680> chords<00:04:05.130> maybe<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.940> just

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
then a few other chords maybe the just

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.790 
then a few other chords maybe the just
the<00:04:06.450> F<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.840> G<00:04:06.870> might<00:04:07.230> work<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:07.770> could

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
the F and the G might work so we could

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:20.259 
the F and the G might work so we could
go

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.640 

Oh

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:49.570 

you

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.910 

see<00:04:50.580> now<00:04:50.700> that<00:04:50.910> worked<00:04:51.150> really<00:04:51.270> well<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:52.710> you

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
see now that worked really well and you

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.280 
see now that worked really well and you
saw<00:04:53.160> their<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.760> trap<00:04:54.030> use<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.690> transition<00:04:55.080> to

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
saw their to trap use the transition to

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.560 
saw their to trap use the transition to
get<00:04:55.560> back<00:04:55.800> all<00:04:56.130> I<00:04:56.190> had<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.580> do<00:04:56.820> was<00:04:57.000> play<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.210> G

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
get back all I had to do was play a G

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.680 
get back all I had to do was play a G
because<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.710> G<00:04:58.980> is<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.850> one<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.180> leads<00:05:00.450> you

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
because the G is the one that leads you

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.920 
because the G is the one that leads you
into<00:05:00.870> that<00:05:01.050> d<00:05:01.320> minor<00:05:01.620> chord<00:05:02.810> so<00:05:05.600> let's<00:05:06.600> try<00:05:06.870> it

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
into that d minor chord so let's try it

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:35.439 
into that d minor chord so let's try it
again<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.500> you've<00:05:07.620> got<00:05:07.650> demon

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:43.490 

here<00:05:36.449> we<00:05:36.570> go

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.050 

you

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:59.220 

you

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:19.960 

and<00:06:00.230> see<00:06:00.500> how<00:06:00.620> I'm<00:06:00.680> just<00:06:00.890> fighting<00:06:01.100> that<00:06:01.430> loud

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.809 

so<00:06:20.970> there's<00:06:21.389> a<00:06:21.479> transition<00:06:22.020> now<00:06:22.860> when<00:06:23.699> you

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
so there's a transition now when you

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.350 
so there's a transition now when you
want<00:06:24.000> to<00:06:24.060> start<00:06:24.270> getting<00:06:24.449> into<00:06:26.360> transitions

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
want to start getting into transitions

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.420 
want to start getting into transitions
to<00:06:27.629> get<00:06:27.990> to<00:06:28.139> a<00:06:28.169> different<00:06:28.530> key<00:06:28.770> signature

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
to get to a different key signature

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.520 
to get to a different key signature
you've<00:06:30.120> got<00:06:30.300> a<00:06:30.330> few<00:06:30.690> other<00:06:30.870> things<00:06:30.990> that<00:06:31.440> you

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
you've got a few other things that you

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.610 
you've got a few other things that you
can<00:06:31.680> work<00:06:31.860> on<00:06:32.129> so<00:06:32.449> we'll<00:06:33.449> start<00:06:33.810> on<00:06:33.990> different

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
can work on so we'll start on different

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.760 
can work on so we'll start on different
key<00:06:34.800> signatures<00:06:35.370> in<00:06:35.550> the<00:06:36.060> next<00:06:36.360> video<00:06:36.629> but<00:06:37.560> so

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
key signatures in the next video but so

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.059 
key signatures in the next video but so
what<00:06:38.310> you've<00:06:38.430> got<00:06:38.460> from<00:06:38.789> this<00:06:38.940> video<00:06:39.270> is<00:06:40.069> your

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:41.069 
what you've got from this video is your

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:46.339 
what you've got from this video is your
intros<00:06:42.680> nice<00:06:43.680> little<00:06:45.080> variation<00:06:46.080> of<00:06:46.199> what

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
intros nice little variation of what

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.290 
intros nice little variation of what
your<00:06:46.500> melody<00:06:46.919> is<00:06:47.039> going<00:06:47.280> to<00:06:47.370> be<00:06:47.520> that's<00:06:48.150> a

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
your melody is going to be that's a

00:06:48.300 --> 00:07:15.320 
your melody is going to be that's a
really<00:06:48.629> nice<00:06:48.780> way<00:06:49.050> of<00:06:49.080> doing<00:06:49.889> an<00:06:49.979> intro

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.060 

so<00:07:16.330> there<00:07:16.540> was<00:07:16.660> a<00:07:16.840> nice<00:07:17.170> way<00:07:17.440> of<00:07:17.470> introducing

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070 
so there was a nice way of introducing

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.260 
so there was a nice way of introducing
it<00:07:18.480> and<00:07:19.480> then<00:07:20.020> you<00:07:20.140> put<00:07:20.290> your<00:07:20.410> baseline<00:07:21.270> so

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.270 
it and then you put your baseline so

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:37.010 
it and then you put your baseline so
baseline<00:07:22.900> and<00:07:23.110> chords

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.080
