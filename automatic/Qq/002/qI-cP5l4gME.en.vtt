00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
it's basically recreating the Ender

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.360 
it's basically recreating the Ender
liquid<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:13.110> am<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.740> not<00:00:13.920> remember<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
liquid in am I I do not remember the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.939 
liquid in am I I do not remember the
exact<00:00:14.730> mod<00:00:14.940> but<00:00:15.630> nevertheless<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.529> ender

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
exact mod but nevertheless this ender

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.510 
exact mod but nevertheless this ender
liquid<00:00:17.310> basically<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.800> it's<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:20.490> like

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
liquid basically can it's just like

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.220 
liquid basically can it's just like
water<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.210> any<00:00:21.390> other<00:00:21.449> liquid<00:00:21.750> except

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
water just like any other liquid except

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.689 
water just like any other liquid except
when<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.470> stand<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.220> will<00:00:23.369> teleport

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
when you stand in it it will teleport

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.759 
when you stand in it it will teleport
you<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.470> you're<00:00:25.590> using

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you just like just like if you're using

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.130 
you just like just like if you're using
an<00:00:26.189> end<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.119> roll<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> liquid

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
an end up roll so it's like a liquid

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.339 
an end up roll so it's like a liquid
made<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.740> ender<00:00:29.220> pearls<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.699> guess<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.349> yeah

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
made out of ender pearls I guess so yeah

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.290 
made out of ender pearls I guess so yeah
what<00:00:31.710> if<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.890> locus<00:00:32.460> will<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> will

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
what if this locus will do it will

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
what if this locus will do it will
convert<00:00:33.540> all<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> water<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.230> world<00:00:34.469> into

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
convert all the water in your world into

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
convert all the water in your world into
this<00:00:35.670> entered<00:00:36.090> liquid<00:00:36.329> stuff<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.899> step

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
this entered liquid stuff so if we step

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.319 
this entered liquid stuff so if we step
in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> water<00:00:37.440> we're<00:00:37.590> gonna<00:00:37.649> get<00:00:37.890> teleported

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
in the water we're gonna get teleported

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.250 
in the water we're gonna get teleported
say<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.600> kind<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> cool<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.050> want<00:00:40.170> any

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
say this is kind of cool if you want any

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.569 
say this is kind of cool if you want any
sound<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.530> adventure<00:00:40.980> wraps<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.280> something

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
if I can hop in there you see we got

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.119 
if I can hop in there you see we got
teleported<00:00:50.820> over<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.449> put<00:00:51.960> little<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.440> name

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
teleported over here put little a name

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.590 
teleported over here put little a name
in<00:00:53.250> sound<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.149> particles

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
in sound and we got a little particles

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
in sound and we got a little particles
everywhere<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.710> yeah<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.399> how<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.699> works

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
everywhere so yeah that's how it works

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.939 
everywhere so yeah that's how it works
now<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.469> cool<00:00:58.649> i<00:00:58.710> like

want the player to be able to step in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.179 
want the player to be able to step in
the<00:01:07.890> water<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:09.090> could<00:01:09.240> say<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.900> oh<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.500> could

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the water you could say like oh I could

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.440 
the water you could say like oh I could
the<00:01:11.460> player<00:01:11.610> would<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.150> could<00:01:12.299> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the player would be like I could just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.880 
the player would be like I could just
smell<00:01:12.600> over<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.619> kind<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
smell over there and you know kind of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.859 
smell over there and you know kind of
cheat<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.220> through<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.549> parkour<00:01:14.970> but

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
cheat my way through this parkour but

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.880 
cheat my way through this parkour but
when<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.110> tried<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> swim<00:01:16.560> over<00:01:16.740> there

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
when they tried to swim over there

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
when they tried to swim over there
what's<00:01:17.070> gonna<00:01:17.189> happen<00:01:17.549> they're<00:01:18.119> gonna<00:01:18.240> get

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
what's gonna happen they're gonna get

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.530 
what's gonna happen they're gonna get
teleported<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.950> yeah<00:01:20.070> what's<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.299> it's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
teleported so yeah what's going on it's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.910 
teleported so yeah what's going on it's
basically<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.900> using<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.439> spread<00:01:22.740> player

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
basically just using some spread player

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.090 
basically just using some spread player
commands<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.640> some<00:01:24.060> place<00:01:24.450> sound<00:01:24.659> commands

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
commands and some place sound commands

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.020 
commands and some place sound commands
but<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> reason<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:26.970> been

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
but the reason that this has not been

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.569 
but the reason that this has not been
possible<00:01:27.299> though<00:01:27.750> before<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
possible though before is because of

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.929 
possible though before is because of

go ahead and dive into the Redstone you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.819 
go ahead and dive into the Redstone you
let's<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.590> open<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.829> chest<00:01:38.070> first

you'll<00:01:44.009> look<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.329> what's<00:01:45.509> going<00:01:45.720> on

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you'll look like this so what's going on

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.719 
you'll look like this so what's going on
here<00:01:46.020> you're<00:01:46.110> gonna<00:01:46.170> push<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.560> button<00:01:46.740> all

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
here you're gonna push this button all

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.920 
here you're gonna push this button all
its<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.060> doing<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.450> getting<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> fiddle

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
its up doing it's getting the fiddle

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.389 
its up doing it's getting the fiddle
clock<00:01:49.079> started<00:01:49.500> by<00:01:49.560> putting<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.040> sun<00:01:50.250> block

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
clock started by putting up at sun block

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
clock started by putting up at sun block
there<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.360> creating<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> subjective

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
there and it is creating a subjective

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
there and it is creating a subjective
called<00:01:52.439> ended<00:01:52.950> liquid<00:01:53.220> which<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.549> sad<00:01:54.060> else

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
called ended liquid which is sad else

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300 
called ended liquid which is sad else
win<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.540> centimeter<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.040> essentially

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
win one centimeter so what essentially

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.530 
win one centimeter so what essentially
what<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.700> doing<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.030> saying<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
what that's doing is saying if the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.330 
what that's doing is saying if the
player<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.780> swimming<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> water<00:01:58.560> it's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
player is swimming in the water it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.749 
player is swimming in the water it's
going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.610> go<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.799> that's<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.610> use

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
going to go up so that's that's more use

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.819 
going to go up so that's that's more use
they<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.149> test<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.380> players<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
they kind of test if the players in the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.709 
they kind of test if the players in the
water<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.210> fail<00:02:06.390> clock<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
water and then this is a fail clock of

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.139 
water and then this is a fail clock of
course<00:02:07.129> so<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.399> doing<00:02:08.670> its<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:08.910> say

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
course so what is doing its gonna say

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.609 
course so what is doing its gonna say
everyone<00:02:09.569> who<00:02:09.660> score<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.959> any<00:02:10.080> liquid<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.530> at

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
everyone who score of any liquid is at

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.890 
everyone who score of any liquid is at
least<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.280> anyone<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.879> water<00:02:12.090> what

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
least one so anyone in the water what

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.830 
least one so anyone in the water what
it's<00:02:13.020> going<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> do<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.379> gonna

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
it's going to do it's gonna

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.229 
it's going to do it's gonna
give<00:02:14.019> them<00:02:14.230> spread<00:02:15.190> players<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.819> then<00:02:16.150> it's

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
give them spread players and then it's

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.270 
give them spread players and then it's
going<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.450> do<00:02:16.540> relative<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.170> them<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.620> then

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
going to do relative to them and then

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.259 
going to do relative to them and then
it's<00:02:18.400> they're<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:18.849> going<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:19.090> spread

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
it's they're just going to get spread

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.990 
it's they're just going to get spread
within<00:02:19.450> five<00:02:19.720> blocks<00:02:20.010> 5<00:02:21.010> lakhs<00:02:21.280> paces<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.760> don't

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
within five blocks 5 lakhs paces I don't

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.309 
within five blocks 5 lakhs paces I don't
know<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.450> only<00:02:22.480> one<00:02:22.690> player<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.140> it

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
know it's the only one player so it

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.720 
know it's the only one player so it
doesn't<00:02:23.560> really<00:02:23.620> matter<00:02:23.800> but<00:02:24.519> they're<00:02:24.640> going

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
doesn't really matter but they're going

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.640 
doesn't really matter but they're going
to<00:02:24.819> get<00:02:24.910> spread<00:02:25.090> anywhere<00:02:25.330> within<00:02:25.660> 25<00:02:26.200> blocks

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
to get spread anywhere within 25 blocks

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.949 
to get spread anywhere within 25 blocks
of<00:02:27.040> them<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:28.239> then<00:02:28.569> it's<00:02:28.660> going<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.810> that

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
of them and then it's going to that

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.300 
of them and then it's going to that
anyone<00:02:29.290> who<00:02:29.470> score<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.739> any<00:02:29.830> liquid<00:02:30.129> is<00:02:30.220> at

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
anyone who score of any liquid is at

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.550 
anyone who score of any liquid is at
least<00:02:30.430> one<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.750> yeah<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.989> reason<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.290> hasn't

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
least one so yeah the reason this hasn't

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.059 
least one so yeah the reason this hasn't
been<00:02:32.590> possible<00:02:33.069> before<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.790> because<00:02:35.069> before

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
been possible before is because before

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.289 
been possible before is because before
there<00:02:36.370> was<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.489> bug<00:02:36.670> with<00:02:36.879> spread<00:02:37.060> players

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
there was a bug with spread players

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.550 
there was a bug with spread players
where<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.599> could<00:02:37.750> not<00:02:37.840> do<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.080> relative<00:02:38.530> to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
where you could not do it relative to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.339 
where you could not do it relative to
the<00:02:38.799> player<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:40.150> now<00:02:40.330> or<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:41.019> could<00:02:41.140> not<00:02:41.230> use

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the player so now or you could not use

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.660 
the player so now or you could not use
relative<00:02:41.620> course<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.069> they<00:02:42.099> would<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.580> be

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
relative course so they would have to be

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.059 
relative course so they would have to be
exact<00:02:43.120> coordinates<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.319> have<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.470> say<00:02:44.590> you

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
exact coordinates so you have to say you

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.530 
exact coordinates so you have to say you
can<00:02:45.220> only<00:02:45.340> spread<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.700> player<00:02:45.819> around<00:02:46.090> 100

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
can only spread the player around 100

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.259 
can only spread the player around 100
100<00:02:47.019> but<00:02:47.560> now<00:02:47.709> they<00:02:47.980> fix<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.370> bug<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:48.849> now<00:02:49.209> you

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
100 but now they fix the bug so now you

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.449 
100 but now they fix the bug so now you
can<00:02:49.569> use<00:02:49.720> relative<00:02:50.049> coordinates<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.310> way

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
can use relative coordinates so this way

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.380 
can use relative coordinates so this way
you're<00:02:51.610> actually<00:02:51.730> spraying<00:02:52.120> players

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
you're actually spraying players

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.699 
you're actually spraying players
relative<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> where<00:02:52.930> they<00:02:53.049> are<00:02:53.170> instead<00:02:53.590> of

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
relative to where they are instead of

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.839 
relative to where they are instead of
relative<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.099> a<00:02:54.130> certain<00:02:54.430> point<00:02:54.579> on<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.819> map

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
relative to a certain point on the map

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.729 
relative to a certain point on the map
which<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.930> why<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.110> end<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.380> liquid<00:02:56.590> works

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739

failed with water at the bottom you

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.759 
failed with water at the bottom you
could<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.670> course<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.299> say<00:03:07.680> teleport<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
player to this exact location if they

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.309 
player to this exact location if they
have<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.799> score<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.280> any<00:03:12.370> liquid<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:14.230> know

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
for example you could just replace the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.400 
for example you could just replace the
spread<00:03:49.239> players<00:03:49.419> command<00:03:49.690> with<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> TP<00:03:49.989> command

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
they got teleport back to the start of

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.199 
they got teleport back to the start of
the<00:03:53.590> park<00:03:53.799> or<00:03:53.950> something<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.760> what's<00:03:55.030> to

the park or something so that what's to

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.319 
the park or something so that what's to
yeah<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:57.040> ender<00:03:57.639> ender<00:03:57.880> liquid

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
yeah so that is the ender ender liquid

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.990 
yeah so that is the ender ender liquid
in<00:03:58.450> vanilla<00:03:58.630> minecraft<00:03:59.489> there<00:04:00.489> we<00:04:00.549> go<00:04:00.669> so

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
in vanilla minecraft there we go so

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.129 
in vanilla minecraft there we go so
sometimes<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.480> sounds<00:04:01.690> won't<00:04:01.870> play<00:04:01.989> that

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
sometimes the sounds won't play that

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.080 
sometimes the sounds won't play that
could<00:04:02.290> just<00:04:02.440> be<00:04:02.470> because<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.609> chunks<00:04:04.000> are

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
could just be because the chunks are

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.550 
could just be because the chunks are
getting<00:04:04.269> unloaded<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:05.169> make<00:04:05.349> sure<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.500> always

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560
