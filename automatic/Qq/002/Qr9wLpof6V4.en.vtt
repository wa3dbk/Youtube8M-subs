00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.770 
size so i think the iphone 5 may have a
more<00:03:45.200> micro<00:03:45.710> one<00:03:45.890> micro<00:03:46.370> level<00:03:46.760> awesome<00:03:47.420> card

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
okay let me make a comparison again

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:02.260 
okay let me make a comparison again
first<00:03:55.240> second<00:03:56.240> a<00:03:59.350> third<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:01.640> fourth<00:04:01.850> change

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
first second a third the fourth change

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:10.250 
first second a third the fourth change
and<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:03.380> fifth<00:04:03.620> big<00:04:03.860> change

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.820

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.060 
handset right now and this is the iphone
5<00:04:17.260> part<00:04:18.040> with<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:19.079> let's<00:04:20.079> we'll<00:04:20.260> see<00:04:20.500> check

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
5 part with that let's we'll see check

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.970 
5 part with that let's we'll see check
in<00:04:21.250> this<00:04:21.459> angle<00:04:21.880> we<00:04:22.570> can<00:04:22.750> see<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.590> two

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980

models<00:04:24.390> has<00:04:25.890> different<00:04:26.890> size<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.520> think<00:04:28.180> at

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
models has different size I think at

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.390 
models has different size I think at
iPhone<00:04:28.690> 5<00:04:28.990> is<00:04:29.670> much<00:04:30.670> thinner<00:04:31.500> than<00:04:32.500> iphone<00:04:32.830> 4

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
iPhone 5 is much thinner than iphone 4

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.770 
iPhone 5 is much thinner than iphone 4
or<00:04:33.430> iphone<00:04:34.000> 4s<00:04:34.390> and<00:04:35.730> also<00:04:36.730> maybe<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.360> may<00:04:37.720> be

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
or iphone 4s and also maybe it may be

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:50.660 
or iphone 4s and also maybe it may be
lighter

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.730
