00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.979
 Welcome to our new The Settlers 7 Special 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.839
 today we are dealing with a key point of the settler series of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.839
 economy 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.139
 Of course this is not the pub around the corner community but that 

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:24.829
 increasingly impressive economic system in the game itself 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.800
 what have the developers set here and what's up at the point 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.040
 Economic cycles towards you 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.560
 So far, it was always designed so that it is only one from the direction of the garden 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.430
 the military means all economic cycles 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.450
 it is always only 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.690
 Now the strip ran in. Papageno soldiers produce and that 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.670
 At that time we expanded we could have done the research inside 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.100
 from the tar cover 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 and this is the game 4 we had different variations 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.990
 Tables extend back to these displacement areas 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.240
 and so also give different than to expand 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.570
 So there are different possibilities in the new settlers 7 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.750
 To operate expansion 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.750
 and that means 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.520
 additional variety in gameplay 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.320
 but that's not enough 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 in the newest settler part further possibilities are offered to the individual 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.020
 To further optimize economic cycles 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.320
 It is therefore about more efficiency in production processes OMV 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.820
 Transportation of goods but how exactly is this now implemented in practice 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.030
 when he did that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.110
 Economic system of settlers 7 since they are very dependent on his demented so far 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.190
 known parts 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.420
 that means we were again our goods circuits winter transport system 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.700
 have, however, now 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.960
 to make the us system even more fixable and flexible 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.900
 the dynamics built in that means he can despair in different bank of it 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.540
 can provide more efficient work then can transport routes 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.500
 individually optimize 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.040
 French percent warehouses from Daimler you can do the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.860
 Fasten roads through the currency guard to move faster 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.170
 so what have different options with the known elements yet 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.180
 more to offer tactics and strategies to the game 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.569
 you see already in the spring of 2010 a lot is coming towards you 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.790
 As far as the economy goes the Settlers 7 is concerned paper both familiar 6 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.239
 as well as numerous innovations such as optimizing the individual 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.830
 Economic Cycles Settlers 7 will be released in early 2010 for your PC
