off<00:00:28.270> of<00:00:28.300> it<00:00:28.539> you<00:00:29.110> were<00:00:29.199> racing<00:00:29.349> against<00:00:29.829> it<00:00:29.980> the

off of it you were racing against it the

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.609 
off of it you were racing against it the
other<00:00:30.369> 360<00:00:30.939> around<00:00:31.029> us<00:00:31.390> when<00:00:32.379> if<00:00:32.439> those<00:00:32.529> are

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
other 360 around us when if those are

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.140 
other 360 around us when if those are
360<00:00:33.010> around<00:00:33.100> us<00:00:33.370> everything<00:00:33.670> turned<00:00:33.970> in<00:00:34.089> the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
360 around us everything turned in the

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.479 
360 around us everything turned in the
color<00:00:34.360> because<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:34.720> black<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.019> white

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
color because it's black and white

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.740 
color because it's black and white
the<00:00:36.489> camera<00:00:36.850> will<00:00:36.940> reusing<00:00:37.330> today<00:00:37.540> it's

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
the camera will reusing today it's

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.630 
the camera will reusing today it's
called<00:00:37.900> a<00:00:38.019> phantom<00:00:38.410> camera<00:00:38.800> and<00:00:38.980> it<00:00:39.250> lets<00:00:39.519> me

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
called a phantom camera and it lets me

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.400 
called a phantom camera and it lets me
shoot<00:00:40.000> at<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.239> thousand<00:00:40.660> frames<00:00:40.839> a<00:00:41.050> second

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
shoot at a thousand frames a second

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.399 
shoot at a thousand frames a second
which<00:00:41.829> basically<00:00:42.370> lets<00:00:42.670> me<00:00:42.910> stop<00:00:43.239> time<00:00:43.629> so

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
which basically lets me stop time so

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.350 
which basically lets me stop time so
when<00:00:44.860> we<00:00:44.980> play<00:00:45.159> it<00:00:45.280> back<00:00:45.309> at<00:00:45.579> normal<00:00:45.879> speed<00:00:46.120> we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
when we play it back at normal speed we

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.030 
when we play it back at normal speed we
actually<00:00:46.720> see<00:00:46.900> the<00:00:47.019> idles<00:00:47.290> running<00:00:47.739> but

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
actually see the idles running but

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.130 
actually see the idles running but
they're<00:00:48.370> virtually<00:00:49.000> stopped<00:00:49.449> almost<00:00:49.750> frozen

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
they're virtually stopped almost frozen

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.619 
they're virtually stopped almost frozen
in<00:00:50.379> time<00:00:50.559> so<00:00:51.250> it's<00:00:51.460> crucial<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.909> the<00:00:52.030> story<00:00:52.180> to

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
in time so it's crucial to the story to

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.359 
in time so it's crucial to the story to
see<00:00:52.809> them<00:00:53.019> moving<00:00:53.350> in<00:00:53.470> slow<00:00:53.739> motion<00:00:53.920> little

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
see them moving in slow motion little

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.539 
see them moving in slow motion little
cars<00:00:54.549> fast<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:55.809> resonate<00:00:56.379> for<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.860> concept<00:00:57.400> of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
cars fast to resonate for the concept of

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.520 
cars fast to resonate for the concept of
the<00:00:57.640> video<00:00:57.879> one<00:00:58.839> of<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:58.960> things<00:00:59.140> we<00:00:59.229> had<00:00:59.320> to<00:00:59.409> do

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
the video one of the things we had to do

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.079 
the video one of the things we had to do
today<00:00:59.650> was<00:00:59.799> we<00:01:00.010> had<00:01:00.159> to<00:01:00.339> lip-sync<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:00.970> the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
today was we had to lip-sync to the

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.149 
today was we had to lip-sync to the
track<00:01:01.390> in<00:01:01.689> like<00:01:01.930> fast-forward<00:01:02.739> like<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:03.040> was

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
track in like fast-forward like it was

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.369 
track in like fast-forward like it was
going<00:01:03.280> really<00:01:03.489> really<00:01:03.640> fast<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:04.269> I<00:01:05.110> guess

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
going really really fast and I guess

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.280 
going really really fast and I guess
they<00:01:05.530> do<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.280> create<00:01:06.939> a<00:01:07.479> cool<00:01:07.840> look<00:01:08.080> on

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
they do that to create a cool look on

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.719 
they do that to create a cool look on
camera<00:01:08.500> they<00:01:08.740> shoot<00:01:08.950> at<00:01:09.070> really<00:01:09.280> high<00:01:09.430> speed

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
camera they shoot at really high speed

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.340 
camera they shoot at really high speed
and<00:01:10.240> then<00:01:10.360> they<00:01:10.479> slow<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:10.689> down<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:11.200> their

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
and then they slow it down to their

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.899 
and then they slow it down to their
original<00:01:11.560> speed<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.220> track<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:12.729> gets

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
original speed of the track and it gets

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.110 
original speed of the track and it gets
us<00:01:13.090> looking

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
us looking

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.080 
us looking
it<00:01:14.930> was<00:01:15.050> quite<00:01:15.380> difficult<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:16.040> do<00:01:16.400> because<00:01:16.820> it

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
it was quite difficult to do because it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.830 
it was quite difficult to do because it
was<00:01:17.180> like<00:01:17.270> singing<00:01:17.570> along<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:22.810> world<00:01:23.810> of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
was like singing along to the world of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.320 
was like singing along to the world of
energy<00:01:24.140> aware<00:01:24.620> of<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.770> desert<00:01:28.160> here<00:01:28.550> is<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
energy aware of the desert here is the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.300 
energy aware of the desert here is the
awesome<00:01:29.480> what<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.020> mean<00:01:30.200> it's<00:01:30.380> fun<00:01:30.890> because

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
awesome what I mean it's fun because

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.400 
awesome what I mean it's fun because
we're<00:01:31.430> actually<00:01:31.870> some<00:01:32.870> more<00:01:32.990> different<00:01:33.350> from

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
we're actually some more different from

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.960 
we're actually some more different from

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
me pretty fun you know I think at first

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.890 
me pretty fun you know I think at first
it<00:01:55.520> was<00:01:55.610> for<00:01:55.880> me<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.060> was<00:01:56.270> tough<00:01:56.420> because<00:01:56.600> it's

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
it was for me it was tough because it's

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.390 
it was for me it was tough because it's
not<00:01:57.050> my<00:01:57.200> kind<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.440> thing

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
not my kind of thing
