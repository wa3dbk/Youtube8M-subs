you<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.500> overwhelmed<00:01:41.160> with<00:01:41.220> information

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
you know overwhelmed with information

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.730 
you know overwhelmed with information
you<00:01:41.940> have<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> short<00:01:42.330> attention<00:01:42.420> span<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.560> it's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you have a short attention span so it's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.290 
you have a short attention span so it's
got<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.070> packaged<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.850> way<00:01:44.880> where<00:01:45.180> it's

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
got to be packaged in a way where it's

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.710 
got to be packaged in a way where it's
short<00:01:45.690> concise<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.730> isn't<00:01:47.730> engaging<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.480> I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
short concise and isn't engaging and I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.750 
short concise and isn't engaging and I
think<00:01:49.020> I've<00:01:49.170> found<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.650> formula<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.610> it's

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
think I've found that formula but it's

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.430 
think I've found that formula but it's
always<00:01:50.909> changing<00:01:51.510> so<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.900> interesting<00:01:52.200> that

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
always changing so it's interesting that

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.130 
always changing so it's interesting that
to<00:01:53.070> remain<00:01:53.370> relevant<00:01:53.700> by<00:01:54.360> understanding<00:01:54.960> what

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to remain relevant by understanding what

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.470 
to remain relevant by understanding what
people<00:01:55.170> how<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.220> process<00:01:56.460> information<00:01:56.850> now

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480
