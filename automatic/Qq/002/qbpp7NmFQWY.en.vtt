00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.490

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.710
 tasting is made up the week of looting 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.880
 I have to restart the and I said step 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.930
 to repeat the race I will start the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.490
 playing from the last one and you'll see how 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.680
 came back we're here a little career 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.099
 rare in which we are the airport and 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.960
 200 tastes there are 200 thousand 600 thousand container 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 you have to be turning the time and you have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.340
 paint that complicated looks like being 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.110
 complicated are 333 checkpoints to 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.160
 the turn and it's two laps we're going 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.400
 voucher worth mosquera mosquera tour 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.570
 Mosquera was amazing in the past 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.220
 last but I feel that I will win 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.450
 career as uncle and carry this 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.020
 last starting race that I have 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 flowers 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.600
 but I suppose being perfect is 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.190
 it's super good there is perfect 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.260
 it's better if I go later 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.240
 position guys little by little bit a 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.059
 little without losing the rhythm and it takes the 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.900
 chivas that the super bad 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.180
 care care room well well well 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.070
 cutting positions and it takes you to that 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.070
 also come on guys come 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.240
 they call me the trimmer and he does not call me 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.210
 go Go 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.380
 eye eye we have this uncle there is 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.040
 let's say I spent long we spent 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.320
 your father kid giving the quick turn 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.280
 come less engine and no one kid 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.770
 moderate much that the first and the second 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.940
 something similar will be attached to know that it is 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.190
 the guy who will stay face down like 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.729
 never because I have to give 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 because if it's not going to be enough 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:48.220
 complicated to catch him as you see the race 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.220
 and his uncle already super weird the plan thing 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.510
 there it is there is the outside rebujito 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.510
 see if he can sing above 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.600
 I think it will be the first one would be a little 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:13.970
 There is no time to lose 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.240
 I really do not know why that central 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.800
 germain is that I do not understand 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.800
 of true delay have some 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.820
 listen irrevocably and I fall 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.950
 I do not understand it wrong 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.270
 this is going to be impossible guys 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.430
 honestly this is going to be very difficult 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.750
 go up it since we go super jump 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.750
 giant as in the child 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.580
 too much rock uncle I think that 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.810
 we should repeat and repeat and a 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.000
 also not so long that the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.790
 just one round already already ends 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.720
 11 and I'm going to play with the institut the boy 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.010

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.200
 good for this merhi career is because 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.820

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.590

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.180

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.540

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.340

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.769
 detail 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.569
 we keep jumping when the command is missing 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.569
 car control 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:31.180
 although I do not crave and point 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.620
 of engine to see if we manage to win 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.480
 now to see if we are lucky 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.269
 to see if we stick it and the whole issue 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.180
 ok but already this race can be 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.299
 easy or harder than care 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.260
