00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 with a goal 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.220
 we do not believe that the soldiers we listen to at moments of maximum 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.709
 danger or seriousness 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.710
 Behind my brand of 112 there is a network of professionals and technical means in 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.079
 perfect coordination prepared so that any incident reported or 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.119
 any help requested is taken care of 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.269
 Today we want to face the voices that are listening to us, we are inside the center 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.770
 emergency coordinator be our back 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 we have a room of about g the fundamental piece 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.100
 to assist a person as soon as their courts 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.390
 everyone should know what we do so as to understand and collaborate tepco 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.080
 most effective way 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.410
 there is an area where our colleagues without will pick up the call 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.780
 they were going to ask a series of questions 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.040
 the alerting citizen to the citizen 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.799
 although it is annoying 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.219
 Although we believe that it is a waste of time, it is very important to answer all 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.179
 the questions that are asked because all of them will be decisive for 

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:11.450
 determine the type of event and therefore have some means or others for its 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.550
 Attention 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.260
 in no case is helping time being lost 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.850
 All the information we give about the event we are aware of is known in 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 real time all the security and assistance bodies of Castile and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.700
 Lion 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.320
 all these computers are interconnected with each other in such a way 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.040
 that when we receive the emergency 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.930
 all operators and those who resist the rooms also at the same 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.620
 time that is expected to make the one that exceeds the emergency 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.580
 69 cents per national share and that is what it is clear that we 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.970
 we had planned 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.320
 at the moment that is having the organism knows what is it that is 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.100
 going 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.659
 both the response time is immediate when you call 112 and it 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.630
 opens a call letter so the computer document is known in which 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.289
 point 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.810
 how the so-called place name has developed where it is found that has 

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:05.219
 occurred and all kinds of details that allow the maximum 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.100
 nature of the accident 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.720
 In fact, the system recognizes up to 178 different types of incidents per 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.720
 which any citizen yamaha 112 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.079
 fully recovered 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.229
 we know how to act in each case the canterano knows what it is that has to 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.340
 do in each case in the online editions do not really drink coffee 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:30.099
 mutual self but we rely on the protocols previously estimated with each 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.649
 one of the organisms that are connected with us 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.029
 with which we can allow some kind of related information 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.189
 with the emergency 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.349
 slow and complex the local hobby concept is pretty easy of what not 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.259
 know what you have to do because with systems it does not recommend as these 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.980
 previously already the posters of these reports we have a lot of presents 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.369
 different incidents 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:52.209
 a very high percentage are road accidents percent 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.299
 fruit of the summer seasons not 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.409
 there we have a cessation of actions collapsing could speak of many 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.589
 dreams of many different types of aena preside over the operating room one 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.110
 informative screen 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.799
 where can we check 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.279
 how the morning goes 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:11.799
 with more than nine hundred in 11 hours it can be said that it is more than calm 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.999
 this area be more that have occurred since 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.149
 next to a coastal village in a row 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.009
 all night the back view until this moment 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.809
 at the end of the day then we'll be rafa plastic calls 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.800
 depending on the days of today is a quiet day prosely horrific 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.379
 we would have to get to the best my client 2000 and bad that not all 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.419
 hours of the day are the same there are times when it ceased to be 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.349
 Part by part 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.279
 percent 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:40.109
 and there are other moments he 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.039
 good 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.190
 in the number of calls 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.379
 we have this perfectly for many years now 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.699
 if we have statistics 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.279
 to know 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.989
 How many people do we need at each moment to pass one hundred percent of the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:53.809
 calls efe 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.789
 and as long as an answer is served in French French German 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:00.080

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.439
 other foreseeable circumstances 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.269
 over time the anecdotes and experiences accumulate but many people love because 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.499
 I had bars at home 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.620
 it seems that it is a bit particular ahead 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.009
 the conseller and they lost 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.959
 firefighters that are few who are immersed exit 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.840
 to camp for mexico df 20 calls 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.800
 they have insinuated that they want to bury sketched the manejos an anal gap the 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.210
 door opening incident typology that we use more than we think not 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.740
 many people stay inside the houses peter the heads stays at home the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.830
 surprise faces east of miami 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.770
 sometimes 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.860
 they are direct witnesses of the drama the tragedy was not the moment efe 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.370
 tremendous we agreed with to be with the family 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.979
 in those hard moments of accidents 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.180
 recently mate 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.289
 these moments drew an important attention but also 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.569
 at the same time with a great calm efe 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.220
 our obligation is to be prepared at all times for when it occurs 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.860
 this circumstance 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.300
 it's interesting you know you have to think that this work that is poverty 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.700
 that we have to do it together among the citizen who is attending 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.129
 live to the emergency 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.669
 and it has to become 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.050
 the moment of our eyes and our ears 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.080
 to know what is happening 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.370
 and at the same time three 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.919
 try also from the tranquility 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.000
 by following the instructions that satisfy them
