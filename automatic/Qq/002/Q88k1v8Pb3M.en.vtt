love<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.490> all-over<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:45.289> coloring<00:01:46.289> for

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
love this for an all-over I coloring for

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.300 
love this for an all-over I coloring for
a<00:01:46.950> highlighting<00:01:47.850> color<00:01:48.500> maybe<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> contouring

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
a highlighting color maybe a contouring

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.999 
a highlighting color maybe a contouring
it's<00:01:50.759> pretty<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> use<00:01:52.289> it<00:01:52.319> with<00:01:52.679> a<00:01:52.709> lot<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
it's pretty you can use it with a lot of

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.510 
it's pretty you can use it with a lot of
ways<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.179> next<00:01:54.450> brush<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.929> um<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:56.399> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
ways and the next brush is um just a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.699 
ways and the next brush is um just a
normal<00:01:56.789> fluffy<00:01:57.360> shader<00:01:57.630> brush<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.530> thing

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
normal fluffy shader brush and the thing

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.770 
normal fluffy shader brush and the thing
with<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.160> I<00:01:59.459> don't<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.879> I<00:01:59.910> think<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.629> very

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
with this I don't know I think it's very

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
with this I don't know I think it's very
i<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.709> compare<00:02:02.099> this<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.580> normal

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
i can compare this with a normal

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.749 
i can compare this with a normal
blending<00:02:03.390> brush<00:02:03.599> like<00:02:04.319> a<00:02:04.619> brush<00:02:05.489> like<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
blending brush like a brush like this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.180 
blending brush like a brush like this
one<00:02:06.209> and<00:02:06.569> this<00:02:06.690> one<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.959> from<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.110> sigma<00:02:07.560> it's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
one and this one is from a sigma it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.119 
one and this one is from a sigma it's
pretty<00:02:08.399> close<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.690> more

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
pretty close it's just this is more

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.550 
pretty close it's just this is more
shorter<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.370> guess<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.690> more<00:02:12.900> stubbier

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
shorter I guess and it's more stubbier

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
shorter I guess and it's more stubbier
so<00:02:14.370> i<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.670> compare<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.150> together<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.690> i've

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so i can compare this together like i've

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.170 
so i can compare this together like i've
tried<00:02:16.140> using<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.769> for<00:02:17.129> my<00:02:17.280> priests<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.030> it's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
tried using this for my priests and it's

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.400 
tried using this for my priests and it's
pretty<00:02:18.420> good

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
pretty good

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.440 
pretty good
and<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.890> get<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.550> same<00:02:20.730> results<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.330> it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and you can get the same results with it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.600 
and you can get the same results with it
so<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.350> really<00:02:22.500> good<00:02:22.590> one<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.400> this
