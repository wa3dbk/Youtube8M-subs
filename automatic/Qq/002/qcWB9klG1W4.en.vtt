these can be released but I find it

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.709 
these can be released but I find it
simpler<00:01:51.009> if<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.310> have<00:01:51.459> enough<00:01:51.789> wire<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.179> go

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
simpler if you have enough wire to go

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.969 
simpler if you have enough wire to go
ahead<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.959> just<00:01:53.049> cut<00:01:53.229> them<00:01:53.409> off<00:01:53.529> and<00:01:53.770> start
