look at that look at that I thought I
was<00:01:30.509> doing<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:30.750> well<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:30.990> I'd<00:01:31.079> died<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
was doing really well then I'd died that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.719 
was doing really well then I'd died that
but<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> even<00:01:31.979> gets<00:01:32.040> better<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> second

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
but it even gets better on the second

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
but it even gets better on the second
half<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.150> second<00:01:33.720> half<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.020> finish<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
half like this second half I finish it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980 
half like this second half I finish it
off<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> next<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:35.189> 30<00:01:35.520> seconds<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.869> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
off in the next what 30 seconds like it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.620 
off in the next what 30 seconds like it
was<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.500> fast<00:01:38.299> good<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.360> think<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
