digital SLR II so you can see it set up
on<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.210> tripod<00:00:13.280> so<00:00:14.280> there's<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:15.920> mounting<00:00:16.920> plates

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
on a tripod so there's a mounting plates

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.349 
on a tripod so there's a mounting plates
under<00:00:17.760> here<00:00:19.340> let's<00:00:20.340> see<00:00:20.460> if<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.820> see<00:00:21.000> and

under here let's see if we can see and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.550 
under here let's see if we can see and
it's<00:00:22.170> mounted<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.430> part<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.380> see

it's mounted to this part so you can see

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.480 
it's mounted to this part so you can see
we<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.130> screw<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.560> then<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
we have the screw here and then I have

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.930 
we have the screw here and then I have
two<00:00:29.670> rod<00:00:29.970> bottom<00:00:30.330> rods<00:00:30.570> which<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.349> go<00:00:31.850> to<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
two rod bottom rods which then go to the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.889 
two rod bottom rods which then go to the
front<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> front<00:00:34.110> frame<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.040> also

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
front for this front frame here but also

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.470 
front for this front frame here but also
to<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> main<00:00:37.200> rig<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> camera<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to the main rig for the camera so this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.920 
to the main rig for the camera so this
is<00:00:39.629> where<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.260> camera<00:00:40.739> sets<00:00:41.570> let's<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:42.809> we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
is where the camera sets let's see if we

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.049 
is where the camera sets let's see if we
can<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> shot<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.640> should<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:45.000> able

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
can get a shot there you should be able

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
can get a shot there you should be able
to<00:00:45.210> access<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.660> battery<00:00:45.780> pack<00:00:46.399> unfortunately

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to access the battery pack unfortunately

to access the battery pack unfortunately
one<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> rod<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> way<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.440> I'm

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
one of the rod is in the way so I'm

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.810 
one of the rod is in the way so I'm
looking<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> solution<00:00:52.250> back<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.789> have

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
rigid construction they also go up to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.950 
rigid construction they also go up to
the<00:01:21.750> handle<00:01:22.909> let's<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.390> gonna<00:01:24.689> get

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the handle let's see I'm just gonna get

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.899 
the handle let's see I'm just gonna get
some<00:01:25.140> focus<00:01:27.619> something<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:31.909> this

main arm here is just for as a handle so
you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.509> pick<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.990> more<00:01:37.229> easily<00:01:37.610> here<00:01:38.610> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you can pick it up more easily here in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.660 
you can pick it up more easily here in
the<00:01:38.820> front<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.890> one<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.369> for

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the front to have one for this is for

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.819 
the front to have one for this is for
the<00:01:41.850> microphone<00:01:42.689> which<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.110> using<00:01:43.409> currently

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the microphone which I'm using currently

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.450 
the microphone which I'm using currently
I<00:01:44.070> can't<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.820> show<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:46.310> these<00:01:47.310> are

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
I can't really show it's and these are

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
I can't really show it's and these are
basically<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:47.939> standardized<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.079> mount

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
basically all standardized you can mount

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.859 
basically all standardized you can mount
things<00:01:50.189> everywhere<00:01:50.610> from<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.570> all

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
things everywhere from here and on all

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.760 
things everywhere from here and on all
possible<00:01:52.439> broad<00:01:52.710> angles<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:54.770> so

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
possible broad angles and so on so

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.469 
possible broad angles and so on so
that's<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.219> basically<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:56.790> having<00:01:57.090> magic

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that's it basically I'm not having magic

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.450 
that's it basically I'm not having magic
on<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> display<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.409> which<00:01:59.189> also

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
on with the display here which also

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.280 
on with the display here which also
mounts<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.149> from<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> inner<00:02:00.719> frame<00:02:00.930> here

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
mounts on the from the inner frame here

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.249 
mounts on the from the inner frame here
as<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.579> there's<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.939> lot<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
as you see there's a lot of

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.160 
as you see there's a lot of
possibilities<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:05.329> it's<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.719> really<00:02:06.930> good

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
possibilities and it's it's really good

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.760 
possibilities and it's it's really good
this<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.009> here<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.770> teleprompt

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
this is here is for a teleprompt

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.090 
this is here is for a teleprompt
solution<00:02:11.220> which

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
solution which

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.880 
solution which
is<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.820> making<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.350> also<00:02:14.620> for

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
is in the making this is also for

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.280 
is in the making this is also for
balance<00:02:15.220> legs<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.270> doesn't<00:02:16.630> fall<00:02:16.810> over<00:02:16.840> if

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
balance legs so it doesn't fall over if

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.950 
balance legs so it doesn't fall over if
you<00:02:17.410> take<00:02:17.620> off<00:02:17.830> its<00:02:18.270> from<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.420> from<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
you take off its from the from the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.270 
you take off its from the from the
tripod<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:21.780> let's<00:02:22.780> see<00:02:22.900> here<00:02:23.140> that's<00:02:23.800> about<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
tripod so let's see here that's about it

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.560 
tripod so let's see here that's about it
so<00:02:24.730> far<00:02:25.260> thanks<00:02:26.260> bye
