00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.899 
of her clothing pieces are there her
shirt<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.019> sweater<00:03:04.169> combo<00:03:04.680> her<00:03:05.340> skirt<00:03:05.669> and

shirt and sweater combo her skirt and

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.920 
shirt and sweater combo her skirt and
then<00:03:06.030> her<00:03:06.239> little<00:03:06.389> um<00:03:07.639> briefs<00:03:08.639> or<00:03:09.030> underwear<00:03:09.900> I

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
then her little um briefs or underwear I

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.039 
then her little um briefs or underwear I
guess<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.849> she<00:03:11.879> did<00:03:12.389> not<00:03:12.510> come<00:03:12.719> with<00:03:12.840> shoes

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
guess and she did not come with shoes

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.240 
guess and she did not come with shoes
but<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.319> kind<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.650> her<00:03:13.769> better<00:03:13.980> without

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
but I kind of like her better without

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.390 
but I kind of like her better without
she<00:03:14.519> was<00:03:14.639> she's<00:03:14.819> really<00:03:15.030> adorable<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:16.400> her

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
she was she's really adorable and her

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.369 
she was she's really adorable and her
head<00:03:17.609> is<00:03:17.639> kind<00:03:17.939> of<00:03:18.000> loose<00:03:18.180> though<00:03:18.530> it's<00:03:19.530> like

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
head is kind of loose though it's like

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.569 
head is kind of loose though it's like
but<00:03:22.379> I<00:03:22.409> think<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.769> strings<00:03:23.069> are<00:03:23.219> already

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
but I think the strings are already

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.929 
but I think the strings are already
fully<00:03:24.180> tightened<00:03:24.689> so<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.260> think<00:03:25.889> I'm<00:03:26.069> there's

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
fully tightened so I think I'm there's

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.610 
fully tightened so I think I'm there's
nothing<00:03:27.209> really<00:03:27.299> I<00:03:27.449> can<00:03:27.479> do<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.379> have<00:03:28.409> any
