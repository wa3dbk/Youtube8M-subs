00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.529 

and<00:06:01.680> when<00:06:01.800> it<00:06:01.889> actually<00:06:02.099> got<00:06:02.520> finished<00:06:03.030> I

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
and when it actually got finished I

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.369 
and when it actually got finished I
think<00:06:04.349> that<00:06:05.210> not<00:06:06.210> only<00:06:06.240> did<00:06:06.810> we<00:06:06.870> have<00:06:07.110> a

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
think that not only did we have a

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.959 
think that not only did we have a
feeling<00:06:07.860> of<00:06:07.979> satisfaction<00:06:08.189> but<00:06:08.999> I<00:06:09.270> think

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
feeling of satisfaction but I think

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.219 
feeling of satisfaction but I think
frankly<00:06:11.969> I<00:06:12.029> think<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.419> lot<00:06:12.599> of<00:06:12.629> the<00:06:12.810> people<00:06:12.990> that

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
frankly I think a lot of the people that

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.570 
frankly I think a lot of the people that
worked<00:06:13.439> on<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:13.740> building<00:06:14.069> had<00:06:14.219> the<00:06:14.370> same

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
worked on the building had the same

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.239 
worked on the building had the same
feeling<00:06:15.029> that<00:06:15.060> they<00:06:15.389> were<00:06:16.199> really<00:06:16.439> kind<00:06:16.710> of<00:06:16.949> it

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:17.249 
feeling that they were really kind of it

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:19.610 
feeling that they were really kind of it
was<00:06:17.430> a<00:06:17.460> building<00:06:17.849> that<00:06:17.999> was<00:06:18.180> somehow<00:06:18.419> a<00:06:18.930> little

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
was a building that was somehow a little

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.019 
was a building that was somehow a little
bit<00:06:19.770> different<00:06:20.249> than<00:06:20.400> most<00:06:20.550> of<00:06:20.789> the<00:06:20.909> other

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
bit different than most of the other

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:24.429 
bit different than most of the other
buildings<00:06:21.449> that<00:06:21.599> they<00:06:21.719> had<00:06:21.810> worked<00:06:22.020> on<00:06:23.330> but

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:24.439 
buildings that they had worked on but

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.350 
buildings that they had worked on but
then<00:06:25.439> of<00:06:25.860> course<00:06:25.889> some<00:06:26.460> of<00:06:26.580> the<00:06:26.639> recognitions

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
then of course some of the recognitions

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.330 
then of course some of the recognitions
started<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:28.219> it<00:06:29.219> was<00:06:29.580> really<00:06:30.029> I<00:06:31.340> think

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
started and it was really I think

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.450 
started and it was really I think
interesting<00:06:32.879> to<00:06:33.479> go<00:06:34.139> through<00:06:34.169> the<00:06:34.650> the<00:06:35.099> final

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
interesting to go through the the final

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.730 
interesting to go through the the final
phase<00:06:35.699> of<00:06:35.969> reaction<00:06:36.719> because<00:06:37.669> at<00:06:38.669> one<00:06:38.969> time<00:06:39.029> I

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
phase of reaction because at one time I

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.230 
phase of reaction because at one time I
felt<00:06:40.740> that<00:06:40.830> that<00:06:41.129> building<00:06:41.580> was<00:06:41.789> the<00:06:41.819> most

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
felt that that building was the most

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.059 
felt that that building was the most
important<00:06:42.930> thing<00:06:43.169> that<00:06:43.199> could<00:06:43.500> possibly<00:06:43.979> be

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
important thing that could possibly be

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.219 
important thing that could possibly be
done<00:06:44.250> and<00:06:45.590> and<00:06:46.590> now<00:06:46.830> that<00:06:47.039> it's<00:06:47.159> built<00:06:47.490> I

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
done and and now that it's built I

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.320 
done and and now that it's built I
realized<00:06:49.229> that<00:06:49.650> it<00:06:50.250> is<00:06:50.550> just<00:06:50.939> another

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
realized that it is just another

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.860 
realized that it is just another
building<00:06:51.840> that<00:06:52.370> is<00:06:53.370> an<00:06:53.550> expression<00:06:54.000> of<00:06:54.509> all

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
building that is an expression of all

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.149 
building that is an expression of all
these<00:06:55.110> different<00:06:55.529> people<00:06:55.710> that<00:06:56.069> were

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
these different people that were

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.719 
these different people that were
involved<00:06:56.639> with<00:06:56.759> it<00:06:56.939> that<00:06:58.219> helped<00:06:59.219> build<00:06:59.550> it

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
involved with it that helped build it

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.279 
involved with it that helped build it
then<00:07:00.029> and<00:07:00.300> were<00:07:00.659> able<00:07:00.749> to<00:07:00.900> experience<00:07:01.379> it<00:07:01.680> and

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
then and were able to experience it and

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.300 
then and were able to experience it and
and<00:07:04.289> realize<00:07:04.889> that<00:07:05.990> given<00:07:06.990> another<00:07:07.529> set<00:07:08.159> of

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
and realize that given another set of

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.480 
and realize that given another set of
circumstances<00:07:09.240> like<00:07:09.659> that<00:07:10.009> we<00:07:11.009> could<00:07:11.250> do

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
circumstances like that we could do

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.269 
circumstances like that we could do
another<00:07:11.819> Lake<00:07:12.750> point<00:07:13.110> tower<00:07:13.379> type<00:07:13.830> building

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:14.279 
another Lake point tower type building

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:18.320 
another Lake point tower type building
but<00:07:15.060> it<00:07:15.210> was<00:07:15.509> really<00:07:16.199> a<00:07:16.879> building<00:07:17.879> that<00:07:18.149> was<00:07:18.270> a

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
but it was really a building that was a

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.939 
but it was really a building that was a
little<00:07:18.689> bit<00:07:18.839> different<00:07:19.349> than<00:07:19.500> the<00:07:19.620> normal

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:19.949 
little bit different than the normal

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:22.909 
little bit different than the normal
building<00:07:20.339> to<00:07:20.699> build
