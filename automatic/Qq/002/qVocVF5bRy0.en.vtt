00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
in each one of the wells and then I'm

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.610 
in each one of the wells and then I'm
going<00:00:58.909> to<00:00:58.970> take<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.239> little<00:00:59.540> bit<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.989> baking

baking powder many times if muffins

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.000 
baking powder many times if muffins
don't<00:02:16.670> rise<00:02:16.990> correctly<00:02:17.990> it<00:02:18.200> can<00:02:18.410> be<00:02:18.590> because

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
don't rise correctly it can be because

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.820

going to fill it about half way and I'll
start<00:04:04.230> filling<00:04:04.650> these<00:04:05.040> wells<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.820> reason<00:04:06.269> I

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
start filling these wells the reason I

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.750 
start filling these wells the reason I
fill<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:06.959> half<00:04:07.470> way<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.250> want<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.610> make

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
fill it just half way is I want to make

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.319 
fill it just half way is I want to make
sure<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> get<00:04:09.930> enough<00:04:10.620> batter<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.519> each<00:04:12.120> of

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
sure that I get enough batter in each of

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.449 
sure that I get enough batter in each of
the<00:04:12.450> wells<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.320> fairly<00:04:13.769> evenly

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
the wells and that it's fairly evenly

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.940 
the wells and that it's fairly evenly
divided<00:04:15.090> if<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.930> have<00:04:16.140> some<00:04:16.410> wells<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.890> have

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
divided if you have some wells that have

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.770 
divided if you have some wells that have
a<00:04:17.100> lot<00:04:17.400> about<00:04:17.729> or<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.180> some<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.720> don't

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
a lot about or and some that don't

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.199 
a lot about or and some that don't
they're<00:04:19.320> not<00:04:19.350> going<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.739> bake<00:04:20.100> as<00:04:20.340> evenly<00:04:21.060> as

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
they're not going to bake as evenly as

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.390 
they're not going to bake as evenly as
you'd<00:04:21.600> like

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
you'd like

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.880 
you'd like
now<00:04:23.400> each<00:04:23.669> will<00:04:24.000> has<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.510> half<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.169> scoop<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.710> I

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
now each will has a half a scoop and I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.450 
now each will has a half a scoop and I
still<00:04:26.220> have<00:04:26.580> some<00:04:27.270> batter<00:04:27.570> left<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.890> then

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
still have some batter left and then

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.909 
still have some batter left and then
I'll<00:04:29.580> just<00:04:29.760> evenly<00:04:30.360> divide<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.200> up<00:04:31.530> just

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
I'll just evenly divide that up just

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.080 
I'll just evenly divide that up just
adding<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.460> bit<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:33.270> each<00:04:33.510> well<00:04:34.669> now<00:04:35.669> these<00:04:35.910> are

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
adding a bit to each well now these are

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.230 
adding a bit to each well now these are
about<00:04:36.320> 3/4<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.710> way<00:04:37.890> full<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.700> I've

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
about 3/4 of the way full and I've

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.900 
about 3/4 of the way full and I've
preheated<00:04:39.660> my<00:04:40.080> oven<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.620> 400<00:04:41.430> degrees<00:04:41.880> and

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
preheated my oven to 400 degrees and

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.909 
preheated my oven to 400 degrees and
these<00:04:42.360> are<00:04:42.539> going<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.750> bake<00:04:43.020> for<00:04:43.350> about<00:04:43.470> 15

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
these are going to bake for about 15

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.880 
these are going to bake for about 15
minutes<00:04:44.700> now<00:04:45.479> while<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.870> muffins<00:04:46.260> are<00:04:46.410> baking
