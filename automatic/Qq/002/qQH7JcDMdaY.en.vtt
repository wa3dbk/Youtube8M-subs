00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.700 
mode as you can see the inside the car
looking<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> door<00:01:39.930> handles<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.500> things

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
looking at the door handles and things

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170 
looking at the door handles and things
like<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.890> everything's<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.490> basic<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
like that everything's is basic as I

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.480 
like that everything's is basic as I
could<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.420> made<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.189> it's<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.340> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
could have made it and it's like that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.389 
could have made it and it's like that
every<00:01:44.880> car<00:01:45.829> reason<00:01:46.829> being<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.189> they

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
every car reason being I think they

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.410 
every car reason being I think they
wanted<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> worry<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
wanted you to worry more about the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.780 
wanted you to worry more about the
gameplay<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.259> working<00:01:49.710> better<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.189> I

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
gameplay and that working better and I

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.520 
gameplay and that working better and I
kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.720> kind<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.290> would

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
kind of like that I kind of like I would

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
kind of like that I kind of like I would
rather<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> game<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.780> graphics

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
rather have a game that the graphics

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.770 
rather have a game that the graphics
weren't<00:01:55.229> phenomenal<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.090> played<00:01:57.509> better

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
weren't phenomenal but it played better

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.950 
weren't phenomenal but it played better
and<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.380> definitely<00:01:58.469> does<00:01:58.799> play<00:01:58.950> better

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
and this definitely does play better

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.179 
and this definitely does play better
yeah<00:02:00.960> not<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.500> driveclub<00:02:01.799> where<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
yeah not like driveclub where the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.319 
yeah not like driveclub where the
graphics<00:02:02.490> are<00:02:02.579> great<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.969> can't<00:02:03.149> do

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
graphics are great and you can't do

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.670 
graphics are great and you can't do
anything<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:06.140> first<00:02:07.140> person<00:02:07.409> mode<00:02:07.500> here

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
anything on the first person mode here

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.190 
anything on the first person mode here
when<00:02:07.890> your<00:02:08.099> car<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> passenger<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.660> actually

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
when your car the passenger can actually

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.770 
when your car the passenger can actually
turn<00:02:10.920> around<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.730> shoot<00:02:12.420> through<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.629> back

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
turn around and shoot through the back

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.700 
turn around and shoot through the back
seat<00:02:13.110> which

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
seat which

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.740 
seat which
really<00:02:13.950> helps<00:02:14.340> when<00:02:15.120> you're<00:02:15.240> driving<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
really helps when you're driving and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
being chased by cops it at the aiming is

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080 
being chased by cops it at the aiming is
really<00:02:19.350> easy<00:02:19.470> with<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.490> course<00:02:20.520> using

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
really easy with it and of course using

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.000 
really easy with it and of course using
the<00:02:21.180> touchpad<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.290> controller<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.890> how

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the touchpad on the controller is how

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.620 
the touchpad on the controller is how
you<00:02:23.070> go<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.250> first-person<00:02:23.580> values<00:02:24.120> tap<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
you go to first-person values tap it and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.050 
you go to first-person values tap it and
you<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.900> change<00:02:25.080> your<00:02:25.290> view<00:02:26.220> modes<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.700> while

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
you can change your view modes and while

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.550 
you can change your view modes and while
you're<00:02:27.210> in<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.360> vehicle<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:28.140> swipe

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
you're in the vehicle you can just swipe

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.380 
you're in the vehicle you can just swipe
up<00:02:28.830> or<00:02:28.980> down<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.190> change<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.640> radio<00:02:29.880> stations

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
but they did add a lot of functionality

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.470 
but they did add a lot of functionality
the<00:02:39.990> touchpad<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.820> action<00:02:42.210> when<00:02:42.360> you're

too high like the screen blowers a
little<00:04:12.840> bit<00:04:13.010> now<00:04:14.010> watching<00:04:14.250> here<00:04:14.460> on<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.610> game

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
little bit now watching here on the game

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.280 
little bit now watching here on the game
on<00:04:14.940> as<00:04:15.030> I'm<00:04:15.180> watching<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.780> doesn't<00:04:15.930> look<00:04:16.080> as

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
on as I'm watching it it doesn't look as

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.630 
on as I'm watching it it doesn't look as
bad<00:04:16.320> but<00:04:16.650> what<00:04:16.890> you're<00:04:17.010> playing<00:04:17.280> for<00:04:17.400> some

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
bad but what you're playing for some

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.570 
bad but what you're playing for some
reason<00:04:17.910> it's<00:04:18.000> kind<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.180> hard<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:19.160> focus<00:04:20.160> right

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
reason it's kind of hard to focus right

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.180 
reason it's kind of hard to focus right
maybe<00:04:20.850> it's<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.060> me<00:04:21.270> I'm<00:04:21.390> not<00:04:21.480> really<00:04:21.600> sure

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
maybe it's just me I'm not really sure

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.110 
maybe it's just me I'm not really sure
but<00:04:23.190> then<00:04:23.340> again<00:04:23.430> they've<00:04:23.730> had<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.880> lot<00:04:24.090> of

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
but then again they've had a lot of

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.060 
but then again they've had a lot of
issues<00:04:24.330> as<00:04:24.600> well<00:04:24.750> I'm<00:04:24.960> not<00:04:25.080> sure<00:04:25.140> if<00:04:25.530> it's

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
issues as well I'm not sure if it's

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.379 
issues as well I'm not sure if it's
because<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.490> server<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.090> lot<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.240> you

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
because the server and a lot of you

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.839 
because the server and a lot of you
trying<00:04:27.629> to<00:04:27.689> get<00:04:27.780> on<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.860> did<00:04:29.009> take<00:04:29.189> me<00:04:29.219> a<00:04:29.370> full
