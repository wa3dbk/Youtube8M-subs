00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
not gonna ever be there I mean we could

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.159 
not gonna ever be there I mean we could
stay<00:04:14.090> there<00:04:14.269> raise<00:04:14.450> our<00:04:14.599> kids<00:04:14.780> there<00:04:14.930> but<00:04:15.079> we

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
stay there raise our kids there but we

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.050 
stay there raise our kids there but we
would<00:04:15.319> never<00:04:15.470> be<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:15.829> but<00:04:16.310> yet<00:04:16.489> we<00:04:16.609> have<00:04:16.639> this

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
would never be that but yet we have this

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.599 
would never be that but yet we have this
family<00:04:17.510> already<00:04:17.840> why<00:04:18.229> don't<00:04:18.470> we<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:19.280> know<00:04:19.400> why

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
family already why don't we you know why

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.430 
family already why don't we you know why
are<00:04:19.669> we<00:04:19.760> so<00:04:19.940> far<00:04:20.120> from<00:04:20.239> them<00:04:20.450> if<00:04:20.810> we<00:04:21.049> want<00:04:21.260> this

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
are we so far from them if we want this

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.370 
are we so far from them if we want this
feeling<00:04:21.739> they're<00:04:22.190> there<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:24.289> think

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
feeling they're there and so I think

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.110 
feeling they're there and so I think
that<00:04:24.560> was<00:04:24.800> one<00:04:25.070> of<00:04:25.099> the<00:04:25.220> reasons<00:04:25.430> we<00:04:25.490> went<00:04:25.640> back

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
that was one of the reasons we went back

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.370 
that was one of the reasons we went back
to<00:04:26.450> be<00:04:26.570> closer<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.930> our<00:04:26.990> family

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
to be closer to our family

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.810 
to be closer to our family
