cut my hair when it's straight is

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.980 
cut my hair when it's straight is

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
to where you want to cut it and I'm only

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.779 
to where you want to cut it and I'm only
going<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.370> cut<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:36.979> think<00:04:39.169> that<00:04:40.169> much<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.800> I

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
going to cut I think that much and I

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.790 
going to cut I think that much and I
only<00:04:42.060> recommend<00:04:42.479> that<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:42.930> cut<00:04:43.229> half<00:04:43.470> an<00:04:43.650> inch

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
only recommend that you cut half an inch

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.460 
only recommend that you cut half an inch
to<00:04:43.889> an<00:04:44.160> inch<00:04:44.400> because<00:04:44.760> it's<00:04:45.720> always<00:04:46.110> better<00:04:46.320> to

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
to an inch because it's always better to

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.790 
to an inch because it's always better to
cut<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:47.010> little<00:04:47.220> bit<00:04:47.370> then<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:49.229> cut<00:04:49.500> too<00:04:49.770> much

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
cut a little bit then to cut too much

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.279 
cut a little bit then to cut too much
and<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:51.000> can't<00:04:51.240> go<00:04:51.389> back<00:04:51.570> once<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:51.960> already
