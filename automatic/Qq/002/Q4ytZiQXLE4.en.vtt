00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.220
 learn how to make silicones step by step 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:17.279
 I calculated the necessary amount of 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.279
 silicone to perform your orthosis 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.940
 ah 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.080
 Spread the silicone evenly 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.080
 on his hand 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.460
 add the amount of catalyst 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.620
 corresponding to one drop per 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.620
 square centimeter of silicone 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:02.180
 to more energetically mixing so that 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.180
 be totally homogeneous 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.000
 be quick in the mix and do not let the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.000
 silicone begins to catalyze in your hand 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.810
 Y 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.070
 Y 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.690
 once the silicone has been mixed 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.940
 is ready for your application 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.940
 in a rounded way 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.520
 mold in the silicones on the foot of the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.729
 patient 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 Take special care not to leave 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.570
 useless cracks that can spoil the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.570
 Final product 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.250
 ah 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.959
 and 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.209
 after a few minutes we will have a 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.700
 silicone perfectly catalyzing 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.170
 we will have to check the elastic 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.170
 and the quality of it 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.380
 to 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.819
 silicone polo energy thanks you for your 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.819
 Attention
