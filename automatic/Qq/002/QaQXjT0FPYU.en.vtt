00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 good hello to all dear friends 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.450
 welcome back in the company of that 76 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.950
 second video after the first real the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.200
 support the tripod we saw 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.420
 inside the video how to shoot video 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500
 inside youtube with a discreet 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.449
 quality 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.029
 I spoke to you about the first step 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.660
 even before choosing ours 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.000
 support or a reflex or a 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.840
 camera or webcam 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 our computers 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.790
 we have to buy a tripod then 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 passed this step and here we go to the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.070
 next step the second or the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.070
 choice between a reflex machine 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.770
 photo that shoots videos or a webcam 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.899
 maybe in high definition for ours 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.730
 computers that are mac and that are 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.300
 windows and we always have the possibility 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.039
 to connect an external webcam you are 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.199
 now started to make videos maybe 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.510
 the webcam could be for you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.410
 because you only want to take it back 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.840
 make blogs make videos without infamy e 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.740
 without praise and therefore could do al 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.810
 your computer and this case 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.729
 there are many inside the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.979
 I will leave you some links from 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.140
 amazon to go to see you 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.659
 some camcorder maybe I'll wear 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.200
 the one in full hd so the quality will be 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.150
 best for your listeners and for 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 who watches your videos 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.430
 if instead you decide like me to make videos 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.659
 reviews maybe you need to pick up the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.340
 your smartphone 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.400
 maybe you have to go out of the house 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.350
 because anyway you want to run 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.659
 videorecensione also outside then 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.000
 in another kind of environment then 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.890
 you have to focus on a machine 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.430
 video camera that runs a 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.590
 camcorder or reflex then mine 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.140
 choice was very difficult and very 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.930
 studied and I have to thank two 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.229
 characters in primis andrea alesse 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.000
 blackjack tutorial that recommended me 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.680
 the canon eos 700 of which I have now 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.540
 in short, more or less advised me not 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.209
 so much this model but going to 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.760
 choose a reflex because according to him 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.450
 and now also in my opinion is one of the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.110
 seven best second must 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.420
 thank alex pick up the one who me 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.480
 is helping a lot in going to 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.030
 post producing my video and therefore not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.540
 go perform a montage done at 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.459
 modino with final cut pro hicks alex 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.709
 racuglia and also the inventor of pod 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.140
 cleaner which is an application that costs 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.629
 not even 3 euros can be found on 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.760
 various stores on the app store or otherwise vi 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.920
 I leave the link description a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.900
 a fabulous application because you 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.870
 bring your audio track and pot 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.470
 sail cleaner will edit the best then a 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.790
 click and it works wonderfully 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.120
 so let's start with our choice 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.940
 then camera that also shoots videos 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.400
 there are many cameras inside the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.190
 market that shoot videos in ways 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.409
 I would say discreet there are all the prices yes 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.040
 part from 200 euros you get even up 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.260
 to the 1800s of a semi reflex and that 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.269
 could be panasonic and gh 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.549
 four there are also machines 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.430
 photographic not really the panasonic is 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.489
 already h4 because otherwise we go to really a 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.040
 take an element that costs flower 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.750
 of money inside the big one 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.940
 distribution on amazon sum 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.489
 within the market you will find many 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.769
 cameras that shoot videos maybe 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.139
 you can also find a bridge that is a street 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.090
 half of a reflex is precisely one 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.530
 classic camera a compact camera 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.440
 maybe that's a better quality 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.730
 in short, they respect compactina however 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:52.410
 having a decent quality already passes i 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.599
 250 bar 350 euros so at least I do 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.540
 I found there there I said no 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.879
 video camera does not take it 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.639
 I'm talking about cameras or compact or bridge 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.430
 and then you have to see if I have the 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.500
 camcorders or reflex cameras that also run 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.659
 video regarding video cameras 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.400
 there are three brands that I recommend 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:16.989
 which are the panasonic are the canon 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.180
 and are the sony these three brands offer 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.669
 really incredible products inside 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.280
 of the market with regard to the 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.720
 price the quality even of the videos 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.419
 in short, they are three manufacturers of 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.190
 camcorders and really at the top 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.710
 which one to choose that is how we go to 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.960
 choose a video camera on the market 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.850
 it is not so simple we must also 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.430
 see what we want to do because 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.990
 even there we start at 199 euros 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.699
 you buy your video camera 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.100
 arrived home started a 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.169
 record your video and immediately have it 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.930
 core g and network that the audio is not perfect 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.669
 so first advice go and get 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.919
 a video camera that at the entrance for a 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.260
 external microphone or as in my case 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.990
 use a microphone from the jacket 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.930
 connected to our smartphone because 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.580
 any camera casket camcorder 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.010
 reflex pick up 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.410
 it takes an external audio because the audio 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.380
 by default that you find inside the 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:19.300
 of all these technological devices 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.650
 makes it so that if cameras though 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.710
 you want an external microphone then 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.750
 the entrance for a jack and not having to 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.349
 mount an audio that comes from another 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.860
 source 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.970
 she also goes over at least the three bars 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.250
 400 euros 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.440
 so everything goes according to yours 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.050
 then I wait for you in the comments there 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.220
 we recommend together on facebook there is not 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.250
 problem 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.620
 third step, that is to say regarding me 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.539
 the most difficult ever and go to 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.000
 buy a reflex to shoot videos 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.070
 first of all it costs so much because one 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.880
 reflex must fit lenses 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.310
 secondary 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.260
 you need to put an external microphone 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.110
 we must know how to focus by hand 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.550
 because making videos with autofocus does 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.770
 really worth it 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.009
 there is so much post production there is so much 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.710
 of artificial lighting with 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.599
 in short, lamps may be the step 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.150
 more difficult to go to choose one 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.449
 reflex to make videos because they are there 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.280
 even from 399 on the market however they have 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.139
 so many limitations may not have 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.470
 then the input with external microphone 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:27.830
 a very accurate choice is needed 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.569
 if you choose a reflex for me 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.430
 the most beautiful choice ever because 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:33.470
 I will have the chance to take pictures in high 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.690
 quality or the possibility of learning 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.610
 in any case, a trade or in doing 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.139
 video in focus by hand 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.289
 in going to choose my goals 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.270
 not have a fabulous quality so I have 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.550
 chose the reflex of the most choice 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.620
 difficult and more wrong because 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.539
 begins to do see now but I will 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.409
 I also talk about what was right 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.449
 for me 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:56.650
 maybe for you just the webcam is enough 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:59.930
 for your mac or windows 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.479
 in short, these were a bit of a mini-summary 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.180
 I recommend what I have chosen you 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.080
 memory that awaits you inside the 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.580
