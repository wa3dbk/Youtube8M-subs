washing<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.320> then<00:01:15.190> after<00:01:15.729> they<00:01:15.850> wash<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.330> I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
washing and then after they wash it I

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.029 
washing and then after they wash it I
think<00:01:16.450> they<00:01:16.630> do<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:16.810> about<00:01:16.929> two<00:01:17.259> times<00:01:17.530> it

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
think they do it about two times it

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.609 
think they do it about two times it
becomes<00:01:18.220> this<00:01:18.640> dark<00:01:19.000> or<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:20.320> darker

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
becomes this dark or a little darker

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.940 
becomes this dark or a little darker
yellow<00:01:20.649> it's<00:01:21.429> almost<00:01:21.820> like<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.060> bluish<00:01:22.950> does

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
yellow it's almost like a bluish does

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.800 
yellow it's almost like a bluish does

because the waist doesn't it's not as
form<00:03:17.860> fitting<00:03:18.160> because<00:03:18.340> I'd<00:03:18.610> like<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.030> be<00:03:19.150> I

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
form fitting because I'd like it to be I

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.840 
form fitting because I'd like it to be I
do<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.930> bigger<00:03:20.080> butt<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:20.590> these<00:03:21.070> pants<00:03:21.520> do

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
do have a bigger butt so these pants do

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.530 
do have a bigger butt so these pants do
let<00:03:22.690> my<00:03:22.810> butt<00:03:23.050> fill<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.410> but<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:25.030> waist<00:03:25.270> is

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
pictures that I'm showing you the thing

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.560 
pictures that I'm showing you the thing
is<00:03:32.530> if<00:03:32.740> I<00:03:32.860> got<00:03:33.100> any<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.820> smaller<00:03:34.180> pair<00:03:34.450> of

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
pants my butt wouldn't fit and therefore

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.790 
pants my butt wouldn't fit and therefore
I<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:37.240> would<00:03:37.630> have<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.930> get<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.260> next<00:03:38.500> size<00:03:38.530> up
