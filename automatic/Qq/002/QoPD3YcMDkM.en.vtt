00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
survival not creative mode and this is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.880 
survival not creative mode and this is
basically<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.000> roller<00:00:27.300> coaster<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.500> made

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
basically a roller coaster that I made

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.440 
basically a roller coaster that I made
and<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.970> might<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.660> making<00:00:31.050> more<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.090> maybe<00:00:33.090> make

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and I might be making more so maybe make

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.840 
and I might be making more so maybe make
a<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.600> theme<00:00:34.079> park<00:00:34.410> down<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.160> but

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
a little theme park down here but

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.729 
a little theme park down here but
basically<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> ever

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
basically this is the first one I ever

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.760 
basically this is the first one I ever
made<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.239> game<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.870> think<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.590> pretty

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
made in the game I think it's pretty

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
made in the game I think it's pretty
cool<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.739> basically<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:45.590> guess<00:00:46.590> I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
cool so basically here it is I guess I

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
cool so basically here it is I guess I
probably<00:00:46.950> should<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.340> put<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.930> word

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
probably should have put the the word

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.689 
probably should have put the the word
drop<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.739> all<00:00:49.890> capital<00:00:50.280> letters<00:00:50.309> too<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
drop in all capital letters too but it

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.610 
drop in all capital letters too but it
looks<00:00:53.699> okay<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.390> I'll<00:00:54.539> fix<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.960> later<00:00:55.140> but

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
looks okay like I'll fix that later but

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.209 
looks okay like I'll fix that later but
obsidian<00:00:56.129> takes<00:00:56.399> forever<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.620> break<00:00:58.620> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
obsidian takes forever to break so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.810 
obsidian takes forever to break so
basically<00:00:59.730> here<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:01.309> I'm<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> put<00:01:02.699> on

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
basically here we go I'm going to put on

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.660 
basically here we go I'm going to put on
the<00:01:02.940> minecart<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:06.170> basically<00:01:07.170> go<00:01:07.680> so

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the minecart here and basically go so

00:01:08.670 --> 00:02:54.390 
the minecart here and basically go so
here<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.240> is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:22.100 

you

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:40.640 

you

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.550 

okay<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:42.489> was<00:03:42.640> basically<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.840> I

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
okay so that was basically it and I

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.860 
okay so that was basically it and I
didn't<00:03:45.519> know<00:03:45.610> if<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.849> guys<00:03:45.879> noticed<00:03:46.390> but

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
didn't know if you guys noticed but

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.470 
didn't know if you guys noticed but
earlier<00:03:47.860> over<00:03:48.610> there<00:03:48.879> a<00:03:49.659> cow<00:03:50.170> blocked<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.549> how

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
earlier over there a cow blocked the how

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.550 
earlier over there a cow blocked the how
I<00:03:52.510> think<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:52.900> was<00:03:53.049> blocked<00:03:53.409> the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
I think it was blocked the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.039 
I think it was blocked the
roller-coaster<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:55.599> would<00:03:55.720> have<00:03:55.810> been<00:03:55.930> so

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
roller-coaster and I would have been so

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.729 
roller-coaster and I would have been so
mad<00:03:56.700> but<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.730> guess<00:03:57.909> I<00:03:58.420> kind<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:58.989> just<00:03:59.170> went<00:03:59.409> back

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
mad but I guess I kind of just went back

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.780 
mad but I guess I kind of just went back
on<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.430> bounce<00:04:01.060> back<00:04:01.360> part<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:02.489> guess<00:04:03.489> it's<00:04:03.700> a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
on the bounce back part so guess it's a

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.610 
on the bounce back part so guess it's a
little<00:04:03.819> added<00:04:04.239> feature<00:04:04.599> there<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.500> the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
little added feature there and on the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.880 
little added feature there and on the
back<00:04:05.829> oh<00:04:05.860> well<00:04:06.720> went<00:04:07.720> backwards<00:04:08.140> for<00:04:08.379> yes<00:04:08.590> but

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
back oh well went backwards for yes but

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.759 
back oh well went backwards for yes but
um<00:04:09.269> basically<00:04:10.269> if<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:11.049> wondering<00:04:11.530> why<00:04:11.709> this

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
um basically if you wondering why this

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.479 
um basically if you wondering why this
wall<00:04:12.250> was<00:04:12.489> here<00:04:12.849> it's<00:04:13.629> actually<00:04:14.620> because<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
wall was here it's actually because the

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.629 
wall was here it's actually because the
animals<00:04:16.209> would<00:04:16.600> keep<00:04:16.840> getting<00:04:17.139> in<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.350> way<00:04:17.500> so

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
animals would keep getting in the way so

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.509 
animals would keep getting in the way so
the<00:04:18.639> railroad<00:04:19.060> track<00:04:19.269> wouldn't<00:04:19.630> work<00:04:19.810> so<00:04:20.519> I

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
the railroad track wouldn't work so I

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.370 
the railroad track wouldn't work so I
just<00:04:21.669> put<00:04:21.729> those<00:04:21.940> up<00:04:22.000> there<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:23.110> did<00:04:23.289> help

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
just put those up there and it did help

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.340 
just put those up there and it did help
a<00:04:23.530> lot<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:24.220> as<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:24.639> see<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.210> cow<00:04:26.020> that's

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
a lot but as you can see a cow that's

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.490 
a lot but as you can see a cow that's
one<00:04:27.340> over<00:04:27.580> there<00:04:27.729> that<00:04:27.940> i'm<00:04:28.120> going<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.449> kill

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.840 

blocked<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.919> roller<00:04:33.100> coaster<00:04:33.520> for<00:04:33.669> me

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
blocked the roller coaster for me

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.409 
blocked the roller coaster for me
although<00:04:34.419> it<00:04:35.050> did<00:04:35.229> turn<00:04:35.410> out<00:04:35.560> pretty<00:04:35.770> well<00:04:36.419> but

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
although it did turn out pretty well but

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.330 
although it did turn out pretty well but
yeah<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.169> was<00:04:38.260> basically<00:04:38.470> my<00:04:38.830> roller

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
yeah that was basically my roller

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.900 
yeah that was basically my roller
coaster<00:04:40.030> in<00:04:40.350> Minecraft<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:41.710> i'll<00:04:42.610> probably

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
coaster in Minecraft and i'll probably

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.260 
coaster in Minecraft and i'll probably
make<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.270> few<00:04:43.449> more<00:04:44.789> make<00:04:45.789> like<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.030> whole

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
make a few more make like a whole

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.129 
make a few more make like a whole
amusement<00:04:46.780> park<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:47.470> as<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.160> can<00:04:48.370> see<00:04:49.139> i'm

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
amusement park and as you can see i'm

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.860 
amusement park and as you can see i'm
terrible<00:04:50.500> at<00:04:50.620> killing<00:04:51.010> cows<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.789> animals<00:04:52.539> and

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
terrible at killing cows and animals and

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.710 
terrible at killing cows and animals and
stuff<00:04:53.280> because<00:04:54.280> i'm<00:04:54.610> lagging<00:04:54.910> terribly<00:04:55.449> but
