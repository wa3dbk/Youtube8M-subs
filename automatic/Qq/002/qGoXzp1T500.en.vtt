00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.579
 It deals with the indicators in the 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.010
 car 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.409
 its function is very simple if we click 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 the letter zeta of the keyboard will activate the 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.909
 left intermittent will stay like this 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.940

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.949
 let's press the shift letter if we press the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.409
 letter c we will activate the intermittent 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.439
 right of the car or also of the motorbike 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.659
 the same shift to remove it if 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.030
 we press the X, activate the two 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.770
 intermittent at the same time thing that is usually 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.929
 do in real life to leave the car 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.670
 double row waiting to signal 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.200
 that you are going to park in an area not 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 allowed the most 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.299
 cif to remove it then we have in the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.819
 way to include some flashers for 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.130
 reverse when you brake nothing happens 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.709
 but if you reverse you will turn on 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.840
 the white lights as you can see 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.759
 the mode is not just for you if a 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.709
 character of the game wants to turn a 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.159
 side will tell you by activating the 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.159

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.760

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.120

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.370

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.380
