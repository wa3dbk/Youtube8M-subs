 before jumping you need to choose clothes 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.710
 it should be durable and comfortable 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.070

 life for so long did not write ending with 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.420
 we immediately started preparing the papers 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.380
 the instructor immediately began to joke so artur 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.380
 wear overalls 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.569

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:44.209
 I was interested in security issues 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.269
 suspension system how to gain a foothold on it 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.939
 parachute we will have one parachute for 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.049
 two he our some this system 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:56.239
 reliable is a very reliable fashion axes in 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.959
 Basically hippopotamus appears on 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.999
 statistics 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.430
 work accidents are many 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:04.159
 it was a friend pour accidents on 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.090
 production we haven't been here yet 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.879
 will be instructed as it seemed to me should 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.829
 was take at least half an hour i think 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.680
 that I will be tormented by theory and long 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.669
 complex terms and at least will show not 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.489
 reserve parachute 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.180
 now the most important instruction on all 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.699
 will be 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.010
 we are getting on the plane 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:27.709
 height of 4 kilometers and jump with a parachute 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.790
 But in general, that's all, but before 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.099
 I jump you just in case 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.810
 I will fasten myself with four carbines and 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.919
 will be behind you for 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.169
 all of our exploits and that's all a bit 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.150
 don't forget without me don't jump backwards 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.310
 no instructor said i need to jump here i 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.919
 already I understand the system just that all 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.370
 don't you have to jump one hundred 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:51.280
 percent if that redeem does not care 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.739
 the longest is waiting during 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.819
 who was also constantly joking for a long time 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:02.080
 forget about pampers divisions collar wore 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.299

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.579
 minutes cook but real jim-jams 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.049
 appeared already on boarding the plane by the way 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.549
 saying the captain of the aircraft 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.549
 turned out to be a woman 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.350
 to the right height, we went literally 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.390
 ten minutes with me 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.520
 jumping girl who also started 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.520
 relive this excitement passed on to me 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.590
 but 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.410
 and here he awaited with nothing 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.699
 comparable step down here already as they say 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.699
 No comments 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.940
 already subject 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.040
 probably this is the most well or one of the most 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.650
 unforgettable 5 minutes in my life 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.240
 first hit the clouds seconds inside 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.310
 it feels like a cold shower 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.100
 which suddenly stops and you 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.790
 will stay literally between heaven 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.430
 and land 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.690
 the most interesting thing is that at this moment you are not 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.360
 you can think about anything 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.910
 your thoughts focus only on yours 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.430
 feeling weightless by the way only on 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.200
 earth I learned that the highest speed 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.630
 which I scored during the flight 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.850
 amounted to two hundred and twelve kilometers in 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.370
 hour for comparison the highest speed 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.360
 who traveled by car just two hundred 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.130
 nine kilometers 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.020
 they gave me an incredible feeling 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.930
 direct parachutes made one 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.510
 rotation around its axis I did not want it 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.300

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.970
