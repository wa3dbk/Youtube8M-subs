00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:04.599
 Hello people manufacturer for this frequently I have this time no let's play 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.209
 No power on the Main No I have a minibus 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.679
 if he is so gold tricot her video 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.599
 I would like to show how a small supplement could build instructions 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.749
 with the here 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.960
 pretty much everyone 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 Nusser was probably driving for example 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.339
 I gave her some stones I place her these stones here in such a place 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.060
 Arrangement here 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.480
 by Matthias Chapman 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.640
 So I got her three stones in a row with two each 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.090
 and then I have 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.100
 in between, sometimes distance 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.470
 Here again, pick stone also placed in the web flint 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 So take the stones and set 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 and classify each 4 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 not only by her this story in Thale 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.750
 the donations with samples 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.250
 Of course, Lena Christian unused you can arrange that differently 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.930
 but important is the number of 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.510
 be in at least five stones 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.880
 nine he placed it here between trend that the stones 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.340
 be provided with Maggie 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.990
 GÃ¶tz Cathedral 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.640
 here 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 and I am here now one 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.180
 Milestone that happened 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 the torches begin to flash 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.760
 and you certainly know the effect 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.260
 Redstone 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.890
 open and close the doors 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.810
 and that's what we're doing with this construction to the user we place 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.259
 like a door 19 quoted on withdrawal 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.450
 comes not yet so extreme view ick but that probably happens at the end of March 5 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.610
 percent 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 virtually untouched not recognized 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.680
 Often hoping to stalemate now leads to fourth place in the spring arrested 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.119
 Dr gradually change will have consequences 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.319
 the friend continues to be friendly 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.319
 the starting field 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.599
 definitely make 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.629
 That should work if I go over here now 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.629
 then we will not hear any more 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.599
 you can have this construction 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.679
 expand now 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.089
 do that now 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.089
 as an an example 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979
 Fri. 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.039
 AFP 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.849
 distant past 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.849
 tried from house no 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.379
 I just hope that I caught that again 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.829
 if in the future we often play games for January or even very good 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.889
 m with Mueller describes that is then 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.599
 Moving and perhaps to the one or the other small video in this direction 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.159
 can make 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.560
 and otherwise look if you have questions 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.909
 in my block over there of course there are the kilos 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.930
 bullish so the most important questions around 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.039
 May have been my last passport and so on 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.099
 Gold brought 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.909
 m 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.430
 From time to time this development is also extended say if I have a question 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.469
 have 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.279
 Not 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.889
 around 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.150
 and the question if percent do not know before 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.199
 my effects could be found that the 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.909
 the stocks have to jump 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 It means that I have fallen again please ask 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.999
 Spelling comments what do you think of this construction 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.729
 Yes, we'll see you last year
