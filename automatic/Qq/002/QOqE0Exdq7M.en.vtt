gross<00:00:43.859> and<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.250> should<00:00:44.399> not<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.670> treated<00:00:45.030> as

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
they're clearly undergarments I

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.720 
they're clearly undergarments I
personally<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.469> leggings<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.190> disgusting

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730

wearing<00:00:56.010> them<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.250> pants<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.969> might<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.210> well

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
wearing them as pants you might as well

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.520 
wearing them as pants you might as well
just<00:00:57.480> not<00:00:57.539> even<00:00:57.840> wear<00:00:57.960> pants<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.440> gonna

think it depends on the butt whether you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.260 
think it depends on the butt whether you
can<00:01:04.019> wear<00:01:04.199> leggings<00:01:04.560> as<00:01:04.830> pants<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.340> as<00:01:06.180> a
