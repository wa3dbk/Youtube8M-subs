00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.180 
we have a lot of trips throughout the
year<00:01:46.210> something<00:01:46.690> like<00:01:46.840> 50<00:01:47.290> or<00:01:47.410> 60<00:01:47.890> trip

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
year something like 50 or 60 trip

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.300 
year something like 50 or 60 trip
convoys<00:01:48.670> per<00:01:49.060> year<00:01:49.590> most<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.770> our<00:01:50.830> trips<00:01:51.130> have

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
convoys per year most of our trips have

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.740 
convoys per year most of our trips have
multiple<00:01:51.790> convoys<00:01:52.180> on<00:01:52.390> them<00:01:52.540> these<00:01:52.690> days

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
multiple convoys on them these days

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.500 
multiple convoys on them these days
typically<00:01:53.590> being<00:01:53.860> 68<00:01:54.490> or<00:01:54.700> maybe<00:01:54.970> even<00:01:55.180> 10

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
typically being 68 or maybe even 10

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.450 
typically being 68 or maybe even 10
depending<00:01:55.900> on<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.140> difficulty<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.220> trip

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
depending on the difficulty of the trip

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.270 
depending on the difficulty of the trip
but<00:01:57.670> basically<00:01:58.060> we<00:01:58.240> run<00:01:58.450> trips<00:01:58.930> from<00:01:59.410> every

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
but basically we run trips from every

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.340 
but basically we run trips from every
expertise<00:02:00.970> level<00:02:01.180> from<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:01.600> full<00:02:01.810> driving

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
expertise level from a full driving

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.140 
expertise level from a full driving
perspective<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.490> vehicle<00:02:03.820> setup

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
perspective and a vehicle setup

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.700 
perspective and a vehicle setup
perspective<00:02:04.750> because<00:02:05.020> obviously<00:02:05.260> there's<00:02:05.680> a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
perspective because obviously there's a

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.900 
perspective because obviously there's a
lot<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.890> people<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.280> want<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.490> get<00:02:06.580> out<00:02:06.760> there

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
and do things that maybe not have a

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.130 
and do things that maybe not have a
weekend<00:02:09.160> weapon<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.700> something<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.660> extreme

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
weekend weapon and something to extreme
