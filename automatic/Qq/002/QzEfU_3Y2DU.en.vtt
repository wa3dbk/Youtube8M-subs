stick<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> bottom<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.860> bit

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
stick to the bottom because a little bit

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
stick to the bottom because a little bit
difficulty<00:01:41.520> messed<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> fork<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.750> into
