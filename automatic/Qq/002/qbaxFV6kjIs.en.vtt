00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
little short piece goes in between and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:31.759 
little short piece goes in between and
then<00:02:14.300> your<00:02:14.480> bottom<00:02:14.750> ones<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.380> base

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.619 

like<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:35.219> alright<00:02:36.219> if<00:02:36.370> there<00:02:36.519> are<00:02:36.640> some<00:02:36.939> some

like so alright if there are some some

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.360 
like so alright if there are some some
gaps<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:38.170> here<00:02:38.379> don't<00:02:38.680> worry<00:02:38.829> about<00:02:38.889> it<00:02:39.189> your

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
gaps in here don't worry about it your

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.360 
gaps in here don't worry about it your
ashes<00:02:39.579> are<00:02:39.909> gonna<00:02:40.000> fill<00:02:40.329> in<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.930> that'll<00:02:41.200> be

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
ashes are gonna fill in and that'll be

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.240 
ashes are gonna fill in and that'll be
insulation<00:02:42.840> against<00:02:43.840> your<00:02:43.930> firebox<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:45.040> fire

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
insulation against your firebox the fire

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.550 
insulation against your firebox the fire
bricks<00:02:45.549> retain<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.329> heat<00:02:46.510> they<00:02:47.049> help<00:02:47.260> reflect

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
bricks retain the heat they help reflect

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.220 
bricks retain the heat they help reflect
that<00:02:47.889> heat<00:02:48.159> back<00:02:48.459> into<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:49.000> fire<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:50.019> they

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
that heat back into the fire and they

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.429 
that heat back into the fire and they
also<00:02:50.469> protect<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.730> sides<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.299> stove<00:02:52.569> and

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
also protect the sides of the stove and

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.500 
also protect the sides of the stove and
as<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.829> fire<00:02:54.040> starts<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.519> burn<00:02:54.669> down<00:02:54.909> and<00:02:55.269> cool

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
as the fire starts to burn down and cool

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.110 
as the fire starts to burn down and cool
off<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.530> fire<00:02:57.040> bricks<00:02:57.310> will<00:02:57.549> retain<00:02:57.909> that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
off the fire bricks will retain that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.170 
off the fire bricks will retain that
heat<00:02:58.180> long<00:02:58.659> so<00:02:59.019> it'll<00:02:59.879> continue<00:03:00.879> to<00:03:01.000> produce

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
heat long so it'll continue to produce

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.690 
heat long so it'll continue to produce
heat<00:03:01.510> out<00:03:01.689> into<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.019> room<00:03:02.250> all<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.370> have<00:03:03.519> left

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
heat out into the room all we have left

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.069 
heat out into the room all we have left
to<00:03:03.819> do<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.030> put<00:03:04.299> our<00:03:04.419> door<00:03:04.629> on<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:07.980> drop<00:03:08.980> those

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
to do is put our door on and drop those

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.830 
to do is put our door on and drop those
under<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.169> pins<00:03:15.329> there<00:03:16.329> are<00:03:16.450> some<00:03:16.599> cotter

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
under the pins there are some cotter

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.789 
under the pins there are some cotter
pins<00:03:17.169> that<00:03:17.319> go<00:03:17.469> in<00:03:17.620> there<00:03:22.109> our<00:03:23.109> installation
