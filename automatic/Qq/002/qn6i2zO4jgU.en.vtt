00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:09.250
 but do not worry about everything 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.210
 from her she is the one that is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.199
 in love person who writes the subjects 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.100
 and produces the photographs of mixco and 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.100
 direct videos 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.500
 Y 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.500
 who values ​​from others 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.380
 What is it 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.470
 and not material after two years of 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.390
 prison well, well, I went to hide 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.390
 a little while writing the songs 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.460
 of course not 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.880
 and I think we all always have like 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 that 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.950
 that masquerade that we moved dmt 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.729
 the people we want for what 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.350
 and pride or ego are things that 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.490
 human beings we have a chip in the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.170
 head to control certain things that do not 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.540
 we allow ourselves not even sometimes 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.700
 we forgive 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.820
 that's why I identify so much with this 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.820
 song because when I learned to forgive 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.720
 I composed the song then when you ask 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.450
 sorry 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.970
 Many times you are not to blame 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.380
 doors of life open to you from another 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.380
 way and you become a 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.159
 with this and much more 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.159
 sensitive are 0 and simple 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.100
 out of nothing by the press 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.270
 well I think being a pop artist 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.369
 being always there 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.700
 because when you're a pop artist too 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.700
 you are much more open to criticism and 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.840
 somehow much more in front of the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.430
 media 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.269
 and pro has been a bit complicated 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.680
 for me to suffer but of course I learned to 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.410
 forgive and now I'm in another stage 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.750
 different and I learned also left 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.670
 it matters finally what they say or not 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.310
 you have to be very aware of who 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.800
 that's why I never give explanations 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.120
 because my life is my life 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.030
 who likes to believe 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.069
 I'm sorry 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.349
 and nothing I am, I am who I am, I give them 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.569
 When I do not do it, it 's because I do not have 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.810
 nothing of what 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.760
 to say nothing and when I have what 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.270
 talk I love talking to the press and 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.300
 I love 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.770
 and tell them what I was doing in the 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.230
 that I am very focused that now 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.320
 obviously it 's in catharsis for the only thing 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.830
 what I come to earth is that the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.340
 people learn from me that they enjoy that my 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.170
 music forms important stages in a 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.170
 important stage in life 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:32.599
 and it ends up exploding 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.520
 you can not relate
