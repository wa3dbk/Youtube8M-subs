desktop and safe and this is going to be

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.330 
desktop and safe and this is going to be
the<00:04:40.540> pond<00:04:40.780> of<00:04:40.900> shul<00:04:41.110> in<00:04:41.139> work<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.950> just<00:04:42.190> looks

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
the pond of shul in work it just looks

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.090 
the pond of shul in work it just looks
like<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.169> I'm<00:04:44.169> going<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.380> speed<00:04:44.770> up<00:04:44.800> this

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
like that and I'm going to speed up this

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.830 
like that and I'm going to speed up this
whole<00:04:45.280> process<00:04:45.520> for<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.030> because<00:04:46.240> you'll<00:04:46.720> get

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
whole process for you because you'll get

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:57.450 
whole process for you because you'll get
bored<00:04:47.020> if<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.260> just<00:04:47.410> watch<00:04:47.530> this

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.740 

at<00:04:58.460> this<00:04:58.699> point<00:04:58.909> it'd<00:04:59.120> be<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.300> good<00:04:59.419> idea<00:04:59.509> to

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
at this point it'd be a good idea to

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.290 
at this point it'd be a good idea to
plug<00:05:00.050> in<00:05:00.259> your<00:05:00.560> Apple<00:05:00.979> TV<00:05:01.009> into<00:05:01.699> your<00:05:01.819> computer

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
plug in your Apple TV into your computer

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.350 
plug in your Apple TV into your computer

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
while the custom firmware is being built

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.439 
while the custom firmware is being built
and<00:05:06.069> eventually<00:05:07.069> punished<00:05:07.490> will<00:05:07.759> will<00:05:08.060> alert

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
and eventually punished will will alert

pretend like I didn't do anything to it
and<00:05:37.909> you'll<00:05:38.479> notice<00:05:38.690> it'll<00:05:38.960> give<00:05:39.229> me<00:05:39.349> an<00:05:39.440> error

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
it basically does the exact same thing

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.480 
it basically does the exact same thing
while<00:05:48.319> it's<00:05:48.469> connected<00:05:48.830> into<00:05:49.009> itune<00:05:49.279> then

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
while it's connected into itune then

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.320

find<00:05:55.159> the<00:05:55.490> correct<00:05:55.669> custom<00:05:56.569> firmware<00:05:56.930> that

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
find the correct custom firmware that

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.279 
find the correct custom firmware that
you<00:05:57.110> just<00:05:57.289> created<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:58.569> it's<00:05:59.569> going<00:05:59.900> to<00:06:00.020> do

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
you just created and it's going to do

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.920 
you just created and it's going to do
the<00:06:00.409> restore<00:06:00.590> process<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:01.479> looks<00:06:02.479> like<00:06:02.690> this

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
the restore process and looks like this

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.480 
the restore process and looks like this
it<00:06:03.169> just<00:06:03.199> sped<00:06:03.590> it<00:06:03.740> up<00:06:03.800> or<00:06:04.009> actually<00:06:04.250> just<00:06:04.370> made

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
it just sped it up or actually just made

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.010 
it just sped it up or actually just made
screenshot<00:06:05.029> so<00:06:05.240> that<00:06:05.389> way<00:06:05.509> it<00:06:05.629> would<00:06:05.719> be<00:06:05.870> super

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
screenshot so that way it would be super

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.490
