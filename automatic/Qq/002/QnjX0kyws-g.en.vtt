can remind you what they were right
here's<00:01:29.299> how<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.540> program<00:01:29.810> this<00:01:30.110> thing<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
here's how you program this thing in the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.270 
here's how you program this thing in the
back<00:01:31.720> when<00:01:32.720> it's<00:01:32.840> open<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.470> back<00:01:33.680> side<00:01:33.979> of

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
back when it's open in the back side of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.600 
back when it's open in the back side of
the<00:01:34.790> tumbler<00:01:35.630> mechanism<00:01:36.200> there<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.890> little

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
the tumbler mechanism there is a little

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.870 
the tumbler mechanism there is a little
pin<00:01:38.030> located<00:01:38.869> right<00:01:39.290> in<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.439> middle<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.920> it

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
pin located right in the middle and it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.840 
pin located right in the middle and it
actuates<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.900> tumbler<00:01:42.320> mechanism<00:01:42.890> now<00:01:43.640> this

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
actuates the tumbler mechanism now this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.730 
actuates the tumbler mechanism now this
needs<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.150> be<00:01:44.270> lifted<00:01:44.899> all<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.290> way<00:01:45.409> up<00:01:45.530> that's

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
needs to be lifted all the way up that's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.280 
needs to be lifted all the way up that's
why<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:45.920> need<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> pen<00:01:46.369> or<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.549> tiny<00:01:46.850> screwdriver

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
why you need a pen or a tiny screwdriver

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.660 
why you need a pen or a tiny screwdriver
now<00:01:48.290> when<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:48.560> insert<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:51.189> screwdriver<00:01:52.189> tip

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
now when you insert the screwdriver tip

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.789 
now when you insert the screwdriver tip
in<00:01:52.850> there<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.119> can<00:01:53.270> feel<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:53.720> lift<00:01:53.960> up<00:01:54.170> and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
in there you can feel it lift up and

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.760 
in there you can feel it lift up and
it's<00:01:54.920> at<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.220> point<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.329> can<00:01:56.509> change<00:01:56.869> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
it's at that point you can change the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.679 
it's at that point you can change the
numbers<00:01:58.189> gotta<00:01:58.700> face<00:01:58.969> it<00:01:59.000> towards<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.570> because

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
numbers gotta face it towards it because

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.690 
numbers gotta face it towards it because
it's<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.049> numbers<00:02:00.320> on<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.560> front<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:00.979> count

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
it's the numbers on the front that count

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.440 
it's the numbers on the front that count
once<00:02:02.689> you<00:02:02.810> let<00:02:02.960> go<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.320> pin<00:02:03.909> it's<00:02:04.909> set<00:02:05.210> and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
once you let go to pin it's set and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.450 
once you let go to pin it's set and
you'll<00:02:05.600> know<00:02:05.750> right<00:02:05.780> away<00:02:06.110> because<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.159> pins

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
you'll know right away because the pins

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.280 
you'll know right away because the pins
will<00:02:08.090> be<00:02:08.239> able<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.509> actuate<00:02:08.869> with<00:02:09.110> these

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
will be able to actuate with these
