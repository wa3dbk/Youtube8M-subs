00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.430
 you make a pie 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.080
 today when you buy 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.540
 apples there are many intermediaries 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.580
 between you and the producer a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.460
 supermarket a wholesaler a cooperative 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.020
 sometimes even a half wholesalers a 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.440
 side you pay dearly the product of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.060
 the other 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.590
 the producer is poorly paid for his 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 work the hive that says yes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.109
 shortened the circuit between you and the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.760
 producer then what is a hive 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.199
 a hive is a relay point installed 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.710
 in an individual allowing the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.600
 direct trade with producers 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.559
 so the trial of the hive that says yes 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.690
 it is to favor local actors and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.190
 therefore to benefit from products that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.460
 come from close so products 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.219
 which are super fresh and limiting the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.020
 number of intermediaries the hive that says 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.910
 yes can guarantee prices that are 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 just for both producers and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.510
 for members the bees of the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.550
 hive 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.550
 my role was initially to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.440
 recruit to make understand the system 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.730
 from the hive to suppliers of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.729
 artisans of local producers 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.400
 and then also to find members 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.040
 bees from the hive and animate this 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.200
 network this community of producers 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.570
 craftsmen and members after one year 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.909
 of existence 150 hives are active on 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.509
 the French territory and 350 are in 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.729
 construction 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.580
 it is a mode of consumption that pleases 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.200
 and that piques curiosity because here 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.990
 the reception is as important as the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.570
 service 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.079
 today so there are about 800 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.430
 people registered in the hive a lot 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.130
 out of curiosity 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.470
 and people who order 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.910
 members who order between 30 and 50 per 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.030
 order per week the principle of 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.200
 hive it's completely free and that's them 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.330
 simply engage to receive 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.770
 information once a week and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.960
 then after ordering if you want to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 order and what you want to order 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.110
 that is, each person creates 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.110
 his basket to his measure 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.010
 the hive that says yes so this is a 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.950
 short distribution circuit a 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.450
 total freedom to order or not but 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.430
 are there other reasons that prompt 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.980
 growers and bees to come 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.430
 in the hive we will try 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.540
 the advent of a new way of 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.560
 marketing their relationship of 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.820
 proximity that customers when we will see 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.390
 for the future 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.750
 there is quality research towards the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.709
 organic 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.140
 and then as well consume local for 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.330
 the environment simply is more 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.950
 easy we order on the internet we pay 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.040
 by internet and then we come to recover 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.959
 our products here and then it's enough 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.519
 quick 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.320
 after after work at this facility 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.970
 to come here to become a supplier 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.880
 of a hive some conditions are 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.140
 indispensable as producing organic the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.640
 suppliers can also posed 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.620
 certain conditions on delivery of 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.910
 as she the hive is often a 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.000
 alternative to other modes of 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:08.040
 marketing had started 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.020
 markets and it's true that I know it's 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.590
 Friday morning market for more 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.920
 focus on the street score that in 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.050
 done makes it possible to get ahead who has been 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.870
 ordered so casually there is no 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.730
 do not lose this simplifies 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.390
 sales 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.230
 there is no cash to manage here and 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.850
 then we are safe 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.340
 now when m like everything 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.700
 provider we can give a minimum of 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.520
 commands why I do back 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.750
 do not respect too much what I prefer 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.380
 make the hive grow 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.050
 quietly we see there but we 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.700
 can refuse sales if the quota 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.860
 minimum is not one is not reached 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.190
 previously I was working on 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.670
 direct sales markets if to find 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.950
 client 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.570
 and since I supply the hives I do not 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.410
 works more on the markets because 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.360
 there the orders are are assured I 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.100
 only delivers what is ordered and 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.050
 then it avoids all the work of 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.610
 preparing investments on 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.540
 markets with sales that can be 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:19.519
 random depending on the weather 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.720
 element in the Rennes basin three 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.729
 hives have opened since the 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.550
 creation of the device one to saint 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.490
 Gregory the other to liffré reindeer 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.590
 bréquigny is the only desire can we 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.979
 become dependent on this system when he 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.770
 the only one in the region 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.810
 dependent important land but very 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.039
 interested currency now yes i'm there 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.630
 take taste and every week in 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.190
 orders 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.110
 we know we have our little ones 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:50.099
 habits our little products we love 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.539
 alright but that's it yeah I saw it taste 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.580
 reverse the hive and it depends 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.020
 number of his bees and ben 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.629
 would not exist ie that the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.370
 hive it's a community or for 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.949
 that it works needs to 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.349
 producers the craftsman of members and then 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.370
 among all to a manager who does that 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.620
 it works 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.560
 and then what is also interesting 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.259
 is that there are partners who are 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.310
 puts in place between producers themselves 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.280
 for example natacha who makes 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.830
 culinary creations will use the 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:25.539
 fruit vegetables or beer by 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.810
 example to realize his creations while 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.810
 did
