it also has these dual front stereo
speakers<00:00:30.170> hopefully<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.380> were<00:00:31.560> will<00:00:32.189> be

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
speakers hopefully they were will be

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.040 
speakers hopefully they were will be
able<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.669> pump<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.210> some<00:00:33.649> decent<00:00:34.649> chills<00:00:36.050> and

it has a 6 inch display with Full HD

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
it has a 6 inch display with Full HD
resolution<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.280> 1080<00:00:41.790> x<00:00:42.170> 1920<00:00:43.170> pixels<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
resolution so 1080 x 1920 pixels it's a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.069 
resolution so 1080 x 1920 pixels it's a
super<00:00:45.510> IPS<00:00:45.780> plus<00:00:46.559> display<00:00:47.570> which<00:00:48.570> should

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
super IPS plus display which should

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.189 
super IPS plus display which should
theoretically<00:00:50.000> provide<00:00:51.000> an<00:00:51.660> even<00:00:51.930> better

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
theoretically provide an even better

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.700 
theoretically provide an even better
image<00:00:52.739> quality<00:00:52.980> compared<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.350> some<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
image quality compared to some kind of a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.330 
image quality compared to some kind of a
traditional<00:00:56.309> IPS<00:00:56.969> screen<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.780> guess<00:00:58.340> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
traditional IPS screen we guess the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.240 
traditional IPS screen we guess the
display<00:00:59.670> colors<00:01:00.270> look<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.719> bit<00:01:00.899> cold<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.500> us<00:01:01.620> but

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
display colors look a bit cold to us but

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250 
display colors look a bit cold to us but
you<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.640> able<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.090> tweak<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.840> using

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
you will be able to tweak this using

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.910 
you will be able to tweak this using
this<00:01:04.409> planet<00:01:04.850> application<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:06.720> allows<00:01:07.140> you
