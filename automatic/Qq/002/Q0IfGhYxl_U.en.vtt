the<00:02:27.620> general<00:02:28.100> rule<00:02:28.370> for<00:02:28.400> planting<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.300> that

the general rule for planting is that

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.720 
the general rule for planting is that
they<00:02:30.140> should<00:02:30.320> be<00:02:30.410> planted<00:02:30.830> three<00:02:31.190> times<00:02:31.490> as

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
they should be planted three times as

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.240 
they should be planted three times as
deep<00:02:31.910> as<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.390> diameter<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.170> seed<00:02:33.350> but

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
deep as the diameter of the seed but

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.280 
deep as the diameter of the seed but
really<00:02:34.670> seeds<00:02:35.210> aren't<00:02:35.420> all<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.570> picky<00:02:36.110> and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
really seeds aren't all that picky and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.320 
really seeds aren't all that picky and
will<00:02:36.500> often<00:02:36.680> germinate<00:02:37.340> regardless<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.090> soil
