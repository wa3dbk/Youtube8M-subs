00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
John I agree I think that he's kept the

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.400 
John I agree I think that he's kept the
hitters<00:06:35.180> off<00:06:35.480> balance<00:06:35.540> every<00:06:36.080> once<00:06:36.260> in<00:06:36.380> a

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
hitters off balance every once in a

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.290 
hitters off balance every once in a
while<00:06:36.530> I<00:06:36.560> don't<00:06:36.710> like<00:06:37.100> the<00:06:37.250> pit<00:06:37.430> selection<00:06:37.970> but

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300
