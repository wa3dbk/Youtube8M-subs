one<00:00:00.359> of<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.599> most<00:00:00.840> amazing<00:00:01.319> things<00:00:01.949> about<00:00:02.129> our

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
one of the most amazing things about our

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.889 
one of the most amazing things about our
universe<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.270> that<00:00:03.659> time<00:00:04.560> as<00:00:05.270> measured<00:00:06.270> from<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
universe is that time as measured from a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.730 
universe is that time as measured from a
stationary<00:00:07.799> person<00:00:09.230> travel<00:00:10.230> slower<00:00:10.860> on

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
stationary person travel slower on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.480 
stationary person travel slower on
fast-moving<00:00:14.120> objects<00:00:15.120> or<00:00:15.330> spaceships<00:00:16.190> so<00:00:17.190> for

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
fast-moving objects or spaceships so for

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.240 
fast-moving objects or spaceships so for
example<00:00:17.550> let's<00:00:18.270> take<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.109> spaceship<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:24.140> and

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
example let's take a spaceship here and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.990 
example let's take a spaceship here and
here's<00:00:26.250> our<00:00:26.369> funny-looking<00:00:27.119> spaceship<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
here's our funny-looking spaceship and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.049 
here's our funny-looking spaceship and
it's<00:00:30.000> being<00:00:30.300> driven<00:00:30.599> by<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> young<00:00:31.380> astronaut

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
it's being driven by a young astronaut

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's being driven by a young astronaut
and<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.980> guy<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.850> astronaut<00:00:36.540> well<00:00:36.930> he's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and this guy this astronaut well he's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.200 
and this guy this astronaut well he's
got<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> brother<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.820> home<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.390> twin<00:00:39.840> brother<00:00:41.210> his

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
got a brother at home a twin brother his

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.590 
got a brother at home a twin brother his
twin<00:00:42.570> brothers<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> farmer<00:00:44.510> farmers<00:00:45.510> are

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
twin brothers a farmer farmers are

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.600 
twin brothers a farmer farmers are
naturally<00:00:46.260> great<00:00:46.800> observers<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.610> this

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
naturally great observers and so this

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
naturally great observers and so this
guy<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.660> astronaut<00:00:52.289> well<00:00:52.649> he<00:00:52.739> goes<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.190> in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
guy the astronaut well he goes up in

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.590 
guy the astronaut well he goes up in
space<00:00:53.730> fires<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.899> exhaust<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:57.180> now<00:00:57.390> he's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
space fires the exhaust and now he's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.760 
space fires the exhaust and now he's
moving<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.289> very<00:00:58.530> fast<00:00:58.890> speed<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.770> they

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
moving out of very fast speed and they

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.320 
moving out of very fast speed and they
are<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> compare<00:01:02.789> clocks<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:05.330> why

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
are going to compare clocks to see why

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
are going to compare clocks to see why
and<00:01:07.040> if<00:01:08.060> there<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> difference<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:10.260> they

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and if there is a difference well they

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.390 
and if there is a difference well they
agree<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> very<00:01:12.299> simple<00:01:12.810> clock<00:01:13.400> that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
agree on a very simple clock that

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.830 
agree on a very simple clock that
consists<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.710> photodiodes<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:17.840> set

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
consists of two photodiodes a set

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.249 
consists of two photodiodes a set
distance<00:01:19.080> D<00:01:19.740> apart<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.689> clock<00:01:21.960> works

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
distance D apart and the clock works

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.719 
distance D apart and the clock works
like<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:23.299> when<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> photon<00:01:25.159> hits<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.460> top

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
like this when the photon hits the top

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.190 
like this when the photon hits the top
well<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.869> tick<00:01:29.180> tick<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.509> then<00:01:31.049> when

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
well that's a tick tick and then when

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
well that's a tick tick and then when
the<00:01:31.290> photon<00:01:31.680> bounces<00:01:32.250> off<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> top<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.000> comes

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the photon bounces off the top and comes

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.950 
the photon bounces off the top and comes
back<00:01:33.659> down<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.829> talk<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.970> tick-tock<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
back down that's a talk so tick-tock and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.090 
back down that's a talk so tick-tock and
we<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.430> speed<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> photon<00:01:40.100> photon

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
we know the speed of the photon photon

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550 
we know the speed of the photon photon
well<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.939> particle<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.509> light<00:01:42.600> light

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
well that's the particle of light light

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.420 
well that's the particle of light light
always<00:01:43.950> travels<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.820> speed<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.420> light<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
always travels at the speed of light and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.359 
always travels at the speed of light and
therefore<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> time<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.360> clock<00:01:48.810> is

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
therefore the time of this clock is

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.090 
therefore the time of this clock is
simply<00:01:50.369> given<00:01:50.520> by<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> distance<00:01:51.979> divided<00:01:52.979> by

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
simply given by the distance divided by

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.740 
simply given by the distance divided by
the<00:01:53.159> speed<00:01:54.500> well<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.159> well<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.369> good

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
the speed well that's all well and good

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.319 
the speed well that's all well and good
now<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.680> brother<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> spaceship

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
now for the brother and the spaceship

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.100 
now for the brother and the spaceship
he's<00:02:00.540> got<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> exact<00:02:01.200> same<00:02:01.439> clock<00:02:02.659> two<00:02:03.659> panels

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
he's got the exact same clock two panels

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.050 
he's got the exact same clock two panels
a<00:02:04.259> distance<00:02:04.680> D<00:02:04.860> apart

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
a distance D apart

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.390 
a distance D apart
and<00:02:06.470> photon<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.619> released<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:10.250> from<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and photon is released but from the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.180 
and photon is released but from the
farmers<00:02:12.090> perspective<00:02:12.870> by<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.680> time<00:02:14.160> that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
farmers perspective by the time that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.360 
farmers perspective by the time that
photon<00:02:14.970> has<00:02:15.270> hit<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.660> upper<00:02:15.959> panel<00:02:16.410> this

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
photon has hit the upper panel this

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.339 
photon has hit the upper panel this
spacecraft<00:02:18.500> has<00:02:19.500> already<00:02:19.860> moved<00:02:20.520> some

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
spacecraft has already moved some

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.100 
spacecraft has already moved some
distant<00:02:22.349> whoops<00:02:22.640> has<00:02:23.640> already<00:02:23.819> moved<00:02:24.239> forward

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
distant whoops has already moved forward

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.070 
distant whoops has already moved forward
a<00:02:25.940> significant<00:02:26.940> distance<00:02:29.840> something<00:02:30.840> like

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
a significant distance something like

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.400 
a significant distance something like
this<00:02:32.599> so<00:02:33.599> here's<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.680> top<00:02:34.920> panel<00:02:36.050> by<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.140> time

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
this so here's the top panel by the time

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.160 
this so here's the top panel by the time
the<00:02:37.530> photons<00:02:37.980> hit<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.480> by<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.690> time<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the photons hit it so by the time the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.970 
the photons hit it so by the time the
photon<00:02:40.880> gets<00:02:41.880> up<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.390> top<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:43.470> ship<00:02:43.739> has

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
photon gets up to the top the ship has

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.900 
photon gets up to the top the ship has
moved<00:02:44.310> forward<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.140> farmer<00:02:47.040> sees<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
moved forward so the farmer sees the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.530 
moved forward so the farmer sees the
photon<00:02:48.360> travel<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.170> distance<00:02:49.230> D<00:02:50.040> Prime<00:02:50.540> so

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
photon travel this distance D Prime so

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.839 
photon travel this distance D Prime so
the<00:02:51.720> farmer<00:02:52.290> says<00:02:53.209> hey<00:02:54.209> man<00:02:54.540> your<00:02:55.440> clock<00:02:55.890> is

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.420 

taking<00:02:59.849> this<00:03:00.120> long<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:02.610> do<00:03:02.790> its<00:03:03.000> Tik<00:03:03.599> Tok<00:03:04.430> so

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
taking this long to do its Tik Tok so

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.030 
taking this long to do its Tik Tok so
your<00:03:05.730> clock<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.420> moving<00:03:07.190> slower<00:03:10.040> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
your clock is moving slower the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.180 
your clock is moving slower the
astronaut<00:03:11.940> well<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.230> astronaut<00:03:13.769> let's<00:03:14.040> go

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
astronaut well the astronaut let's go

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.430 
astronaut well the astronaut let's go
into<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:15.060> astronauts<00:03:15.630> world<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.350> i'll

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
into the the astronauts world so i'll

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.440 
into the the astronauts world so i'll
put<00:03:16.650> Astro<00:03:17.390> here<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.690> here's<00:03:19.410> his<00:03:19.650> world<00:03:19.980> well

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
put Astro here and here's his world well

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.270 
put Astro here and here's his world well
he<00:03:21.470> simply<00:03:22.470> sees<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.549> photon<00:03:24.620> going<00:03:25.620> up<00:03:25.799> and

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
he simply sees the photon going up and

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.520 
he simply sees the photon going up and
down<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:28.400> that's<00:03:29.400> because<00:03:29.940> he's<00:03:30.420> moving<00:03:30.900> with

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
down and that's because he's moving with

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.069 
down and that's because he's moving with
the<00:03:31.859> spaceship<00:03:32.519> with<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.819> photon<00:03:33.359> it's<00:03:33.660> like

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
the spaceship with the photon it's like

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.809 
the spaceship with the photon it's like
if<00:03:34.230> you're<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> train<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.829> throw<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.340> ball<00:03:35.549> up

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
if you're on a train you throw a ball up

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.330 
if you're on a train you throw a ball up
in<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.000> air<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.540> see<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.840> go<00:03:36.870> up<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.319> down<00:03:37.440> but

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
in the air you see it go up and down but

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
in the air you see it go up and down but
somebody<00:03:38.850> standing<00:03:39.239> on<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.480> platform<00:03:39.630> sees<00:03:40.500> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
somebody standing on the platform sees a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.770 
somebody standing on the platform sees a
travel<00:03:42.019> diagonal<00:03:43.019> distance<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.790> he<00:03:45.090> says<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
travel diagonal distance so he says the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.400 
travel diagonal distance so he says the
astronaut<00:03:46.410> says<00:03:46.970> now<00:03:48.319> it's<00:03:49.850> same<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:51.500> always

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
astronaut says now it's same as always

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.220 
astronaut says now it's same as always
now<00:03:55.410> from<00:03:55.799> his<00:03:56.010> perspective<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.989> same

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
now from his perspective it is the same

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.740 
now from his perspective it is the same
as<00:03:58.410> always<00:03:58.670> his<00:03:59.670> heartbeats<00:04:00.299> at<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.540> same

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
as always his heartbeats at the same

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.180 
as always his heartbeats at the same
rate<00:04:01.220> he<00:04:02.220> eats<00:04:02.370> his<00:04:02.549> meals<00:04:02.609> on<00:04:03.269> time<00:04:04.190> clock

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
rate he eats his meals on time clock

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.360 
rate he eats his meals on time clock
does<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.639> stick<00:04:05.910> talk<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.480> same<00:04:07.040> but<00:04:08.040> from<00:04:08.250> the

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
does it stick talk the same but from the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.360 
does it stick talk the same but from the
farmers<00:04:08.880> perspective<00:04:09.630> his<00:04:10.170> clock<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.950> moving

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
farmers perspective his clock is moving

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.690 
farmers perspective his clock is moving
much<00:04:11.880> slower<00:04:12.799> because<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.189> reason<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.640> just

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
much slower because of the reason I just

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.360 
much slower because of the reason I just
explained<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:16.019> photon<00:04:16.530> from<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.010> farmers

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
explained the photon from the farmers

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.830 
explained the photon from the farmers
perspective<00:04:17.909> is<00:04:18.060> travelling<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.570> farther

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
perspective is travelling a farther

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.849 
perspective is travelling a farther
distance

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
distance

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.740 
distance
time<00:04:20.069> is<00:04:20.400> distance<00:04:20.819> over<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.150> speed<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.539> light

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
time is distance over the speed of light

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.779 
time is distance over the speed of light
so<00:04:22.439> each<00:04:22.889> tick<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:23.849> each<00:04:24.000> talk<00:04:24.330> takes<00:04:24.780> longer

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
so each tick in each talk takes longer

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.990 
so each tick in each talk takes longer
well<00:04:26.789> at<00:04:27.120> some<00:04:27.780> point<00:04:28.439> the<00:04:29.430> brother<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:29.849> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
well at some point the brother and the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.390 
well at some point the brother and the
spaceship<00:04:30.569> will<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.229> to<00:04:31.409> decelerate<00:04:31.860> and

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
spaceship will have to decelerate and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.490 
spaceship will have to decelerate and
come<00:04:33.030> back<00:04:33.180> down<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.599> earth<00:04:33.659> and<00:04:34.020> he'll

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
come back down to earth and he'll

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.219 
come back down to earth and he'll
basically<00:04:35.069> have<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.759> reconcile<00:04:36.419> himself<00:04:36.719> with

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
basically have to reconcile himself with

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.890 
basically have to reconcile himself with
the<00:04:37.349> stationary<00:04:37.979> reference<00:04:38.490> frame<00:04:38.789> and<00:04:39.090> when

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
the stationary reference frame and when

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.149 
the stationary reference frame and when
that<00:04:40.139> happens<00:04:40.430> when<00:04:41.430> he<00:04:41.580> finishes<00:04:41.969> his<00:04:42.330> trip

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
that happens when he finishes his trip

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.779 
that happens when he finishes his trip
well<00:04:44.159> what<00:04:44.699> he'll<00:04:44.939> see<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:46.310> let's<00:04:47.310> draw<00:04:47.520> him

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
well what he'll see is let's draw him

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.749 
well what he'll see is let's draw him
here's<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.270> astronaut<00:04:49.099> he'll<00:04:50.099> see<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.550> his

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
here's the astronaut he'll see that his

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.469 
here's the astronaut he'll see that his
brother<00:04:51.060> has<00:04:51.960> aged<00:04:52.349> considerably<00:04:53.159> and<00:04:54.060> now

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
brother has aged considerably and now

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.110 
brother has aged considerably and now
maybe<00:04:54.779> has<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.080> big<00:04:55.409> long<00:04:55.680> beard<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:59.340> what<00:04:59.939> we've

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
maybe has a big long beard so what we've

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.240 
maybe has a big long beard so what we've
done<00:05:00.150> here<00:05:00.419> is<00:05:00.750> we've<00:05:01.110> proven<00:05:01.529> that<00:05:02.629> the<00:05:03.629> clock

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
done here is we've proven that the clock

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.209 
done here is we've proven that the clock
in<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.659> fast-moving<00:05:06.659> spaceship<00:05:09.169> tix<00:05:10.219> slower

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
in the fast-moving spaceship tix slower

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.800 
in the fast-moving spaceship tix slower
in<00:05:11.520> other<00:05:12.090> words<00:05:12.360> has<00:05:12.659> time<00:05:13.110> dilation
