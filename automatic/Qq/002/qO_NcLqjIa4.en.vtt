 for the study 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.050
 as soon as we have conducted 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.270
 with the cramif e was to demonstrate 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.650
 which the eyes technically possible to reduce emissions 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.260
 Pollutants from Diesel Engines Equipping Construction Equipment

 state of the possibility of a

 the simple on amal equipment 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.150
 we used just that appeals to me on the planned nine

 month entry 6 11 eur the actual use 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.700
 in reality is very different remains

 abb has passed the peace 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.820
 has perfectly compare the titles of maizière and ps3 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.820
 she is present at each stage before me compared to 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.420
 those from other european countries 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.729
 to a lot of white e we could use the 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.960
 flood that on the other machines we can now blow the 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.140
 overconsumption of fuel is really minimal the particles are 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.360
 very well treated we did not have any particular problem 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.150
 in gt 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.170
 in the middle of the first child machine drivers of this method 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.950
 pending Friday 3 3% German is apparently very large centers of 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.100
 prototype state backup the other methods 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.000
 the results are significant 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.480
 the figure that we can 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.710
 highlight its 99 of more than 9% efficiency 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.039
 this release of particles 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.849
 if particle filter technology 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.519
 active 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.929
 the link 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:20.849
 technically universal who will monitor it is done to avoid 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:21.989
 spread 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.569
 no particles 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.930
 but this experience was unaware of anything related to audois 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.970
 he was not lying outside the gear 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.470
 because six years matter 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.760
 business class to do 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.759
 the discount of the loans which releases 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.909
 to Jean-sébastien voters 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.729
 a little more adapted 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.780
 today often work on the environment 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.720
 I think it's a good thing the experiment conducted with the filter at 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.859
 particles 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.680
 this is an illustration of the program of action that were being conducted these 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.409
 past years within public defacto public is always 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.709
 closer but his contribution is only the cremif the societies of the city 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.329
 we always had 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.909
 the two teams why 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.420
 on one side she 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.960
 to set up new devices but on our side the tram does not 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.729
 help us not 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.729
 the means that it can make available 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.780
 I think it's a smart way to progress
