00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello today we will do with you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.810
 salt dough for sculpting in order to 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.750
 then our kids could something from it 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.599
 sculpt to create and so for this you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.160
 need flour salt and water and the most 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.300
 the main thing that salt was enough 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.710
 small and so let's get started 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.260
 we take the capacity itself capacity in which we 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
 we will do the dough and what our port 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.519
 port 1 cup of water one cup 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.650
 salt and 2 cups flour 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 it does nâ€™t matter if you are 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.610
 want a lot of dough tom and take some 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.800
 big glasses if a maniac take where 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.489
 little glass I want to do a little 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.270
 I have a test of such a cup 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:49.559
 take a glass of water first pour and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:56.190
 as much salt we add all now everything 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:58.109
 mix well when you 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 mixed still you can add a little bit 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.860
 sunflower oil or baby cream 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:12.270
 but I'll take in the usual children's cream 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 a little bit and again we interfere now we take 2 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 cups of flour 1 and 2 there are two 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.040
 a cup of flour is now here 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.729
 naturally begins to thicken 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.490
 we lay on the table and start to interfere 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.700
 with hands if it is sufficiently liquid and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.710
 sticks to the hands then you can still flour 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.470
 add a little bit painted crumbles 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.500
 very worth and then some water that is already 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.130
 We look at the dough as I have 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:09.489
 watery added our 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:11.849
 flour here is such a lump of dough for me 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.800
 It turned out big enough to me 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.290
 I love to make fresh dough every time 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.110
 although you can immediately cook a lot of dough and 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.790
 put them in some bags clean 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.360
 freezer then when you need to get 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.760
 to drink 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.150
 Well, I do this fresh every time 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.489
 a lump once big enough 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.530
 the circle is no longer sticking 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.650
 the child took this literally from me even 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.420
 less than five minutes but if you still have 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.080
 little baby and you first time 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.549
 did such a dough do not know what happened to him 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.239
 how to introduce a child 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.920
 watch my video about turnip from dough 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.599
 I told there as the first time 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.610
 introduces the child with the dough true us on 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.769
 there was a purchase dough but this 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.810
 wonderful and such is nothing 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.269
 inferior at any moment until when you 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.819
 suddenly decided polepit your dough is not this 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.329
 reluctance nowhere to go to the house there is always 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.829
 flour salt and water made such and 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.290
 please repit and with a little 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.840
 baby of more any child 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.010
 will be glad you can also paint it and I 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.139
 I tried to paint it with paint just in 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.120
 ready dough is added from where the eye has 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.340
 I had finger paints I added 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.840
 finger paints in principle normal 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.639
 paints but when you need to paint 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.819
 wear some non-brand clothes because 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:33.160
 that paints can get on you and after 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.200
 of how often everything is good about painting 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.370
 but does not leave marks on hands 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.920
 nowhere and can sculpt 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.109
 I hope everything is on this video 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.150
 it was useful to you and if suddenly someone 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.490
 any questions have arisen to take down below 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.370
 under the video in the comments ask 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.370
 I will answer all until we meet again
