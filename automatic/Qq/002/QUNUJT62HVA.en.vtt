00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.519
 I still have a little bit more exactly 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.490
 gray is more pleasing is the fact that 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:16.449
 when I put it on, I put them to banks 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.770
 Unfortunately, not all banks have 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.150
 a good experience with banks but 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.009
 there are banks that give us good 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.720
 experiences and what is this also 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.359
 we publish a note in excess of the world 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.910
 set mx about the banks that you 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.579
 They thank the loyalty to their clients as 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.820
 this happened paula last July 25 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.989
 a bank then decided to give gifts 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 Give your customers flowers 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 give them also because you know it was 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.970
 effective but nothing more for the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.460
 preference for pure preference to 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.050
 they the bank said you know which clients 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.850
 that I think they deserve 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.829
 thank you for this part and well 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.210
 come even for example we can 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.980
 We are seeing now that a child who 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.559
 Well, with some cards you have to be 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.360
 getting also receives a money the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.219
 people that the best thing that the cashier does not 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.500
 ie not only you entered your 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:12.960
 card now but you enter your card 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.960
 and he answered how are you good afternoon 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.650
 good morning but it's just that it was what 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.910
 better than some of these clients 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.640
 some of those clients received 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.800
 until trips all paid to disney 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.630
 listen here please banks 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.100
 Mexicans that take us on a trip to 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.340
 somewhere at least come to 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.730
 xochimilco 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.040
 pretty clear that this is the subject 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.370
 because some would say good xochimilco 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:50.860
 but it's nice it's very touristy 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:52.690
 this land is a card to the cashier and 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.850
 suddenly they came out with money 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.070
 restaurant with money more money with the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.550

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.530

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.120

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 here are these chocolates there are though 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.570
 be a chocolatito already know where 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.160
 we are if it is not a bank at least 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.530
 someone who can also manifest 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.690
 with us exactly and then then 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.760
 well that's the good news of the day 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.220
 Today, well, this part of the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.450
 banks that is just will make the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.130
 customers return again there will be 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.270
 clients that will definitely arrive 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.320
 new because I say 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.840
 maybe they got some 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.250
 communicated some tweet some way in 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.720
 the one they said good we're doing 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.240
 this because we want to thank all the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.550
 people because of their preference or because it is the 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.130
 Good Samaritan's day I do not know anything 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.460
 nothing simply you reached the cashier and 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.680
 the cashier 3 and that and that's great 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.930
 because it was like that because we're going to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.520
 be frank when suddenly you warn 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.100
 I am going to give is to study that 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.690
 Well, the people 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.770
 it arrives and obviously things also 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.960
 come out I think here and in China 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.630
 everyone would be making a few rows for 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.640
 withdraw money from the cashier is not active 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.590
 well you already see here the people that 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.090
 arrives and suddenly I say it's very gratifying and 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.620
 between there are how many will be the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.410
 amounts more or less than they were given you know 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.750
 good according to the reasons they handled or 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:19.180
 something like without dolaritos that we want 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:21.850
 it did not say that is not good for 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.670
 example is what we have there 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.200
 paola with all this part of then the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.730
 good works also from companies and 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.750
 that I believe that little by little it is happening 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.600
 more do you remember what 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.580
 at Christmas just this one was given 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.410
 this video of some passengers went up in a 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.910
 plane but before boarding them 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.830
 we asked to walk I'm sorry you want 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.620
 and some do not because I want a sweet not 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.330
 I want a phone and there was someone else 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.520
 seasoned who said I want a screen 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.080
 and that when they landed they 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.670
 they found just with him with 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.980
 found their luggage they found their 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.750
 good gifts but also the luggage 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.230
 it does not work for us, but also 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.209
 within the next time that I 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.220
 ask something like this on any flight 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.200
 I'm going to say I want a watch 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.000
 I want a new phone and I do not know if that 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.260
 party time to answer us a hug 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.470
 because you also that answer a 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.970
 hug that I do not know exactly also not 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.160
 I would say a hug 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.989
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.989
 information with the following videos
