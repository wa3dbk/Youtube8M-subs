00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.070 
then use the three last screws which are
probably<00:02:32.910> number<00:02:33.299> ten<00:02:33.540> by<00:02:34.440> inch<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.830> half

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
probably number ten by inch and a half

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.840 
probably number ten by inch and a half
security<00:02:37.080> screws<00:02:37.319> it's<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.650> one-way<00:02:38.100> style<00:02:38.519> but

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
security screws it's a one-way style but

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.430 
security screws it's a one-way style but
I<00:02:38.940> realize<00:02:39.239> it's<00:02:39.450> kind<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.720> hard<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.930> see<00:02:40.170> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
I realize it's kind of hard to see that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.289 
I realize it's kind of hard to see that
but<00:02:41.310> that's<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.640> slotted<00:02:42.420> head<00:02:42.810> style<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:44.850> has

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
but that's a slotted head style that has

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.410 
but that's a slotted head style that has
a<00:02:47.180> taper<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.040> such<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.150> I'm

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
a taper to it such that and and I'm

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.990 
a taper to it such that and and I'm
speaking<00:02:51.810> from<00:02:51.900> actual<00:02:52.230> experience<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.820> can

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
speaking from actual experience you can

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.509 
speaking from actual experience you can
turn<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:54.420> screw<00:02:54.630> counterclockwise<00:02:55.519> very

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
turn this screw counterclockwise very

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.630 
turn this screw counterclockwise very
well<00:02:57.109> but<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.230> minute<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.709> try<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.100> turn

well but the minute that you try to turn

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.099 
well but the minute that you try to turn
it<00:02:59.820> counterclockwise<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:02.280> entire

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109

at least I've never seen it the way that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.180 
at least I've never seen it the way that
this<00:03:56.900> looks<00:03:56.960> when<00:03:57.530> it's<00:03:57.650> all<00:03:57.800> installed

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
this looks when it's all installed

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.930 
this looks when it's all installed
correctly<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.910> like<00:03:59.270> this<00:04:03.820> so<00:04:04.820> you'll

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
correctly is like this so you'll

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.450 
correctly is like this so you'll
obviously<00:04:05.060> have<00:04:05.390> your<00:04:05.570> flathead<00:04:06.260> screws<00:04:09.460> in

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
obviously have your flathead screws in

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.570 
obviously have your flathead screws in
the<00:04:10.550> back<00:04:10.730> of<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.750> U<00:04:11.930> channel<00:04:12.380> piece<00:04:12.620> mounting

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
into the door kind of you know looks

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.000 
into the door kind of you know looks
like<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.820> more<00:04:19.820> appropriately<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:21.650> drawing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
like this more appropriately the drawing

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.220 
like this more appropriately the drawing
above<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.610> video<00:04:22.940> shows<00:04:23.300> installation

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
above this video shows installation

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.810 
above this video shows installation
instructions<00:04:24.740> which<00:04:24.920> appear<00:04:25.250> on<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.430> back<00:04:25.610> of

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
instructions which appear on the back of

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.370 
instructions which appear on the back of
the<00:04:26.380> package<00:04:27.380> that<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.710> latch<00:04:29.380> protector

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
the package that the latch protector

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.610 
the package that the latch protector
came<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:31.810> this<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.080> 6-inch<00:04:33.500> version<00:04:35.620> and

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
came in this is the 6-inch version and

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.320 
came in this is the 6-inch version and
it's<00:04:36.800> obviously<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.340> VP<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.850> brass<00:04:38.060> version

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
it's obviously the VP the brass version

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.600 
it's obviously the VP the brass version
so<00:04:38.660> it's<00:04:38.810> six<00:04:39.020> inches<00:04:39.290> tall<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:40.160> is<00:04:40.220> what<00:04:40.490> you

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
so it's six inches tall this is what you

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.190 
so it's six inches tall this is what you
would<00:04:40.700> use<00:04:40.910> if<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.090> have<00:04:41.270> a<00:04:41.300> single<00:04:41.750> lock<00:04:41.960> on

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
would use if you have a single lock on

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.680 
would use if you have a single lock on
the<00:04:42.320> door<00:04:42.350> there's<00:04:43.220> also<00:04:43.460> a<00:04:43.640> 12<00:04:44.000> inch<00:04:44.240> version

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
the door there's also a 12 inch version

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.420 
the door there's also a 12 inch version
if<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:44.870> have<00:04:45.140> a<00:04:45.170> lock<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.740> deadbolt<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.340> you

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
if you have a lock and deadbolt and you

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.090 
if you have a lock and deadbolt and you
would<00:04:46.550> want<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.820> have<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.060> larger<00:04:47.720> unit<00:04:48.560> but

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
would want to have a larger unit but

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.230 
would want to have a larger unit but
it's<00:04:49.280> other<00:04:49.520> than<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.880> length<00:04:50.060> that's

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
it's other than the length that's

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:58.750
