what's<00:00:01.650> up<00:00:01.829> guys<00:00:02.040> my<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.990> my

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
what's up guys my video today is on my

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.259 
what's up guys my video today is on my
egg<00:00:04.560> draw<00:00:05.870> so<00:00:06.870> basically<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:08.189> egg<00:00:08.340> drop<00:00:08.580> was<00:00:09.240> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
egg draw so basically the egg drop was a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.350 
egg draw so basically the egg drop was a
project<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.980> physics<00:00:11.490> class<00:00:11.580> at<00:00:12.059> high

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
project in my physics class at high

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.589 
project in my physics class at high
school<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.190> basically<00:00:14.190> what<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.210> had<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.480> do

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
school and basically what you had to do

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.890 
school and basically what you had to do
you<00:00:15.809> had<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.990> design<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.529> device<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.600> that<00:00:18.600> held

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
you had to design a device to that held

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.349 
you had to design a device to that held
an<00:00:19.080> egg<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.949> one<00:00:20.310> drop<00:00:20.580> from<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> stadium

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
an egg that one drop from the stadium

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.000 
an egg that one drop from the stadium
would<00:00:22.340> basically<00:00:23.340> survive<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.800> not<00:00:25.800> let

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
would basically survive and just not let

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.040 
would basically survive and just not let
the<00:00:26.130> egg<00:00:26.250> break<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.300> there<00:00:27.720> were<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> couple

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the egg break so there were a couple

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.339 
the egg break so there were a couple
rules<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.130> competition<00:00:30.109> first<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.260> all

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
rules to this competition first of all

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.819 
rules to this competition first of all
you're<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.610> max<00:00:32.820> mass<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.360> your

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
you're the max mass that your

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.410 
you're the max mass that your
contraption<00:00:34.829> slash<00:00:35.340> device<00:00:35.670> could<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:35.940> was

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
contraption slash device could be was

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.240 
contraption slash device could be was
500<00:00:36.960> grams<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:37.649> without<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.129> egg

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
500 grams and that's without the egg

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.380 
500 grams and that's without the egg
included<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:41.250> couldn't<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.700> longer<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
included and it couldn't be longer in

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.529 
included and it couldn't be longer in
any<00:00:42.840> direction<00:00:43.379> longer<00:00:44.309> than<00:00:44.460> 25<00:00:44.910> centimeters

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
any direction longer than 25 centimeters

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.920 
any direction longer than 25 centimeters
and<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:47.010> couldn't<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.489> any<00:00:47.670> plastic

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
and you couldn't use any plastic

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.299 
and you couldn't use any plastic
styrofoam's<00:00:48.930> metals<00:00:49.410> at<00:00:49.649> haw<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.160> be

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
styrofoam's metals at haw to be

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.750 
styrofoam's metals at haw to be
biodegradable<00:00:51.949> like<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.070> could<00:00:53.219> use<00:00:53.250> food

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
biodegradable like you could use food

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
biodegradable like you could use food
paper<00:00:54.090> cotton<00:00:54.629> wood<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:56.300> basically<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
paper cotton wood and basically this is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.439 
paper cotton wood and basically this is
my<00:00:58.920> design<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.840> find<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.199> who<00:01:01.350> wins<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
my design so to find out who wins you

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.700 
my design so to find out who wins you
multiply<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.409> longest<00:01:05.070> length<00:01:05.309> times<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
multiply the longest length times the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.330 
multiply the longest length times the
mass<00:01:07.950> times<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:09.380> time<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.530> took<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
mass times the time it took for it to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.289 
mass times the time it took for it to
fall<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.740> these<00:01:13.740> were<00:01:13.950> mine<00:01:14.189> 18<00:01:14.820> centimeters

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
fall so these were mine 18 centimeters

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.310 
fall so these were mine 18 centimeters
6.8<00:01:16.080> grams<00:01:16.460> 1.3<00:01:17.460> 4<00:01:17.640> seconds<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
6.8 grams 1.3 4 seconds and I got a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.390 
6.8 grams 1.3 4 seconds and I got a
total<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.000> 164<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.740> doing<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
total of 164 so when I was doing this I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.200 
total of 164 so when I was doing this I
I<00:01:23.900> found<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.610> maximizing<00:01:26.610> little

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
I found out that maximizing little

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.060 
I found out that maximizing little
minimizing<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> mass<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> most

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
minimizing the mass was the most

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
minimizing the mass was the most
effective<00:01:29.700> way<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> low<00:01:30.540> point<00:01:30.810> because

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
effective way to get a low point because

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 
effective way to get a low point because
I<00:01:31.829> mean<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.579> people<00:01:32.610> made<00:01:33.090> their<00:01:33.270> small<00:01:33.689> but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
I mean some people made their small but

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
I mean some people made their small but
there<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.189> weighed<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.360> many<00:01:36.720> times<00:01:36.990> more

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
there is weighed up but many times more

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
there is weighed up but many times more
than<00:01:37.409> mine<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.070> mine<00:01:38.579> still<00:01:38.850> won<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
than mine so mine still won because it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.889 
than mine so mine still won because it
was<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> lightest<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.270> design<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.840> took

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
was the lightest so for my design I took

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.859 
was the lightest so for my design I took
a<00:01:43.110> normal<00:01:43.409> piece<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> printer<00:01:44.520> paper<00:01:44.640> okay<00:01:45.540> so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
a normal piece of printer paper okay so

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.020 
a normal piece of printer paper okay so
that's<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.320> cone<00:01:46.649> part<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that's this cone part and you make it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.319 
that's this cone part and you make it
into<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> cone<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.170> about<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.590> six<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
into a cone it was about like six and

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.080 
into a cone it was about like six and
centimeters<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> point<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.399> changes

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
centimeters for a point but it changes

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.760 
centimeters for a point but it changes
you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.479> make<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.720> smaller<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.290> drop<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you can make it smaller if you drop it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
you can make it smaller if you drop it
from<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.159> smaller<00:01:56.939> height<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.509> ours<00:01:57.780> was

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
from a smaller height but ours was

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.550 
from a smaller height but ours was
pretty<00:01:58.320> high<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:59.990> first<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> cone

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
pretty high up so first of all the cone

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.760 
pretty high up so first of all the cone
design<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
design the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.429 
design the
own<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.640> absorbs<00:02:04.359> all<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.689> energy<00:02:05.049> from<00:02:05.259> the

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
own it absorbs all the energy from the

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.240 
own it absorbs all the energy from the
fall<00:02:05.649> so<00:02:06.219> the<00:02:06.429> point<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:07.270> crumples<00:02:07.929> up<00:02:08.250> into

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
fall so the point it crumples up into

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.030 
fall so the point it crumples up into
here<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:10.539> just<00:02:10.780> absorbs<00:02:11.410> all<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> energy

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
here and it just absorbs all the energy

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.360 
here and it just absorbs all the energy
and<00:02:12.280> trance<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.360> it's<00:02:13.629> transferred<00:02:14.140> into<00:02:15.069> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and trance and it's transferred into the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.000 
and trance and it's transferred into the
crumpling<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> paper<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.629> next<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:17.709> had

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
crumpling of the paper and next I had

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.920 
crumpling of the paper and next I had
this<00:02:18.190> egg<00:02:18.430> carton<00:02:18.879> at<00:02:19.090> first<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.480> didn't<00:02:19.750> have

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
this egg carton at first I didn't have

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.229 
this egg carton at first I didn't have
it<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.230> when<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:20.980> test<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.430> out<00:02:21.549> all<00:02:21.790> my<00:02:22.030> eggs

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
it and when I test it out all my eggs

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.570 
it and when I test it out all my eggs
would<00:02:22.510> break<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:23.319> from<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.709> impact<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:24.400> when

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
would break not from the impact but when

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.610 
would break not from the impact but when
it<00:02:24.700> hit<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.180> they<00:02:25.450> would<00:02:25.599> fall<00:02:25.930> over<00:02:25.959> on<00:02:26.440> its

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
it hit and they would fall over on its

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.940 
it hit and they would fall over on its
side<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.849> would<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.599> side<00:02:28.780> would<00:02:28.959> break<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.920> I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
side it would the side would break so I

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.039 
side it would the side would break so I
put<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.340> egg<00:02:30.970> carton<00:02:31.360> because<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.690> held<00:02:31.900> it

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
put this egg carton because it held it

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.750 
put this egg carton because it held it
nicely<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.799> it<00:02:33.069> was<00:02:33.220> very<00:02:33.519> sturdy<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:35.079> I<00:02:35.760> used

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
nicely and it was very sturdy so I used

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.759 
nicely and it was very sturdy so I used
that<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.090> protect<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.540> when<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.049> fell<00:02:38.349> over<00:02:38.680> on

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
that to protect it when it fell over on

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.559 
that to protect it when it fell over on
its<00:02:38.950> side<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.549> I<00:02:39.579> put<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.849> piece<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.090> tape<00:02:40.269> over

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
its side then I put a piece of tape over

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.130 
its side then I put a piece of tape over
the<00:02:40.720> top<00:02:40.750> after<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.500> installed<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.160> egg<00:02:42.310> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
the top after I installed the egg and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.680 
the top after I installed the egg and
that<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.319> just<00:02:44.500> -<00:02:44.739> if<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.069> flipped<00:02:45.340> over<00:02:45.690> it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
that was just - if it flipped over it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.620 
that was just - if it flipped over it
would<00:02:46.840> keep<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.079> egg<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.560> place

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
would keep the egg in place

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.569 
would keep the egg in place
and<00:02:49.630> next<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.200> had<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> string<00:02:50.920> at<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.069> top<00:02:51.310> it

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
and next I had a string at the top it

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.930 
and next I had a string at the top it
was<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.500> found<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.680> was<00:02:53.860> easier<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.220> find<00:02:54.819> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
was I found this was easier to find the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.339 
was I found this was easier to find the
center<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.269> mass<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.720> could<00:02:55.870> drop<00:02:56.140> it

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
center of mass so you could drop it

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.220 
center of mass so you could drop it
easier<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:56.890> then<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.760> had<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.120> flaps<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.840> make

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
easier and then I had the flaps to make

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.589 
easier and then I had the flaps to make
it<00:02:59.620> so<00:02:59.799> it<00:02:59.980> would<00:03:00.130> fall<00:03:00.400> straight<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:01.030> don't

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
it so it would fall straight I don't

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.360 
it so it would fall straight I don't
know<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.930> helped<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.290> much<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:02.920> I

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
know if that helped that much but I

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.670 
know if that helped that much but I
don't<00:03:04.000> know<00:03:04.239> mind<00:03:04.690> drop<00:03:04.930> perfectly<00:03:05.379> straight

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
don't know mind drop perfectly straight

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.340 
don't know mind drop perfectly straight
when<00:03:05.829> I<00:03:05.860> did<00:03:06.519> my<00:03:06.730> final<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.239> but<00:03:08.049> basically

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
when I did my final one but basically

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.559 
when I did my final one but basically
yeah<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.889> cone<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.400> found<00:03:09.910> was<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.299> best

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
yeah the cone I found was the best

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.470 
yeah the cone I found was the best
design<00:03:11.049> if<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.620> wanted<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.250> pretty<00:03:12.940> much<00:03:13.120> win

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
design if you wanted to pretty much win

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.840 
design if you wanted to pretty much win
if<00:03:13.780> you're<00:03:14.109> basing<00:03:14.829> off<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.130> these<00:03:15.250> rules<00:03:15.609> and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
if you're basing off of these rules and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.150 
if you're basing off of these rules and
it<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:16.780> looks<00:03:16.989> sweet<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> piece<00:03:18.130> of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
it just looks sweet that a piece of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.360 
it just looks sweet that a piece of
paper<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:19.030> little<00:03:19.180> carton<00:03:20.040> lets<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.160> egg

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
paper and a little carton lets a egg

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.970 
paper and a little carton lets a egg
survive<00:03:22.060> from<00:03:22.269> dropping<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.840> 30-plus<00:03:23.709> feet

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
survive from dropping it 30-plus feet

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.569 
survive from dropping it 30-plus feet
onto<00:03:24.549> concrete<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:25.920> yeah

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
onto concrete so yeah

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.599 
onto concrete so yeah
coming<00:03:28.120> up<00:03:28.239> will<00:03:28.450> be<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:29.350> video<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:30.040> my
