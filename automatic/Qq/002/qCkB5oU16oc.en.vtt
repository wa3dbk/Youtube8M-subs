 basketball is like this and it came into my 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.460
 life passed 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.019
 to become everything because it is 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.750
 a form I did not accept in the 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:51.070
 society then basketball introduced me 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.070
 back in society 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.050
 I was hit or run over 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.350
 18 years 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.280

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.830

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.979
 I was invited to meet basketball 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.979
 I liked the actor playing since he's 10 years old. 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.690

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.020

 his is all there is a standard measure in 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.740

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.230
