 non-video media musician leave Nazis with 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.929
 like here we are back with this 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.849
 piece of little was neither with 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.440
 I subscribe to it but I'm the one 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.150
 point that the important thing to diego valeri to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 dedicate yourself with this vow today and you're not 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.570
 with your activity or life since 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.880
 We are because in this race 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.439
 I just let you fuck or which one if 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.859
 they just fall in front or this 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.300
 motorcycle and how it is not that it takes me 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.920
 especially so choosing to catch 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.960
 this basic bike I put because we are 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.820
 a brake I tell you from now on 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.590
 because from own experience tell you 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 that this motorcycle does not brake anything so 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.070
 many very well and very well amazing and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.710
 I think that in the curve so close and that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.219
 end to my assignment 30 of another in a 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.219
 container 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:56.789
 clear three against or against has 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:01:00.690
 brand name sport with many 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.070
 plans and as well as subscriber 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.180
 I do not know how that subscriber does not eat me 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.510
 but the important thing is that we're going 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.050
 First 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.050
 and not 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.760
 so it 's a turn 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.740
 of the container 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.360
 has positive brand name 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.920
 inside I mean seriously it looks very good to me 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.150
 I love 66 because because I take me 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.770
 also with which I do not go for that 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.030
 I love the same things I've 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.430
 I love them perfectly I love them 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.530
 parrots I have them in my heart I shit on 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.850
 your boy to see eye, because it's not 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.360
 They advance the eye because they overtake me with 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.400
 the nonsense 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.920
 vale vale vale ojo will fall measured the world 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.780
 from here 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.509
 until the goal is there the goal is there 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.509
 I want to take the island 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.140
 little is left first if it could look good 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.520
 already without being well but I want to give the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.110
 rematch the writers and see what it is 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.210
 what happens is worth if I got secant 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.030
 I said that the bullet to the moon when 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.009
 there was every moment gave he sticks to the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.750
 nothing throws me a 4 no longer a subscribed 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.310
 some when he throws me a quad I opened a 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.140
 which 6 subscribers and has pushed me to be 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.360
 tomato those that already push me to the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.450
 objects and what balls are pushing me already 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.349
 up inanimate objects god but 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.060
 there is 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.560
 when I get along very well with them 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.599
 mainly because of this because they are 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.700
 uncontrollable but as I leave you with the 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.200
 innovation that is called the motorcycle so 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.519
 although I have been here I must go to play 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.739
 with which to test how I would go to 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.360
 quad in this race you have to turn as 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.040
 very gently it has as it turns very 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.180
 fast he knows as very unexpected everything 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.980
 for identical we go fifth 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.890
 and a lot of attention because it's worth braking 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.599
 we brake super unstable with the 4 I say 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.450
 seriously so we go to the cane 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.549
 We passed around the tunnel tunnel 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.900
 the containers the jumped over here ok no 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.189
 native that there is no says that or rotates in 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.019
 plan that madryn since it seems to write 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.250
 an incredible handlebar there are times that 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.349
 tour there are times that I do not know it seems that the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.609
 handlebar is twisted is one eye 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.120
 hole that was given okay let's go quarters 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.120
 subscribers other subscriber 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.319
 turns like a top dude I've had 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.239
 an impact there in subscriber plan 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.510
 youtube that goal to act impact 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:22.590
 air of his story I had to throw myself 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.599
 also if you start looking back 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.739
 just before taking a ramp then 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.109
 the sea commands that happen to you is that you 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.549
 fall to the ground literally not you 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.109
 you're going to fall apart because if it's not 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.329
 climb towards the term would fall but 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.370
 well after all a little and I can not 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.639
 here the subscribers start dancing 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.100
 here in the middle the favor please we have 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:44.420
 improved an economic mix or 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.420
 who says he loves me 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.400
 which is uncontrollable please is 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.410
 let the trike from my cousin 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.300
 two years is more is more controllable than 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.530
 this how much we are worth is worth vale vale 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.270
 Okay I have it I have it We give it to 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.070
 back quietly and we give him to 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.390
 go ahead not so quietly around here 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.980
 you have to give it power and it's very good 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.880
 here we can fifth and last and 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.290
 finished there is another one that has also 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.060
 finished but to see guys that is the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.880
 quad 2 to which you have to have patience 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.100
 with him he is worth kids that is super 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.160
 uncontrollable iommi between jumps is worth what 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.600
 I have never turned autonomous but you have 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.280
 seen your is that my mother gives it to me in 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.530
 these five minutes and already as if 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.430
 been very good in good shape doing the 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.650
 pathetic 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.360
 someone signed within the tunnel 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.280
 control in which you are fighting with 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.420
 the walls I do not know what he's doing to 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.420
 she manages to have fun 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.850
 partner 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.370
 a guy 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:07.170
 several castles more won 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:10.120
 since the eyes that we see here 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.760
 this let's go come on let's go brave fell 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.900

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.030
 guys listened to what it cost us 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.350
 well finally to be fourth the 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.090
 that does not have a duel against a 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.340
 pretty bloody subscriber but 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.470
 finally subscribers has been prefixed 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.550
 before us before placed before us 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.110
 I do not know if that phrase is well said 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.310
 stop like the case of joel that 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.600
 favorites and let's see what ramÃ³n 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.470

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.470
 next video goodbye
