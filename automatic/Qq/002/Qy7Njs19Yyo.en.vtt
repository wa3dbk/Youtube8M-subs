00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:18.079
 after following the schematic method of the previous chapter that has us 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.079
 shown the realization of the clusone planking 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.779
 let's move on to the practical phase of our action society 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.569
 the goal of this tutorial is to make for the crown of 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:37.460
 36 a functionally occlusal morphology in an anatomy 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.460
 and pleasant from an aesthetic point of view 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.410
 just to limit the inclusions of air during the dough 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.150
 let's put a few drops of liquid on the back 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.220
 as we did for the tax of opposites 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.830
 repel dust and ceramic with the spatula, making it fall into the 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.860
 liquid 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.000
 photo 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.830
 we begin to apply the intino porca to 360 degrees on the crown as we have 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.220
 seen in the graphic simulation 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.900
 covering the goat from the sadistic mar gen allen up to the most part 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.530
 top of the goat leaving free from the intacc paccaro surface 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.180
 influx to 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.780
 this operation completed 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.230
 we pass to the ultrasonic condensation of the masses will be mica 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.340
 I personally use this tool only at this stage of the earth processing 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.540
 stabilize the intino pat especially in the cervical areas in 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.000
 how much these are considered by all 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.760
 the most critical areas for metal coverage and its eyes sites that yes 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.990
 they form during the cooking phases
