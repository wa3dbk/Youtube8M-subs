have<00:01:07.000> worries<00:01:07.509> about<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.950> system<00:01:09.580> applying

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
have worries about this system applying

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.320 
have worries about this system applying
too<00:01:10.539> much<00:01:10.570> pressure<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:11.350> their<00:01:11.500> lenses<00:01:11.860> more

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
too much pressure to their lenses more

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.389 
too much pressure to their lenses more
specifically<00:01:13.330> their<00:01:13.660> focus<00:01:14.110> rings<00:01:14.410> they're

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
specifically their focus rings they're

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.010 
specifically their focus rings they're
thinking<00:01:15.700> with<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.970> band<00:01:16.240> using<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.690> tension

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
thinking with the band using the tension

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.419 
thinking with the band using the tension
off<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.320> they're<00:01:17.470> applying<00:01:17.920> it's<00:01:18.190> great

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
off that they're applying it's great

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.400 
off that they're applying it's great
amount<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.820> force<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.210> your<00:01:19.539> ring<00:01:19.810> that's

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
amount of force to your ring that's

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.249 
amount of force to your ring that's
going<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.679> eventually<00:01:21.300> wear<00:01:22.300> and<00:01:22.570> tear<00:01:22.840> your

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
going to eventually wear and tear your

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.940 
going to eventually wear and tear your
lens<00:01:23.829> faster<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.490> have<00:01:24.970> not<00:01:25.299> seen<00:01:25.689> any<00:01:26.229> issues

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
lens faster I have not seen any issues

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.929 
lens faster I have not seen any issues
with<00:01:27.159> this<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:27.520> far<00:01:27.579> in<00:01:28.119> fact<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.259> can<00:01:29.470> see

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
with this so far in fact you can see

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.120 
with this so far in fact you can see
there's<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.030> lot<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.600> slack<00:01:31.990> in<00:01:32.020> this<00:01:32.530> band<00:01:32.799> it's

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
there's a lot of slack in this band it's

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.810 
there's a lot of slack in this band it's
not<00:01:33.400> necessarily<00:01:34.060> ran<00:01:34.810> off<00:01:35.140> tension<00:01:35.950> it's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
not necessarily ran off tension it's

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.130 
not necessarily ran off tension it's
more<00:01:37.180> ran<00:01:37.540> off<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.610> little<00:01:39.850> teeth<00:01:40.299> in<00:01:40.600> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
more ran off the little teeth in the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.469 
more ran off the little teeth in the
band<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.100> tea<00:01:42.310> or<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.759> I<00:01:43.000> guess<00:01:43.270> teeth

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
grooves whatever on the focus ring so

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.630 
grooves whatever on the focus ring so
instead<00:01:46.930> of<00:01:46.990> using<00:01:47.170> all<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.799> force<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.430> keep

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
instead of using all that force to keep

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.520 
instead of using all that force to keep
it<00:01:48.820> nice<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.090> tight<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.780> get<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.079> Rings<00:01:50.320> to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
it nice and tight to get the Rings to

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.440 
it nice and tight to get the Rings to
turn<00:01:50.740> it's<00:01:51.070> more<00:01:51.579> relying<00:01:51.909> on<00:01:52.060> these<00:01:52.210> little

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
turn it's more relying on these little

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.539 
turn it's more relying on these little
teeth<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:53.049> line<00:01:53.229> up<00:01:53.409> in<00:01:53.530> these<00:01:53.649> grooves<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.310> get

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
teeth to line up in these grooves to get

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.020 
teeth to line up in these grooves to get
the<00:01:54.869> focus<00:01:55.869> ring<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.290> turn<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.579> only<00:01:57.790> problem

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
the focus ring to turn the only problem

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.429 
the focus ring to turn the only problem
with<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.299> if<00:01:58.659> you<00:01:58.780> bought<00:01:58.899> two<00:01:59.079> like

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
with that is if you bought two like

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.350 
with that is if you bought two like
myself<00:01:59.619> and<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.130> try<00:02:00.280> using<00:02:00.520> one<00:02:00.850> on<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.090> zoom

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
myself and you try using one on the zoom

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.899 
myself and you try using one on the zoom
ring<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.439> grooves<00:02:02.829> inside<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.460> zoom<00:02:03.670> ring

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
ring the grooves inside the zoom ring

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.990 
ring the grooves inside the zoom ring
are<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.240> little<00:02:04.600> larger<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.070> belt<00:02:06.340> slips<00:02:06.850> a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
are a little larger so the belt slips a

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.669 
are a little larger so the belt slips a
little<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.509> what<00:02:07.990> I'm<00:02:08.140> going<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.320> have<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.530> do

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
little so what I'm going to have to do

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.169 
little so what I'm going to have to do
is<00:02:08.799> replace<00:02:09.070> that<00:02:09.160> rubber

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
is replace that rubber

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.580 
is replace that rubber
grip<00:02:10.539> with<00:02:11.079> the<00:02:11.379> focus<00:02:11.980> part<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.959> focus<00:02:14.379> ring

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
grip with the focus part the focus ring

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.789 
grip with the focus part the focus ring
grip<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.939> uh<00:02:15.989> it'll<00:02:16.989> catch<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.379> it<00:02:17.560> easily

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
grip so uh it'll catch this it easily

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.589 
grip so uh it'll catch this it easily
he'll<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.250> understand<00:02:18.640> what<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.760> mean<00:02:18.969> you

now<00:03:03.989> not<00:03:04.349> only<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:06.120> easier<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.800> focus

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
now not only is this easier to focus

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.520 
now not only is this easier to focus
from<00:03:08.069> one<00:03:08.250> object<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.730> another<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:10.290> follow

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
focus you can further add a piece of

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.570 
focus you can further add a piece of
tape<00:03:18.200> marker<00:03:19.200> or<00:03:19.349> whatever<00:03:19.680> but<00:03:20.069> it's<00:03:20.220> pretty

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
tape marker or whatever but it's pretty

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.089
