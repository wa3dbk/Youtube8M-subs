a few two of the light machine guns
medium<00:03:15.280> range<00:03:15.550> damage<00:03:15.880> was<00:03:16.240> increased<00:03:16.660> a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
medium range damage was increased a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.260 
medium range damage was increased a
current<00:03:17.320> member<00:03:17.380> which<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.980> work<00:03:18.160> but<00:03:18.850> I

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
current member which to the work but I

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.800 
current member which to the work but I
remember<00:03:19.780> recoil<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.800> MSMC<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.090> PDW

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
remember recoil on the MSMC and the PDW

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.710 
remember recoil on the MSMC and the PDW
were<00:03:23.500> increased<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.910> most<00:03:25.090> important

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
were increased but the most important

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.110 
were increased but the most important
one<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:26.110> think<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.430> damage<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:27.940> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
one I think is that the damage on the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.150 
one I think is that the damage on the
FAL<00:03:28.480> when<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.990> was<00:03:29.080> made<00:03:29.260> automatic<00:03:29.950> with

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
FAL when it was made automatic with

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.270 
FAL when it was made automatic with
select<00:03:30.550> fire<00:03:30.790> has<00:03:31.300> been<00:03:31.540> decreased<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.320> think

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
select fire has been decreased I think

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.640 
select fire has been decreased I think
everyone<00:03:33.790> can<00:03:33.970> agree<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:34.570> powerful<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.470> its

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
everyone can agree it's powerful I its

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.370 
everyone can agree it's powerful I its
normal<00:03:36.100> semi-automatic<00:03:37.000> state<00:03:37.270> but<00:03:38.020> when<00:03:38.290> you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
normal semi-automatic state but when you

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.170 
normal semi-automatic state but when you
made<00:03:38.560> an<00:03:38.650> automatic<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.760> thing<00:03:39.970> would<00:03:40.150> just

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
made an automatic that thing would just

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.480 
made an automatic that thing would just
tear<00:03:40.630> up<00:03:40.660> everyone<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:42.040> was<00:03:42.160> one<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.310> the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
tear up everyone it was one of the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.280 
tear up everyone it was one of the
strongest<00:03:42.880> guns<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.390> game<00:03:43.570> like<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:44.050> and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
strongest guns in the game like that and

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.170 
strongest guns in the game like that and
I<00:03:44.710> thought<00:03:45.040> treyarch<00:03:45.430> we're<00:03:45.610> gonna<00:03:45.760> leave<00:03:46.000> it

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
I thought treyarch we're gonna leave it

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180 
I thought treyarch we're gonna leave it
as<00:03:46.270> it<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:47.050> they<00:03:47.230> have<00:03:47.500> actually<00:03:47.740> patched

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
as it is but they have actually patched

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.490 
as it is but they have actually patched
it<00:03:48.460> but<00:03:49.240> they've<00:03:49.450> only<00:03:49.600> patched<00:03:49.900> is<00:03:50.110> damaged

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
it but they've only patched is damaged

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.460 
it but they've only patched is damaged
when<00:03:50.680> it's<00:03:50.830> automatic<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:52.090> normal

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
when it's automatic so it's normal

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.300 
when it's automatic so it's normal
semi-automatic<00:03:53.470> state<00:03:53.710> should<00:03:54.010> be<00:03:54.130> pretty

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
semi-automatic state should be pretty

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.640 
semi-automatic state should be pretty
much<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.730> same<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.150> actually<00:03:55.900> don't<00:03:56.170> use

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
much the same I actually don't use

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.400 
much the same I actually don't use
select<00:03:57.010> fire<00:03:57.250> on<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.700> FAL<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.330> did<00:03:58.870> like<00:03:59.050> once

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
select fire on the FAL I did like once

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.320 
select fire on the FAL I did like once
to<00:03:59.650> see<00:03:59.800> what<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.040> was<00:04:00.130> like<00:04:00.190> but<00:04:00.670> then<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:01.060> just

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
to see what it was like but then I just

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.420 
to see what it was like but then I just
used<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.720> normal<00:04:02.080> reflex<00:04:02.530> sight<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:03.070> stock

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
used the normal reflex sight and stock

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.850 
used the normal reflex sight and stock
because<00:04:03.940> my<00:04:04.510> trigger<00:04:04.840> finger<00:04:05.050> isn't<00:04:05.380> too<00:04:05.680> bad

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
because my trigger finger isn't too bad

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.910 
because my trigger finger isn't too bad
and<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.520> didn't<00:04:06.790> really<00:04:07.030> need<00:04:07.180> selects<00:04:07.540> fire

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
and I didn't really need selects fire

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.110 
and I didn't really need selects fire
the<00:04:08.920> only<00:04:09.130> reason<00:04:09.280> I'm<00:04:09.490> using<00:04:09.520> it<00:04:09.910> in<00:04:10.000> this

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
the only reason I'm using it in this

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.970 
the only reason I'm using it in this
video<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.750> because<00:04:10.960> I<00:04:11.140> wanted<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.620> see<00:04:11.800> how

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
video is because I wanted to see how

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.610 
video is because I wanted to see how
much<00:04:12.280> they<00:04:12.700> actually<00:04:12.850> brought<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.510> down<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:13.990> I

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
much they actually brought it down and I

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.229 
much they actually brought it down and I
wanted<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:14.980> compare<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.430> damage<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.820> what<00:04:16.150> it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
wanted to compare is damage to what it

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.780 
wanted to compare is damage to what it
was<00:04:16.420> before<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.960> patch<00:04:17.280> first<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.549> didn't

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
was before the patch first it didn't

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.310 
was before the patch first it didn't
seem<00:04:18.970> like<00:04:19.000> there<00:04:19.299> was<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.480> huge<00:04:19.810> difference<00:04:20.109> to

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
seem like there was a huge difference to

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.470 
seem like there was a huge difference to
it<00:04:20.560> but<00:04:21.160> when<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.430> started<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:21.910> use<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.300> bit

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
it but when I started to use it a bit

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.840 
it but when I started to use it a bit
more<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.870> could<00:04:23.260> start<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:24.010> see<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.460> they<00:04:24.820> have

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
more I could start to see that they have

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.080 
more I could start to see that they have
pretty<00:04:25.180> much<00:04:25.300> nerfed<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:26.169> thing

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
pretty much nerfed the thing

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.150 
pretty much nerfed the thing
still<00:04:27.389> quite<00:04:27.720> strong<00:04:28.110> but<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.620> can<00:04:28.800> start<00:04:29.010> to

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
still quite strong but you can start to

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.250 
still quite strong but you can start to
see<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.430> difference<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.660> increase<00:04:31.080> in

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
see the difference and the increase in

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.990 
see the difference and the increase in
hip<00:04:31.410> markers<00:04:31.770> as<00:04:31.919> well<00:04:32.100> they've<00:04:32.850> actually

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
hip markers as well they've actually

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.570 
hip markers as well they've actually
done<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.480> same<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:34.169> SMS<00:04:34.830> automatic

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
done the same to the SMS automatic

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.030 
done the same to the SMS automatic
damage<00:04:35.910> as<00:04:36.030> well<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.419> know<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.050> SMR<00:04:37.620> was<00:04:37.830> good

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
damage as well I know the SMR was good

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.040 
damage as well I know the SMR was good
automatic<00:04:38.669> but<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.120> didn't<00:04:39.479> think<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.780> was<00:04:39.840> like

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
automatic but I didn't think it was like

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.469 
automatic but I didn't think it was like
Reagan<00:04:40.710> material<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:41.580> needed<00:04:41.880> patching<00:04:42.300> I

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
Reagan material and it needed patching I

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.090 
Reagan material and it needed patching I
think<00:04:43.139> they<00:04:43.260> probably<00:04:43.380> should<00:04:43.800> have<00:04:43.860> left

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
think they probably should have left

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.580 
think they probably should have left
that<00:04:44.250> like<00:04:44.790> it<00:04:44.940> was<00:04:44.970> I<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:46.020> don't<00:04:46.169> understand

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
that like it was I just don't understand

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.560 
that like it was I just don't understand
why<00:04:46.650> they<00:04:47.250> decided<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.790> both<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.180> couple<00:04:48.419> of

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
why they decided to both a couple of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.840 
why they decided to both a couple of
light<00:04:48.780> machine<00:04:49.080> guns<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.919> LMGs<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.669> game

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
light machine guns the LMGs in the game

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.360 
light machine guns the LMGs in the game
are<00:04:51.060> ultra<00:04:51.510> powerful<00:04:51.840> as<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.110> is<00:04:52.320> already<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.340> I

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
are ultra powerful as it is already so I

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.520 
are ultra powerful as it is already so I
don't<00:04:53.760> see<00:04:53.940> why<00:04:54.120> they<00:04:54.300> would<00:04:54.330> need<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:55.020> do

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
don't see why they would need to do

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.010 
don't see why they would need to do
damage<00:04:55.830> increases<00:04:56.220> but<00:04:57.090> whatever<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.870> doesn't

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
damage increases but whatever it doesn't

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.719 
damage increases but whatever it doesn't
really<00:04:58.139> affect<00:04:58.560> me<00:04:58.650> because<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.160> still<00:04:59.490> enjoy

it was pre-ordering black ops 2 and you

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.760
