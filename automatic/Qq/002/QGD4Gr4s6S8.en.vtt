process I mean have you really thought

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.169 
process I mean have you really thought
about<00:00:11.700> it

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
about it

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.180 
about it
or<00:00:12.389> just<00:00:12.540> taking<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:12.900> granted<00:00:13.190> because

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
or just taking it for granted because

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.250 
or just taking it for granted because
this<00:00:14.549> PC<00:00:14.940> when<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.450> press<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> power<00:00:15.900> button

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
this PC when you press the power button

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.320 
this PC when you press the power button
all<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.770> sudden<00:00:16.920> springs<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.430> life<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.910> it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
all the sudden springs to life and it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.240 
all the sudden springs to life and it
loads<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.660> your<00:00:18.840> operating<00:00:19.230> system<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:20.039> yet

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
loads up your operating system but yet

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.529 
loads up your operating system but yet
you<00:00:20.640> couldn't<00:00:20.970> build<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.330> from<00:00:21.449> scratch

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you couldn't build one from scratch

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.109 
you couldn't build one from scratch
could<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.640> want<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> take<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.880> through<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
could you I want to take you through the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.900 
could you I want to take you through the
PC<00:00:24.359> boot<00:00:24.600> process<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.199> how<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.470> works<00:00:25.910> okay

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
PC boot process and how that works okay

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.000 
PC boot process and how that works okay
so<00:00:26.970> step<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.840> push<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> button<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.800> your

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
so step one you push the button on your

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.519 
so step one you push the button on your
desktop<00:00:29.400> or<00:00:29.580> laptop<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:30.480> happens<00:00:30.869> well<00:00:31.410> that

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
desktop or laptop what happens well that

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
desktop or laptop what happens well that
turns<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> power<00:00:32.070> supply<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.210> point

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
turns the power supply on at this point

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.630 
turns the power supply on at this point
it<00:00:33.899> gets<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> voltages<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> sensible

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it gets it voltages up to a sensible

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.270 
it gets it voltages up to a sensible
level<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.380> stabilizes<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.040> takes

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
level and stabilizes it now this takes

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
level and stabilizes it now this takes
about<00:00:38.430> half<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.879> second<00:00:39.270> which<00:00:39.690> compared<00:00:40.200> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
about half a second which compared to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.650 
about half a second which compared to
the<00:00:40.379> rest<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> boot<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:41.010> time<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:42.090> long

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the rest of the boot up time is a long

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.799 
the rest of the boot up time is a long
time<00:00:43.489> now<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> point<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.300> voltages<00:00:45.690> are

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
time now at this point the voltages are

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.750 
time now at this point the voltages are
stable<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.770> fans<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.190> switch<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
stable so the fans can switch on and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.540 
stable so the fans can switch on and
everything<00:00:48.270> else<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.570> start<00:00:48.930> powering<00:00:49.410> up

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
everything else can start powering up

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.799 
everything else can start powering up
now<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> motherboards<00:00:51.120> clock<00:00:51.329> pulses<00:00:51.690> are

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
now the motherboards clock pulses are

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.150 
now the motherboards clock pulses are
going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> synchronize<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:52.770> will<00:00:52.949> start

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
going to synchronize which will start

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.970 
going to synchronize which will start
the<00:00:53.250> CPU<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.629> issue<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.289> CPU<00:00:55.590> doesn't

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the CPU the issue is the CPU doesn't

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.639 
the CPU the issue is the CPU doesn't
know<00:00:56.129> anything<00:00:56.370> there's<00:00:56.850> nothing<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> RAM

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
know anything there's nothing in the RAM

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
know anything there's nothing in the RAM
absolutely<00:00:58.649> nothing<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> heads<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
absolutely nothing so it heads to the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510 
absolutely nothing so it heads to the

startup test you see the readout on your
screen<00:01:16.530> afterwards<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
screen afterwards but you don't see it

screen afterwards but you don't see it
while<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:18.990> doing<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> once<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.759> done

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
while it's doing it so once it's done

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.660 
while it's doing it so once it's done
that<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.420> finds<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> video<00:01:22.350> card<00:01:22.680> bios<00:01:23.130> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that it finds the video card bios so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
that it finds the video card bios so
it's<00:01:23.790> got<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.450> display<00:01:25.080> things

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it's got to have a way to display things

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.010 
it's got to have a way to display things
for<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> talks<00:01:26.549> t<00:01:26.790> video<00:01:27.030> card<00:01:27.360> when

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
for you so it talks t video card when

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.510 
for you so it talks t video card when
it's<00:01:28.170> finished<00:01:28.530> that's<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it's finished that's when you see the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
it's finished that's when you see the
first<00:01:29.970> thing<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.630> screen<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.229> the

first thing on your screen it's the
video<00:01:31.740> cards<00:01:32.280> post<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> your

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
video cards post so you see that your

what<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:39.990> next<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.409> find<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
what it's going to do next is find the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.490 
what it's going to do next is find the
other<00:01:40.920> devices<00:01:41.400> connected<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> checks<00:01:43.290> all

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
other devices connected so it checks all

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.950 
other devices connected so it checks all
available<00:01:44.130> ports<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> USB<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
available ports so that's the USB the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.530 
available ports so that's the USB the
firewire<00:01:46.409> everything<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.880> when<00:01:48.210> you're

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
firewire everything this is when you're

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.870 
firewire everything this is when you're
about<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.680> BIOS<00:01:50.220> screen<00:01:50.399> whether

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
about to see the BIOS screen whether

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
about to see the BIOS screen whether
this<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.570> logo<00:01:52.049> or<00:01:52.259> whether<00:01:52.590> you've<00:01:52.770> set<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
this be a logo or whether you've set it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.710 
this be a logo or whether you've set it
to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> post<00:01:53.610> screen<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.329> do<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
to be the post screen like I do and you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.709 
to be the post screen like I do and you
can<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.409> everything<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:56.280> connected<00:01:56.909> so

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
can see everything that's connected so

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539 
can see everything that's connected so
what's<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.409> done<00:01:58.590> before<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.189> it's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
what's it's done before this it's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.580 
what's it's done before this it's
counted<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.600> memory<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.469> we

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
counted you all of your memory and we

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.260 
counted you all of your memory and we
remember<00:02:01.860> back<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.280> old<00:02:02.549> Intel<00:02:03.090> Pentium

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
remember back to the old Intel Pentium

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.780 
remember back to the old Intel Pentium
2s<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.590> could<00:02:04.829> watch<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.040> count<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> memory

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
2s you could watch it count the memory

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
2s you could watch it count the memory
you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.210> watch<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.509> memory<00:02:06.869> number<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.229> up

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
you can watch the memory number go up

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.169 
you can watch the memory number go up
and<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.220> will<00:02:08.280> determine<00:02:08.580> all<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and it will determine all of the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.999 
and it will determine all of the
hardware<00:02:09.420> attach<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.050> configure<00:02:10.590> them<00:02:10.679> for

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
hardware attach and configure them for

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.559 
hardware attach and configure them for
boot

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
boot

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.270 
boot
so<00:02:12.840> after<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.260> we<00:02:13.560> get<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.890> post<00:02:14.099> screen

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
so after that we get the post screen

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.670 
so after that we get the post screen
coming<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.599> summary<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.170> everything

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
coming up the summary of everything

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.399 
coming up the summary of everything
you've<00:02:17.010> got<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:18.599> next<00:02:18.750> thing<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.079> compute

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
you've got the next thing you compute

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.080 
you've got the next thing you compute
has<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.709> do<00:02:19.829> is<00:02:20.040> determine<00:02:20.400> what<00:02:20.939> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
has to do is determine what the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.789 
has to do is determine what the
operating<00:02:21.450> system<00:02:21.719> is<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.959> be<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.709> not

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
operating system is going to be it's not

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.020 
operating system is going to be it's not
going<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> run<00:02:23.099> on<00:02:23.219> the<00:02:23.310> bios<00:02:23.609> it's<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:23.909> going

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
going to run on the bios it's not going

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.729 
going to run on the bios it's not going
to<00:02:24.090> run<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.329> efi<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.319> you've<00:02:25.439> got<00:02:25.590> to

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
to run the efi so you've got to

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.780 
to run the efi so you've got to
determine<00:02:26.099> what<00:02:26.310> you're<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.549> to<00:02:26.609> boot<00:02:26.760> to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
determine what you're going to boot to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.000 
determine what you're going to boot to
next<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.930> does<00:02:28.079> that<00:02:28.290> by<00:02:28.530> pulling<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
next and it does that by pulling the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.059 
next and it does that by pulling the
CMOS<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.579> where<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.970> master<00:02:30.299> boot<00:02:30.450> record<00:02:30.629> is

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
CMOS on where the master boot record is

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.140 
CMOS on where the master boot record is
and<00:02:32.069> when<00:02:32.189> it<00:02:32.280> finds<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.609> master<00:02:32.879> boot<00:02:33.000> record

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and when it finds the master boot record

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.330 
and when it finds the master boot record
it<00:02:33.569> then<00:02:33.930> loads<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.439> secondary<00:02:34.890> boot<00:02:35.129> loader

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
it then loads the secondary boot loader

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.910 
it then loads the secondary boot loader
and<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:36.150> loads<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.540> rest<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.019> BIOS<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.530> ram

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
and it loads the rest of the BIOS to ram

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.339 
and it loads the rest of the BIOS to ram
and<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.909> operating<00:02:39.420> system<00:02:39.780> will<00:02:39.989> take<00:02:40.139> over

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
and the operating system will take over

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.740 
and the operating system will take over
the<00:02:40.560> rest<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.859> the<00:02:40.980> boot<00:02:41.099> process<00:02:41.689> okay<00:02:42.689> so

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the rest of the boot process okay so

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.539 
the rest of the boot process okay so
this<00:02:43.109> has<00:02:43.260> taken<00:02:43.409> me<00:02:43.680> almost<00:02:43.889> three<00:02:44.370> minutes

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
this has taken me almost three minutes

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.059 
this has taken me almost three minutes
to<00:02:44.819> explain<00:02:45.150> what<00:02:45.720> takes<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.139> computer<00:02:46.319> two

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
to explain what takes the computer two

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.970 
to explain what takes the computer two
seconds<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.879> do<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:49.049> mentioned<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.739> power

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
seconds to do as I mentioned the power

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.710 
seconds to do as I mentioned the power
supply<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.669> bit<00:02:50.909> that<00:02:50.939> takes<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.419> longest

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
supply is the bit that takes the longest

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.780 
supply is the bit that takes the longest
but<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.349> rest<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.769> it's<00:02:53.099> almost<00:02:53.310> instant

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
but the rest of this it's almost instant

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.149 
but the rest of this it's almost instant
we<00:02:53.909> don't<00:02:54.120> notice<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.629> we<00:02:55.169> aren't<00:02:55.560> at<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
we don't notice it we aren't at the

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.399 
we don't notice it we aren't at the
level<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.609> processor<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.239> works<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.169> many
