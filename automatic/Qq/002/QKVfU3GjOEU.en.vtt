 a usb security hole whatsapp spam 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.839
 Advertising and a smartphone as a ball 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.620
 vest that much more now in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.389
 news Let's go new lithium batteries 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.429
 should be able to double their term 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.650
 Scientist at Stanford University 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.170
 did it by means of a carbon 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 sign on nato level all the way 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.279
 unfortunately it is not yet realized 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 so very marcel ripe but in the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.580
 next years, then come up 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.800
 We really have to go there with one 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 extra or with his battery pack 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.870
 rumlaufen chamber has this week just a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.140
 Played 3 and doing a very funny 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.180
 Advertising seen in the whatsapp 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 was commissioned to evaluate whatsapp 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 and then he can make some apple products 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.530
 win 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.059
 regardless of that he is not like that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.469
 quite interested in apple products 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.070
 He once the legal notice thereof to 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.780
 seen and recognized that the whole 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.550
 planet49 is very important in such 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.110
 acquisitions you can never get him anything 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.449
 win is best looking for the big one 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 small or hidden somewhere on dx 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.219
 the side presses and plays on 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.470
 such whatsapp advertising and winning games 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.260
 and polls are not there 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.060
 mostly rip-off companies the company blue 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.090
 box has a new security gap underneath 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.040
 android found called fady the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.810
 used security certificates under 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.759
 Android with the complete rights 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.409
 about the device get a test if 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.330
 each affected not been or 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.710
 It's best to use the bluebox app 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.970
 Find out the link to this you will find 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.590
 below in the description or in the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.630
 Articles in the network already have several 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 product manager and companies describes 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.780
 given that you have a patch 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.280
 have published and became 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 mostly in front of the smartphone automatically 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.090
 downloaded and the device is back 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.930
 surely you should not be sure 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.610
 please check what apps are installed 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.020
 apropos security gaps three berliners 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.420
 security researchers have found out 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.799
 that you can stick out of a normal usb 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.149
 can do anything 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.829
 with a simple software you can 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.470
 the usb stick say that he has one now 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.149
 usb keyboard or a usb mouse and 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.930
 can also exactly those commands then 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.939
 To run 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.710
 the dangerous thing is that you are so to speak 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.689
 everything can do on a computer 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.280
 and other usb peripherals 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.990
 instead of being infected 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.490
 it is as dangerous as it sounds 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.740
 So far, however, is not such a case 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.509
 So it's really theoretical 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.459
 Practically practically there is none 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.150
 made so please also in 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.090
 future careful of 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.069
 demir where which equipment connects kombi 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.269
 to the remaining user week the lg 3 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.890
 got an update 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.599
 there was this mistake that that is 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.519
 device simply turns off now 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.689
 fixed the motto eex also has one 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.200
 get update and that the 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.579
 android version 4 point 4.4 the last of 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.700
 Oliver Samsung has new information 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.069
 to samsung galaxy alpha that's coming 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.109
 with nano with nano sim slot and one 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.519
 he wanted a little more alu the design 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.019
 not quite lying down but already has 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.299
 some information about the benchmark 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.530
 they are very interesting 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.349
 and strongly after a grip direction 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.810
 apple off and persuades user has one 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.430
 samsung galaxy s 4 used quite normally 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.319
 with the original parts the thing is in 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.810
 Vollbrand explodes whatever 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.680
 and he wanted one from samsung on it 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.870
 have a guarantee 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.519
 but he did not get that instead 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.290
 just htc meddled in 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.989
 The best prac- tice is easy on him 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.829
 a new htc smartphone sent that 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.109
 you can also do it 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.060
 what was this week so going to giga 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.220
 Chamber has decided that there is no 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.540
 Fans are more and wanted to know if you 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.129
 this looks exactly why he once 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.569
 started a survey that you can 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.010
 Please click on it there and 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.199
 just simply click on it below 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.299
 whether it still exists in your opinion or 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.549
 not reason for that was under 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.049
 Another is the test of the one plus one 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.340
 this week went online 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.769
 we have the thing on heart and 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.780
 kidney through and changed but should I 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.480
 say it is a huge part and that 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.879
 rest you see there as well was came 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.739
 last week in south korea it has become 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.409
 whole topic and above all 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.569
 South Koreans viewed and what he had to do 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.889
 say what he has so much experience 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.180
 he took everything with him 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.949
 a big article summarized 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.290
 very very interesting with a very 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:52.390
 funny picture that you will also find 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.220
 us on giga de 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.350
 a man in taiwan has a wallet 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.360
 how did he find the rightful one? 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.950
 owner wants to return before 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.480
 He just joked that he was 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.770
 of the contents of the purse first time 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.080
 get a decent beer 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.490
 and that's the opposite 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.890
 somehow did not like because he has 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.410
 Just pulled out a creak and gave them a shout 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.770
 shot with it 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.329
 luckily, a samsung galaxy had mega 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.430
 worn because this huge part has him 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.799
 just before the breast hung and the 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.630
 intercepted ball so you can say so 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.270
 big smartphone is almost one 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.360
 protection vest 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.830

 that's a good idea 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.390
 Excited here in the middle you come to 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.800
 the theme of how lousy the internet is 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.020
 have started a survey on the 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.340
 What you do, how much you do 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.240

 you can find everything at the bottom of the link 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.030
 on the article on the side you can

 we still subscribe there the next 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.330
 Two weeks are still coming 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.160
