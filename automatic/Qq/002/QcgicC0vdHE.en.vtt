00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.670
 hello dear friends video 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:12.870
 rented specifically for the site 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:16.000
 xaker dot ru well and in general I gathered 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.750
 power supply with adjustable output 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.029
 voltage and current means the circuit I took 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:31.929
 because of the video ok and here i collected the print 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.350
 the board itself did well and in general this one 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.590
 variable resistor fixed on 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:46.660
 a piece of wood and then between the wire down all 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:50.800
 drags well and generally filed I fall to the entrance 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.640
 I'm 13 volts at the output I picked up a light bulb 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.480
 filament at 12 volts means this one 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.430
 variable resistor adjusts 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.850
 This voltage regulates the current 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.130
 here I have a transistor to stand for t800 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.960
 18 kt 815 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:18.100
 Kt 818 I installed on the heat sink with 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:25.680
 Thermal grease here I want it later 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:29.470
 replace yes and in my article I said that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.490
 I did not put the output capacitor so 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.820
 like I was not there so I found 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.329
 I put the output capacitor 2200 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.290
 microfarad and input I set 2200 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:47.439
 microfarad instead of thousands microfarad well 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:53.640
 and in general, I think we will demonstrate the work 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:58.520
 device to put a light bulb 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.799
 turn on the circuit 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.579
 and there is nothing and now we start to turn 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.579
 voltage regulator 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:17.780
 Here is a light bulb in full heat 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:23.599
 and begin to turn off turn away to manage 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:29.959
 turn off to take control and him as 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:34.849
 bulb bang or not well and you can 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.680
 harshly well how well so at least so well 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.310
 and I generally turn off 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.730
 since my husband has a heat sink 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.590
 the transistor warms up very well 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.150
 I don't want to burn him 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.500
 well, and that means everything seems to be 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.470
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.480
 likes leave comments to all 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.480
 thanks for watching bye
