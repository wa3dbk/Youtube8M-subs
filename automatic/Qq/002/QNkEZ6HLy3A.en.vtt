himself<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:34.320> first<00:01:34.560> thing<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.799> look<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
himself the first thing I look at is the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
himself the first thing I look at is the
design<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.329> which<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.680> probably<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
design of them which is probably the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.910 
design of them which is probably the
main<00:01:38.100> selling<00:01:38.549> point<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.909> these<00:01:39.150> headphones

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
main selling point of these headphones

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.100 
main selling point of these headphones
they<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:40.979> come<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.579> huge<00:01:42.450> range<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.810> colors

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.100 
they do come in a huge range of colors
think<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.470> about<00:01:43.590> 14<00:01:44.130> different<00:01:44.399> colors<00:01:45.110> if

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110

you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.310> doesn't<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:02.700> rip<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you know it doesn't really rip that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.020 
you know it doesn't really rip that
easily<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.170> quite<00:02:04.320> strong<00:02:04.790> braided<00:02:05.790> here

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
easily it's quite strong braided here

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.779 
easily it's quite strong braided here
and<00:02:06.360> even<00:02:06.630> here<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.560> well<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.799> braided<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.519> if

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and even here as well as braided so if

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
and even here as well as braided so if
it<00:02:09.299> gets<00:02:09.420> caught<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.720> something<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.380> less

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it gets caught and something it's less

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.270 
it gets caught and something it's less
likely<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.280> break<00:02:11.660> um<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.739> that's<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.070> pretty

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
likely to break um so that's just pretty

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.620 
likely to break um so that's just pretty
much<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.549> design<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.180> quite<00:02:15.329> simple

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630

designs got a matte finish here and when

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.210 
designs got a matte finish here and when
you're<00:02:18.870> wearing<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.320> do<00:02:19.470> look<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.920> nice

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
suffering up a bit so maybe I have to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.520 
suffering up a bit so maybe I have to
probe<00:03:18.030> out<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.419> few<00:03:18.689> months<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.109> use<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.439> they

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
probe out a few months of use and they

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.270 
probe out a few months of use and they
will<00:03:19.709> get<00:03:20.099> quite<00:03:20.370> soft<00:03:21.409> I<00:03:22.409> do<00:03:22.769> like<00:03:23.099> the

will get quite soft I do like the
folding<00:03:24.269> design<00:03:24.389> of<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.079> this<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:25.700> it's

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
folding design of it like this so it's

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.940 
folding design of it like this so it's
quite<00:03:26.939> easy<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.239> pack<00:03:27.450> away<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:27.930> mean<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.739> was<00:03:28.919> a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.979 
so I would have thought that would have
sucked<00:03:44.489> one<00:03:44.699> of<00:03:44.790> them<00:03:44.909> in<00:03:45.030> as<00:03:45.150> well<00:03:45.329> so<00:03:45.629> if<00:03:45.870> you

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
sucked one of them in as well so if you

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.210 
sucked one of them in as well so if you
can<00:03:46.169> fold<00:03:46.439> in<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.859> store<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:48.979> the<00:03:49.979> sound

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
can fold in and store it the sound

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.469 
can fold in and store it the sound
quality<00:03:50.430> was<00:03:52.099> fairly<00:03:53.099> decent<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.879> mean<00:03:53.909> 50

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
quality was fairly decent I mean 50

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:57.670 
quality was fairly decent I mean 50
pounds<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.620> wasn't<00:03:55.979> going<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.159> be<00:03:56.220> high-end

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
pounds it wasn't going to be high-end

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.929 
pounds it wasn't going to be high-end
sound<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:59.069> mean<00:03:59.250> compared<00:03:59.669> to<00:03:59.699> a<00:03:59.759> lot<00:03:59.879> of

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
sound I mean compared to a lot of

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.110 
sound I mean compared to a lot of
headphones<00:04:00.329> in<00:04:00.540> its<00:04:00.780> range<00:04:01.139> it's<00:04:01.819> not<00:04:02.819> too<00:04:03.090> bad

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
headphones in its range it's not too bad

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.569 
headphones in its range it's not too bad
but<00:04:03.449> at<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.379> same<00:04:04.620> time<00:04:04.919> there<00:04:05.549> are

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
but at the same time there are

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.030 
but at the same time there are
headphones<00:04:05.909> out<00:04:06.299> there<00:04:06.569> with<00:04:06.780> I'll<00:04:07.290> say<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.769> lot

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
headphones out there with I'll say a lot

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.569 
headphones out there with I'll say a lot
better<00:04:09.019> sound<00:04:10.019> quality<00:04:10.109> for<00:04:10.680> their<00:04:11.099> price<00:04:11.549> I

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
better sound quality for their price I

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.580 
better sound quality for their price I
mean<00:04:11.849> obviously<00:04:11.939> these<00:04:12.299> headphones<00:04:13.049> are<00:04:13.409> more

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
mean obviously these headphones are more

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.409 
mean obviously these headphones are more
aimed<00:04:13.769> at<00:04:13.949> style<00:04:14.310> wise<00:04:14.669> and<00:04:14.939> sound<00:04:17.209> but<00:04:18.209> that

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
aimed at style wise and sound but that

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.899 
aimed at style wise and sound but that
they<00:04:18.599> they<00:04:19.470> were<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.769> best<00:04:20.009> sounding<00:04:20.579> things

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
they they were the best sounding things

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.490 
they they were the best sounding things
but<00:04:21.120> if<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.329> are<00:04:21.359> looking<00:04:21.539> style<00:04:22.019> these<00:04:22.259> are

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
but if you are looking style these are

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.999 
but if you are looking style these are
what<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.460> should<00:04:23.699> go<00:04:23.820> for<00:04:24.470> they<00:04:25.470> do<00:04:25.530> come<00:04:25.889> with

works quite well I mean I found that the
sound<00:05:05.719> kept<00:05:06.829> constantly<00:05:07.829> sometimes<00:05:08.489> with

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
sound kept constantly sometimes with

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.149 
sound kept constantly sometimes with
headphones<00:05:09.029> that<00:05:09.119> do<00:05:09.329> have<00:05:09.479> this<00:05:09.599> function

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
headphones that do have this function

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.889 
headphones that do have this function
functionality<00:05:11.239> the<00:05:12.239> head<00:05:12.389> thought<00:05:12.659> they

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:12.899 
functionality the head thought they

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:15.499 
functionality the head thought they
sound<00:05:13.259> on<00:05:13.589> the<00:05:13.739> first<00:05:14.610> pair<00:05:14.909> of<00:05:14.939> less<00:05:15.360> a

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
sound on the first pair of less a

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.929 
sound on the first pair of less a
decrease<00:05:15.959> because<00:05:16.829> the<00:05:17.249> powers<00:05:17.579> going<00:05:17.729> to<00:05:17.879> the

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:17.939 
decrease because the powers going to the

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.029 
decrease because the powers going to the
other<00:05:18.029> headphones<00:05:18.269> but<00:05:19.259> with<00:05:19.439> these<00:05:19.649> the

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
other headphones but with these the

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.249 
other headphones but with these the
sound<00:05:20.459> stayed<00:05:20.849> exactly<00:05:21.089> the<00:05:21.629> same<00:05:21.839> didn't

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
sound stayed exactly the same didn't

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.049 
sound stayed exactly the same didn't
affect<00:05:22.589> in<00:05:22.769> any<00:05:22.889> way<00:05:23.129> once<00:05:23.489> a<00:05:23.579> headphone<00:05:23.879> was

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:24.059 
affect in any way once a headphone was

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.019 
affect in any way once a headphone was
plugged<00:05:24.299> into<00:05:24.479> it<00:05:24.919> so<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:25.949> did<00:05:26.159> like<00:05:26.369> this<00:05:26.579> it

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
plugged into it so I did like this it

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.009 
plugged into it so I did like this it
works<00:05:27.269> really<00:05:27.360> well<00:05:27.689> with<00:05:27.899> these<00:05:28.049> headphones

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:30.019 
works really well with these headphones

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:32.899 
works really well with these headphones
but<00:05:31.019> overall<00:05:31.499> if<00:05:31.679> I<00:05:31.769> take<00:05:31.979> into<00:05:32.279> consideration

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
but overall if I take into consideration

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.179 
but overall if I take into consideration
style<00:05:33.269> comfort<00:05:33.809> sound<00:05:34.559> quality<00:05:35.009> and

style comfort sound quality and

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.249 
style comfort sound quality and
functionality<00:05:35.519> I<00:05:36.209> would<00:05:36.689> have<00:05:36.839> to<00:05:36.989> give<00:05:37.139> it

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
functionality I would have to give it

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.119 
functionality I would have to give it
about<00:05:37.349> a<00:05:37.889> six<00:05:38.609> out<00:05:38.819> of<00:05:38.849> ten<00:05:39.149> purely<00:05:39.689> because

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129 
about a six out of ten purely because

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.519 
about a six out of ten purely because
the<00:05:41.129> sound<00:05:41.489> wasn't<00:05:41.999> you<00:05:42.899> know<00:05:43.019> it<00:05:43.199> wasn't

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
the sound wasn't you know it wasn't

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.139

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.189 
have made the ear cushions a bit soft i

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.999

mean<00:05:53.369> the<00:05:54.029> headband<00:05:54.479> is<00:05:54.749> really<00:05:55.439> soft<00:05:55.679> to<00:05:55.860> do

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.169 
they could have made a bit softer so
