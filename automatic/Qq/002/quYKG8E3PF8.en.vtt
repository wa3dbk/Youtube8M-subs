00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.230
 when you give permission instantly for 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.240
 that is how it is allows you to be as it is 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.690
 you are giving yourself permission to 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.879
 be like you are 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.930
 because the way you perceive the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:03.840
 instant reflects the way you think 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.840
 and that permission that little strife 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.480
 open a minimum space in your system 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.000
 thought where that change that we 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:20.020
 direct to see our willingness to be 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.020
 happy and to experience the can happen 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.250
 nobody realizes that exist as 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 you exist is impressive no one is given 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.930
 count nobody because we suffer it instead 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.930
 to live it 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.210
 this is to sit down and stay 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.210
 perplexed 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:02:00.410
 nobody is happy about the fact of existing 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.170
 because why exist comes from the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.730
 existence existence comes from the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.820
 cause and the cause that exists to me is pure 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:15.040
 happiness because if it were not, I would not 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.040
 I would explain to myself 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.350
 in order to give life to a being you need 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.050
 all your conscience 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.680
 to give life to a conscious being 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.800
 it requires all your consciousness all your 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.680
 consciousness to be able to make a garden 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.670
 with all your consciousness you need to be 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.670
 fully happy 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.840
 in the chair is a reason for joy 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.440
 means that you do not depend on anything or 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.780
 nobody that the only thing you depend on is 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.440
 your own existence of life that is 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.440
 happening when
