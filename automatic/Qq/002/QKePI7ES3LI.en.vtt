 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.200
 channel and a week has passed mean I today to 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.560
 to you with your sweet tooth report from 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.560
 rhyolis 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.629
 I embroidered all week it literally 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.379
 a couple of hours in the evening here but I believe in 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.940
 I have a pretty good promotion and 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.500
 let's see what I have now 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.500
 was last week 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.360
 and this is how my work for this looks 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.670
 moment 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.920
 as you see I embroidered a vase 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.610
 flowered pot 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:16.610
 a little pot with flowers embroidered a little 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:20.470
 paws here they here and here still 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.050
 it will be a little bit of flowers it's just 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.140
 another page of the scheme 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:31.369
 I also have a little more background embroidered 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.360
 here here so here are my 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.869
 promotion at the moment on this 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.950
 a week 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:47.450
 Strangely enough embroidered to me 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:54.460
 still too heavy do not know maybe 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:57.610
 the fact that he is here and the scheme is lighter than 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.130
 for example in shushun 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 so somehow concentration is less and 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.010
 maybe because of this i am making mistakes i 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.830
 i'm only saying even here in this in this 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.769
 Plot somewhere I already or once rummaged 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.410
 In general, as I do not know, I had 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:26.690
 mistakes and a little bit I'm on one cross 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:29.510
 Went over here he is for the field you somewhere in my 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.049
 here on the line was a mistake and so 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.910
 It turned out that I went to one cross 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.180
 But I think it's okay with that. 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.180
 no 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:46.160
 strings I like the principle of crosses 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:55.750
 already it turns out more or less pits now 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:03:01.030
 show them here such crosses in principle 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:05.830
 rovnenkie but of course is far from going 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.739
 I just bastard from blends here for example 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.110
 here 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:23.200
 blends here and I already showed you blends 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:26.140
 here, too , I leave this work on 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.830
 two weeks two weeks she is not being embroidered 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:34.870
 will be so when you already know from my 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.790
 previous videos i'm going on vacation but 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.160
 nothing a bit of a break from this job 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.470
 because somehow this week she told me 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.989
 a bit fed up I really like her 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:52.569
 but Iâ€™m already a little to embroider 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:55.330
 fed up here as regards the circuit so 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.750
 here I have one piece here i see 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:05.049
 three goals 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:09.910
 embroidered and the main scheme is 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:13.870
 so here it looks possible even on 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:18.760
 this week I will do backsticks here 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:24.220
 here on the leg and here on here 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:31.000
 Flowers see if I have time possible 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.510
 I'll just start to embroider 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.490
 I 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.729
 sunday so i will have another 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:43.000
 a little time for something here 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:45.270
 embroider an organism like this 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.460
 I have not changed anything 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:56.130
 same organizer and such trifles 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:05:01.479
 life where I have my strings 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.940
 here are the strings do not wave 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.970
 Thinning very high quality and 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.840
 quality strings to me they are very and 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:14.320
 I like it very much 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.340
 buy a whole palette of wool 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:23.680
 there are a few rhyolis strings there 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:28.840
 pretty and normal money here 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:35.560
 a little bit i started to go out on this schema 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:41.979
 here here here on the dog so here she 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:44.229
 it looks like a floor crosses embroider me not 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:48.930
 really like more like embroidering 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.930
 media crosses well nothing can be done 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:59.460
 the result is worth it so that's it 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:06.190
 I told you the report showed 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:09.450
