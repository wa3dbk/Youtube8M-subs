00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.009
 the salmon cake and a simple idea 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.020
 fast and impressive to bring 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.880
 on the table a really tasty appetizer 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.630
 just a few steps are needed to prepare it 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.630
 let's see it together 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.140
 ingredients for 6 8 people 260 grams 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.160
 of smoked salmon 350 grams of bread 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.290
 rye 50 g small tender spinach 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.510
 250 g of philadelphia half rind of 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.730
 grated lemon a tablespoon of milk 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.309
 or fresh dill liquid cream how much 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.910
 just salt pepper enough to 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.309
 cover 300 g of philadelphia 100 g of 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.290
 smoked salmon a spoonful of milk 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.120
 or cream to decorate lumpfish dill eggs 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.620
 then we start by creating the cream with 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.780
 which we are going to fill our own 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.760
 cake we put in a bowl of 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.780
 Philadelphia or any cheese 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.519
 fresh spread we add a 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.350
 spoon of milk or panda just 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.140
 what it takes to soften the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:16.460
 all of the chopped dill the rind of a 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.030
 grated lemon a pinch of pepper e 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.030
 of salt 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.490
 now we amalgamate the whole forming one 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.500
 nice thick cream and we can help you with 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.500
 a whisk or a whisk 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.170
 and now we compose our cake of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.909
 salmon the cream is ready we support one 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 slice of rye bread we already have 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.110
 found shaped in a rectangular shape 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.360
 but you can eventually if you have 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.030
 found another form to cut it into 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.970
 this way so let's take some 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.970
 cream we save it on the first slice 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.520
 of course you can also use a 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.520
 other bread format 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.400
 let's go over the salmon 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.400
 smoked 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.560
 let's go and cover it completely let's go 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.760
 to add on the salmon of the leaves 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.760
 keep spinach possibly small 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.510
 is our first layer is formed now 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.489
 we lay on top of another slice of 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.180
 bread and keep it up until the end 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.180
 the ingredients 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.170
 now I put the street cake in 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.670
 refrigerator to firm up to compact and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.590
 we don't take care of the cream then 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.350
 will serve to completely cover it 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:14.280
 so let's put the smoked salmon in 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.280
 a mixer equipped with blades we join 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.280
 philadelphia 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:33.500
 and a goccino of milk now we go to 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.060
 blend everything well 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.800
 I recommend you shake it for some 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.420
 minutes because the cream that will result 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.830
 it will have to be very smooth there 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.430
 they must therefore be small pieces of 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.430
 salmon 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.980
 and here we are ready to dress ours 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.989
 first cake to do this 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.579
 operation put the salmon cream 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.129
 in the refrigerator for at least half an hour 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.110
 until it compacts well then then with 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.360
 we will spread a spatula on the data and 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:13.409
 on the surface covering it 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:15.390
 entirely help yourself naturally with 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.620
 a spatula like this or like a 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.620
 knife with a smooth blade 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.650
 now that we have covered the whole 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.210
 cake with salmon cream we can 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.800
 refrigerate for at least an hour 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.800
 to harden it was to sweat it 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.919
 our salmon pie as you see is 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.199
 ready I decorated it with eggs 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.780
 of red lumpfish and tufts of dill 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.699
 an excellent result in a very short time 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.150
 enjoy your meal and the next video
