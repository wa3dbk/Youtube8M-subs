00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.760
 Souto is a platform game that will have 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.010
 very interesting concepts that already 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.650
 here on the channel is one of them is the 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.150
 one-button gameplay 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.429
 which he may note in several others 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.859
 games already appeared as the carnival says the 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.810
 google offers the boys and all that 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.220
 game concept that you play with only one 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.259
 button I think it's all very interesting 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.899
 because I think a lot of creativity 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.970
 comes with limitations if you see until 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.800
 games in the past even if they 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.680
 had to do with technical limitations 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.120
 and today it is a matter of style in 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.579
 joking, we 'll go to our own 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.199
 pixel art that he sees as limitation and 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.210
 today is a graphic style is a decision 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.379
 creative way to create something cool with 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.420
 based on food 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.039
 only without these limitations of 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.559
 today we can do things a lot 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.999
 creative and limiting sounds and we will have 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.899
 platform game in which you play only with 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.370
 a button 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.170
 their gameplay consists of the following 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.760
 your character does not run 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.100
 that screen but always when 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.109
 he ends a jump he gives a slip 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.940
 as if he fell on a day does not know 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.920
 It's using these people you know you're moving. 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.840
 A passage for you then. 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.240
 position for the next jump 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.420
 You have to do a calculation with 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.970
 advance of some 12 cars before 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.460
 You can do the right thing next time. 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.110
 do not fall into the hole in the wall and loose game 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.480
 is recommended for franck players who 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.580
 likes really difficult games 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.160
 This game is a very difficult game, and you 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.750
 the only control of the polished height of the jump is 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.130
 by the time you press any 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.140
 button on your frame and this will depend 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.600
 hours and hours of fun you do not 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.640
 it's a short game it would be a cruel game 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.500
 said it was much easier, huh? 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.520
 But you can see and I could not. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.290
 I think I pass 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.850
 I think I've only gone from the second 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.340
 do not be fooled release is a game 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.870
 extremely addictive and as soon as 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.130
 Finish recording this video, I'm 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.810
 ready to open the game again and 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.590
 keep trying to pass the next 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.390
 phases 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.980
 unless he has he can create 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.900
 a very interesting atmosphere of 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.580
 very beautiful art direction very 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.200
 interesting all based on black and 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.510
 with a colored background but he can 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.700
 make a background for max very cool and 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.920
 soundtrack is very well chosen 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.750
 also was only made then mabe games is 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.100
 web games all have a 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.450
 footprint very similar to that in the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.129
 time 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.629
 the engine with platform game 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.160
 extremely simple to pass this property 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.910
 practically then if you liked 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.379
 weld 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.300
 it is worth knowing the work in the 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.830
 environment leaving his site too and 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.700
 jump was developed in less than one 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.500
 week for the game site competition 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.060

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.280

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.140
 and was only in the middle of the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.900
 competition then jumped a game 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.340
 a must for the most audacious players 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.720

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.879

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.450
 interesting 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.579
 I find it worth it very low and 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.579
