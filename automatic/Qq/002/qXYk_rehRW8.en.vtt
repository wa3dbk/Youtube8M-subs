00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.129
 hello hello to all my followers on this side and on the other side of the channel pointed 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 this is the end that exceeds the number 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.810
 9 d messi that says it's been many days but 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.909
 I wanted to talk 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:16.179
 match them up competing for those people that the annual manners to 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.070
 pay and for all those who want to strengthen their programming language 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.989
 before going to the bottom 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.230
 these go there already reaches the number of 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.630
 in 3d with the dike 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.740
 try to keep the ce doublets later for what they had a the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.669
 strongest programming base 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.230
 with this panorama it is not better 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.340
 what are we going to do in this in this tutorial 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.570
 this 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.640
 this kind of doing an introduction to 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.430
 the applications of several views until now we have only been doing 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.030
 applications that 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.620
 they have a view that is 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.360
 you only have one window and there you have all the coasts and in three fields 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.920
 texo your keyboard 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.260
 but well this becomes limiting because just in that still 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.350
 it's a guy a very small part 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.969
 but it has many resources then at some point the screen 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.280
 and the space you have to show things gets too small to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.050
 all I can do 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.480
 so let's see how 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.140
 rather what forms has apo given us for 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.400
 give several views to my applications 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.360
 then let's see the two ways there 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.790
 first of all 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.160
 we'll see 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.990
 in the other one 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.890
 kessel 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 your home 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.689
 the first form 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.150
 I was ready listed below 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.930
 i is pretty, it allows me to change my view 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.640
 for example here I have one in this thirtieth stevenot on a calculator 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.850
 Speech discount and 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 calculates the discount next year 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.390
 this has nothing to do with this application here 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.460
 they agree with me this is a cradle that curator of discounts that is 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.619
 totally different that I have something totally different since I have another 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.180
 total thing 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.690
 totally different 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.690
 here I mean with this 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.289
 this part of here 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.859
 has absolutely nothing to do with the part here 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.779
 what does this mean that the classes that control each of the views 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.439
 they are not linked 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.679
 in this case 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.519
 the class that controls 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.629
 this hop squares control 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.769
 is not bound to me depends nor your class this kind of here 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.440
 that against lazio cost of skanska al kotick acz 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.489
 generally when we are 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.549
 common with which we are 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.549
 thinking about the debut architecture of application 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.529
 I try to 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.289
 min 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:54.129
 to leave things as orderly as possible then here I am almost in 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.679
 a class division 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:57.359
 that do not have to see each other 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.549
 that's the way the iphone developers 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.120
 we try to schedule for that notification he 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.190
 had to control 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.470
 both the control then I saw that prove that state reiterates that under what 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.750
 then in this case the classes are not linked to each other there is no 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.379
 connections between them 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.159
 there are four cases 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.879
 just be 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.559
 but well we're going to see that rather 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.019
 in another application that I have here 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.839
 I wanted yamada 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:26.059
 na 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.650
 The ice is obligatory 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.650
 when I was learning to use these measurement controls 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.599
 mark cuban here what happens 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.279
 mckay here 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.159
 things 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.919
 if they are linked for example here 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.079
 here I already have an arrangement that holds all this information percy for example 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.499
 if I give him in this other crime 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:51.289
 tells me by the way plus you the disclosure button to 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.429
 percent said bugs maddox the iss 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:56.980
 So here is this information 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.849
 I did not tunnel in this class necessarily because I had already 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.200
 put in the class above 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.639
 Well I can I want to give the information 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.029
 to this other view that is to say I have the view that controls this class 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.420
 peron a class with this visit 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.750
 and I have another class that controls this view but 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.779
 as I have the information in this first class 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.059
 already 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:20.079
 the next classic csi that I see after touching the button 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.610
 just already the beta information of the previous class to what I mean with this 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.400
 what 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.680
 It's not like the air when I'm using 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.729
 this kind of distinction 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:31.949
 controls 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.199
 min this type because they are left like this 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.449
 the 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.650
 cells 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.460
 Spiral ata late eating things mahut I will try to put classes that are 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.560
 linked together is when I touched a button to show another view 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.680
 I will generally use things 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.300
 that came from the attacker of the other class things like objects the information 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.759
 moke stocks this are the the network threads said analysis 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.050
 justly 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.030
 it accommodates me more use it in this way yes 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.370
 in fact ap a car builds well for what 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.559
 things the holidays that are linked in different ways 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.979
 can be arranged so that when 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.979
 I touched something for example who tweeted credit not 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.160
 I'm going to see information for thomas jefferson so he touched it 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.810
 and already hurt the information that was so scared meals that was already the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.270
 date that was already 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.270
 the name tonces here to nothing else happened yes 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.069
 he spent it for plains redefining it all here where he abused minis 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:33.900
 of the properties of 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.189
 language oriented to cult objects and 3rd what good 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.650
 I'm going to your goal a series of tutorials that are about to go up 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.650
 but being in the fight list of competitions but the guys 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.650
 then finally 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.009
 this is 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.840
 are the two formations of contracts allows us to show different views 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.250
 in fact if you take a look at your father everything to his attacker and they go to the 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.389
 music application 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.220
 this you can see it stop music in it in that sports school of 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.529
 the application of boxes on the iphone 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.569
 they will realize that 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.789
 it is very well illustrated they text that in the part below the bar 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:12.629
 the things are there are not applied to each other absolutely nothing 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:13.539
 once 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.749
 artists other is I've seen him three some are things that are totally 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:20.130
 separated from each other 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.199
 but if for example attacks and touches I do not know the favorite society 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.500
 will give you information from the same artist 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.419
 no house duck ac information is related 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.730
 110 in general 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.730
 lavadita that some noda change of classes down 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:39.969
 pipe in exchange for views has different classes classes that are not linked 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:40.760
 each 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.910
 for the time and for the inheritance and polymorphism that we already know of 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.409
 competition yes 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.529
 instead those that 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:49.540
 those that depend on the cells 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.839
 generally they 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:55.229
 we give classes that are linked by and heritage oporto 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.529
 let's say for so many properties of the language that will help us to give it a 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:03.629
 more efficient operation our application 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:06.460
 this was a total of a lot of me talking 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.830
 but 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.309
 this one where I'm going to show you how to use 

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:13.930
 the one who had told them first in the 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.930
 the bandit below is not done 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.120
 that allows me to change views in the three that are not related between 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.800
 yes 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.180
 let's do it via 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.350
 inter asked the park is going to give anything for granted is a little more 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.800
 turn on tutorial 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.759
 I hope this is coming up much any questions or questions in please 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.320
 do not forget to subscribe and right now only the other one until then
