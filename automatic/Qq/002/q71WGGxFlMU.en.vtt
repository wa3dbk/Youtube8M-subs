00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
you hit a note and this is take a C note

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.560 
you hit a note and this is take a C note
okay<00:01:56.600> if<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.780> move<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.380> half-step<00:01:59.299> that<00:02:00.299> makes

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
okay if I move up a half-step that makes

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.530 
okay if I move up a half-step that makes
it<00:02:00.750> sharp<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.430> half<00:02:02.430> step<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.790> moving<00:02:03.299> just

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
it sharp and a half step is moving just

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.340 
it sharp and a half step is moving just
one<00:02:03.990> fret<00:02:04.579> to<00:02:05.579> move<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.909> whole<00:02:06.119> step<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.869> would

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
one fret to move a whole step I would

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.100 
one fret to move a whole step I would
move

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
move

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.859 
move
two<00:02:08.200> friends<00:02:08.619> an<00:02:09.100> after<00:02:09.759> seeing<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.330> alphabet

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
two friends an after seeing the alphabet

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.550 
two friends an after seeing the alphabet
comes<00:02:11.620> D<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.520> if<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.730> move<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.180> Fred's<00:02:13.540> that's<00:02:14.320> a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
comes D so if I move to Fred's that's a

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.790 
comes D so if I move to Fred's that's a
denote<00:02:15.270> okay<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:17.650> between<00:02:18.990> would<00:02:19.990> be<00:02:20.200> C<00:02:20.440> sharp

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
denote okay in between would be C sharp

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.960 
denote okay in between would be C sharp
so<00:02:21.460> we'd<00:02:21.580> go<00:02:21.730> C<00:02:22.060> C<00:02:23.020> sharp<00:02:23.100> D<00:02:24.100> I'm<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.820> to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
so we'd go C C sharp D I'm going to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.700 
so we'd go C C sharp D I'm going to
start<00:02:25.180> with<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.360> string<00:02:25.630> open<00:02:25.840> I'm<00:02:26.290> gonna<00:02:26.470> walk

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
start with a string open I'm gonna walk

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.530 
start with a string open I'm gonna walk
it<00:02:26.920> up<00:02:27.040> for<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:27.730> get<00:02:27.880> an<00:02:27.970> idea<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.330> what

it up for you and get an idea of what

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.430 
it up for you and get an idea of what
I'm<00:02:28.660> talking<00:02:28.870> about

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
if I hit this string open this is he

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.600 
if I hit this string open this is he
okay<00:02:33.550> there's<00:02:34.180> no<00:02:34.510> such<00:02:34.870> thing<00:02:35.170> as<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.650> sharp<00:02:36.010> or

this and the end of this I promise you
you'll<00:02:43.570> see<00:02:43.780> how<00:02:43.930> easy<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.459> if<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.610> go

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
you'll see how easy it is so if I go

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.780 
you'll see how easy it is so if I go
from<00:02:45.790> e<00:02:46.380> next<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.739> alphabet<00:02:48.250> would<00:02:48.400> be<00:02:48.580> F

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
from e next in the alphabet would be F

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.580 
from e next in the alphabet would be F
which<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.870> first<00:02:50.170> fret<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.920> string

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
which is the first fret of that string

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.589 
which is the first fret of that string
okay

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
okay

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.039 
okay
the<00:02:55.349> next<00:02:55.709> fret<00:02:55.950> F<00:02:56.219> does<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> sharp<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.840> go

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
the next fret F does have a sharp so go

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:11.599 
the next fret F does have a sharp so go
F<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.590> F<00:02:58.829> summer<00:03:00.889> G<00:03:03.469> g-sharp<00:03:04.469> a<00:03:08.239> nice<00:03:09.239> sharp<00:03:10.609> B

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
F to F summer G g-sharp a nice sharp B

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.640 
F to F summer G g-sharp a nice sharp B
now<00:03:12.599> we<00:03:12.719> already<00:03:12.840> determined<00:03:13.379> there's<00:03:13.530> no

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
now we already determined there's no

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.199 
now we already determined there's no
such<00:03:13.829> thing<00:03:14.040> as<00:03:14.069> B<00:03:14.340> sharp<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:15.000> after<00:03:15.389> become<00:03:15.870> C

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
such thing as B sharp so after become C

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.250 
such thing as B sharp so after become C
C<00:03:18.209> sharp<00:03:19.010> D<00:03:20.010> d<00:03:20.629> sharp<00:03:22.459> B<00:03:23.719> once<00:03:24.719> you<00:03:24.840> get<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.139> the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
C sharp D d sharp B once you get to the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.679 
C sharp D d sharp B once you get to the
twelfth<00:03:25.620> red<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:27.000> name<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.419> note<00:03:27.569> that

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
twelfth red the name of the note that

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.899 
twelfth red the name of the note that
you<00:03:27.840> come<00:03:28.079> up<00:03:28.109> with<00:03:28.260> should<00:03:28.950> also<00:03:29.219> be<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.760> name

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
you come up with should also be the name

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.899 
you come up with should also be the name
of<00:03:29.969> that<00:03:30.239> string<00:03:30.689> okay<00:03:31.469> because<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.310> concept

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
of that string okay because the concept

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.459 
of that string okay because the concept
behind<00:03:33.560> all<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.829> is<00:03:34.949> at<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.189> twelfth<00:03:35.609> red

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:36.469 
behind all of it is at the twelfth red

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.439 
behind all of it is at the twelfth red
everything<00:03:37.469> basically<00:03:37.769> starts<00:03:38.579> over<00:03:39.030> that

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
everything basically starts over that

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.420 
everything basically starts over that
you<00:03:39.719> did<00:03:39.900> down<00:03:40.139> here<00:03:40.169> it's<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:40.769> in<00:03:41.159> a<00:03:41.219> higher

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
you did down here it's just in a higher

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.420 
you did down here it's just in a higher
octave<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.810> hitting<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.319> twelfth<00:03:43.799> fret<00:03:44.010> on

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
octave so hitting the twelfth fret on

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.439 
octave so hitting the twelfth fret on
the<00:03:44.519> E<00:03:44.879> string<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:46.459> simply<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.489> higher<00:03:47.849> octave

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
the E string is simply a higher octave

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.000 
the E string is simply a higher octave
of<00:03:48.480> playing<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.230> same<00:03:49.469> string<00:03:49.889> open

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
of playing that same string open

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.949 
of playing that same string open
and<00:03:52.550> when<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.670> say<00:03:52.909> octet<00:03:53.420> there's<00:03:53.599> a<00:03:53.659> lot<00:03:53.840> of

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
and when I say octet there's a lot of

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.320 
and when I say octet there's a lot of
turns<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.560> stuff<00:03:54.849> another<00:03:55.849> lesson<00:03:56.090> we're

this<00:06:59.119> concept<00:06:59.719> and<00:07:00.019> you<00:07:00.139> could<00:07:00.289> walk<00:07:00.559> up<00:07:00.800> and

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
this concept and you could walk up and

this concept and you could walk up and
you<00:07:00.979> could<00:07:01.189> find<00:07:01.459> G<00:07:01.849> and<00:07:02.539> it<00:07:02.659> really<00:07:02.839> is<00:07:02.989> a

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:03.019 
you could find G and it really is a

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:05.739 
you could find G and it really is a
helpful<00:07:03.529> tool<00:07:03.739> as<00:07:03.979> time<00:07:04.729> goes<00:07:05.059> by<00:07:05.089> and<00:07:05.659> the

helpful tool as time goes by and the
more<00:07:05.779> you<00:07:06.229> play<00:07:06.529> the<00:07:06.919> more<00:07:07.279> this<00:07:07.699> concept<00:07:08.299> to

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:08.389 
more you play the more this concept to

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:10.869 
more you play the more this concept to
come<00:07:08.629> to<00:07:08.839> you<00:07:08.989> then<00:07:09.169> eventually<00:07:09.579> become<00:07:10.579> part
