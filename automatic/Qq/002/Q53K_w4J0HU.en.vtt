00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.349
 what started as a normal day for a group of oil tankers became 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.349
 in a meeting with the unknown 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.100
 big silver object caught their eye as they approached the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 western limit of the plateau 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.480
 the oil tankers reached the limit of the plateau turned into a disc with 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 approximately 30 meters in diameter 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.080
 the disk was intact 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
 which suggested a landing 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.449
 the decision is with two witnesses who says this 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.640
 and we all 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 which at the time were the young and did not find anything 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.200
 despite the samu supervisors who was a little older shouted wanted to 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 walk away from there 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.490
 except for a broken hatch 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.490
 there were no visible signs of gaza 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.200
 everyone told of having seen two bodies through the broken hatch 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.050
 a few hours later trucks appeared 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.080
 government deputy 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 and had learned from the mistakes made in vain 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760
 an army quickly assumed 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 troy of the situation 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.180
 nine months before the incident and the next one to the forum for the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
 many newspapers in the country 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.529
 the military learned how to recover a flying saucer with nine shots 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:17.239
 sixth the secret was imposed as soon as the military arrived on the scene 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.679
 fall 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:19.989
 luiza brunet 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.439
 the residents remembered their patriotic duty to the 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.549
 U.S 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.469
 and the jurors made them secret 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.709
 58 years, kept the secretary in cases of national security because 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.769
 respect the government we trusted well 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.779
 the military wants a machine and currently 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.779
 and did what it took to take it 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.199

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.199
 or 16 very burnt alien bodies 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.729
 the rescue team raised both the ship and the number of alien corpses to the site 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.729
 insurance saved you from the press 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.369
 technically has to take us to a military base closer and then the 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.340
 sent to the appropriate place 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.360
 for what they wanted to do but the base is going to hit pressure would be the final destination 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.980
 the fall in astana which is considered as the most important accident yesterday 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
 10 due to the large number of alien bodies 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:40.399
 but researchers say there have been many other cases all 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:43.699
 connected to make good defense 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:51.059
 October 1947 was in a cafeteria in May 1953 to sign on the

 pennsylvania are just some of the flying saucers recovered in the states 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.059
 United 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.420
 no matter where 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.739
 or tricolor 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.389

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.099
 wright paterson was a kind of building cemetery 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.759
 must have been stored there until we have enough technology to 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.759
 to study 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.879
 despite the countless books and public interest in the sufferings 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.409
 there never was official confirmation about alien ships in hangar 18 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.900
 art over time the expatriation ceased to be the center of attention 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.349
 but the interest was aroused in 1978 when the researcher at once 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.819
 but none of this has been done 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.939
 gave a talk at the annual meeting of my current and iphone mac ford performed 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.770
 in question the radius where they stood peace in Hebrew the attraction 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.129
 no one could do what he did to me for the field of death he cultivated 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.129
 relationships with many people who passed on information 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.990
 statements of what they had witnessed. 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:21.009
 was not just an individual but many people who knew they would not be the 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.779
 answer if I trusted him one of them gave me information that he 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.679
 correlated to determine what was real that the kit was not his 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.830
 this movie has written several books about UFO crash and recovery 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.719
 due to the secret content of the information many sources did not want their 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.759
 names were published because they feared losing high-level jobs. 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.759
 confidentiality they possessed 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.819
 among the stories related to 1h18 of the base will debate somavÃ­a of a pilot 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.969

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.969
 Misdemeanor in a restricted access hangar 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.530
 for 30 seconds 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.150
 we saw an object in the shape of a disk of metallic color and 4 meters and a half 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.370
 width and two and a half feet tall I can only confirm that he was there 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.800
 according to the survey from the beginning they were surrounded by guards and quickly 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.759
 taken out of place 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.990
 outside the hangar we told each other that the United States had invented 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.990
 or recovered flying saucers 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.610
 as these stories told the actor other witnesses to present themselves 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.880
 we did four are with the organicity researcher the police chief of 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.699
 Baggage 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:50.540
 washington 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.499
 located in uniforms 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:55.809
 an ex-paterson farm employee at the time of approach 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:02.119
 in 1997 she agreed to give him an interview which clarkson consented to 

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:05.689
 rest the inter does not present this interview for the first time on tv 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.539
 the history of crime and the date of the beginning of the 50's 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.689
 according to the documents she gave Clarkson, she was a typist and had 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.819
 access to highly sensitive information 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.750
 being a lieutenant showed of a piece of a Christmas as well as 

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.570
 who put it on my desk and discipline it together 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.530
 You're a good employee, more than that, you're going to have to give it to me. 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.530
 stay the tournament I twisted my coconut leg on the table it took shape in 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.360

 ivete sorry to sell the pigs weighed almost nothing 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.379
 almost no membership seems a joke 

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.479
 I asked what it was and he said it was part of a spaceship 

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.720
 he had just come back in this context his Christmas
