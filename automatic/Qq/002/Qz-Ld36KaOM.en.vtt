mid-grade<00:01:06.450> blade<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.710> has

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
mid-grade blade this one right here has

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.749 
mid-grade blade this one right here has
an<00:01:08.160> ultra<00:01:08.460> edge<00:01:08.610> blade<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:10.340> quite<00:01:11.340> bright

an ultra edge blade on it quite bright

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.240 
an ultra edge blade on it quite bright
right<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.539> see<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.220> still<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
right now you can see it's still a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.830 
right now you can see it's still a
little<00:01:14.490> light<00:01:14.729> outside<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.539> getting<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
little light outside but it's getting to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.180 
little light outside but it's getting to
be<00:01:15.899> about<00:01:15.959> Twilight<00:01:16.349> and<00:01:16.740> both<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> these

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
be about Twilight and both of these

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.300 
be about Twilight and both of these
sabers<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.759> quite<00:01:18.149> right<00:01:18.569> I<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:19.349> that<00:01:20.099> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
sabers are quite right I think that the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
sabers are quite right I think that the
blue<00:01:20.550> one<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.349> bit

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
blue one has to be just a little bit

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.020 
blue one has to be just a little bit
lighter<00:01:22.709> it<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> fact<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.819> it's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
lighter it could be the fact that it's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.290 
lighter it could be the fact that it's
got<00:01:24.289> freshly<00:01:25.289> charged<00:01:25.590> batteries<00:01:26.099> versus<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
got freshly charged batteries versus the

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.270 
got freshly charged batteries versus the
old<00:01:27.539> triple<00:01:27.959> A's<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.319> are<00:01:28.440> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.679> red<00:01:29.009> saber
