00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.830
 unknown to the health trust to comment on a match like that 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.620
 but it is not the only one France has been slow to come but 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.640
 this is what serves 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.810
 it's good because until the end is that if Nicolas until 5 4 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.419
 Ben must do the points francort on the game 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.899
 he was raised to 5 4 this one had to do 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.630
 that by searching without any harm 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.390
 in the south I am very happy to reach an agreement 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.610
 to finish especially by advancing three baskets in lack finally 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 you doubted at one time or not at all 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 have never been easy 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.010
 no thanks to m many difficult times especially at the beginning of the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.470
 fifth behind several days on flights should com 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.790
 bush and save by serving well 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.860
 the splits if I had been broke five meters could have been 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.450
 other 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.900
 this disc 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.940
 right here 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.920
 you say that the public bring us what his skin has become tense 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.770
 as soon as we are on the central and as many people 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.290
 the fear of doing wrong maybe the fear of being out in the first round that may 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.880
 crying for help at times it made you tense 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.899
 we are actress 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.090
 his thighs a lot but that's at first 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.000
 when we are just that is what is scary that we try on the central 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.300
 we want to 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.430
 we want to do well and love the world wants to play well 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.770
 piola my top it's not going as we read it 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.770
 you have to do with my best moments in account 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.430
 what more do they have than three hours to feel a little unthinking brain 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.260
 more laughed 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.300
 Besides, that's why it plays better at one time because we are 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.080
 we are more in sensations of this camp to concentrate one of less do we manage 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.420
 better his effort 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.080
 and percent and at that moment we forget everything and we 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.920
 lacking the positive and this is where we realize that the public has done 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.190
 a lot of mayor 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.720
 this tension is mostly related to the fact that these roland-garros his polar 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.520
 find in other festive tournaments 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 good finds it everywhere said that France is still there that has 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.150
 then different degrees what 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.750
 there are days and days we are afraid but it will bring very scary days 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.289
 but it takes just later he sifted
