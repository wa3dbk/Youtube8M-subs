00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello ela we see setting zatek 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.300
 such coral cobra its pros and cons 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.809
 exploiting the third year I say it 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.900
 pretty good reel is the easiest 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.510
 the cheapest thing to say is to drink and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 here comes the top of the cobra here 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.840
 it is written that we are talking about 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.849
 write here 6 read right now we will 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.019
 I look for myself wondering is there 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.770
 not such as it understands them 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.960
 that part you see here that we are the threshold 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.820
 pull the pliers sees the court 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.360
 it is pulled out easily to the side further 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.480
 here goes 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.129
 cog so give me more precise on it 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.520
 reverse thread here this side 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.520
 pulls this way she 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.710
 unscrew well that side which should 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 end it unscrews and vice versa 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.660
 here back guys doctor further take off 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.810
 here we will look for this part now 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:11.790
 bearings we then removed as we see 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.130
 here we have one bearing we already 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.280
 found means we should have more 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.320
 she smeared everything to me 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.560
 as she herself immediately every year before 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:30.340
 in the winter I disassemble the coils and cleaner and 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.710
 smear you next year beginning 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.840
 fishing season I did not have with them 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.300
 fooling to always do this in the winter when 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.000
 i am from the end of the season as you see here 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.890
 go three cogs now I take off watching 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.229
 in the middle how many bearing we have there 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:02:01.190
 on the coil itself it is written 6 one 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.440
 cog stayed this reel cheap 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.890
 budget can say small 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.660
 budget 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.900
 if you want to go fishing but no 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.370
 You can bring a lot of money 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.350
 cheap simple cats of course she doesn't 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.769
 will withstand heavy loads immediately 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.790
 I'll tell you, but if 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:27.799
 managed to use and good about taxes 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.180
 so look further here goes alone 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.640
 I see the bearing on the reverse side 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.290
 here one in the other 2 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:45.170
 here 4 found a SUV and where are two more 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.400
 so there is no here now, but this one 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.040
 part of the debtors here 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.459
 bearing on the idea if it is of course 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.560
 Now look at it will be 5 if he 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:04.100
 will be here of course on 6 I don't know where he is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:07.760
 even hidden there yes here goes like 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:13.370
 see 5 bearing and now we find 6 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.959
 the enemy could 6 bearing seems to me 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.660
 most likely there are two bearings here 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:22.670
 they are 1 or maybe wrong or rather 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.100
 just what goes on here at the end of the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.190
 most likely he is here about to sneeze this 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.090
 part I will not disassemble because of all 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.349
 equals him there we will not see 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.050
 I'll figure it out anyway 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:47.060
 see if he is there or not it 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:51.550
 gets out here and such that it's time 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:57.290
 this part is choosing 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:04:04.940
 thrust this part yes there goes here last 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:10.310
 sixth bearings here it is here well 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:16.459
 This part is still opa and there is no 6 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:19.130
 bearing mean to me yet then here 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.109
 and then two bearings but this is unlikely 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.510
 so this is only five coil 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.979
 hinge bearings although the box says 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.700
 6 1 2 3 4 5 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:34.430
 all see here I save that they 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.950
 put here what the middle looks like here 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.919
 this coil is simple quite easy 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.780
 disassembled easily repaired all 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.780
