the new fairytail opening as well as the

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.509 
the new fairytail opening as well as the
leanest<00:00:13.870> episode<00:00:14.410> which<00:00:14.710> if<00:00:14.860> I'm<00:00:15.010> correct<00:00:15.190> is

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
leanest episode which if I'm correct is

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.730 
leanest episode which if I'm correct is
a<00:00:15.550> precursor<00:00:16.090> or<00:00:16.540> in<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:16.930> beginning<00:00:17.080> to<00:00:17.619> the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
a precursor or in the beginning to the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.040 
a precursor or in the beginning to the
upcoming<00:00:18.340> filler<00:00:18.610> art<00:00:18.910> which<00:00:19.390> from<00:00:19.720> crack<00:00:19.930> is

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
upcoming filler art which from crack is

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.390 
upcoming filler art which from crack is
supposed<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.380> be<00:00:20.529> about<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.890> celestial

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
supposed to be about the celestial

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.609 
supposed to be about the celestial
spirits<00:00:21.820> so<00:00:22.029> it<00:00:22.270> kind<00:00:22.840> of<00:00:22.960> made<00:00:23.140> sense<00:00:23.410> and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
spirits so it kind of made sense and

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.200 
spirits so it kind of made sense and
maybe<00:00:23.770> something<00:00:24.369> with<00:00:24.490> this<00:00:24.640> episode<00:00:24.940> even

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
maybe something with this episode even

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.750 
maybe something with this episode even
though<00:00:25.480> it<00:00:25.690> felt<00:00:26.170> for<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.830> most<00:00:27.100> part<00:00:27.520> very

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
though it felt for the most part very

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.790 
though it felt for the most part very
simplistic<00:00:28.570> it<00:00:28.720> might<00:00:29.109> have<00:00:29.289> some<00:00:29.500> sort<00:00:29.710> of

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
simplistic it might have some sort of

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.130 
simplistic it might have some sort of
relevance<00:00:30.189> to<00:00:30.430> why<00:00:30.670> this<00:00:31.000> new<00:00:31.210> dress<00:00:31.510> is<00:00:31.720> here

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
relevance to why this new dress is here

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.110 
relevance to why this new dress is here
and<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.619> upcoming<00:00:32.920> episodes<00:00:33.550> now<00:00:33.910> for<00:00:34.059> the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
and the upcoming episodes now for the

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.729 
and the upcoming episodes now for the
most<00:00:34.269> part<00:00:34.540> we<00:00:34.660> regarding<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.050> opening<00:00:35.590> the

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
most part we regarding the opening the

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.340 
most part we regarding the opening the
visuals<00:00:36.160> felt<00:00:36.430> pretty<00:00:36.760> lazy<00:00:37.150> it<00:00:37.839> was<00:00:38.019> as<00:00:38.170> if

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
visuals felt pretty lazy it was as if

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.570 
visuals felt pretty lazy it was as if
they<00:00:38.500> were<00:00:38.589> like<00:00:38.739> saving<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.220> budget

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
they were like saving the budget

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.100 
they were like saving the budget
hopefully<00:00:40.030> that's<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.330> case<00:00:40.420> for<00:00:40.989> the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
hopefully that's the case for the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.750 
hopefully that's the case for the
upcoming<00:00:41.440> canon<00:00:41.949> art<00:00:42.190> when<00:00:42.370> they<00:00:42.460> have<00:00:42.610> an

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
upcoming canon art when they have an

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.579 
upcoming canon art when they have an
opening<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.330> you<00:00:43.570> opening<00:00:43.960> then<00:00:44.170> because

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
opening and you opening then because

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.189 
opening and you opening then because
it's<00:00:44.799> like<00:00:44.979> yeah<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:46.000> visuals<00:00:46.540> was<00:00:46.750> just<00:00:46.989> for

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
it's like yeah the visuals was just for

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.619 
it's like yeah the visuals was just for
the<00:00:47.260> most<00:00:47.440> part<00:00:47.739> very<00:00:47.979> simplistic<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.089> it<00:00:49.479> was

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
the most part very simplistic and it was

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.930 
the most part very simplistic and it was
like<00:00:49.839> the<00:00:50.199> best<00:00:50.409> animation<00:00:51.339> you<00:00:51.400> have<00:00:51.430> in<00:00:51.820> the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
like the best animation you have in the

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.030 
like the best animation you have in the
actual<00:00:52.360> goddamn<00:00:52.870> opening<00:00:53.320> it's<00:00:53.440> like<00:00:53.559> aires'

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
actual goddamn opening it's like aires'

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.820 
actual goddamn opening it's like aires'
jiggle<00:00:54.489> physics<00:00:54.519> it's<00:00:55.120> like<00:00:55.210> yeah<00:00:55.989> so<00:00:56.530> as<00:00:56.650> far

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
jiggle physics it's like yeah so as far

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.100 
jiggle physics it's like yeah so as far
as<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.040> opening<00:00:57.339> goes<00:00:57.549> the<00:00:57.760> soul<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.299> alright

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
as the opening goes the soul is alright

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.170 
as the opening goes the soul is alright
it's<00:00:59.799> not<00:00:59.920> something<00:01:00.369> that<00:01:00.519> I<00:01:00.549> can<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:01.000> myself

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
it's not something that I can see myself

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.820 
it's not something that I can see myself
like<00:01:01.570> getting<00:01:01.900> your<00:01:01.989> tour<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:02.379> feel<00:01:02.739> like

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
like getting your tour and feel like

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.280 
like getting your tour and feel like
that<00:01:03.010> or<00:01:03.159> like<00:01:03.280> jamming<00:01:04.030> too<00:01:04.210> but<00:01:04.510> I<00:01:04.690> guess<00:01:04.900> I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
that or like jamming too but I guess I

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.780 
that or like jamming too but I guess I
wouldn't<00:01:05.740> really<00:01:05.860> mind<00:01:06.100> listening<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.700> the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
wouldn't really mind listening to the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.670 
wouldn't really mind listening to the
song<00:01:07.030> when<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.360> opening<00:01:07.720> plays<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.409> it's<00:01:08.530> not

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
song when the opening plays so it's not

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.859 
song when the opening plays so it's not
that<00:01:09.340> bad<00:01:09.579> but<00:01:09.789> as<00:01:09.909> far<00:01:10.060> as<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.210> visuals<00:01:10.719> it

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
that bad but as far as the visuals it

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.929 
that bad but as far as the visuals it
was<00:01:10.960> just<00:01:11.140> very<00:01:11.289> light<00:01:11.530> so<00:01:12.219> overall<00:01:12.789> the

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
was just very light so overall the

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.249 
was just very light so overall the
opening<00:01:13.299> not<00:01:13.450> too<00:01:13.570> impressed<00:01:13.899> me<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.140> be

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
opening not too impressed me to be

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
most part the episode as a whole if I

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.919 
most part the episode as a whole if I
didn't<00:01:30.429> know<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:31.030> there<00:01:31.210> was<00:01:31.299> gonna<00:01:31.450> be<00:01:31.570> some

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
didn't know that there was gonna be some

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.660 
didn't know that there was gonna be some
content<00:01:32.409> regarding<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.799> celestial<00:01:33.310> spirits

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
content regarding the celestial spirits

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.800 
content regarding the celestial spirits
I<00:01:33.759> would<00:01:33.880> have<00:01:33.969> felt<00:01:34.149> like<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:34.600> was<00:01:34.780> just

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
I would have felt like this was just

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.200 
I would have felt like this was just
another<00:01:35.170> episodic<00:01:35.890> filler<00:01:36.130> up<00:01:36.520> until<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.030> end

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
felt as though it was poor shadowing

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.090 
felt as though it was poor shadowing
something<00:01:46.539> but<00:01:46.869> just<00:01:46.899> her<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.560> aquarius

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
something but just her and aquarius

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.529 
something but just her and aquarius
being<00:01:48.369> alone<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.880> they're<00:01:48.969> talking<00:01:49.210> and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
seeing the flashbacks were her that was

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.010 
seeing the flashbacks were her that was
the<00:01:51.579> good<00:01:51.729> stuff<00:01:52.030> everything<00:01:52.539> before<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.840> a

lot of it was comedic and it was kind of

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.580 
lot of it was comedic and it was kind of
playing<00:01:55.359> off<00:01:55.569> for<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.840> whole<00:01:55.990> dragon<00:01:56.439> arc
