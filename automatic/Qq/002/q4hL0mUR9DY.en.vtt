00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
formations in plays we thought it'd be

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.900 
formations in plays we thought it'd be
good<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.350> second<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.800> they<00:02:37.580> came<00:02:37.790> out

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
different they have done in the first

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.350 
different they have done in the first
half<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:44.270> they<00:02:44.780> did<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.959> good<00:02:45.140> job<00:02:46.360> there's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.720 
half and so they did a good job there's
a<00:02:47.450> difference<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.680> know<00:02:48.730> competition

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
a difference in the you know competition

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.100 
a difference in the you know competition
this<00:02:49.910> week<00:02:50.180> worse<00:02:50.450> than<00:02:50.600> what<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.810> saw<00:02:51.050> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
this week worse than what you saw the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.520 
this week worse than what you saw the
past<00:02:51.380> two<00:02:51.560> weeks<00:02:51.590> when<00:02:52.010> obviously<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:54.440> know

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
past two weeks when obviously you know

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.810 
past two weeks when obviously you know
how<00:02:54.650> much<00:02:54.770> better<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.100> his<00:02:55.220> take<00:02:55.370> versus<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
how much better was his take versus the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.240 
how much better was his take versus the
to<00:02:55.970> teach<00:02:56.150> planes<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:57.440> know<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.590> think<00:02:57.740> sandy

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
to teach planes you know I think sandy

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.990 
to teach planes you know I think sandy
creek<00:02:58.490> is<00:02:58.760> probably<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.150> spear

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
creek is probably a spear

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.940 
creek is probably a spear
last<00:03:00.570> week<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:02.990> guess<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.290> probably<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
last week I guess that probably the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.560 
last week I guess that probably the
difference<00:03:05.370> maker<00:03:05.610> for<00:03:05.910> him<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.270> there<00:03:06.390> inside

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
difference maker for him is there inside

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.470 
difference maker for him is there inside
