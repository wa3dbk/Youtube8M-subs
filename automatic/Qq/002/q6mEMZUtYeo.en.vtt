he uses it as his angles well but he

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.170 
he uses it as his angles well but he
does<00:01:43.079> tend<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> lunch<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.670> he's<00:01:44.820> willing

did<00:06:09.020> and<00:06:09.290> I<00:06:09.680> did<00:06:09.980> not<00:06:10.130> like<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.670> way<00:06:10.700> more

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
did and I did not like the way more

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.530 
did and I did not like the way more
responded<00:06:12.130> when<00:06:13.130> he<00:06:13.400> was<00:06:13.520> getting<00:06:13.670> smacked

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
responded when he was getting smacked

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.620 
responded when he was getting smacked
around<00:06:14.690> by<00:06:15.050> force<00:06:15.830> all<00:06:16.580> his<00:06:16.940> coolness<00:06:17.240> and

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
around by force all his coolness and

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.330 
around by force all his coolness and
women<00:06:18.020> licking<00:06:18.350> his<00:06:18.590> glove<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:18.890> all<00:06:19.190> that

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
women licking his glove and all that

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.640 
women licking his glove and all that
crap<00:06:19.490> was<00:06:19.790> gone<00:06:20.030> yes<00:06:21.010> whatever<00:06:22.010> it's<00:06:22.580> here<00:06:23.330> it

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
crap was gone yes whatever it's here it

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.740 
crap was gone yes whatever it's here it
didn't<00:06:24.650> do<00:06:24.800> him<00:06:24.830> too<00:06:25.250> well<00:06:25.490> in<00:06:25.730> that<00:06:25.880> fight<00:06:26.210> and

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
didn't do him too well in that fight and

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.980 
didn't do him too well in that fight and
I<00:06:26.840> see<00:06:27.170> that<00:06:27.700> going<00:06:28.700> that<00:06:28.820> way<00:06:29.120> too<00:06:29.180> but<00:06:29.570> I

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
I see that going that way too but I

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.010 
I see that going that way too but I
think<00:06:30.320> mosley<00:06:30.710> hits<00:06:31.130> harder<00:06:31.670> than<00:06:31.720> force<00:06:32.720> does

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
think mosley hits harder than force does

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.900 
think mosley hits harder than force does
and<00:06:33.590> I<00:06:33.650> think<00:06:33.830> it<00:06:33.920> Mosley<00:06:34.340> catches<00:06:34.730> him<00:06:34.880> with

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
and I think it Mosley catches him with

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.090 
and I think it Mosley catches him with
the<00:06:35.150> shots<00:06:35.420> that<00:06:35.780> he<00:06:36.290> called<00:06:36.500> me<00:06:36.650> whether<00:06:36.890> with

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
the shots that he called me whether with

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.360 
the shots that he called me whether with
he's<00:06:38.090> going<00:06:38.300> to<00:06:38.360> knock<00:06:38.480> him<00:06:38.690> out<00:06:38.780> and<00:06:39.370> that's

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
he's going to knock him out and that's

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.800 
he's going to knock him out and that's
what<00:06:40.490> I'm<00:06:40.610> going<00:06:40.760> with<00:06:40.880> I<00:06:41.060> think<00:06:41.300> mosley<00:06:41.570> is

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
what I'm going with I think mosley is

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.360 
what I'm going with I think mosley is
going<00:06:42.020> to<00:06:42.080> knock<00:06:42.200> him<00:06:42.470> out<00:06:42.560> by<00:06:42.770> the<00:06:42.830> 10th<00:06:43.160> round

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
going to knock him out by the 10th round

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.110 
going to knock him out by the 10th round
I<00:06:43.960> think<00:06:44.960> the<00:06:45.410> cumulative<00:06:46.100> punishment<00:06:46.670> that

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
I think the cumulative punishment that

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.970 
I think the cumulative punishment that
more<00:06:47.360> will<00:06:47.570> take<00:06:47.780> eventually<00:06:48.410> he<00:06:48.560> will<00:06:48.680> fold

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
more will take eventually he will fold

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.250 
more will take eventually he will fold
and<00:06:49.310> he<00:06:50.060> will<00:06:50.210> suffer<00:06:50.450> his<00:06:50.630> first<00:06:50.870> loss<00:06:51.050> by

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
and he will suffer his first loss by

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.930 
and he will suffer his first loss by
knockout<00:06:51.670> at<00:06:52.670> the<00:06:52.850> hands<00:06:53.030> of<00:06:53.150> mostly<00:06:53.420> and<00:06:54.940> you

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
knockout at the hands of mostly and you

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.610
