00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
can we have another question based on

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.960 
can we have another question based on
the<00:00:01.469> concept<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:01.949> degree<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.580> Radian

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
the concept of degree and Radian

know<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.739> complete<00:00:41.280> revolution<00:00:42.000> alright

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
know in one complete revolution alright

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.450 
know in one complete revolution alright
one<00:00:43.200> complete<00:00:43.590> revolution<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.190> make<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
one complete revolution to make it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
one complete revolution to make it
complete<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.030> revolution<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.570> takes<00:00:45.780> 60

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
complete one revolution it takes 60

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.330 
complete one revolution it takes 60
minutes<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.340> 60<00:00:47.940> minute<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.719> right

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
minutes so in 60 minute all right

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.029 
minutes so in 60 minute all right
minute<00:00:50.340> hand<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> completing<00:00:51.210> how<00:00:51.300> much<00:00:52.039> 360

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
minute hand is completing how much 360

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
minute hand is completing how much 360
degree<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.000> angle<00:00:54.360> made<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.960> on

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
degree because the angle made are not on

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.340 
degree because the angle made are not on
a<00:00:55.199> point<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:57.030> revolution<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.719> 60

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
a point or on one revolution is 60

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.299 
a point or on one revolution is 60
degree<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.539> one<00:01:00.539> minute<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.829> one

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
degree so in one minute you know in one

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.590 
degree so in one minute you know in one
minute<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.930> minute<00:01:04.530> hand<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.040> making<00:01:05.610> 360

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
minute the the minute hand is making 360

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
minute the the minute hand is making 360
over<00:01:07.070> 60<00:01:09.110> degree<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.380> right<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.979> therefore<00:01:11.189> in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
over 60 degree all right so therefore in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.350 
over 60 degree all right so therefore in
40<00:01:12.210> minute<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.830> 40<00:01:13.830> minute<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.850> minute<00:01:15.150> hand

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
40 minute in 40 minute the minute hand

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.300 
40 minute in 40 minute the minute hand
is<00:01:15.479> making<00:01:15.860> 360<00:01:16.860> over<00:01:17.040> 60<00:01:17.460> into<00:01:17.659> 40<00:01:18.979> degree<00:01:19.979> all

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
is making 360 over 60 into 40 degree all

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
is making 360 over 60 into 40 degree all
right<00:01:20.460> now<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.180> cancel<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.110> 0<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
right now we can cancel up this 0 and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.630 
right now we can cancel up this 0 and
this<00:01:22.619> 0<00:01:22.680> all<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:26.100> weekend<00:01:26.369> 6

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this 0 all right and this this weekend 6

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.070 
this 0 all right and this this weekend 6
6<00:01:26.909> hour<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.180> easily<00:01:27.299> cancel<00:01:27.600> though<00:01:27.869> now

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
6 hour we can easily cancel though now

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.510 
6 hour we can easily cancel though now
this<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.500> 60<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.790> 40<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.960> 6<00:01:31.950> times<00:01:32.159> 4<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
this is 60 and this 40 so 6 times 4 that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.480 
this is 60 and this 40 so 6 times 4 that
is<00:01:32.869> 240<00:01:33.869> degree<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.369> can

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
is 240 degree and if we want then we can

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.670 
is 240 degree and if we want then we can
convert<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.090> into<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.840> Radian<00:01:37.229> also<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
convert this into the Radian also and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.200 
convert this into the Radian also and
that<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.159> 240<00:01:38.850> into<00:01:39.240> PI<00:01:39.600> over<00:01:40.229> 180<00:01:41.040> degree<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
that is 240 into PI over 180 degree this

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.920 
that is 240 into PI over 180 degree this
is<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.780> Radian<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.659> cancel

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
is now in Radian and now if if we cancel

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.069 
is now in Radian and now if if we cancel
then<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.649> 2<00:01:46.979> things<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.579> cancel<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:48.090> 6

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
then this 2 things we can cancel on 6

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.760 
then this 2 things we can cancel on 6
times<00:01:49.409> 4<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.399> 6<00:01:50.790> times<00:01:51.030> 3<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.630> our<00:01:51.770> Radian

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
times 4 and 6 times 3 so our Radian

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.420 
times 4 and 6 times 3 so our Radian
angle<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.149> 4<00:01:54.149> PI<00:01:54.420> over<00:01:54.720> 3<00:01:55.130> radians

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
angle is 4 PI over 3 radians

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.789 
angle is 4 PI over 3 radians
alright<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.479> 60<00:01:57.930> minute<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> minute<00:01:58.590> hand

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
alright so in 60 minute the minute hand

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.039 
alright so in 60 minute the minute hand
of<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.130> watts<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.640> 1<00:02:00.060> point<00:02:00.210> 5<00:02:00.390> centimeter<00:02:00.630> long

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
of a watts is 1 point 5 centimeter long

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.920 
of a watts is 1 point 5 centimeter long
now<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.149> actually<00:02:03.270> giving<00:02:03.689> us<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
now this is actually giving us the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.789 
now this is actually giving us the
radius<00:02:04.079> all<00:02:04.469> right

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
radius all right

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.560 
radius all right
the<00:02:05.009> minute<00:02:05.310> hand<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.299> this

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the minute hand you know this this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.559 
the minute hand you know this this
minute<00:02:06.960> hand<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.910> length<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.270> minute

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
minute hand the length of this minute

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.110 
minute hand the length of this minute
hand<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.590> radius<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.489> which<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.910> one

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
hand is actually radius and which is one

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.940 
hand is actually radius and which is one
point

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
point

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.640 
point
five<00:02:13.220> centimeter<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.330> how<00:02:14.810> far<00:02:15.050> does<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.230> tips

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
five centimeter and how far does it tips

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.440 
five centimeter and how far does it tips
move<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.040> 40<00:02:16.370> minutes<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.849> is<00:02:17.000> moving<00:02:17.330> in

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
move in 40 minutes and it is moving in

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.080 
move in 40 minutes and it is moving in
40<00:02:17.810> minutes<00:02:17.989> all<00:02:18.200> right<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:19.129> is<00:02:19.310> 30<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.940> it's

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
40 minutes all right this is 30 and it's

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.780 
40 minutes all right this is 30 and it's
so<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.780> 40<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.099> total<00:02:22.400> angle

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
so this is 40 so this is the total angle

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.140 
so this is 40 so this is the total angle
made<00:02:23.000> by<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.569> this<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.849> 240<00:02:25.849> degree

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
made by this and this is 240 degree

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.920 
made by this and this is 240 degree
which<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.540> actually<00:02:27.050> 4<00:02:27.769> PI<00:02:28.069> by<00:02:28.370> 3<00:02:29.150> Radian<00:02:29.480> so

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
which is actually 4 PI by 3 Radian so

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.440 
which is actually 4 PI by 3 Radian so
this<00:02:30.140> much<00:02:30.380> angle<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:30.920> had<00:02:31.069> made<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.550> 40<00:02:32.209> minute

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
this much angle it had made in 40 minute

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.710 
this much angle it had made in 40 minute
and<00:02:32.690> now<00:02:33.440> we<00:02:33.500> need<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.830> find<00:02:34.610> out<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.480> how

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
and now we need to find out that how

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.960 
and now we need to find out that how
much<00:02:35.780> distance<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.620> has<00:02:36.650> traveled<00:02:37.190> all<00:02:37.370> right

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
much distance it has traveled all right

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.570 
much distance it has traveled all right
what<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.599> this<00:02:38.780> length<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.099> actually

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
what is this length and this is actually

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.280 
what is this length and this is actually
the<00:02:40.670> arc<00:02:40.910> length<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.390> need<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.599> find<00:02:41.780> out<00:02:41.930> what

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
the arc length we need to find out what

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.289 
the arc length we need to find out what
is<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.590> L<00:02:42.769> what<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.760> length<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> arc

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
is the L what is the length of the arc

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.390 
is the L what is the length of the arc
that<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.660> had<00:02:44.780> trouble<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.380> we<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:46.190> very

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
that it had trouble and we have very

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.979 
that it had trouble and we have very
good<00:02:46.519> relationship<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.480> are<00:02:47.510> learning<00:02:47.750> since

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
good relationship we are learning since

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.720 
good relationship we are learning since
very<00:02:48.650> long<00:02:48.830> time<00:02:49.099> that<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.930> an<00:02:51.459> inner<00:02:52.459> circle

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
very long time that if an inner circle

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.960 
very long time that if an inner circle
if<00:02:53.239> we<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.870> let's<00:02:54.410> say<00:02:54.530> theta<00:02:55.010> Radian<00:02:55.670> all

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
if we have let's say theta Radian all

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.289 
if we have let's say theta Radian all
right

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
right

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.720 
right
theta<00:02:56.930> Radian<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:57.950> equal<00:02:58.069> with<00:02:58.519> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
theta Radian then that is equal with the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.870 
theta Radian then that is equal with the
ratio<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.390> arc<00:02:59.810> over<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.680> radius<00:03:01.370> all

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
ratio of the arc over the radius all

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.430 
ratio of the arc over the radius all
right<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:03.170> we<00:03:04.099> know<00:03:04.280> now<00:03:04.459> this<00:03:04.900> this<00:03:05.900> we<00:03:06.319> know

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
right so we know now this this we know

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.809 
right so we know now this this we know
the<00:03:06.590> radius<00:03:06.920> first<00:03:07.220> all<00:03:07.400> right<00:03:07.430> we<00:03:07.670> know

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
the radius first all right we know

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.880 
the radius first all right we know
radius<00:03:08.209> but<00:03:08.780> we<00:03:08.870> don't<00:03:09.079> know<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.319> L<00:03:09.530> all

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
radius but we don't know this L all

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.890 
radius but we don't know this L all
right<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.519> need<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.760> find<00:03:10.910> out<00:03:11.060> that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
right and then we need to find out that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.780 
right and then we need to find out that
is<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.079> distance<00:03:12.410> actually<00:03:12.620> moved<00:03:13.130> by<00:03:13.489> that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
is the distance actually moved by that

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.600 
is the distance actually moved by that
minute<00:03:14.510> hand<00:03:14.750> all<00:03:15.110> right<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.769> now<00:03:16.340> we<00:03:16.400> are

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
minute hand all right so now we are

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.789 
minute hand all right so now we are
going<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.910> use<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.239> relationship<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:18.319> theta

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
going to use this relationship so theta

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.890 
going to use this relationship so theta
Radian<00:03:19.190> we<00:03:19.340> got<00:03:19.549> recently<00:03:20.090> 4<00:03:20.930> PI<00:03:21.230> over<00:03:21.530> 3<00:03:22.370> and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
Radian we got recently 4 PI over 3 and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.080 
Radian we got recently 4 PI over 3 and
ly<00:03:23.900> are<00:03:24.079> all<00:03:24.440> right<00:03:24.680> what's<00:03:24.950> our<00:03:25.069> length<00:03:25.340> we

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
ly are all right what's our length we

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.729 
ly are all right what's our length we
don't<00:03:26.299> know<00:03:26.420> length<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.079> mean<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.470> total

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
don't know length I mean the total

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.550 
don't know length I mean the total
length<00:03:27.829> are<00:03:28.069> traveled<00:03:28.430> by<00:03:28.519> that<00:03:28.730> by<00:03:29.359> that

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
length are traveled by that by that

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.780 
length are traveled by that by that
minute<00:03:30.560> hand<00:03:30.739> but<00:03:30.980> we<00:03:31.100> know<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> radius<00:03:31.609> or

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
minute hand but we know the radius or

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.309 
minute hand but we know the radius or
the<00:03:31.880> length<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.810> minute<00:03:33.350> hand<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.829> is

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
the length of the minute hand that is

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.740 
the length of the minute hand that is
1.5<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.500> now<00:03:37.010> 4<00:03:37.459> PI<00:03:37.609> over<00:03:37.880> 3<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.480> question

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
1.5 and now 4 PI over 3 and the question

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.000 
1.5 and now 4 PI over 3 and the question
is<00:03:38.840> saying<00:03:39.049> we<00:03:39.170> need<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.350> use<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.650> value<00:03:39.920> of

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
is saying we need to use the value of

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.050 
is saying we need to use the value of
the<00:03:40.130> PI<00:03:40.340> as<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:41.170> 3.14<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:42.709> let's<00:03:43.069> use<00:03:44.049> four<00:03:45.049> into

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the PI as a 3.14 so let's use four into

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.210 
the PI as a 3.14 so let's use four into
3.14<00:03:47.060> divided<00:03:47.870> by<00:03:48.019> 3<00:03:48.440> equals<00:03:48.620> 2l<00:03:49.579> over<00:03:49.880> 1.5<00:03:50.870> and

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
3.14 divided by 3 equals 2l over 1.5 and

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.430 
3.14 divided by 3 equals 2l over 1.5 and
everybody<00:03:52.220> know<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.430> 1.5<00:03:53.329> times<00:03:53.660> 2<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:54.139> 3<00:03:54.350> and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
everybody know that 1.5 times 2 is 3 and

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.259 
everybody know that 1.5 times 2 is 3 and
2<00:03:54.680> times<00:03:55.130> 2<00:03:55.940> is<00:03:56.150> 4<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:56.840> now<00:03:57.349> it<00:03:57.560> will<00:03:57.739> be<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:59.090> is

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
2 times 2 is 4 so now it will be it is

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.890 
2 times 2 is 4 so now it will be it is
six<00:03:59.660> point<00:04:00.019> two<00:04:00.709> eight<00:04:00.739> equals<00:04:01.400> 2l<00:04:01.670> so<00:04:01.940> the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
six point two eight equals 2l so the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.319 
six point two eight equals 2l so the
length<00:04:03.200> or<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.639> distance<00:04:04.639> traveled<00:04:05.180> by<00:04:05.209> the

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
length or the distance traveled by the

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.920 
length or the distance traveled by the
minute<00:04:05.660> hand<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:06.079> six<00:04:06.440> point<00:04:06.799> two<00:04:07.489> eight

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
minute hand is six point two eight

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.080 
minute hand is six point two eight
centimeter<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.650> distance<00:04:10.099> this<00:04:10.849> much

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
centimeter so the distance this much

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.750 
centimeter so the distance this much
distance<00:04:11.599> you<00:04:11.900> know<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.620> distance<00:04:13.099> travel<00:04:13.609> by

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
distance you know the distance travel by

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.099 
distance you know the distance travel by
that<00:04:14.419> that<00:04:15.109> minute<00:04:15.590> hand<00:04:15.859> is<00:04:16.099> is<00:04:16.820> six<00:04:17.780> point

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
that that minute hand is is six point

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.949 
that that minute hand is is six point
two<00:04:18.680> eight<00:04:18.970> centimeter<00:04:19.970> this<00:04:20.479> is<00:04:20.630> how<00:04:20.720> we<00:04:20.780> need

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
two eight centimeter this is how we need

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.260 
two eight centimeter this is how we need
to<00:04:21.079> find<00:04:21.349> out<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:22.220> distance<00:04:22.550> move<00:04:22.849> sometimes

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
to find out the distance move sometimes

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.029 
to find out the distance move sometimes
you<00:04:23.360> may<00:04:23.510> be<00:04:23.750> asked<00:04:24.380> how<00:04:24.500> much<00:04:24.620> angle<00:04:24.950> is

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
you may be asked how much angle is

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.170 
you may be asked how much angle is
making<00:04:25.400> sometimes<00:04:25.789> maybe

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
making sometimes maybe

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.850 
making sometimes maybe
asked<00:04:26.330> how<00:04:26.419> much<00:04:26.630> how<00:04:27.050> much<00:04:27.229> is<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.500> radius

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
asked how much how much is the radius

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.439 
asked how much how much is the radius
what<00:04:28.039> is<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.190> length<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.610> radius<00:04:28.910> so

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
what is the length of the radius so

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.840
