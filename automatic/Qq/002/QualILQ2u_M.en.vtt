00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.359
 make a classic black smoke you can 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.059
 use the black shadow that you like best 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.030
 I will use the naked 2 this black tone 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.310
 from here but as I say you can 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.229
 use what you want and we will apply it in 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.740
 all the almond of our eye all 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.740
 this part 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.930
 something like that does not have to be full 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 in black then now we are going to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.460
 blur very very well I'm using 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.520
 this type of brush as well as more dense 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.650
 and hairs and little more loose and what 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 let's go through the little shore where 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.550
 we put the color black and you have to 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.550
 be very well blurred 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.310
 okay girls now I'm going to apply a 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.890
 blue pigment that you can use 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.530
 de visu has very good pigments but 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.870
 I am going to use for today 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.960
 tower appointment of the shadows should the skin 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.480
 is the blue tone then what are we going 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.040
 to do is apply some micellar water 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.220
 in a whatever you can stay or 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.910
 natural water as you want then 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 Now I'm going to apply it with a brush 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.780
 cat tongue 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.570
 I'm going to wet it well moistened in 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.640
 our brush and then I will take 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.640
 little product of the shadow of 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.610
 pigment and I'm going to apply it only 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.660
 here in the almond of the eye so that 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.660
 is more or less like this 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.980
 clarifying my children says something micellar and 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.349
 it's thermal water I'm obsessed with the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.629
 lake looks long but good this the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.909
 next step is that here we stayed 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.459
 of blue then already with the same brush 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.590
 that diffuse take a little bit of color 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.670
 black and I will pass it again by 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.829
 Enimita because the color that was lost 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.659
 we already had black but it is very very 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.909
 little bit what we are going to take and 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.840
 we diffuse very light no longer there 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.840
 take them all the color 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.310
 Now I'm going to apply a line with a 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.990
 black eyeliner I'm using this one 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.990
 italy and we are going to apply it 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.790
 now with a cat tongue brush 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.760
 a little smaller take the black shadow 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.000
 and we're going to draw a line here in the 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.920
 lower eyelashes to my liking when 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.560
 I make smoked I like it to be half 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.270
 cross to the line but it is already 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.270
 your decision and we are going to put you 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.640
 now let's apply a shade color 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.160
 vanilla in the bone of our eyebrows 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.600
 I'm using the fox tone and the same 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.670
 naked 2 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.650
 then I previously already applied 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.630
 glue to my false eyelash because I 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.180
 like to let them dry a little so that 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.360
 paste better and we will apply tab 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.360
 false 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.910
 now let's take away the waste 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.030
 whites of the glue putting 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.710
 black eyeliner over serves that we give 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.710
 another one passed to our delineated 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.010
 Now let's apply a light coat of 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.830
 mascara nothing more to paste our 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.120
 false eyelash with natural and also 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.450
 We are not going to apply on the tabs 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.450
 lower 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.500
 already for almost finished I will apply 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.550
 black pencil on the water line so that 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.260
 look even more as well as deeper 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.910
 the look and highlight more our human 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.610
 now I'm just going to light the 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.030
 tear in my eye putting a shadow 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.330
 color as a litmus so that you see a 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:01.100
 little bit more, do not be like so dark 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.100
 our eye and have a touch of light 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.090
 now we are going to apply our base myself 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.699
 I used the arrangement in color style and 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.060
 Now I'm going to apply nothing more than dust 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.099
 translucent powder over more than anything 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.529
 the sun where I get more greasy 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.050
 because in that idea of our recording 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:23.919
 we want our skin to be perfect 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.810
 I want to give a touch as well as good to do 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.069

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:33.370

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.569
 little bone that is on my cheekbones 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:46.849
 and I will put a touch of blush this 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.849
 pink on the apple of my cheeks 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.870
 how I want my eyes to be like what 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.970
 what else stands out in my makeup 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.370
 then I will put a little lipstick 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.260
