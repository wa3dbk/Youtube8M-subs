00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello youtube are welcome in this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.769
 brand new video in this new 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.500
 episode of where where when the series 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.609
 where from the facebook fan page that the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.240
 find let's say in www.bbt.com hypercube 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.490
 gaming I warn you I put three comments 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.750
 with three weapons the most voted will be the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.699
 next as where when then 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.920
 take the opportunity to go and click me 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.420
 like it on my fan page where in between 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.059
 the other we do a lot of others 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.270
 activities like fussing about as a decision 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.489
 of other series in today's episode 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.219
 we'll talk about a weapon that was 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.379
 I was expecting it, of course I expected 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.969
 this will be one of the key videos of 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.600
 as where when on a weapon you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.280
 you will remember lace 23 and 23 that is 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.840
 a weapon starting immediately from the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.879
 statistics with 770 strokes per minute a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.980
 bullet that travels at 620 meters to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.229
 second and up to 930 meters 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.780
 before disappearing from the very high bug 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.570
 netcode of battlefield 4 the damage as 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.110
 always from close range and 25 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.119
 with a drop off of the damage that starts at 8 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.159
 meters then from 8 meters onwards begins a 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.560
 go down to 18 that the minimum damage 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.320
 which does at 930 meters 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 what makes this weapon what it is 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 me is the strongest assault weapon 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.540
 inside battlefield 4 a weapon that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.060
 it's versatile basically you remember 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.799
 the 16 to 3 m in battlefield 3 well this 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.659
 I think it looks a lot like it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.100
 because the statistics are very close 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.460
 in terms of gratitude of fire and the times of 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.920
 recharge and be it simply because it is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 a versatile weapon and as always being 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.460
 the most versatile and also the one that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.939
 in most situations there 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.119
 win the fire duel for how much 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.020
 regards the recoil we are 10 point 15 a 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.490
 left 0.25 right 0.36 up 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.530
 so we are in the classic stereotypes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.000
 criticism in which we do not know whether to choose 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.490
 a compensator since the recoil 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.040
 asymmetrical side 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.649
 or whether to choose a mouth brake that 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.480
 will slow down the vertical recoil a little 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.120
 you know what the Americans say 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.310
 you know what I no longer do anymore 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.200
 accessories on the barrel that I explain to you 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.690
 also because every accessory on the tip 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.610
 of the cane in fact from a bonus to the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.989
 your rifle by making less recoil 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.870
 giving him a little more precision than here 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.569
 removing or from there and this is the point 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.160
 each bonus is followed by a malus 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.319
 this means that if you are 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.410
 skilled enough to control you from 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.790
 only the recoil of the weapon not having 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.709
 put no bonus so no 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.290
 accessory you simply won't have 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.760
 no malus in terms of spread 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.620
 of the weapon that is usually what 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.360
 suffers when it goes to put for 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.730
 example a mouth brake or a cane 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.709
 heavy or anything else a b 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.480
 reduces nip fire accuracy 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.760
 at the other it reduces the accuracy on the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.440
 targeted fire and then at the end of 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.420
 fair always go anyway 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.299
 improve to make it more manageable 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.580
 the weapon but also to make it worse reason for 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.330
 which I use all lately 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.859
 weapons without any type of accessory 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.370
 at the tip the barrel unless it is a 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.900
 lmg as a truly indomitable recoil 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.370
 for less than I can't control 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.019
 and therefore it takes a nice day in the mouth 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.350
 rather than compensate pro based on 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.959
 kind of recoil that's there so this is 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.430
 23 why it is as strong as ever 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.320
 I urge so much because of how you are 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.859
 I said it is a weapon that in all 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.739
 situations will never betray you ever never is 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.180
 an opposing weapon is fine from distant though 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.220
 will be able to control an excellent recoil 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.359
 it's fine up close because a rat 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.850
 of fire 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.400
 not bad since there are 770 hits per 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.739
 minute is exactly the average between the weapon 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.069
 firing slower than the oscar h the weapon he 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.359
 shoot faster than obviously the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.980
 famas that you have already got to 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.310
 try another very interesting weapon 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.260
 that we will be able to treat in the future how to do 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.630
 the deployment of this weapon as 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.450
 deploy it well I've already told you something 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.239
 about the rods about the handle 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.370
 I prefer how you know lingle grip for 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.620
 which removes the recoil of the first shot e 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.180
 so let's start shooting immediately 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.910
 aiming at the right point without a 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.570
 excessive initial recoil as far as 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.500
 it concerns the viewfinders usually I go 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.570
 of coyotes or reflexes which are the two that 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.760
 sorry for coyotes or covers that are i 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.639
 two that leave me a little more space 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.280
 visual within the target area e 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:39.280
 I consider it a very important thing for 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.080
 an assault rifle how to use the 23 well 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.520
 any minimally skilled player 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.259
 knows well how to use it bero corrie 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.490
 hide yourself shoot 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.380
 there is nothing simpler 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.180
 this weapon will be fine in all 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.370
 situations I can only recommend 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.710
 most of you and unlocks 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.630
 through a very simple assignment 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.940
 that you can find from the battlelog in 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.389
 which you will need to take actions with 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.919
 your doctor and I repeat is the weapon that you 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.540
 I can advise on all the am 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.520
 using inc la war I am 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.240
 using on public servers when 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.949
 I have to catch up on some the game or 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.270
 I'm not finding so much maybe in a 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.190
 game for 23 days 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.740
 in short it is the weapon with which I succeed to 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.509
 be truly more effective and one 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.120
 statistic that is not to be ignored and the 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.759
 2.1 seconds recharge time 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.280
 there are three lower recharge times and 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.530
 the third weapon in the standings as far as 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.539
 it's about charging times and it's one 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.949
 which must be given much weight 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.630
 because many times do not give a 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.910
 you will notice arriving at the end of matches 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.190
 network this weapon not necessarily list 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.289
 while I know what a beautiful game I have 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.970
 done with this weapon who knows what the 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.500
 reason well many times the time of 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.330
 recharge is one of the statistics that you 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.310
 has helped because recharging more 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.710
 he quickly got out 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.180
 first from the shelter or to shoot first a 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.039
 enemy that was coming for you 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.750
 so while you are charging there are six 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.699
 definitely an advantage then 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.720
 another thing not to be avoided in weapons 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.789
 for example fame itself a weapon 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.009
 strong close, but we'll talk about 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.930
 another episode, however, is for how much 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.330
 relates to the recharge and painful time 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.750
 in fact it is one of the worst if not the 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.219
 worst weapon with 2.8 seconds almost three 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.330
 seconds to put the shots back into yours 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.560
 rifle and make it ready to shoot e 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.360
 this is definitely a very big one 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.490
 handicap as far as shooting is 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.949
 obviously forced 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.539
 the bug to very much battlefield boys 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.690
 I would really like to close this video 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.820
 making a blame on what 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.710
 beats the movie 4 right now because 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.630
 the although my favorite fps 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.719
 is making me spin a lot 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.819
 watermelons we really know that e 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.130
 tron karts blocked 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:45.550
 let's say it sets electronics from it 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.699
 to block the development of dlc and stars 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.949
 wars battlefront that obviously 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.500
 will resume this development I think between a 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:56.169
 month but from singstars to this month 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.389
 in trying to fix this better 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.849
 beat p4 because it is a game that al 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.340
 moment is the best fps around 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.319
 under many points of view but to a 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.900
 netcode that really sucks the 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.880
 pigeons and for this reason I hope 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.380
 that everything be fixed as the 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.490
 speech of not being able to play behind the 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.219
 teammates 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.990
 we 're not complaining for now 

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:18.240
 to do 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.520
 limbo fuck we try to support 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.010
 maybe the community by going to the forum e 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.130
 reporting the various bugs hoping that i 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.650
 hominids dais give us for once 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.180
 listen to them listen to the community well 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.850
 finish the game and then move on 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.950
 with the dlc of what I think is a 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.690
 game that still a lot to say there 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.220
 we see in the next video commented and 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.220
 vote if you want to sign up 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.000
 ok 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.980
 Now
