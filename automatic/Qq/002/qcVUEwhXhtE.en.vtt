00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.970
 Way, there's no way to choose well. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.530
 like this 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:54.390
 then come white blue blue lighter 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:02:00.060
 Yellow pink purple blue greenbacks this 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.060

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.989
 darker and lighter hair okay 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.209
 I tested with pink with purple and with blue 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.030
 and it was super cool because you guys are going 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.920
 you need your own water 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.670
 I put it here because I did not want to do it. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.660
 in the bathroom 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.000
 So you go or wet your hair in the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.099
 time or are going to leave the bath to dry a little 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.959
 leave it humid and put there today is 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:39.760
 For sauce I'm going to look a little bit at it. 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.030
 leave now 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.880
 if you have hair like me like that at 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:55.500
 very white times will come out on the second 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:59.610
 okay we put the cure with green 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.610
 Then you know the judge. 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:17.060
 the wetter it is 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:19.489
 but who will not fall and whoever I want 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.880
 I think it's cool to look at the 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:27.760
 continuous says the jetty tip of there 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.760
 chalk and come here and paint 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.950
 Let's see the other one who agreed you 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.250
 want it to be the coolest science is 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.650
 that when you win those words 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.870
 Let's put yellow yellow here. 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.870
 I like the blue sea 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.320
 the pink movie now 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.350
 okay and so on you see 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.960
 here it catches well in eye hair 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.360
 now I'll make up here that your 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.380
 natural hair in the dark first medium 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.820
 and then we'll see if it really does not promise 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.820
 white vote 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.889
 yellow nassau 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.640
 see you now the following many girls 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.390
 asked you to paste is receive hair 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.010
 dries out time is're dry at the time because 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.980
 I did not talk to my hair 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.170
 so the once-out tunnel type did not 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.500
 there was something so dry 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:55.760
 eternally or even cut was not 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:01.360
 but your natural hair does not stay 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:04.040
 so you know it gets a texture 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.920
 even brushing etc. 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.790
 it gets a texture I think it's cool 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.260
 For those who can not paint hair, so I 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.570
 I'm going to be logical to whoever wants 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.320
 Something like that to go out with the 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.370
 colored hair can come out but it's logical 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.370
 like I said it's not going to be a one thing 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.770
 natural hair so will not stand the 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.240
 half with a texture zinha but this I think 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.450
 that is not no big deal 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.730
 I think it's quiet, so then 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.680
 you saw that the white yellow green 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.630
 blue and pink tea 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.190
 so I 'll even indicate you're going to buy 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.790
 in because for those who do not want to paint the 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.310
 hair for who does not want to discolor 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:50.120
 why practice coloring needs 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.680
 heart then for those who do not want to have this 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:57.020
 problem is here 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.150
 this here now comes the question to nicole 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.370
 can do babyliss chapinha here in 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.250
 good up 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.110
 the brand says that it can understood then not 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.620
 I know, it goes from hair to hair 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.680
 I think I'd rather 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.900
 I do not know how to leave it so it 's natural 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.880
 and I'm kind of crazy people you know 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.460

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.970
 I go there and just do it then 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.080
 I leave here the tip for you to say 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.730
 hair will be so the affection of 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:32.090

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.610
 etc and will all catch will stay like this 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.920
 super cuddly and that's all good people 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.760
 any doubt about the judge leaves here 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.160
