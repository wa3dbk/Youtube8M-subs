00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.879
 hey people whatsup i'm colin yours 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.650
 mr tech news with your technology channel 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.730
 here on youtube if you subscribe me 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.830
 that was always up to date 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.380
 on the topic of technology today again 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.350
 small screencast on the subject of windows 8 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.209
 or to the topic browser in windows 8 and 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.910
 at the same time the big problem in 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.020
 windows 8 I have the three so far 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.690
 available or 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.640
 the three biggest ones available so far 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.520
 windows 8 browser that we once the 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.279
 internet explorer number no idea 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.090
 what the standard internet for itself 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.089
 do not use that 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.920
 then of course that's the current one 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:41.559
 version and firefox 18 knightley why 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.489
 the people just that's the first one 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.979
 times the first firefox with metro 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.370
 works and we see here once 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:55.120
 in the normal desktop surface here 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.579
 They all work pretty well here 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.289
 to my celebration in front of the internet explorer 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.920
 Of course they go out 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.580
 Well, the Internet bubble then stop 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.840
 Here's the firefox Knightley 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.390
 Actually looks like firefox too 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.640
 we can give you the version too 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:23.800
 well, that's the fashion on firefox 19 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:26.190
 19 01 so and of course here the chrome 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.050
 current version so no beta or something 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.000
 and they all work in the desktop 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.130
 quite normal when I am in the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.320
 Of course I can enter the metro surface 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.050
 playing surfing is like that, too 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.290
 advertised here if internet explorer 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.720
 to open 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.070
 Of course, the metro is nice too 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.200
 impuls bees and I have nothing annoying 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.659
 and have the full screen diagonal 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.040
 to surf 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.690
 but that works only if the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.330
 internet explorer as standard browser 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.890
 which is what I have not been selected 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.540
 understand because it can be so difficult 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.640
 it does not mean that you all 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.790
 browser at the same time as well 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.230
 can use metro browser and me 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.590
 has to say the internet industry is 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.840
 pretty well adapted to that metro 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.760
 so if that should be it 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.140
 finished with loading then disappears 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.850
 this bar and if you go with the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.520
 you also click the right mouse button 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.270
 different tabs and you are only one 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.910
 the homepage continues to be exciting 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.020
 actually nothing and I find 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.180
 any case internet explorer not 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.710
 bad 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.640
 and maybe we should now 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.500
 in the firefox or chrome quasi as 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.390
 We need to open metro browser 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.940
 the first set that the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.510
 standard programs are given to us 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.560
 once standard we go on 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.400
 standard programs that you can easily 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.720
 enter in the search bar open the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.120
 and go to standard programs 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.100
 then I need that very shortly 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.650
 just take the google for a while 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.640
 chrome first and click here on this 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.170
 set program as default and then 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.300
 here is this program has 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.310
 all standards that means I can now 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.720
 this browser either if I have those 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.390
 to open via desktop 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.800
 as desktop stock exchanges as usual under 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.019
 windows 7 or so open 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.790
 but also here as a metro browser and that 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.610
 is a bit different concept a lot 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.010
 Chrome as I become the tabs 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.860
 displayed 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.070
 So it's almost like normal chrome 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:35.620
 the normal desktop surface just stops 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.330
 without taskbar down or up and that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.850
 the same applies of course with the 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.760
 firefox night again need now again 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.220
 the standard programs or yes I have 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.080
 they are still open 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.620
 then i go here too Michael makes 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.580
 set this program as default 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.180
 this program has all 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.600
 standards and now I can do that here 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.820
 open nightly builds of firefox and 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.200
 you always see the icon which 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.160
 grad the standard is that is 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.620
 Knightley is right now 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.420
 change the icon and we can see that 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.940
 that almost the quasi the 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.489
 standard browser at the moment is so and he 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.620
 does not open that at all 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.180
 Of course, showing effect should be good 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.770
 He is then open times relative 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.450
 the same as the internet 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.950
 explorer that means you have five games 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.530
 surf and right mouse button 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.220
 you can use the tabs or something similar 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.930
 call 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.100
 but now come to the big problem 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.530
 I would have this metro broke here now 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.810
 No, that's what I wanted to do now 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.600
 for chrome in the desktop variant a 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.040
 download addon that's no matter what 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.360
 and I did not sign up 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.980
 logged in that means there will not be 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.700
 synced i just have one 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.770
 download addon that 's no matter what 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.210
 and you might think okay that is 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.220
 now also installed the chrome 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.890
 works well in metro but true 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.690
 not if I'm here now 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.840
 the desktop version of google chrome 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.650
 an add on has installed then that is 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.370
 not available when i google chrome 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.550
 something completely opened in the metro 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.080
 incomprehensible is the same 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.169
 is also with cookies that means I have 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.600
 subscribed to the versions at 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.010
 as not opened the google account 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.110
 the metro, and did not again 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.990
 logged in that is extremely disturbing and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.730
 has led me to exclusively 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.900
 the desktop version was used that 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.230
 simply that is completely nonsense 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.730
 Firstly, you always have to 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.770
 browser you want to have as 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.500
 standardbrowser that means you can quasi 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.420
 not two browsers alongside as metro 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.910
 use the browser and you have the whole 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.830
 cookies and addons not on the other 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.960
 browser what i am today is the one 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.680
 program something like that and that's how it works 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.230
 just no fun 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.340
 but good with the metro browsers 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.900
 I feel a little better too 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.540
 presented as it actually is me 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.590
 thought cool that I use fully 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.540
 that sprouted a lot cooler though 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.640
 somehow this bothers more than that 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.640
 I think it helps because you have to 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.700
 Often times well short the downloads 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.370
 look it up or something and then if you can 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.990
 course in the metro is and shut up 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.420
 opens automatically opens the 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.260
 desktop and because they are not all that 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.970
 100 percent by may that is simply 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.160
 for me i am looking at the desktop apps 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.820
 with you that is almost everyone 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.380
 leave 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.110
 I just have a quick look at the three 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.940
 try presented browser so 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.010
 firefox somehow does not start any 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.150
 I do not know why 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.970
 maybe simply because it's the alpha 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.580
 In any case they are pretty much like 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.020
 the like firefox for android or me 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.280
 do not know if the euro is also there 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.740
 definitely for the mobile version 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.000
 from firefox that looks pretty accurate 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.900
 equal except just a bit bigger 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.280
 scale that 's it if you were 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.660
 any suggestions for others 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.460
 screencast definitely writes me 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.770
 below in the comments I am open 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.270
 for if you liked the video 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.640
 Gives me a thumbs up and comments 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.140
 In any case, why not if you never 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.150
 fallen opponent thumbs down and 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.260
 but also comments why I want that 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.020
 in any case, I know also wants 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.190
 get better that 's it for today me 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.190
 I'm your mister tech news
