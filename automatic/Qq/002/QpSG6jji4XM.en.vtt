the<00:00:05.310> main<00:00:05.520> thing<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.790> sets<00:00:06.150> touchdown<00:00:06.660> aside

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
the main thing that sets touchdown aside

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.290 
the main thing that sets touchdown aside
from<00:00:07.319> any<00:00:07.500> other<00:00:07.710> mono<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.580> stretch<00:00:08.910> it's

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
from any other mono is the stretch it's

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.140 
from any other mono is the stretch it's
half<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.660> stretch<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.559> sub<00:00:11.099> line<00:00:11.340> which<00:00:11.910> means

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
half the stretch of sub line which means

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.209 
half the stretch of sub line which means
when<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> leg<00:00:12.780> touches<00:00:13.290> down<00:00:13.500> hence<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.040> name

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
when the leg touches down hence the name

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.670 
when the leg touches down hence the name
you<00:00:14.820> feel<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.509> much<00:00:15.690> more<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.170> that's<00:00:16.320> such<00:00:16.529> an

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
you feel so much more and that's such an

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.859 
you feel so much more and that's such an
integral<00:00:17.010> part<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.910> all<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.150> our<00:00:18.390> fishing<00:00:18.750> that

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
integral part of all of our fishing that

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.900 
integral part of all of our fishing that
same<00:00:19.080> Calder<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.100> can't<00:00:20.400> fill<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> lid

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
same Calder if we can't fill the lid

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.550 
same Calder if we can't fill the lid
down<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.390> don't<00:00:21.539> know<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.930> we're<00:00:22.080> fishing<00:00:22.410> on

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
down we don't know what we're fishing on

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.990 
down we don't know what we're fishing on
and<00:00:22.830> then<00:00:23.340> you're<00:00:23.460> gonna<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> whine<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
and then you're gonna have to whine the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
and then you're gonna have to whine the
rigging<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.480> recast<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.260> again<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.680> this

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
rigging and recast it again so this

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.189 
rigging and recast it again so this
exaggerated<00:00:26.490> set<00:00:26.730> feeling<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:27.660> very<00:00:27.990> very

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
exaggerated set feeling it's very very

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.140 
exaggerated set feeling it's very very
close<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.619> fluorocarbon<00:00:29.130> which<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> also<00:00:29.910> very

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
close to fluorocarbon which is also very

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.359 
close to fluorocarbon which is also very
low<00:00:30.359> stretch<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> mono<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
low stretch but for a mono of this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.160 
low stretch but for a mono of this
quality<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> be<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> lowest

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
quality it's going to be the lowest

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.450 
quality it's going to be the lowest
stretch<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> market

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
stretch that you can get on the market

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.030 
stretch that you can get on the market
so<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> downsides<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.559> touchdown

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
so one of the downsides to touchdown

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.319 
so one of the downsides to touchdown
what<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.280> would<00:00:38.430> say<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.850> you're<00:00:39.090> an

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
what I would say if you're an

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.869 
what I would say if you're an
inexperienced<00:00:39.600> carp<00:00:40.440> angler<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.190> would<00:00:41.670> stick

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
inexperienced carp angler I would stick

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
inexperienced carp angler I would stick
with<00:00:41.910> sub<00:00:42.270> line<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> begin<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.110> because<00:00:43.290> it's

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
with sub line to begin with because it's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.529 
with sub line to begin with because it's
slightly<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:43.950> stretching<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.420> can

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
slightly more stretching it then you can

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.850 
slightly more stretching it then you can
make<00:00:45.660> more<00:00:45.840> mistakes<00:00:45.930> when<00:00:46.379> you're<00:00:46.500> playing<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
make more mistakes when you're playing a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
make more mistakes when you're playing a
fish<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.850> forgiving<00:00:48.270> when<00:00:48.360> you're

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
fish it's more forgiving when you're

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
fish it's more forgiving when you're
casting<00:00:49.200> less<00:00:49.920> chance<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.370> anything<00:00:50.579> frakking

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
casting less chance of anything frakking

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.970 
casting less chance of anything frakking
up<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.320> you're<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> complete<00:00:52.829> beginner

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
up so if you're a complete beginner

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.189 
up so if you're a complete beginner
start<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.850> sub<00:00:54.059> line<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:54.690> you've<00:00:54.870> been<00:00:54.960> can't

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
start with sub line if you've been can't

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.830 
start with sub line if you've been can't
fishing<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> long<00:00:55.770> time<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.460> you're<00:00:56.940> dedicated

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
fishing a long time and you're dedicated

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.270 
fishing a long time and you're dedicated
to<00:00:57.930> feeling<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.379> lead<00:00:58.530> hit<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> bottom<00:00:59.160> if

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to feeling that lead hit the bottom if

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.979 
to feeling that lead hit the bottom if
that's<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.579> integral<00:01:00.090> part<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.570> fishing

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that's an integral part of your fishing

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.959 
that's an integral part of your fishing
then<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.609> fishing

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
then it is for you and if you're fishing

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.530 
then it is for you and if you're fishing
up<00:01:03.090> 10<00:01:03.750> yards<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.670> 120<00:01:05.670> yards<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.180> there's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
up 10 yards out or 120 yards out there's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.760 
up 10 yards out or 120 yards out there's
going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.869> breaking<00:01:07.260> strain<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.650> will

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
going to be a breaking strain that will

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.289 
going to be a breaking strain that will
so<00:01:07.950> you're<00:01:08.159> fishing<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.970> some<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> the

people<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:22.140> fishing<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.560> 20-pound<00:01:23.159> version

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
people are fishing the 20-pound version

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
people are fishing the 20-pound version
in<00:01:23.939> really<00:01:24.299> weedy<00:01:24.509> conditions<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.799> it's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
in really weedy conditions you know it's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
in really weedy conditions you know it's
not<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> cast<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.759> far<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.509> know<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
not going to cast as far you know is the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.480 
not going to cast as far you know is the
12<00:01:28.140> pound<00:01:28.380> version<00:01:28.619> because<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.310> much

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
12 pound version because it's so much

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
12 pound version because it's so much
thicker<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.240> still<00:01:30.420> cast<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.170> well

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
thicker but it's still cast really well

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
thicker but it's still cast really well
and<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.100> regime<00:01:32.579> resistance<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.180> also

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and the regime resistance is also

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 
and the regime resistance is also
brilliant<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.920> use<00:01:35.130> sub<00:01:35.340> line<00:01:35.549> before

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
brilliant so if you use sub line before

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.249 
brilliant so if you use sub line before
and<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.420> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> feel<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> little<00:01:36.990> bit<00:01:37.200> more

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
and you want to feel a little bit more

and you want to feel a little bit more
touch<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> line<00:01:38.820> touchdown<00:01:39.509> comes

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
touch down as the line touchdown comes

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.480 
touch down as the line touchdown comes
in<00:01:40.110> two<00:01:40.290> colors<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.040> using<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
in two colors the one I'm using at the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
in two colors the one I'm using at the
moment<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> sort<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.299> unobtrusive<00:01:42.899> green

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
moment is the sort of unobtrusive green

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.230 
moment is the sort of unobtrusive green
color<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.740> suits<00:01:44.310> lakes<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
color that suits lakes like this that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.789 
color that suits lakes like this that
are<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.360> clear<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.380> look<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
are really clear if you look on the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.289 
are really clear if you look on the
underwater<00:01:47.159> cameras<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.700> summer<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.119> this

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
underwater cameras on summer like this

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
underwater cameras on summer like this
the<00:01:48.450> waters<00:01:48.810> got<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.200> green<00:01:49.590> tint<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the waters got a really green tint to it

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.190 
the waters got a really green tint to it
so<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.850> color<00:01:51.090> fits<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.570> perfectly<00:01:52.110> with

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so this color fits in perfectly with

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
so this color fits in perfectly with
that<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> brown<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.060> places

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that and then the brown is for places

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.910 
that and then the brown is for places
that<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:54.750> tea<00:01:54.990> colored<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:55.829> he

Manos<00:02:56.879> you<00:02:57.060> want<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.299> spool<00:02:57.569> spinning<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.349> a

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
Manos you want the spool spinning in a

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.410 
Manos you want the spool spinning in a
bucket<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.829> water<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.459> basically<00:03:00.180> when

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
bucket of water and basically when

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.240 
bucket of water and basically when
you're<00:03:00.599> winding<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.290> stop<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.859> just<00:03:01.890> look

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you're winding if you stop I just look

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.220 
you're winding if you stop I just look
at<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.459> line<00:03:02.640> going<00:03:02.940> through<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.359> but<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.569> make

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
at the line going through the but I make

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.210 
at the line going through the but I make
sure<00:03:04.379> it's<00:03:04.530> coming<00:03:04.709> through<00:03:04.799> perfectly

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
sure it's coming through perfectly

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.890 
sure it's coming through perfectly
straight<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.060> twisted<00:03:06.569> round<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
straight if it's twisted round the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.660 
straight if it's twisted round the
Buckeye<00:03:07.109> like<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.709> then<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.370> means<00:03:08.549> you're

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
Buckeye like that then it means you're

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.920 
Buckeye like that then it means you're
putting<00:03:08.760> twists<00:03:09.150> into<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.629> which<00:03:09.750> usually

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
putting twists into it which usually

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.599 
putting twists into it which usually
means<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.440> spools<00:03:10.739> falling<00:03:11.159> over<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.489> its

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
means the spools falling over on its

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:11.869 
means the spools falling over on its
side

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
side

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.240 
side
so<00:03:12.480> turn<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.900> back<00:03:13.079> up<00:03:13.260> again<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.769> have<00:03:14.099> it

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
so turn it back up again and have it

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.009 
so turn it back up again and have it
spinning<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:15.060> freewheel<00:03:15.450> throwing<00:03:15.840> water

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
spinning like a freewheel throwing water

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.809 
spinning like a freewheel throwing water
out<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.440> bucket<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.159> you<00:03:17.400> know<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.730> will

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
out of the bucket and you know it will

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.430 
out of the bucket and you know it will
go<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:17.970> perfect<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.780> makes<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.169> massive

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
go on perfect and that makes a massive

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.680 
go on perfect and that makes a massive
difference<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:20.310> how<00:03:20.700> far<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.209> cast<00:03:21.450> if

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
difference to how far you can cast if

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.420 
difference to how far you can cast if
you<00:03:21.780> put<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.049> on<00:03:22.169> wrong<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.919> get<00:03:23.069> loads<00:03:23.310> of

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
you put it on wrong you get loads of

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.009 
you put it on wrong you get loads of
problems<00:03:23.760> with<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.030> put<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.359> on<00:03:24.389> right<00:03:24.690> it

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
problems with it put it on right it

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.900 
problems with it put it on right it
would<00:03:25.290> absolutely<00:03:25.470> sail<00:03:26.099> out<00:03:26.370> there<00:03:26.609> one

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
would absolutely sail out there one

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.280 
would absolutely sail out there one
other<00:03:27.030> tip<00:03:27.269> we've<00:03:27.510> touched<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:28.079> you'll

other tip we've touched down you'll

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.080 
other tip we've touched down you'll
notice<00:03:28.410> we've<00:03:28.799> excessive<00:03:29.340> use<00:03:29.519> playing<00:03:29.849> lots

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
notice we've excessive use playing lots

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.210 
notice we've excessive use playing lots
of<00:03:30.209> fish<00:03:30.419> lots<00:03:30.629> of<00:03:30.780> casting<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.500> line<00:03:31.859> will<00:03:32.069> go

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
of fish lots of casting the line will go

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.190 
of fish lots of casting the line will go
curly<00:03:32.700> from<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.879> rod<00:03:33.090> tip<00:03:33.359> down<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.989> rig

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
curly from the rod tip down to the rig

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.349 
curly from the rod tip down to the rig
if<00:03:34.410> you'd<00:03:34.769> let<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.129> go<00:03:35.280> slacks<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:35.940> want<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.239> do

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
if you'd let it go slacks I want to do

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.059 
if you'd let it go slacks I want to do
then<00:03:36.599> you<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:37.169> pull<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.349> rod<00:03:37.530> length<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.889> line

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
then you just pull a rod length of line

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.550 
then you just pull a rod length of line
off<00:03:38.280> cut<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.579> rig<00:03:38.760> off<00:03:38.910> retie<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.379> lines

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
off cut the rig off retie and the lines

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.009 
off cut the rig off retie and the lines
perfect<00:03:41.129> again<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:42.150> any<00:03:42.359> line<00:03:42.599> keep<00:03:42.900> it

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
perfect again and like any line keep it

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.390 
perfect again and like any line keep it
out<00:03:43.139> direct<00:03:43.530> sunlight<00:03:43.769> when<00:03:44.129> you're<00:03:44.250> not

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
out direct sunlight when you're not

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.550 
out direct sunlight when you're not
using<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.910> keep<00:03:45.419> wetting<00:03:45.629> it<00:03:45.900> before<00:03:46.199> you<00:03:46.319> cast

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
using it keep wetting it before you cast

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.740 
using it keep wetting it before you cast
just<00:03:46.889> so<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.129> flies<00:03:47.370> off<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.790> spool<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.419> it

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
just so it flies off the spool and it

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.479 
just so it flies off the spool and it
will<00:03:48.840> last<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.230> absolutely<00:03:49.829> ages<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.400> one

have a little tip you can use it for

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.180 
have a little tip you can use it for
hook<00:03:52.109> links<00:03:52.379> as<00:03:52.470> well<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.859> lot<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.129> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
hook links as well and a lot of the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.250 
hook links as well and a lot of the
European<00:03:53.280> anglers<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.150> using<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.959> heavier

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
European anglers now using the heavier

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.990 
European anglers now using the heavier
breaking<00:03:55.680> strains<00:03:55.949> for<00:03:56.129> hooklink<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:56.699> if

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
breaking strains for hooklink so if

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.189 
breaking strains for hooklink so if
you've<00:03:57.209> wound<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.510> onto<00:03:57.720> your<00:03:57.810> reels<00:03:58.019> and

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
you've wound it onto your reels and

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.990 
you've wound it onto your reels and
you've<00:03:58.290> got<00:03:58.470> some<00:03:58.709> left<00:03:58.949> but<00:03:59.370> 10<00:03:59.579> pounds<00:03:59.940> of

brilliant Zee cook link and the heavy

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.110 
brilliant Zee cook link and the heavy
ones<00:04:02.099> are<00:04:02.250> brilliant<00:04:02.549> for<00:04:02.579> fishing<00:04:02.940> on<00:04:03.030> the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
ones are brilliant for fishing on the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.539 
ones are brilliant for fishing on the
bottom<00:04:03.419> so<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:04.139> got<00:04:04.260> loads<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.590> uses<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.280> it

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
bottom so it's got loads of uses and it

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.009 
bottom so it's got loads of uses and it
will<00:04:05.639> last<00:04:05.819> as<00:04:06.060> long<00:04:06.209> as<00:04:06.359> any<00:04:06.480> other<00:04:06.660> mono

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.439 
will last as long as any other mono
lines<00:04:07.859> with<00:04:08.129> a<00:04:08.160> low<00:04:08.340> stretch<00:04:08.760> are<00:04:09.090> actually

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
lines with a low stretch are actually

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.210 
lines with a low stretch are actually
better<00:04:09.660> for<00:04:09.750> cast<00:04:10.079> up<00:04:10.319> against<00:04:10.709> islands

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
better for cast up against islands

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.770 
better for cast up against islands
because<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.579> get<00:04:11.699> less<00:04:11.940> stretch<00:04:12.329> as<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.629> hit

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
because you get less stretch as you hit

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.599 
because you get less stretch as you hit
the<00:04:12.810> clip<00:04:13.169> so<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.769> don't<00:04:14.040> end<00:04:14.220> up<00:04:14.310> dragging

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
the clip so you don't end up dragging

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.819 
the clip so you don't end up dragging
the<00:04:14.910> rig<00:04:15.090> into<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.449> island<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:15.959> much<00:04:16.139> so<00:04:16.440> what

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829
