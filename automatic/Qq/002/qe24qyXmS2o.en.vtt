00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
but really durable face fabric so when

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.200 
but really durable face fabric so when
we<00:02:02.160> designed<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:03.000> lightweight

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
we designed this really lightweight

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.490 
we designed this really lightweight
piece<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.690> knew<00:02:03.810> there<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.050> lot<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.229> them<00:02:04.410> on

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
piece we knew there are a lot of them on

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.109 
piece we knew there are a lot of them on
the<00:02:04.590> market<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.130> we're<00:02:05.610> always<00:02:05.759> trying<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the market but we're always trying to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.050 
the market but we're always trying to
balance<00:02:06.300> weight<00:02:07.229> injure<00:02:07.470> two<00:02:07.920> together<00:02:08.100> you

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
balance weight injure two together you

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430 
balance weight injure two together you
can<00:02:09.179> go<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.420> meet<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> lightest<00:02:10.020> piece<00:02:10.229> but

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
can go out meet the lightest piece but

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.570 
can go out meet the lightest piece but
it's<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.649> gonna<00:02:10.740> be<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> most<00:02:11.009> durable<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
it's not gonna be the most durable you

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.070 
it's not gonna be the most durable you
can<00:02:11.610> make<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> most<00:02:12.180> durable<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.960> going

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
can make the most durable and it's going

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.940 
can make the most durable and it's going
to<00:02:13.140> weigh<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> ton

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
to weigh a ton

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.500 
to weigh a ton
we're<00:02:14.310> always<00:02:14.460> trying<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.850> find<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.180> balance

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
we're always trying to find that balance

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.620 
we're always trying to find that balance
between<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.200> two<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.710> we<00:02:17.130> saw<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.490> piece<00:02:17.760> as

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
between the two and we saw this piece as

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.809 
between the two and we saw this piece as
being<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:20.100> jacket<00:02:20.490> that's<00:02:20.610> going<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
being that that jacket that's going to

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.130 
being that that jacket that's going to
be<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.180> out<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.330> your<00:02:21.390> pack<00:02:21.630> quite<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.900> lot

you know a backcountry skier you're a
mountaineer<00:02:24.000> alpinist<00:02:24.569> you're<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.500> out

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
mountaineer alpinist you're in and out

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.380 
mountaineer alpinist you're in and out
you're<00:02:25.770> using<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.340> when<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.760> stop<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.210> that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
you're using it when you stop in that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.760 
you're using it when you stop in that
stop<00:02:27.720> phase<00:02:27.930> more<00:02:28.170> than<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.410> are<00:02:28.530> when<00:02:28.680> you're

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
stop phase more than you are when you're

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.430 
stop phase more than you are when you're
doing<00:02:29.400> your<00:02:29.430> up<00:02:29.640> phase<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.870> realize<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.290> in

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
doing your up phase so we realize in in

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.960 
doing your up phase so we realize in in
a<00:02:31.530> pack<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.190> there's<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.490> lot<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.670> things

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
a pack like that there's a lot of things

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.460 
a pack like that there's a lot of things
that<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.300> jacket<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.780> catch<00:02:33.990> on<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.380> know

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
that the jacket can catch on you know

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.750 
that the jacket can catch on you know
you've<00:02:34.620> got<00:02:34.740> probes<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> shovels<00:02:35.610> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
you've got probes and shovels and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.940 
you've got probes and shovels and
climbing<00:02:36.120> gear<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.510> stuff<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.920> we

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
climbing gear and stuff like that so we

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.580 
climbing gear and stuff like that so we
really<00:02:38.370> wanted<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.730> durable<00:02:39.390> face<00:02:39.569> fabric<00:02:40.020> so

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
really wanted a durable face fabric so

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.640 
really wanted a durable face fabric so
we<00:02:40.710> work<00:02:40.890> with<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.490> Japanese<00:02:42.650> manufacturing

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
we work with a Japanese manufacturing

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.860 
we work with a Japanese manufacturing
company<00:02:43.950> called<00:02:44.130> Toure<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.600> work<00:02:45.750> with

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
company called Toure and we work with

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.210 
company called Toure and we work with
them<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.050> come<00:02:46.350> up<00:02:46.410> with<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.920> lightweight

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
them to come up with a lightweight

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.480 
them to come up with a lightweight
really<00:02:47.790> durable<00:02:48.060> face<00:02:48.300> fabric<00:02:48.510> so

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
really durable face fabric so

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.310 
really durable face fabric so
they<00:02:50.150> did<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:51.260> 79<00:02:51.710> years<00:02:52.040> super-lightweight

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
they did it's 79 years super-lightweight

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:04.750 
they did it's 79 years super-lightweight
sorry<00:02:54.320> 710<00:02:54.830> year<00:02:55.060> 7-7<00:03:03.280> leave<00:03:04.280> them<00:03:04.520> in<00:03:04.700> a

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
sorry 710 year 7-7 leave them in a

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.720 
sorry 710 year 7-7 leave them in a
really<00:03:05.030> really<00:03:05.210> tight<00:03:05.420> weave<00:03:05.710> so<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:07.610> way

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
really really tight weave so the way

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.180 
really really tight weave so the way
it's<00:03:07.910> woven<00:03:08.150> allows<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:09.200> gives<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.100> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
it's woven allows it gives it the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.800 
it's woven allows it gives it the
strength<00:03:10.250> from<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.640> durability<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.570> then

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
strength from the durability and then

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.510 
strength from the durability and then
the<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.440> lightness<00:03:12.770> of<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.950> fibers<00:03:13.250> gives<00:03:13.400> it

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
the the lightness of the fibers gives it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.590 
the the lightness of the fibers gives it
that<00:03:13.550> light<00:03:13.790> weight<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.300> you're<00:03:14.420> looking

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
that light weight that you're looking

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.350 
that light weight that you're looking
for<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.780> 710<00:03:15.290> year<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:16.790> such<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> tight

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
for that 710 year it is such a tight

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.090 
for that 710 year it is such a tight
weave<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.900> takes<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.260> huge<00:03:18.590> amount<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.890> time

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
weave it takes a huge amount of time

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.190 
weave it takes a huge amount of time
just<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.550> like<00:03:19.670> weave<00:03:20.270> a<00:03:20.300> metre<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:21.020> it's

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
just to like weave a metre of it it's

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.070 
just to like weave a metre of it it's
it's<00:03:21.470> really<00:03:21.740> a<00:03:22.040> long<00:03:22.310> time<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.630> what<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.870> get

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
it's really a long time but what you get

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.740 
it's really a long time but what you get
is<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.650> Down<00:03:25.370> proof<00:03:25.640> really<00:03:26.090> durable<00:03:26.450> face

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
is a Down proof really durable face

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.110 
is a Down proof really durable face
fabric<00:03:26.990> really<00:03:27.950> really<00:03:28.160> lightweight<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.970> this

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
fabric really really lightweight so this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.970 
fabric really really lightweight so this
jacket<00:03:29.330> weighs<00:03:29.660> pretty<00:03:29.930> much<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.350> same<00:03:30.560> as<00:03:30.830> an

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
jacket weighs pretty much the same as an

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.660 
jacket weighs pretty much the same as an
