really what you'll see is that Barracuda
can<00:01:03.190> be<00:01:03.280> used<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:03.670> create<00:01:03.850> all<00:01:04.120> kinds<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.570> parts

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839

anything from a hood scoop to a
transmission<00:01:07.300> tone<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:08.260> if<00:01:08.410> you've<00:01:08.530> used

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
transmission tone and if you've used

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.100 
transmission tone and if you've used
carbon<00:01:09.550> fiber<00:01:09.820> before<00:01:10.330> you'll<00:01:10.540> notice<00:01:10.900> that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
carbon fiber before you'll notice that

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.380 
carbon fiber before you'll notice that
the<00:01:11.530> qualities<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.010> Barracuda<00:01:12.670> are<00:01:13.090> very

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
the qualities of Barracuda are very

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.420 
the qualities of Barracuda are very
similar<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.410> fact<00:01:14.620> both<00:01:14.860> products<00:01:15.340> are

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
similar and in fact both products are

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.770 
similar and in fact both products are
used<00:01:15.640> for<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.880> same<00:01:16.090> reason<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.510> that's<00:01:16.630> to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
used for the same reason and that's to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.240 
used for the same reason and that's to
make<00:01:16.990> your<00:01:17.170> car<00:01:17.320> stand<00:01:17.650> out<00:01:17.830> from<00:01:18.010> what<00:01:18.160> the

the barracuda fabric can be cut straight

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.750 
the barracuda fabric can be cut straight
from<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.170> roll<00:01:33.350> or<00:01:33.650> on<00:01:33.830> a<00:01:33.890> 45-degree<00:01:34.729> angle

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
from the roll or on a 45-degree angle

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.090 
from the roll or on a 45-degree angle
the<00:01:35.750> way<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:35.960> cut<00:01:36.260> it<00:01:36.290> will<00:01:36.530> have<00:01:36.710> an<00:01:36.799> effect

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
the way you cut it will have an effect

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.469 
the way you cut it will have an effect
on<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.369> way<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.520> piece<00:01:37.850> looks<00:01:38.180> when<00:01:38.360> it's

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
on the way the piece looks when it's

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.690 
on the way the piece looks when it's
finished<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.830> piece<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.369> lots<00:01:40.580> of

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
finished for a piece with lots of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.530 
finished for a piece with lots of
contours<00:01:41.210> we<00:01:41.600> recommend<00:01:42.080> cutting<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.530> on<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.710> 45

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
contours we recommend cutting it on a 45

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.120 
contours we recommend cutting it on a 45
this<00:01:44.540> makes<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.990> fabric<00:01:45.170> more<00:01:45.530> flexible<00:01:45.950> and

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
this makes the fabric more flexible and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.280 
this makes the fabric more flexible and
also<00:01:46.550> minimizes<00:01:47.119> any<00:01:47.300> distortions<00:01:47.990> here<00:01:48.140> I'm

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
also minimizes any distortions here I'm

we<00:01:55.070> get<00:01:55.250> started<00:01:55.700> by<00:01:55.820> applying<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.330> coat<00:01:56.540> of

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
we get started by applying a coat of

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.000 
we get started by applying a coat of
resin<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.110> our<00:01:57.230> foot<00:01:57.410> box<00:01:57.590> metal<00:01:57.980> mold<00:02:00.010> from

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
resin to our foot box metal mold from

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.380 
resin to our foot box metal mold from
there<00:02:01.220> we<00:02:01.370> place<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:01.790> our<00:02:01.880> first<00:02:02.150> layer<00:02:02.360> of

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
there we place in our first layer of

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.140 
there we place in our first layer of
Barracuda<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.320> then<00:02:03.920> coat<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.310> with<00:02:04.460> resin<00:02:04.850> as

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
Barracuda and then coat it with resin as

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.450 
Barracuda and then coat it with resin as
with<00:02:05.960> any<00:02:06.110> other<00:02:06.200> composite<00:02:06.710> we<00:02:07.190> try<00:02:07.400> to

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
with any other composite we try to

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.940 
with any other composite we try to
spread<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.940> resin<00:02:08.330> as<00:02:08.479> evenly<00:02:08.899> as<00:02:08.990> possible

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.070 

after<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.879> we<00:02:15.090> apply<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> second<00:02:15.870> layer<00:02:15.900> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
after that we apply a second layer of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.770 
after that we apply a second layer of
barracuda<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.890> coat<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.220> with<00:02:17.430> more<00:02:17.640> resin<00:02:18.030> we

barracuda and coat it with more resin we

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.119 
barracuda and coat it with more resin we
want<00:02:18.959> our<00:02:19.050> foot<00:02:19.260> box<00:02:19.470> cover<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.099> a

a template of our shape with a sharpie

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.930 
a template of our shape with a sharpie
next<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:54.680> carefully<00:02:54.920> cut<00:02:55.250> along<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.610> outline

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
next we carefully cut along the outline

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.610 
next we carefully cut along the outline
to<00:02:56.209> get<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.480> rough<00:02:56.690> shape<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:57.110> our<00:02:57.230> foot<00:02:57.440> box

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620
