of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> corner<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:41.340> was<00:01:41.970> actually

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of the corner there I was actually

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.550 
of the corner there I was actually
looking<00:01:42.360> around<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.470> just

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
looking around for it but it's just

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.280 
looking around for it but it's just
inside<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.960> show<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
inside there and then I will show you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.280 
inside there and then I will show you
exactly<00:01:46.380> where<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> map<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
exactly where on the map it is so you

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.080 
exactly where on the map it is so you
can<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.619> isn't<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.130> far<00:01:50.490> away<00:01:50.520> from<00:01:50.790> where

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
can see isn't that far away from where

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.260 
can see isn't that far away from where
we<00:01:51.240> were<00:01:51.270> zoom<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.670> there<00:01:53.670> look<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.149> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
we were zoom in just there look for that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.030 
we were zoom in just there look for that
spirally<00:01:54.899> bit<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.140> road<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.530> your<00:01:55.649> right<00:01:55.829> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
spirally bit of road to your right and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.310 
spirally bit of road to your right and
then<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.390> zoom<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> map<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
then you can zoom in on the map and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.289 
then you can zoom in on the map and
you'll<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.680> exactly<00:01:58.860> where<00:01:59.670> you've<00:02:00.000> got<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you'll see exactly where you've got to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.760 
you'll see exactly where you've got to
be<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:01.979> bit<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> next

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
be so that is that bit right so next

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.290 
be so that is that bit right so next
we're<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.219> car

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
we're in a car

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.960 
we're in a car
we'll<00:02:06.660> head<00:02:06.870> over<00:02:06.900> here<00:02:07.440> you'll<00:02:07.770> see<00:02:07.970> this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
we'll head over here you'll see this

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.030 
we'll head over here you'll see this
shops<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.930> these<00:02:10.080> areas<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.650> there's<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.860> big

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
shops in these areas and there's a big

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.220 
shops in these areas and there's a big
sign<00:02:11.310> right<00:02:11.580> above<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.780> what<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:12.990> have<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
sign right above you so what you have to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.590 
sign right above you so what you have to
do<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.470> climb<00:02:13.770> up<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> big<00:02:14.280> sign<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.360> come

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
do is climb up the big sign so come

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.030 
do is climb up the big sign so come
around<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> back<00:02:16.020> down<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.470> stairs<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:16.830> then

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
around the back down the stairs and then

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.370 
around the back down the stairs and then
up<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.430> huge<00:02:17.760> sign<00:02:18.090> which<00:02:18.600> you'll<00:02:18.990> see<00:02:19.200> from

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
up that huge sign which you'll see from

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.960 
up that huge sign which you'll see from
the<00:02:19.500> rod<00:02:19.680> which<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.670> might

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
the rod which is now you might

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.060 
the rod which is now you might
understand<00:02:21.480> why<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> show<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.260> where<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
understand why I show you where you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.930 
understand why I show you where you
going<00:02:23.450> before<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> show<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.610> exactly<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
going before I show you exactly on the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.120 
going before I show you exactly on the
map<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.660> get<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.080> first<00:02:28.290> level<00:02:28.530> climb<00:02:28.890> up

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
map so get to the first level climb up

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.250 
map so get to the first level climb up
jump<00:02:29.400> up<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.730> second<00:02:30.120> level<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.570> between

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
jump up to the second level and between

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.090 
jump up to the second level and between
the<00:02:31.500> two<00:02:31.680> signs<00:02:32.810> vodka<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.380> think<00:02:35.010> with

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
the two signs vodka and I think with

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.010 
the two signs vodka and I think with
condoms<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.940> other<00:02:36.120> side<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.810> was

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
condoms on the other side it was

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020 
condoms on the other side it was
something<00:02:37.380> strange<00:02:37.620> there<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.000> other

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
something strange there is the other

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.900 
something strange there is the other
part<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:40.680> we'll<00:02:40.830> jump<00:02:41.010> into<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.730> map

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
part and then we'll jump into the map

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.360 
part and then we'll jump into the map
and<00:02:42.150> show<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.750> exactly<00:02:42.900> where<00:02:43.710> we<00:02:43.860> are<00:02:44.010> so

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
and show you exactly where we are so

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.560 
and show you exactly where we are so
we're<00:02:44.520> trying<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.820> keep<00:02:45.000> these<00:02:45.150> as<00:02:45.330> close

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
we're trying to keep these as close

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.610 
we're trying to keep these as close
together<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.740> can<00:02:47.660> know<00:02:48.660> exactly<00:02:48.840> you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
together so you can know exactly you

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.290 
together so you can know exactly you
don't<00:02:49.800> have<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.010> travel<00:02:50.190> up<00:02:50.460> them<00:02:50.700> up<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.060> down

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
don't have to travel up them up and down

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.780 
don't have to travel up them up and down
them<00:02:51.480> up<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.780> then<00:02:51.870> around<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.470> we'll<00:02:53.430> zoom<00:02:53.460> in

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
them up and then around so we'll zoom in

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.270 
them up and then around so we'll zoom in
and<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:55.170> all<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.560> far<00:02:55.890> from<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
and it's not all that far from the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.300 
and it's not all that far from the
marina<00:02:56.880> where<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.380> buy<00:02:58.590> or<00:02:58.950> not

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
marina where you can buy or not

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.670 
marina where you can buy or not
depending<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.720> basically<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.170> look<00:03:01.410> for<00:03:01.590> if

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
depending but basically I look for if

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.700 
depending but basically I look for if
buy<00:03:01.830> them<00:03:02.010> three<00:03:02.340> straight<00:03:02.640> jacked<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.630> off<00:03:03.840> to

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
buy them three straight jacked up off to

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.940 
buy them three straight jacked up off to
the<00:03:04.740> next<00:03:05.340> bit<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:06.660> not<00:03:07.320> even<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.740> far

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
the next bit and it's not even that far

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.830 
the next bit and it's not even that far
away<00:03:08.130> I've<00:03:08.610> got<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.940> same<00:03:09.120> car<00:03:09.420> as<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.690> can

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
away I've got the same car as you can

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.040 
away I've got the same car as you can
see<00:03:10.050> but<00:03:10.680> you'll<00:03:11.040> see<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.670> half<00:03:12.390> round<00:03:12.750> about

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
see but you'll see this half round about

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.290 
see but you'll see this half round about
with<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.380> car<00:03:13.590> park<00:03:13.860> behind<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.910> part<00:03:15.150> is

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
with the car park behind it the part is

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.960 
with the car park behind it the part is
just<00:03:15.330> there<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.560> right<00:03:16.830> around<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.910> corner

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
just there it's right around the corner

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.850 
just there it's right around the corner
when<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.750> on<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.930> map<00:03:19.080> you'll<00:03:19.290> you'll

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
when you see it on the map you'll you'll

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.210 
when you see it on the map you'll you'll
understand<00:03:20.610> why<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.530> we'll<00:03:22.680> zoom<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:23.100> again

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
understand why so we'll zoom in again

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.260 
understand why so we'll zoom in again
and<00:03:24.140> this<00:03:25.140> time<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.800> can<00:03:26.070> use<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.700> block<00:03:27.239> of

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
and this time you can use that block of

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.630 
and this time you can use that block of
squares<00:03:27.810> them<00:03:28.290> little<00:03:28.560> six<00:03:29.010> squares<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.550> you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
squares them little six squares to you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.030 
squares them little six squares to you
right<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.120> just<00:03:30.270> follow<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.750> half<00:03:31.040> like

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
right and then just follow the half like

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.650 
right and then just follow the half like
the<00:03:32.160> bottom<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:32.700> brolly<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.239> then<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.630> know

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
the bottom of a brolly and then you know

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.290 
the bottom of a brolly and then you know
that's<00:03:34.020> where<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.320> got<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.500> be<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.910> next<00:03:36.060> one

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
that's where you got to be the next one

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.910 
that's where you got to be the next one
is<00:03:36.540> up<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.080> roof<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.770> use<00:03:37.890> a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
is up on a roof so you can use a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.710 
is up on a roof so you can use a
helicopter<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.700> can<00:03:38.850> use<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> play<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.450> you

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
helicopter you can use a play and you

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.949 
helicopter you can use a play and you
can<00:03:39.870> use<00:03:40.580> parachute<00:03:41.580> anything<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.270> want<00:03:42.450> but

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
can use parachute anything you want but

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.110 
can use parachute anything you want but
I<00:03:43.020> had<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.380> blimp<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.280> thought<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.700> would<00:03:44.850> use

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
I had the blimp so I thought I would use

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.930 
I had the blimp so I thought I would use
the<00:03:45.270> blimp<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.080> jump<00:03:46.530> out<00:03:46.680> onto<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.520> empty

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
the blimp so jump out onto the empty

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.760 
the blimp so jump out onto the empty
swimming<00:03:48.120> pool<00:03:48.270> and<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:49.260> part<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.709> just

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
swimming pool and the part is just

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.220 
swimming pool and the part is just
around<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.670> corner<00:03:51.120> there<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.570> go<00:03:51.750> picked<00:03:52.110> it

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
around the corner there you go picked it

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.979 
around the corner there you go picked it
up<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:53.820> I'll<00:03:54.090> show<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.300> on<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.570> map<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:54.959> you

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
up and I'll show you on the map so you

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.490 
up and I'll show you on the map so you
can<00:03:55.230> see<00:03:55.410> what<00:03:55.650> building<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:57.350> if<00:03:58.350> you

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
can see what building it is if you

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.110 
can see what building it is if you
haven't<00:03:58.680> got<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:58.860> helicopter<00:03:59.130> skills<00:03:59.700> try<00:04:00.000> and

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
haven't got a helicopter skills try and

of the fourth part the medical one or
jump<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.470> this<00:04:04.590> one<00:04:04.800> straight<00:04:05.070> away<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.760> up

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
jump to this one straight away it's up

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.630 
jump to this one straight away it's up
to<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:07.230> can<00:04:07.410> zoom<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:07.950> zoom<00:04:07.980> out<00:04:08.430> and

to you so you can zoom in zoom out and

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.610 
to you so you can zoom in zoom out and
pick<00:04:08.910> whichever<00:04:09.300> bits<00:04:09.630> best<00:04:09.930> for<00:04:10.140> you<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.350> find

pick whichever bits best for you to find

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.830 
pick whichever bits best for you to find
it<00:04:10.800> now<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.489> next<00:04:11.640> one<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.300> on<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.630> golf

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
it now the next one is on the golf

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.630 
it now the next one is on the golf
course<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.350> big<00:04:13.560> golf<00:04:13.800> course<00:04:14.100> near<00:04:14.490> the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
course the big golf course near the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.320 
course the big golf course near the
middle<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.000> map

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
middle of the map

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.240 
middle of the map
and<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:16.110> can<00:04:16.260> use<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.590> same<00:04:16.769> bloom<00:04:17.040> for<00:04:17.220> a

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
and you can use the same bloom for a

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.490 
and you can use the same bloom for a
helicopter<00:04:17.430> just<00:04:18.420> to<00:04:18.630> save<00:04:18.870> yourself<00:04:19.260> getting

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
helicopter just to save yourself getting

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.620 
helicopter just to save yourself getting
in<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.950> pain<00:04:20.190> from<00:04:20.459> an<00:04:20.549> aircraft<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.420> then

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
in and pain from an aircraft and then

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.260 
in and pain from an aircraft and then
once<00:04:21.900> you've<00:04:22.049> landed<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.770> is<00:04:23.130> on<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> rock<00:04:23.910> in

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
once you've landed it is on a rock in

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.730 
once you've landed it is on a rock in
the<00:04:24.540> middle<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.920> bit<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.160> water<00:04:27.200> so<00:04:28.200> if<00:04:28.590> you

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
the middle of a bit of water so if you

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.020 
the middle of a bit of water so if you
just<00:04:28.890> head<00:04:29.100> around<00:04:29.310> i'll<00:04:29.520> show<00:04:29.730> you<00:04:29.790> on<00:04:29.940> the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
just head around i'll show you on the

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.910 
just head around i'll show you on the
map<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.420> can<00:04:30.630> see<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.650> it's

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
map so you can see and it's it's

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.010 
map so you can see and it's it's
basically<00:04:32.400> just<00:04:32.670> there<00:04:33.150> as<00:04:33.390> we<00:04:33.540> picked<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.930> up

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
basically just there as we picked it up

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.600 
basically just there as we picked it up
and<00:04:34.260> on<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.280> map<00:04:39.890> so<00:04:40.890> you<00:04:41.100> can<00:04:41.250> see<00:04:41.400> we're

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
and on the map so you can see we're

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.190 
and on the map so you can see we're
getting<00:04:41.700> higher<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.180> higher<00:04:42.450> up<00:04:42.900> them<00:04:43.050> up

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
getting higher and higher up them up

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.570 
getting higher and higher up them up
because<00:04:43.500> there'll<00:04:43.800> be<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.920> lot<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.130> stuff<00:04:44.370> near

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
because there'll be a lot of stuff near

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.490 
because there'll be a lot of stuff near
the<00:04:44.700> top<00:04:44.880> but<00:04:45.390> that's<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.720> giant<00:04:45.990> golf<00:04:46.170> course

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
the top but that's the giant golf course

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.980 
the top but that's the giant golf course
and<00:04:46.770> it's<00:04:46.890> right<00:04:47.220> on<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:48.150> water<00:04:48.360> on<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.780> left

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
and it's right on the water on the left

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.090 
and it's right on the water on the left
just<00:04:49.200> look<00:04:49.410> for<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.650> little<00:04:49.830> half

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
just look for that little half

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.190 
just look for that little half
semicircle<00:04:50.910> that's<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.810> best<00:04:51.960> way<00:04:52.170> of

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
semicircle that's the best way of

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.190 
semicircle that's the best way of
pinpointing<00:04:52.530> where<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.190> is<00:04:53.750> right<00:04:54.750> now<00:04:54.810> this

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
pinpointing where it is right now this

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.090 
pinpointing where it is right now this
part<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:57.080> didn't<00:04:58.080> get<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.500> video<00:04:58.770> right

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
part I is I didn't get the video right

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.120 
part I is I didn't get the video right
but<00:04:59.460> it's<00:04:59.640> basically<00:05:00.120> just<00:05:00.350> there<00:05:01.350> you<00:05:01.770> jump

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
but it's basically just there you jump

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.180 
but it's basically just there you jump
over<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.490> Ledge<00:05:02.760> into<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.750> sea<00:05:04.020> it's<00:05:04.740> in<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.950> dumb

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
over a Ledge into the sea it's in a dumb

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.070 
over a Ledge into the sea it's in a dumb
and<00:05:05.490> you'll<00:05:05.670> see<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.120> glowing<00:05:06.480> right<00:05:06.870> the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
and you'll see it glowing right the
