00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
works and the very last thing that we're

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
works and the very last thing that we're
gonna<00:01:17.580> add<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.150> some<00:01:18.180> sweetener<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.080> can

gonna add is some sweetener and you can

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
gonna add is some sweetener and you can
really<00:01:19.409> add<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.950> much<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> would<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.700> I'm

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
really add as much as you would like I'm

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.640 
really add as much as you would like I'm
probably<00:01:21.420> going<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> add<00:01:21.900> around<00:01:22.409> four

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
probably going to add around four

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.249 
probably going to add around four
tablespoons<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.299> Truvia<00:01:24.750> it's

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
tablespoons of this this is Truvia it's

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.510 
tablespoons of this this is Truvia it's
just<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> sweetener<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> use

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
just a sweetener that I like to use

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
just a sweetener that I like to use
because<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.390> tastes<00:01:27.659> more<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.869> sugar

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
because it tastes more like sugar

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.830 
because it tastes more like sugar
actually<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.009> after<00:01:30.000> you've<00:01:30.180> mixed<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
each one of these holes around 3/4 of

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.280 
each one of these holes around 3/4 of
the<00:01:41.310> way<00:01:41.430> full<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:42.450> we'll<00:01:42.600> put<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.200> the
