00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.809
 as we promised we are going to talk 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.599
 of the blue punctured this dollar parallel 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.210
 that is coming deflating and we are going to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.820
 explain what the causes are 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.980
 behind this one of this blue and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.020
 spiced of these last months first 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.250
 the controls in the city since 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 assumed the new president the bank 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.980
 central was reinforced what is the power of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.810
 police in the city raids 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 inspections suspensions this is a 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.739
 factor the other are dollar sales 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 savings of which we have already spoken in the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.989
 another program people are buying 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.989
 dollar to official price is turned around what 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.270
 sells this mechanism in the blues what 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.610
 does is to supply an offer to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.920
 parallel market and helps neutralize 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.020
 the demand for the blues then helps 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.760
 keep it quiet another factor 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 important are patches to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.559
 what are we talking about? 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.870
 towards the end of last year there was a 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.820
 injection of dollars very important in 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.129
 the coffers of the central bank that was this 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.439
 famous 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.270
 with China you should know about has already 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.460
 listened to talk a lot that is not another 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.619
 thing that a short-term loan that 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.170
 precisely allowed to increase the 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.689
 arcas make up a little and disguise 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.729
 how weakened they are is injection 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.860
 of dollars generated a confidence in the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.810
 market from which the power station was going to be able 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.210
 at least in the short term, piloting 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.130
 any exchange rate pressure that 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.770
 show up and that also helped 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.079
 keep the blues quiet the last the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.060
 weight absorption policy that is 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.990
 carrying forward the central bank that 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.270
 it is this 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.670
 the central as well as emits money to the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.459
 street also has a policy for 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.619
 remove dry the square and remove at least 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.630
 part of that surplus of pesos that walks 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.909
 spinning around and that tends to tip over 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
 dollar this year we saw the central bank 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.280
 very aggressive in what is this policy 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.649
 of weight absorption and that helped was 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.539
 key to the blues being so 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.399
 quiet now that I know what you want 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.049
 knowing is good but that's what happened 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.239
 what is coming is going to bounce the 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.849
 blues is going to return to the 16 pesos that 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:11.060
 it was half of last year well there 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.489
 three factors that allow 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.530
 risk speculating what we are going to do 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.599
 futurology but that allow to risk 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.520
 that there will be greater exchange pressure of 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.060
 here to the elections and that effectively 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.280
 the blues can bounce we have for a 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.260
 side that the little machine the little machine 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.660
 central bank the one that prints money is 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.760
 running at an electoral rhythm January 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.069
 February the central issued 22 thousand 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.500
 millions of pesos to help the treasure 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.349
 to finance the expense is more than 4 times 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.180
 what he had issued in 2014 this gives you 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.519
 an idea of ​​the level at which it is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.010
 running the machine are weights in the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.780
 street that will eventually go to the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.780
 blues and the dollar and they're going to put pressure 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.640
 in the quote the other data that we are going 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.410
 to develop a little more is Brazil 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.420
 Brazil is devaluing in a way 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.430
 brutal and is causing the delay 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.220
 Argentine exchange rate is totally in 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.680
 evidence with a still weight or that 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.709
 barely moving this will generate a lot 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.739
 pressure and finally we have yours the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.810
 trial no longer saves soybean worth 30% today 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.610
 less than a year ago despite the fact that 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.200
 harvest is going to be record they are going to enter 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.190
 much less commercial dollars of 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.690
 agro this year 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.040
 the business dollars are 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.590
 essential oil because you 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.630
 exchange market and gives the central a 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.150
 good handling of the equation 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.250
 - agricultural dollars plus exchange rate pressure 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.140
 We are going to come to the elections with a 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.140
 blue I think taller than I was
