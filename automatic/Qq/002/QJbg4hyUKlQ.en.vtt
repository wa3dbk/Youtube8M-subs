00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.259
 you've probably heard that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.180
 human being is destroying the environment 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.580
 environment and that everyone should do 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 something about already seen list of species 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.849
 threatened with extinction and forests 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.469
 are becoming smaller every day 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.480
 You probably think that too. 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.279
 is bad and what we really need to do 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 something about but what you maybe 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 do not know natural ecosystems as well 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.550
 save our money 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.630
 Do you have any idea how much the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.609
 environment 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.609
 in fact, it has a price 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.830
 we call environmental services or 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.810
 those ecosystem services that the 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.940
 environmentally friendly and 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.800
 which results in products for us by 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.720
 coral reefs are a source of 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.730
 tourism and creation they opened a 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.470
 enormous marine biodiversity is estimated 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.840
 which generate almost 30 billion dollars 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.160
 around the world in a direct way 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.500
 and indirect 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.270
 it is not easy to measure exactly how much 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
 money generated ecosystem 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.379
 for the world economy but perhaps the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.239
 The best way is to try to calculate how much 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.140
 money we would spend to replace something 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.060
 that the environment and produce 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.460
 spontaneously if he stopped 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.140
 produce that this process called 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.030
 environmental valuation 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.009
 if corals appeared on the coast 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
 Brazil would also disappear. 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.880
 variety of fish and 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 dependent on coral for their 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.759
 survival 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.649
 now instead of fishing for this fish 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.890
 eating we would have to breed in captivity 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.940
 these fish which is much more expensive 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.110
 probably the price of fish in the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.180
 and increase 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.220
 You'd think twice before asking. 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.080
 that woman in the restaurant in the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.600
 You do not even have to imagine the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.549
 disappearance of corals is something real 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.799
 which can be measured by scientists 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.110
 Brazil has the second largest barrier 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.180
 of the world and in the last 50 years 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 we lost about 80 percent of the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 reefs of the Brazilian coast 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.299
 another real example that illustrates this well 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.090
 occurred in China is a region called 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.890
 mal xian due to the use of pesticides and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.720
 deforestation of natural areas 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.119
 there was a drop in apple production 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.470
 this region because in an attempt to 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.540
 increase production farmers 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.610
 resulted in a reduction in the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.930
 animals that pollination of the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.759
 apple blossoms 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.009
 the result is that since the end 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.660
 from the 1980s to the present day 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.420
 region's apple need to hire 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.280
 people to do what previously 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.840
 animals did for free and with the price 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.730
 of this workforce has increased in 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.410
 over the last 30 years 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.299
 farmers turn to other 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.340
 crops such as plums and other fruits 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.090
 because the apple culture got very 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.010
 face 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.209
 those who can continue harvesting apple 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.160
 without spending so much 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.170
 only those whose lands are near 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.900
 areas where native vegetation is well 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.160
 preserved is the population of animals 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.709
 pollinators was not so reduced 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.480
 It is estimated that in the mid-2000s 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.609
 ecosystems have contributed and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.290
 plus $ 200 billion annually 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.060
 just pollinating 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.489
 the plantations of the whole world that 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.379
 more or less four times the GDP 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.569
 Guatemala in 2013 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.750
 it is difficult at first to think about putting a 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.700
 price in forests and seas and mountains 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.040
 but when we think about the lack they can 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.810
 doing this task becomes easier and 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.640
 so we also have a powerful argument 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.709
 for the conservation of natural resources 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.959
 in a language that everyone can 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.700
 understand more easily into the forest 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.920
 has a different cost because expensive 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.989
 forest is unique and can affect 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.700
 drastically our ability to 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.069
 produce cheaper food for the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.439
 population and other products 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.700
