00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.880
 thank you very much in the president sir 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.589
 president would like to start talking about 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.180
 where we are at this moment with the 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.650
 immigration reform 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.289
 you said at the beginning of this week 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.029
 that there has been progress however has 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.650
 resurfaced the old dispute between the 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.900
 union and business sector 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.270
 specifically about salaries and 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.340
 guest worker program a 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.070
 dispute that could endanger the 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.910
 immigration reform would mediate you in 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.900
 this good dispute no I'm not of 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.610
 agreement that this threatens to put in 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.280
 danger the project that we have seen great 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.560
 progress in the last month and a half I would 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.090
 I feel very optimistic that once I 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.760
 they return in early April 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.739
 we have a bill ready to 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.620
 go through the process 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.010
 you know there are still certain areas like this 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.370
 that you mentioned about the future flow 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.680
 of guest workers and workers 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.450
 and business may not always be 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.010
 agree on how to do it but this 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.360
 it's something that can be solved but what 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.009
 most important however is that 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.200
 we are living a very committed 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.030
 strong to finally solve this 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.220
 problem 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.530
 prepared to teach and show it 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.350
 I do not think we're going to get to that, I think 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.350
 that there is an agreement in democratic texts 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.820
 and republicans to pass this then 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.440
 you believe that the business sector and 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.979
 union if they can resolve their 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.979
 differences 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.220
 ideally so that the 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.460
 immigration reform when it would have to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.369
 be on your desk the proposal 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.409
 you know I'm not going to walk on a date 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.119
 specific but so far at least 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:42.009
 we have seen a progress framed but 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.990
 It would be in the summer at the end of the year 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.570
 you know how the process works 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.110
 legislative 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.020
 and I tell you that if we have a project of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.390
 law presented at the beginning of next 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.490
 month as these senators indicated they 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.120
 will do then I'm sure you can 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.010
 achieve before the end of summer as soon as 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.540
 to the road to achieve citizenship there are 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.670
 worry because there is talk that 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.890
 it could take 13 years even for 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.740
 who are from countries like mexico and the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.930
 savior could take 20 not that's a 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.380
 very long time 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.459
 well we do not know yet what 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.470
 aspect keep this bill 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.930
 so I'm going to have to guess but 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.860
 However, what I do know is that if 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.440
 we have a more intelligent system more 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.810
 delineated more fair of immigration with 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.330
 an easier verification process is 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.580
 reduces waiting and bureaucracy 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.410
 then we can sanction us that 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.630
 those who are already waiting for 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.550
 will process more quickly those 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.870
 people who are not currently 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.459
 documented that you live in this country 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.280
 have to go to the end of the row of the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.110
 tail but those in front are going to go 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.520
 fastest department officials 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.100
 state indicates 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.990
 There has been great progress in Latin America 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.320
 however there are governments in this region 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.220
 that they consider are not a priority 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:08.000
 for good eeuu 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.410
 I am really looking forward to it coming 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.040
 the opportunity to visit Mexico 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.930
 I'll be there in May the relationship will 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.050
 describes as only a relationship of 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.820
 borders or only on cartels of 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.090
 drugs but the relationship goes much more 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.040
 there with respect to trade 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.660
 energy exchange I'm also going to travel 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.290
 to costa rica to meet with the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.850
 leaders of all Central America because one 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.520
 of the most important issues that 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.770
 we can do to strengthen 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.270
 the hemisphere is to strengthen the 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.020
 cooperation and internal others and our 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.020
 partners from the Caribbean and Central America
