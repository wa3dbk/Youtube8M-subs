out it's got a one-year warranty pretty
cool<00:02:07.429> memory<00:02:08.429> itself<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> hunt<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.229> mean

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
cool memory itself is the a hunt I mean

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.050 
cool memory itself is the a hunt I mean
it's<00:02:10.530> got<00:02:10.649> eight<00:02:10.830> gigabytes<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.550> memory<00:02:11.610> so

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
it's got eight gigabytes of memory so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
it's got eight gigabytes of memory so
that's<00:02:12.209> pretty<00:02:12.360> good<00:02:12.569> basically<00:02:13.170> this

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
is the equivalent of a tower PC it's for

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.020 
is the equivalent of a tower PC it's for
gaming<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.190> graphics<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:18.850> really<00:02:19.090> nice

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
gaming and graphics it's really nice

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.220 
gaming and graphics it's really nice
yeah<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:22.210> got<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.330> really<00:02:22.570> big<00:02:22.720> screen<00:02:22.930> that's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
yeah it's got a really big screen that's

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.740 
yeah it's got a really big screen that's
really<00:02:23.470> slim<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.580> don't<00:02:24.940> know<00:02:25.030> about<00:02:25.180> you

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
really slim and I don't know about you

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.900 
really slim and I don't know about you
guys<00:02:25.960> but<00:02:26.290> I've<00:02:26.530> seen<00:02:26.770> past<00:02:27.040> laptops<00:02:27.610> where

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
guys but I've seen past laptops where

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.460 
guys but I've seen past laptops where
like<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.480> where<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.750> battery<00:02:28.930> pack<00:02:29.260> is

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
like this is where the battery pack is

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.470 
like this is where the battery pack is
you're<00:02:30.130> not<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:30.370> sticks<00:02:30.730> out<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> lot<00:02:31.240> this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
you're not like sticks out a lot this

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.300 
you're not like sticks out a lot this
this<00:02:31.780> basically<00:02:32.170> goes<00:02:32.440> right<00:02:32.770> in<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> back

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
this basically goes right in the back

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.700 
this basically goes right in the back
here<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.780> doesn't<00:02:35.140> stick<00:02:35.350> out<00:02:35.470> any

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
here so it it doesn't stick out any

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.980 
here so it it doesn't stick out any
farther<00:02:36.040> than<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.490> laptop<00:02:36.700> itself<00:02:37.330> opening

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
farther than the laptop itself opening

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.950 
farther than the laptop itself opening
so<00:02:38.440> that's<00:02:39.250> really<00:02:39.490> really<00:02:40.030> nice<00:02:40.240> cuz<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.750> just

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
so that's really really nice cuz it just

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.750 
so that's really really nice cuz it just
it<00:02:41.230> just<00:02:41.290> matches<00:02:41.770> more<00:02:42.040> compact<00:02:42.490> that<00:02:42.670> way

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
it just matches more compact that way

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.950 
it just matches more compact that way
and<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.030> really<00:02:43.150> thin<00:02:43.450> too<00:02:43.630> when<00:02:43.840> it's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
and it's really thin too when it's

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.000 
and it's really thin too when it's
closed<00:02:44.230> shall<00:02:45.160> show<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:47.500> then<00:02:47.800> that's

adjusting<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.270> I've<00:03:38.420> only<00:03:38.570> had<00:03:38.750> this

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
adjusting to that I've only had this

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.990 
adjusting to that I've only had this
computer<00:03:39.290> since<00:03:39.440> Christmas<00:03:39.890> so<00:03:40.550> excuse<00:03:40.970> that

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
computer since Christmas so excuse that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.720 
computer since Christmas so excuse that
the<00:03:41.960> caps<00:03:42.140> lock<00:03:42.230> was<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:42.740> so<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.280> that's<00:03:43.460> why<00:03:43.580> my

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
the caps lock was on so it that's why my

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.990 
the caps lock was on so it that's why my
password<00:03:44.090> wasn't<00:03:44.270> right<00:03:45.640> basically<00:03:46.640> I

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
password wasn't right basically I

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.660 
password wasn't right basically I
figured<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.810> how<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:48.140> can<00:03:48.410> tell<00:03:48.670> see

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
figured this is how you can tell see

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.730 
figured this is how you can tell see
cats<00:03:50.000> lock<00:03:50.180> on<00:03:50.330> caps<00:03:50.630> lock<00:03:50.810> off<00:03:51.050> cats<00:03:51.290> ah<00:03:51.440> yeah

cats lock on caps lock off cats ah yeah

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.170 
cats lock on caps lock off cats ah yeah
you<00:03:52.010> know<00:03:52.100> but<00:03:52.340> it's<00:03:52.550> like<00:03:52.670> it's<00:03:52.880> really<00:03:53.000> hard

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
you know but it's like it's really hard

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.400 
you know but it's like it's really hard
to<00:03:53.360> see<00:03:53.510> when<00:03:53.660> you're<00:03:53.780> looking<00:03:53.900> at<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:54.170> screen

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
to see when you're looking at the screen

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.920 
to see when you're looking at the screen
yeah<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.550> is<00:03:55.670> basically<00:03:55.970> my<00:03:56.060> perspective<00:03:56.780> so

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
yeah this is basically my perspective so

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.480 
yeah this is basically my perspective so
that's<00:03:57.080> kind<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.320> just<00:03:57.470> out<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.740> way<00:03:57.860> but

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
that's kind of just out of the way but

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.260 
that's kind of just out of the way but
um<00:03:59.380> yes<00:04:00.380> so<00:04:00.410> that's<00:04:01.310> one<00:04:01.580> thing<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:01.940> don't

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
um yes so that's one thing I don't

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.110 
um yes so that's one thing I don't
really<00:04:02.420> like<00:04:02.750> there's<00:04:03.290> no<00:04:03.560> way<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.310> turn<00:04:04.970> down

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
really like there's no way to turn down

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.930 
really like there's no way to turn down
the<00:04:05.300> volume<00:04:05.330> in<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:06.290> fast<00:04:07.250> manner<00:04:07.430> if<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:07.820> were

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
the volume in a fast manner if you were

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.570 
the volume in a fast manner if you were
to<00:04:08.060> need<00:04:08.240> to<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:09.410> doesn't<00:04:09.620> have<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:09.860> scroll<00:04:10.250> a

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
to need to it doesn't have a scroll a

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.640 
to need to it doesn't have a scroll a
scroller<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.600> you<00:04:11.690> can<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:12.020> turn<00:04:12.440> on<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
scroller so you can just turn on the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.530 
scroller so you can just turn on the
volume<00:04:12.830> turn<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.310> up<00:04:13.400> or<00:04:13.550> down<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.880> will<00:04:14.060> you

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
volume turn it up or down it will you

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.500 
volume turn it up or down it will you
kind<00:04:14.870> of<00:04:14.930> have<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.290> go<00:04:15.410> adjust<00:04:15.740> it<00:04:15.860> yourself

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
kind of have to go adjust it yourself

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.910 
kind of have to go adjust it yourself
unless<00:04:17.510> there's<00:04:17.750> some<00:04:17.959> way<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.170> haven't<00:04:18.560> seen

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
unless there's some way I haven't seen

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.590 
unless there's some way I haven't seen
yet<00:04:19.100> which<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.580> don't<00:04:19.970> think<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:20.330> because<00:04:20.420> I

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
yet which I don't think so because I

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.970 
yet which I don't think so because I
gave<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:20.900> computer<00:04:21.440> pretty<00:04:21.650> good<00:04:21.830> luck<00:04:22.100> over

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
gave this computer pretty good luck over

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.770 
gave this computer pretty good luck over
it<00:04:24.980> does<00:04:25.160> have<00:04:25.340> these<00:04:25.520> buttons<00:04:25.730> here<00:04:26.210> but<00:04:26.660> they

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
it does have these buttons here but they

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.600 
it does have these buttons here but they
don't<00:04:26.990> they<00:04:27.200> don't<00:04:27.440> seem<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.710> work<00:04:28.010> which<00:04:28.460> is

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
don't they don't seem to work which is

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.240 
don't they don't seem to work which is
weird

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
weird

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
weird
yeah<00:04:31.250> that's<00:04:31.430> one<00:04:31.550> thing<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:31.820> speaking<00:04:32.180> of

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
yeah that's one thing and speaking of

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.710 
yeah that's one thing and speaking of
the<00:04:32.360> volume<00:04:32.750> for<00:04:32.990> some<00:04:33.140> reason<00:04:34.510> okay<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.540> don't

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
the volume for some reason okay I don't

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.780 
the volume for some reason okay I don't
really<00:04:35.840> want<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.050> do<00:04:36.169> this<00:04:36.290> but<00:04:36.800> uh<00:04:36.860> the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
really want to do this but uh the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.760 
really want to do this but uh the
speakers<00:04:38.150> are<00:04:38.270> on<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.450> bottom<00:04:38.630> here<00:04:39.050> there's

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
speakers are on the bottom here there's

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.620 
speakers are on the bottom here there's
two<00:04:39.919> speakers<00:04:40.280> ones<00:04:40.700> right<00:04:40.970> here<00:04:41.000> ones<00:04:41.419> right

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
two speakers ones right here ones right

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.900 
two speakers ones right here ones right
here<00:04:41.870> so<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.530> volume<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.040> not<00:04:43.340> coming<00:04:43.730> through

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
here so the volume is not coming through

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.490 
here so the volume is not coming through
here<00:04:44.120> at<00:04:44.390> all

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
here at all

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.130 
here at all
I<00:04:45.700> can<00:04:46.700> probably<00:04:46.970> demonstrate<00:04:47.690> that<00:04:47.810> for<00:04:47.870> you

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
I can probably demonstrate that for you

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.810 
I can probably demonstrate that for you
if<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.800> give<00:04:48.980> me<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.160> second<00:04:49.610> we're<00:04:49.760> gonna

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
if you give me a second we're gonna

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.700 
if you give me a second we're gonna
listen<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.210> blaster

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.439 

you<00:04:55.710> can<00:04:55.860> hear<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:56.129> sound<00:04:56.370> coming<00:04:56.610> out<00:04:56.819> down

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
you can hear the sound coming out down

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.939 
you can hear the sound coming out down
there<00:04:58.879> and<00:04:59.879> when<00:05:00.000> it's<00:05:00.120> on<00:05:00.210> your<00:05:00.240> lap<00:05:00.949> that

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
there and when it's on your lap that

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.640 
there and when it's on your lap that
really<00:05:02.699> kills<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.060> sound<00:05:03.360> like<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:04.229> really

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
really kills the sound like that really

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.740 
really kills the sound like that really
kills<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.039> sound<00:05:07.250> yeah<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.280> just<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.789> it<00:05:09.539> just

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
kills the sound yeah I just it it just

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.270 
kills the sound yeah I just it it just
kind<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:10.020> makes<00:05:10.199> it<00:05:10.319> really<00:05:10.560> damp<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.039> lower

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
kind of makes it really damp and lower

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.950 
kind of makes it really damp and lower
there's<00:05:11.639> nothing<00:05:11.970> there's<00:05:12.180> no<00:05:12.270> power<00:05:12.509> to<00:05:12.780> it

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
there's nothing there's no power to it

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.200 
there's nothing there's no power to it
whereas<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.919> laptop<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.430> has<00:05:14.699> speakers<00:05:15.030> up

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
whereas a laptop that has speakers up

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.909 
whereas a laptop that has speakers up
here<00:05:15.240> which<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:15.930> kind<00:05:16.229> of<00:05:16.289> be<00:05:16.379> blasting<00:05:16.830> at

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
here which is kind of be blasting at

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.830 
here which is kind of be blasting at
your<00:05:17.099> face<00:05:17.310> I<00:05:17.550> think<00:05:17.879> I<00:05:18.210> think<00:05:18.419> they<00:05:18.539> came<00:05:18.720> out

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
your face I think I think they came out

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.270 
your face I think I think they came out
with<00:05:19.050> an<00:05:19.199> idea<00:05:19.289> that<00:05:19.530> they<00:05:19.770> thought<00:05:20.009> you<00:05:20.190> know

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
with an idea that they thought you know

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.010 
with an idea that they thought you know
there's<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:20.610> like<00:05:20.819> you<00:05:21.509> know<00:05:21.599> right<00:05:21.810> here

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
there's this like you know right here

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.180 
there's this like you know right here
this<00:05:22.139> would<00:05:22.259> be<00:05:22.289> your<00:05:22.470> legs<00:05:22.680> this<00:05:22.949> would<00:05:23.099> be

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
this would be your legs this would be

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.499 
this would be your legs this would be
the<00:05:23.280> opening<00:05:23.610> in<00:05:23.699> your<00:05:23.729> legs<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.300> was<00:05:24.389> just

the opening in your legs and it was just

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.510 
the opening in your legs and it was just
kind<00:05:24.629> of<00:05:24.780> come<00:05:24.990> through<00:05:25.370> actually<00:05:26.370> because

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
kind of come through actually because

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.279 
kind of come through actually because
