so<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.009> anchors<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> side<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.000> there

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
so your anchors on the side just there

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.649 
so your anchors on the side just there
interact<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:35.210> interact<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> there

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
interact with it interact with it there

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.870 
interact with it interact with it there
we<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.740> anchor<00:01:37.950> drops<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
we go and your anchor drops down and you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.700 
we go and your anchor drops down and you
won't<00:01:39.600> move<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.650> yeah<00:01:42.079> here<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.350> climb<00:01:43.530> up

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
won't move so yeah here you can climb up

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
won't move so yeah here you can climb up
the<00:01:43.829> sail<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> climb<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> little

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the sail you have to climb up a little

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.800 
the sail you have to climb up a little
bit<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> interact<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.829> them<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.329> fill<00:01:48.329> /

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
bit and interact with them to fill /

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
bit and interact with them to fill /
unfurl<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> sails<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.009> when<00:01:50.790> they're<00:01:51.030> up

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
unfurl the sails and when they're up

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.850 
unfurl the sails and when they're up
like<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> you're<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.530> able<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
like that you're not going to be able to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.580 
like that you're not going to be able to
move<00:01:53.610> anywhere<00:01:54.030> oh<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:54.960> quickly<00:01:55.259> anyway

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
move anywhere oh not very quickly anyway

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.780 
move anywhere oh not very quickly anyway
so<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> same<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.270> one

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
so you can do the same with this one

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.850 
so you can do the same with this one
and<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.180> gets<00:02:00.329> rid<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.570> them<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.680> that's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and it just gets rid of them so that's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.170 
and it just gets rid of them so that's
that's<00:02:02.100> pretty<00:02:02.250> cool<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.700> each<00:02:02.790> -<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> think

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that's pretty cool for each - I think

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.480 
that's pretty cool for each - I think
but<00:02:03.990> I'll<00:02:04.200> show<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> all<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> top<00:02:05.280> where

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
but I'll show you all out the top where

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.850 
but I'll show you all out the top where
the<00:02:05.520> radar<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.500> take<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the radar is so when you do take the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.020 
the radar is so when you do take the
boat<00:02:08.069> out<00:02:08.099> you're<00:02:08.550> always<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
boat out you're always going to have the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.940 
boat out you're always going to have the
owner<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.479> helm<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.619> case<00:02:10.800> is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
owner on the helm which in this case is

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.500 
owner on the helm which in this case is
my<00:02:11.069> ship<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.459> generally<00:02:11.760> you'd<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:12.060> me<00:02:12.360> at

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
my ship so generally you'd have me at

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.670 
my ship so generally you'd have me at
the<00:02:12.599> helm<00:02:12.810> because

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the helm because

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.020 
the helm because
the<00:02:13.890> owner<00:02:14.040> does<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.430> its<00:02:14.549> own<00:02:14.640> special

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
the owner does have its own special

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.309 
the owner does have its own special
ability<00:02:15.359> to<00:02:15.420> stop<00:02:15.569> people<00:02:15.689> from<00:02:15.840> getting<00:02:16.200> on

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
ability to stop people from getting on

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.080 
ability to stop people from getting on
the<00:02:16.349> ship<00:02:16.469> so<00:02:17.010> you're<00:02:17.640> gonna<00:02:17.730> want<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.000> have

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the ship so you're gonna want to have

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.119 
the ship so you're gonna want to have
the<00:02:18.180> owner<00:02:18.329> on<00:02:18.659> there<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.530> helm<00:02:19.709> most<00:02:20.010> of

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
the owner on there on the helm most of

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.099 
the owner on there on the helm most of
the<00:02:20.219> time<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.640> have<00:02:21.090> someone<00:02:21.359> else<00:02:21.390> or<00:02:21.629> up

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
the time and have someone else or up

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.140 
the time and have someone else or up
here<00:02:22.560> you're<00:02:23.040> probably<00:02:23.459> gonna<00:02:23.700> want<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:23.969> be<00:02:24.060> on

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
here you're probably gonna want to be on

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.360 
here you're probably gonna want to be on
voice<00:02:24.329> comms<00:02:24.719> like<00:02:24.989> ten<00:02:25.230> feet<00:02:25.409> very<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.189> know

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
voice comms like ten feet very you know

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.369 
voice comms like ten feet very you know
very<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.299> know<00:02:27.420> Skype<00:02:27.780> whatever<00:02:28.140> something

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
very you know Skype whatever something

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.030 
very you know Skype whatever something
like<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.859> just<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.939> can<00:02:31.010> give<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
like that just so that you can give a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.970 
like that just so that you can give a
bit<00:02:32.280> more<00:02:32.310> precise<00:02:32.879> location<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.139> other<00:02:34.650> ships

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
bit more precise location of other ships

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.559 
bit more precise location of other ships
so<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.579> can<00:02:35.670> see<00:02:35.790> another<00:02:36.000> ship<00:02:36.239> just<00:02:36.389> went

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
so you can see another ship just went

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.000 
so you can see another ship just went
past<00:02:36.780> there<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.739> get<00:02:37.859> on<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.069> station

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
past there but you get on the station

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.550 
past there but you get on the station
can't<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.340> used<00:02:41.639> while<00:02:41.909> stunned<00:02:42.560> okay

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
can't be used while stunned okay

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.670 
can't be used while stunned okay
apparently<00:02:43.859> I<00:02:44.099> am<00:02:44.219> stunned<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.909> don't<00:02:45.560> think<00:02:46.560> I

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
apparently I am stunned I don't think I

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.879 
apparently I am stunned I don't think I
am<00:02:46.859> but<00:02:48.470> no<00:02:49.470> okay<00:02:50.389> okay<00:02:51.389> so<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.049> had<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.319> resub<00:02:52.799> of

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
am but no okay okay so I had to resub of

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.289 
am but no okay okay so I had to resub of
the<00:02:52.980> ship<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.400> don't<00:02:53.579> know<00:02:53.700> what<00:02:53.849> was<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.209> on

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
the ship I don't know what was going on

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.909 
the ship I don't know what was going on
there<00:02:54.510> about<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.780> stun<00:02:55.019> thing<00:02:55.349> I've<00:02:55.560> haven't

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
there about the stun thing I've haven't

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.860 
there about the stun thing I've haven't
had<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.069> before<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:56.609> anyways<00:02:57.239> back<00:02:57.480> into<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
had that before but anyways back into it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.690 
had that before but anyways back into it
so<00:02:58.109> you<00:02:58.169> just<00:02:58.349> jump<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:58.859> the<00:02:58.980> station<00:02:59.459> there

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
so you just jump on the station there

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.199 
so you just jump on the station there
onto<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.120> radar<00:03:00.389> hit<00:03:00.840> R<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.489> then<00:03:02.489> hit<00:03:03.000> M

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
onto the radar hit R and then hit M

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.089 
onto the radar hit R and then hit M
obviously<00:03:03.780> bring<00:03:03.930> up<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.109> map<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.859> shows

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
obviously bring up the map and it shows

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.649 
obviously bring up the map and it shows
you<00:03:05.219> an<00:03:05.310> area<00:03:05.579> around<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.299> shows<00:03:06.450> all

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
you an area around you and it shows all

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.959 
you an area around you and it shows all
the<00:03:06.810> ships<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.260> area<00:03:07.829> so<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.669> see

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:08.969 
the ships in that area so you can see

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.149 
the ships in that area so you can see
the<00:03:09.150> type<00:03:09.389> of<00:03:09.419> ship<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.959> owner<00:03:10.169> and<00:03:10.620> how<00:03:11.010> much

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
the type of ship the owner and how much

the<00:04:41.580> abilities<00:04:42.240> here<00:04:42.719> as<00:04:42.810> well<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.199> obviously

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
the abilities here as well so obviously

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.529 
the abilities here as well so obviously
you've<00:04:44.099> got<00:04:44.219> the<00:04:44.310> owners<00:04:44.610> mark<00:04:44.939> which<00:04:45.210> allows

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
you've got the owners mark which allows

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.300 
you've got the owners mark which allows
only<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.960> owner<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.379> border<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.830> prevents

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
only the owner to border and prevents

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.679 
only the owner to border and prevents
additional<00:04:47.699> passengers<00:04:48.060> from<00:04:48.150> boarding<00:04:48.509> for

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:48.689 
additional passengers from boarding for

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.540 
additional passengers from boarding for
a<00:04:48.719> minute<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.050> 30<00:04:49.229> seconds<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.099> you<00:04:50.189> want<00:04:50.430> to

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
a minute and 30 seconds so you want to

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.920 
a minute and 30 seconds so you want to
keep<00:04:50.669> that<00:04:50.819> up<00:04:51.000> all<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.360> time<00:04:51.569> because<00:04:51.840> it

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
keep that up all the time because it

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.700 
keep that up all the time because it
doesn't<00:04:52.050> have<00:04:52.259> a<00:04:52.289> cool-down

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
doesn't have a cool-down

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.619 
doesn't have a cool-down
same<00:04:53.580> with<00:04:53.759> this<00:04:53.969> one<00:04:54.180> which<00:04:54.389> is<00:04:54.419> the

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
same with this one which is the

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.510 
same with this one which is the
captain's<00:04:54.960> intuition<00:04:55.469> greatly<00:04:56.129> increases

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
captain's intuition greatly increases

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.339 
captain's intuition greatly increases
evasion<00:04:57.000> whilst<00:04:57.150> viewing<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.479> ship<00:04:57.719> so<00:04:58.319> you

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
evasion whilst viewing the ship so you

00:04:58.349 --> 00:04:59.959 
evasion whilst viewing the ship so you
want<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.740> keep<00:04:58.889> that<00:04:59.069> on<00:04:59.129> and<00:04:59.520> you<00:04:59.729> can<00:04:59.849> see

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
want to keep that on and you can see

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.159 
want to keep that on and you can see
this<00:05:00.060> little<00:05:00.240> passive<00:05:00.569> there<00:05:00.719> it<00:05:00.810> makes<00:05:00.990> it<00:05:01.080> a

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
this little passive there it makes it a

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.570 
this little passive there it makes it a
lot<00:05:01.289> harder<00:05:01.349> for<00:05:01.650> things<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:02.069> hit<00:05:02.219> you

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
lot harder for things to hit you

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.180 
lot harder for things to hit you
this<00:05:03.030> ability<00:05:03.300> stops<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.289> gliders<00:05:05.069> from

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
this ability stops the gliders from

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.770 
this ability stops the gliders from
coming<00:05:05.520> in<00:05:05.699> so<00:05:06.150> as<00:05:06.330> long<00:05:06.419> as<00:05:06.539> you're<00:05:06.659> at<00:05:06.719> the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
coming in so as long as you're at the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.140 
coming in so as long as you're at the
helm<00:05:06.990> I<00:05:07.289> think<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.680> lasts<00:05:08.159> two<00:05:08.580> minutes<00:05:08.969> I

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
helm I think it lasts two minutes I

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.570 
helm I think it lasts two minutes I
believe<00:05:09.180> it<00:05:09.479> is<00:05:09.860> yes<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:11.009> lasts<00:05:11.159> two<00:05:11.310> minutes

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
believe it is yes it lasts two minutes

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.010 
believe it is yes it lasts two minutes
and<00:05:11.729> yeah<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.210> just<00:05:12.360> stops<00:05:12.569> gliders<00:05:12.900> from

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
and yeah it just stops gliders from

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.080 
and yeah it just stops gliders from
coming<00:05:13.289> in<00:05:13.409> just<00:05:13.590> pushes<00:05:13.889> him<00:05:14.039> back<00:05:14.069> so<00:05:14.610> that's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
coming in just pushes him back so that's

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.490 
coming in just pushes him back so that's
illegal<00:05:15.330> by<00:05:15.569> the<00:05:15.599> means<00:05:15.840> they<00:05:16.020> have<00:05:16.169> to<00:05:16.289> swim

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
illegal by the means they have to swim

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.830 
illegal by the means they have to swim
onto<00:05:16.710> your<00:05:16.830> ship<00:05:17.039> and<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.310> way<00:05:17.849> you<00:05:17.909> can<00:05:18.240> you

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
onto your ship and that way you can you

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.379 
onto your ship and that way you can you
can<00:05:19.020> find<00:05:19.259> them<00:05:19.379> a<00:05:19.440> lot<00:05:19.560> easier<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:21.060> one<00:05:21.270> you

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
can find them a lot easier this one you

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.999 
can find them a lot easier this one you
have<00:05:21.509> a<00:05:21.539> charge<00:05:21.840> last<00:05:22.349> two<00:05:22.590> minutes<00:05:22.889> it<00:05:22.979> just

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
have a charge last two minutes it just

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.040 
have a charge last two minutes it just
makes<00:05:23.250> you<00:05:23.340> ship<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.610> bit<00:05:23.759> faster<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.389> this<00:05:24.900> one

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
makes you ship a bit faster and this one

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.570 
makes you ship a bit faster and this one
makes<00:05:25.229> you<00:05:25.349> ship<00:05:25.529> a<00:05:25.650> bit<00:05:25.800> more<00:05:25.919> maneuverable

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
makes you ship a bit more maneuverable

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.600 
makes you ship a bit more maneuverable
for<00:05:27.210> six<00:05:27.900> seconds<00:05:28.379> so<00:05:28.889> that's<00:05:29.159> pretty<00:05:29.400> good

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
for six seconds so that's pretty good

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.950 
for six seconds so that's pretty good
too<00:05:29.819> if<00:05:30.000> you're<00:05:30.180> in<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.270> tight<00:05:30.449> spot<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.810> you

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
too if you're in a tight spot and you

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.830 
too if you're in a tight spot and you
need<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.169> turn<00:05:31.379> around<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:33.150> last<00:05:33.509> one<00:05:33.719> you

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
need to turn around this last one you

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.990 
need to turn around this last one you
actually<00:05:33.990> need<00:05:34.500> an<00:05:34.710> item<00:05:35.099> to<00:05:35.250> be<00:05:35.370> able<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.610> cast

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
actually need an item to be able to cast

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.390 
actually need an item to be able to cast
so<00:05:36.779> I<00:05:36.810> haven't<00:05:37.379> actually<00:05:37.560> used<00:05:37.710> it<00:05:38.069> yet<00:05:38.190> but<00:05:38.340> it

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
so I haven't actually used it yet but it

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.550 
so I haven't actually used it yet but it
increases<00:05:38.699> a<00:05:39.029> ship's<00:05:39.629> maximum<00:05:40.080> moves<00:05:40.319> beat

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
increases a ship's maximum moves beat

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.010 
increases a ship's maximum moves beat
for<00:05:40.889> 10<00:05:41.099> minutes<00:05:41.490> requires<00:05:42.210> 10<00:05:42.539> meteor

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
for 10 minutes requires 10 meteor

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.329 
for 10 minutes requires 10 meteor
showers<00:05:43.440> so<00:05:43.589> I'm<00:05:43.650> not<00:05:43.740> really<00:05:43.889> sure<00:05:44.099> those

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339 
showers so I'm not really sure those

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.820 
showers so I'm not really sure those
items<00:05:44.639> are<00:05:44.819> but<00:05:45.449> increasing<00:05:46.139> the<00:05:46.319> most<00:05:46.620> speed

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
items are but increasing the most speed

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.129 
items are but increasing the most speed
for<00:05:46.979> 10<00:05:47.159> minutes<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.520> pretty<00:05:47.849> huge<00:05:48.060> so<00:05:48.449> if<00:05:48.719> you

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
for 10 minutes is pretty huge so if you

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.390 
for 10 minutes is pretty huge so if you
do<00:05:49.379> take<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:49.589> out<00:05:49.800> a<00:05:49.830> lot<00:05:50.039> and<00:05:50.129> you've<00:05:50.250> got<00:05:50.370> a

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
do take it out a lot and you've got a

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.829 
do take it out a lot and you've got a
big<00:05:50.550> crew<00:05:50.759> I<00:05:50.969> definitely<00:05:51.300> recommend<00:05:51.509> picking

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
big crew I definitely recommend picking

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.110 
big crew I definitely recommend picking
that<00:05:52.080> one<00:05:52.199> up<00:05:52.409> and<00:05:52.740> giving<00:05:53.099> it<00:05:53.190> a<00:05:53.250> go<00:05:53.400> but<00:05:53.849> thank

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
that one up and giving it a go but thank

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.279

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.820 
you enjoyed this and it helps you get an
idea<00:05:57.629> if<00:05:57.750> you<00:05:57.810> want<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.050> buy<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.229> galleon<00:05:58.710> or

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
idea if you want to buy the galleon or

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.950 
idea if you want to buy the galleon or
not<00:05:59.039> yourself<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.819> definitely<00:06:00.419> recommend<00:06:00.690> it

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
not yourself I definitely recommend it

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.140 
not yourself I definitely recommend it
though<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.379> have<00:06:01.710> had<00:06:01.919> a<00:06:01.979> lot<00:06:02.219> of<00:06:02.250> fun<00:06:02.520> on<00:06:02.729> it<00:06:02.789> and

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
though I have had a lot of fun on it and

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.879 
though I have had a lot of fun on it and
even<00:06:03.330> had<00:06:03.539> it<00:06:03.659> stolen<00:06:03.870> a<00:06:04.080> couple<00:06:04.199> times<00:06:04.560> but

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889
