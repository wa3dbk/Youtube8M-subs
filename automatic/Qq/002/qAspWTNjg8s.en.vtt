00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.740 

but<00:00:37.840> seriously<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:39.460> thing<00:00:39.670> with<00:00:39.879> Mike<00:00:40.510> being

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750

but I think we need to build the boat

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.700 
but I think we need to build the boat
first<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.180> making<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.660> major<00:00:43.930> fight<00:00:44.320> because

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
first and making a major fight because

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.580 
first and making a major fight because
they're<00:00:44.860> both<00:00:45.040> great<00:00:45.280> fighters<00:00:45.820> so<00:00:46.590> build

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
they're both great fighters so build

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.979 
they're both great fighters so build
them<00:00:47.860> you<00:00:48.579> know<00:00:48.699> build<00:00:48.970> your<00:00:49.090> demand<00:00:49.449> and<00:00:49.780> then

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
them you know build your demand and then

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.790 
them you know build your demand and then
fight<00:00:50.290> don't<00:00:50.800> let<00:00:50.949> it<00:00:50.980> go<00:00:51.399> by<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.670> wayside

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
fight don't let it go by the wayside

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.439

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
there were some talks before this fight

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
think HBO offer gamble so they wanted a

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.749 
think HBO offer gamble so they wanted a
bigger<00:01:05.649> fight<00:01:06.130> for<00:01:07.060> for<00:01:07.570> HBO<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.680> they<00:01:09.580> offer

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
bigger fight for for HBO so they offer

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.660 
bigger fight for for HBO so they offer
gamble<00:01:10.330> i<00:01:10.360> mean<00:01:10.690> we<00:01:10.810> actually<00:01:11.340> tried<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.369> get

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
gamble i mean we actually tried to get

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.609 
gamble i mean we actually tried to get
gamble<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.090> couple<00:01:13.420> times<00:01:13.570> before<00:01:13.720> he<00:01:14.110> said<00:01:14.350> no

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
gamble a couple times before he said no

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.749 
gamble a couple times before he said no
so<00:01:15.460> this<00:01:15.640> time<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.060> say<00:01:16.240> yeah<00:01:16.539> so<00:01:17.080> I<00:01:17.550> mean<00:01:18.550> I

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
think maybe we had the hardware now or

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.419 
think maybe we had the hardware now or
you<00:01:21.399> know<00:01:21.550> it<00:01:22.060> was<00:01:22.179> not<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.020> hot<00:01:23.289> not<00:01:23.470> a<00:01:23.500> very

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
you know it was not a hot not a very

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:25.800 
you know it was not a hot not a very
good<00:01:24.520> risk<00:01:24.910> for<00:01:25.119> him<00:01:25.270> we<00:01:25.420> didn't<00:01:25.570> have<00:01:25.690> to

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
good risk for him we didn't have to

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.389 
good risk for him we didn't have to
title<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:26.289> we<00:01:26.380> got<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> title<00:01:26.800> so<00:01:27.009> i<00:01:27.039> think<00:01:27.100> that

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
title so we got a title so i think that

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.800

might have motivated me at the same yeah

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.050 
might have motivated me at the same yeah
