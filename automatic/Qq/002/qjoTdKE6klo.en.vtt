the difference between an SPF 30 and an
SPF<00:03:39.640> 50<00:03:40.299> is<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:41.019> fact<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.470> 50<00:03:41.920> might<00:03:42.100> give

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
SPF 50 is the fact that a 50 might give

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.360 
SPF 50 is the fact that a 50 might give
you<00:03:42.549> 20<00:03:42.880> more<00:03:43.000> extra<00:03:43.359> minutes<00:03:43.690> in<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.019> Sun

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.039 
you 20 more extra minutes in the Sun
that's<00:03:45.370> about<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.269> it's<00:03:46.480> important<00:03:46.959> to
