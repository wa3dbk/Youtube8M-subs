think anyone had ever even come close to

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.270 
think anyone had ever even come close to
before<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.140> halo<00:01:18.469> was<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.770> beginning<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.130> me

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
before it halo was the beginning of me

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.499 
before it halo was the beginning of me
playing<00:01:19.520> console<00:01:19.909> games<00:01:20.119> with<00:01:20.360> my<00:01:20.479> friends

playing console games with my friends

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.389 
playing console games with my friends
and<00:01:20.990> that's<00:01:21.140> still<00:01:21.680> how<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:21.920> always<00:01:22.189> think

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
and that's still how I always think

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.730 
and that's still how I always think
about<00:01:22.549> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.719

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I think people have been asking for a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
I think people have been asking for a
remake<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> halo<00:01:30.600> 1<00:01:30.840> since<00:01:31.350> halo<00:01:31.799> 2<00:01:31.979> was

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130

since the 10-year anniversary is coming
up<00:01:46.080> it<00:01:46.320> occurred<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> us<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.860> there's<00:01:47.130> this

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
up it occurred to us that there's this

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.550 
up it occurred to us that there's this
entire<00:01:47.640> generation<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> people<00:01:49.020> who<00:01:49.200> never

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
entire generation of people who never

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.679 
entire generation of people who never
played<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.100> original<00:01:50.189> game<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.850> you're<00:01:51.030> an<00:01:51.270> 18

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
played the original game if you're an 18

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.450 
played the original game if you're an 18
year<00:01:51.869> old<00:01:51.990> neighbor<00:01:52.229> today<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:53.100> were<00:01:53.189> eight

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
year old neighbor today you were eight

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
year old neighbor today you were eight
when<00:01:53.970> halo<00:01:54.270> came<00:01:54.479> out<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:55.049> did<00:01:55.289> due<00:01:55.470> diligence

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
when halo came out we did due diligence

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.649 
when halo came out we did due diligence
on<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> number<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.520> partners<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.179> number<00:01:57.479> one

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
on a number of partners the number one

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.180 
on a number of partners the number one
requirement<00:01:58.110> was<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.770> didn't<00:01:59.069> impact

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
requirement was that it didn't impact

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.550 
requirement was that it didn't impact
and<00:01:59.670> play<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.929> classic<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and play at all you have a classic you

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
and play at all you have a classic you
have<00:02:01.590> something<00:02:02.039> that's<00:02:02.220> just<00:02:02.310> magical<00:02:03.299> right

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
have something that's just magical right

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.090 
have something that's just magical right
if<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:04.080> tinker<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.679> you're

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
if you go and tinker with it you're

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.499 
if you go and tinker with it you're
going<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.280> lose<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.429> magic<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.209> really

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
going to lose that magic what we really

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.150 
going to lose that magic what we really
needed<00:02:06.780> was<00:02:06.990> someone<00:02:07.229> who<00:02:07.500> could<00:02:07.530> work<00:02:07.890> with

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
needed was someone who could work with

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.370 
needed was someone who could work with
our<00:02:08.399> existing<00:02:08.850> physics<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.539> gameplay<00:02:09.929> engine

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
our existing physics and gameplay engine

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.199 
our existing physics and gameplay engine
saber<00:02:10.619> popped<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.489> quickly<00:02:11.790> they're

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
saber popped up really quickly they're

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.820 
saber popped up really quickly they're
like<00:02:12.390> yeah<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.440> make<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like yeah we can do this we can make the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130 
like yeah we can do this we can make the
game<00:02:13.980> look<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.970> current<00:02:15.360> generation<00:02:15.900> game

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
game look like a current generation game

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.530 
game look like a current generation game
and<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.370> by<00:02:17.549> using<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.360> original

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
and we can do it by using the original

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.080 
and we can do it by using the original
halo<00:02:19.049> one<00:02:19.230> engine<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.799> game<00:02:20.250> plan<00:02:20.549> halo<00:02:20.819> one

actually<00:02:35.579> use<00:02:36.239> them<00:02:36.420> completely<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.320> car

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
actually use them completely so the car

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.410 
actually use them completely so the car
is<00:02:37.560> nice<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.040> trainer<00:02:38.280> bugs<00:02:38.910> engine<00:02:39.269> is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
is nice and trainer bugs engine is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.180 
is nice and trainer bugs engine is
fairly<00:02:39.989> old<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.650> we'll<00:02:40.769> have<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.040> make

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
fairly old but so we'll have to make

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.039 
fairly old but so we'll have to make

I'm<00:02:43.530> gonna<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.980> speed<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.340> engine<00:02:44.670> to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
I'm gonna have to speed up the engine to

I'm gonna have to speed up the engine to

for<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.470> first<00:04:43.800> cinematic<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.370> definitely

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
for the first cinematic it definitely

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.160 
for the first cinematic it definitely
creates<00:04:44.880> another<00:04:45.270> challenge<00:04:45.810> for<00:04:45.990> us<00:04:46.020> when

you're<00:04:46.290> playing<00:04:46.470> with<00:04:46.620> somebody<00:04:46.890> else<00:04:47.070> but<00:04:47.430> we

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
you're playing with somebody else but we

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.280 
you're playing with somebody else but we
obviously<00:04:47.820> wanted<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.570> support<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:48.900> cool

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
obviously wanted to support that cool

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.320 
obviously wanted to support that cool
breeze<00:04:49.440> was<00:04:49.710> Bill<00:04:49.950> Turner<00:04:50.160> from<00:04:50.790> 15<00:04:51.090> years<00:04:51.120> ago

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
breeze was Bill Turner from 15 years ago

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.510 
breeze was Bill Turner from 15 years ago
so<00:04:51.750> we<00:04:51.870> have<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.230> figure<00:04:52.260> out<00:04:52.680> how<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:53.280> code

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
so we have to figure out how this code

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.550 
so we have to figure out how this code
bases<00:04:53.910> structure<00:04:54.300> total<00:04:54.480> design<00:04:55.080> we<00:04:55.440> had<00:04:55.530> a

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
bases structure total design we had a

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.500 
bases structure total design we had a
lot<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:55.830> people<00:04:56.160> work<00:04:56.310> really<00:04:56.670> long<00:04:56.910> hours<00:04:57.120> to

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
lot of people work really long hours to

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.120 
lot of people work really long hours to
make<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.780> happen<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.530> really<00:04:58.710> cut<00:04:58.980> it

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
make it happen and to really cut it

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.680 
make it happen and to really cut it
ultimately<00:04:59.700> from<00:04:59.880> scratch<00:05:00.150> it's<00:05:00.510> pretty

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
ultimately from scratch it's pretty

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.690 
ultimately from scratch it's pretty
seamless<00:05:01.170> so<00:05:01.410> you'll<00:05:01.680> go<00:05:01.830> into<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.250> campaign

some<00:06:09.160> reason<00:06:09.190> it<00:06:09.490> just<00:06:09.520> pops<00:06:09.850> and<00:06:10.090> halo<00:06:10.270> in<00:06:10.390> a

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
some reason it just pops and halo in a

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.240 
some reason it just pops and halo in a
way<00:06:10.570> that<00:06:10.750> it<00:06:10.810> doesn't<00:06:11.140> in<00:06:11.290> other<00:06:11.770> games<00:06:12.010> or

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
way that it doesn't in other games or

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.970 
way that it doesn't in other games or
even<00:06:12.430> movies<00:06:12.790> yeah<00:06:13.630> I'd<00:06:13.810> say<00:06:13.840> the<00:06:14.200> feature

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
even movies yeah I'd say the feature

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.159 
even movies yeah I'd say the feature
that<00:06:15.340> surprised<00:06:15.700> me<00:06:15.940> the<00:06:16.060> most<00:06:16.090> was<00:06:16.720> connect

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
that surprised me the most was connect

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.540 
that surprised me the most was connect
so<00:06:17.350> we've<00:06:17.470> got<00:06:17.620> a<00:06:17.650> number<00:06:17.800> of<00:06:17.980> voice<00:06:18.130> commands

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
so we've got a number of voice commands

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.860 
so we've got a number of voice commands
throughout<00:06:18.850> the<00:06:18.940> course<00:06:19.150> of<00:06:19.240> the<00:06:19.300> game<00:06:19.450> things

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
throughout the course of the game things

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.380 
throughout the course of the game things
like<00:06:20.080> grenade<00:06:20.560> reload<00:06:21.340> at<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:22.030> point<00:06:22.210> during

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390 
like grenade reload at the point during

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.060 
like grenade reload at the point during
the<00:06:22.570> game<00:06:22.720> when<00:06:22.870> you're<00:06:22.990> playing<00:06:23.200> you<00:06:23.350> can<00:06:23.890> say

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
the game when you're playing you can say

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.920 
the game when you're playing you can say
analyze<00:06:24.580> and<00:06:24.880> this<00:06:24.970> mode<00:06:25.210> comes<00:06:25.510> up<00:06:25.720> where<00:06:25.900> you

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
analyze and this mode comes up where you

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.780 
analyze and this mode comes up where you
can<00:06:25.990> almost<00:06:26.230> capture<00:06:26.890> items<00:06:27.340> so<00:06:27.520> you<00:06:27.580> move

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
can almost capture items so you move

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.820 
can almost capture items so you move
your<00:06:27.940> cursor<00:06:28.180> over<00:06:28.390> saying<00:06:29.020> a<00:06:29.169> leader<00:06:29.380> a<00:06:29.470> grunt

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
your cursor over saying a leader a grunt

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.920 
your cursor over saying a leader a grunt
and<00:06:30.040> in<00:06:30.280> the<00:06:30.400> library<00:06:30.910> you<00:06:31.270> can<00:06:31.300> go<00:06:31.600> in<00:06:31.750> there

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
and in the library you can go in there

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.420 
and in the library you can go in there
and<00:06:32.050> see<00:06:32.260> the<00:06:32.380> things<00:06:32.590> you've<00:06:32.740> captured<00:06:32.979> move

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
and see the things you've captured move

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.610 
and see the things you've captured move
the<00:06:33.610> model<00:06:33.910> around<00:06:34.180> in<00:06:34.360> 3d<00:06:34.720> and<00:06:34.930> it<00:06:35.350> gives<00:06:35.530> you

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
the model around in 3d and it gives you

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.110 
the model around in 3d and it gives you
a<00:06:35.650> bit<00:06:35.830> of<00:06:35.860> a<00:06:35.950> breakdown<00:06:36.190> an<00:06:36.550> explanation<00:06:36.850> of

a bit of a breakdown an explanation of

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.870 
a bit of a breakdown an explanation of
what<00:06:37.270> those<00:06:37.419> characters<00:06:37.840> are<00:06:38.490> for<00:06:39.490> me<00:06:39.640> when<00:06:39.850> I

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
what those characters are for me when I

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.820 
what those characters are for me when I
think<00:06:40.150> about<00:06:40.240> halo<00:06:40.720> I<00:06:40.750> think<00:06:41.110> about<00:06:41.200> looking

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830
