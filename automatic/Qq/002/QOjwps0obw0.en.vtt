00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
with now I'm going to use a basic

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.640 
with now I'm going to use a basic
guideline<00:01:40.310> for<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.700> which<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:42.320> amount<00:01:42.530> of

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
guideline for you which is the amount of

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.800 
guideline for you which is the amount of
RAM<00:01:42.830> your<00:01:42.950> computer<00:01:43.370> has<00:01:43.580> take<00:01:44.540> away<00:01:44.750> 2

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
RAM your computer has take away 2

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.320 
RAM your computer has take away 2
gigabytes<00:01:45.530> now<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.670> needs<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.060> be<00:01:47.150> in

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
gigabytes now this needs to be in

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.550 
gigabytes now this needs to be in
megabytes<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.470> if<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:49.700> have<00:01:49.910> let's<00:01:50.300> say<00:01:50.560> four

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
megabytes so if you have let's say four

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.220 
megabytes so if you have let's say four
gigs<00:01:51.860> when<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:52.970> do<00:01:53.180> for<00:01:53.630> x<00:01:54.640> 1024<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.540> that's

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
gigs when you do for x 1024 and that's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.370 
gigs when you do for x 1024 and that's
how<00:01:57.440> many<00:01:57.620> megabytes<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.250> have<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.780> have<00:01:59.780> six

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
how many megabytes you have I have six

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.230 
how many megabytes you have I have six
gigs<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:00.980> I'm<00:02:01.070> going<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.250> do<00:02:01.370> six<00:02:01.670> x<00:02:02.800> 1024

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
gigs so I'm going to do six x 1024

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.190 
gigs so I'm going to do six x 1024
because<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.450> have<00:02:05.600> eight<00:02:05.930> gigs<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.440> RAM<00:02:07.689> so<00:02:08.689> six

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
because I have eight gigs of RAM so six

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.130 
because I have eight gigs of RAM so six
gigs<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.789> what<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.819> want<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.239> use<00:02:11.480> because<00:02:11.900> you

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
gigs is what I want to use because you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.690 
gigs is what I want to use because you
always<00:02:12.349> want<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.739> use

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
always want to use

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.610 
always want to use
do<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.180> want<00:02:14.360> them<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.569> leave<00:02:14.870> two<00:02:15.349> years

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
do you want them to leave two years

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.770 
do you want them to leave two years
available<00:02:16.250> for<00:02:16.879> system<00:02:17.209> processes<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.830> that's

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
available for system processes so that's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.960 
available for system processes so that's
6144<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.840> want<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.200> type<00:02:21.379> in<00:02:21.530> here<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.730> up

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
6144 I want to type in here and you up

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.820 
6144 I want to type in here and you up
you<00:02:23.300> have<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.750> delete<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.170> brackets<00:02:24.530> as<00:02:24.650> well

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
you have to delete the brackets as well

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.880 
you have to delete the brackets as well
so<00:02:25.580> 6<00:02:25.870> 14<00:02:26.870> /<00:02:27.489> 6144<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:29.720> put<00:02:30.080> up<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> exact<00:02:30.709> same

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
so 6 14 / 6144 to put up the exact same

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.350 
so 6 14 / 6144 to put up the exact same
number<00:02:31.190> in<00:02:31.220> here<00:02:31.459> because<00:02:31.700> that's<00:02:31.880> how<00:02:32.090> many

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
number in here because that's how many

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.270 
number in here because that's how many
you<00:02:32.510> want<00:02:32.630> how<00:02:32.900> much<00:02:33.290> RAM<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.739> want<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.160> run

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
you want how much RAM you want it to run

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.240 
you want how much RAM you want it to run
with<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.700> then<00:02:35.630> that's<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.650> for<00:02:36.860> your<00:02:36.980> RAM

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
with and then that's it for your RAM

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.400 
with and then that's it for your RAM
setup<00:02:37.700> now<00:02:39.519> all<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:40.880> do<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:42.049> type<00:02:42.260> the

it's going to be a bit less than that

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.800 
it's going to be a bit less than that

because of processing that minecraft

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.340 
because of processing that minecraft
uses<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:44.610> in<00:04:44.850> general<00:04:45.450> should<00:04:45.960> speed<00:04:46.320> up

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
uses but this in general should speed up
