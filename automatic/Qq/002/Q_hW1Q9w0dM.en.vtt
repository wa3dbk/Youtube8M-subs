00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the top three of easiest maps get a nuke

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.520

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
soul rifle that's eight so that's eight

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.420 
soul rifle that's eight so that's eight
maps<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.590> don't<00:02:59.740> know<00:02:59.830> how<00:03:00.010> many<00:03:00.040> i<00:03:00.280> think

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
maps I don't know how many i think

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.010 
maps I don't know how many i think
there's<00:03:00.550> 15<00:03:00.910> standard<00:03:01.390> map<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:01.840> eight

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
there's 15 standard map so it's eight
