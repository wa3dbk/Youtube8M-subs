00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.860 
there is no more you can see that there
is<00:02:48.560> no<00:02:48.829> more<00:02:50.349> dry<00:02:51.349> ice<00:02:51.530> in<00:02:51.769> there<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.870> that

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
is no more dry ice in there so that

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.289 
is no more dry ice in there so that
worked<00:02:54.139> there<00:02:54.500> as<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:55.489> can<00:02:55.579> see<00:02:55.760> I've<00:02:56.030> got<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
worked there as you can see I've got the

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:03.909 
worked there as you can see I've got the
marble<00:02:56.540> right<00:02:56.900> there<00:02:57.230> and<00:03:00.880> awesome<00:03:02.889> well<00:03:03.889> I

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
marble right there and awesome well I

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.729 
marble right there and awesome well I
guess<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.250> works<00:03:04.989> now<00:03:05.989> whether<00:03:06.349> this<00:03:06.590> is

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
guess that works now whether this is

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.710 
guess that works now whether this is
actually<00:03:06.859> carbonated<00:03:07.639> there's<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.569> whole

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
actually carbonated there's a whole

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.650 
actually carbonated there's a whole
nother<00:03:08.930> question<00:03:10.030> it's<00:03:11.030> like<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.239> shake<00:03:11.510> it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
nother question it's like a shake it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.690 
nother question it's like a shake it
