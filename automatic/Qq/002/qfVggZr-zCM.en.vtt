put<00:03:39.370> them<00:03:39.489> in<00:03:39.549> there<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.329> got<00:03:41.109> everything<00:03:41.530> I

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
put them in there so I got everything I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
need to do that so I'm pretty much just

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.860 
need to do that so I'm pretty much just
gonna<00:03:43.720> um<00:03:44.579> transfer<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.669> names<00:03:45.880> into<00:03:46.660> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
gonna um transfer the names into the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.159 
gonna um transfer the names into the
palette<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.669> just<00:03:48.669> glue<00:03:48.910> them<00:03:49.060> on<00:03:49.239> or<00:03:49.569> put

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
palette and just glue them on or put

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.080 
palette and just glue them on or put
magnets<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:50.859> so<00:03:51.040> they<00:03:51.190> do<00:03:51.430> have<00:03:51.639> magnetic

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
magnets on so they do have magnetic

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.629 
magnets on so they do have magnetic
strips<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.650> think<00:03:53.889> that's<00:03:54.040> gonna<00:03:54.190> be<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.370> lot

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
strips and I think that's gonna be a lot

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.479 
strips and I think that's gonna be a lot
easier<00:03:54.819> nack<00:03:55.359> actually<00:03:55.870> uh<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:57.010> actually

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
easier nack actually uh I can actually

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.819
