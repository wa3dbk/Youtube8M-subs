00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.050
 Tunisian column under the upper thread 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.780
 pigtails 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.710
 mount another pattern which 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.640
 shows how the view changes 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.010
 Tunisian knitting depending on 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.570
 ways to start loops 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:30.220
 knitting with a chain of air loops and 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.780
 The first row is recruited from this chain and 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.360
 knit it simple that low 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.250
 by bars 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:45.320
 it's like a preparatory series in 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:48.640
 many samples will settle down equally knit 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.640
 binding chain 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.610
 now see 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.600
 from where we will pull out 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.700
 fastening chain we dial from under 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.570
 top loop only i.e. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:27.060
 hook in the middle of the fastening chain 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:31.909
 pulling also here it is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.909
 the middle of the chain we introduce 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.079
 under one loop 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.420
 so go to the end of the series 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.750
 here is the last loop here from here this 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:16.490
 extreme loops that is not from column a 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:22.310
 it is here from the chain and also 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:29.330
 we knit the reverse series completely 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:32.420
 standard here as when knitting under 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.520
 the whole chain of fixing us will be 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.269
 get a little chess and a-shaped 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:43.040
 the pattern so the next row we do here 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:46.430
 not from the first not from the first loop of the chain 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.830
 from 2 to the number of columns 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.830
 we had the same 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.220
 less comfortable of course knit than under the whole 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:11.220
 chain but now you will understand what it is 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.909
 say the difference too is lovely and in 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.909
 in this way 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.660
 Here we reach the end of the last row 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.300
 eyelet pulled from here and not to 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.880
 reduce the number of loops one more 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.239
 the loop was drawn from the vertical 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.239
 column 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.239
 shutting down 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.849
 close this row 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.730
 here 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.870
 what happened in two rows 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.090
 now I'll show you what happens more 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.859
 large sample 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.290
 Here's a sample of it, too, has the 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.769
 peculiar structure is very similar to 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.530
 fabric like all Tunisian knitting 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.049
 pretty shape steady but he 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.070
 turned out thinner 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:32.240
 because if i take a sample that i 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:37.770
 knitted under here in comparison with the sample 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.090
 which is under the whole chain it turns out 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.090
 thiner 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:47.160
 it can be seen even visually and so 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.150
 It turns out less dense, that is, you will see 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:57.180
 what here is the seamy side here 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:05:00.389
 a row more free in general for 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.150
 Tunisian knitting is quite such 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.150
 lightweight pattern that is the thread is not very tight
