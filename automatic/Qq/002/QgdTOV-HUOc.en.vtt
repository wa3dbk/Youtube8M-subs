 So good 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.860
 Your description of the basic steps of Yui 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.470
 I would like to do 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:20.570
 First of all 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:25.580
 Yeah it was Well music because it is a step ashamed of yourself 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.530
 I think that it is easy to match something well and called the beads Toka ob 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.640
 Then I will do it for a while 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.539
 First of all 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.980
 12 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.230
 Fan 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.860
 c 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.440
 Township six 18 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.120
 car 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.990
 Do you catch me 12 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.100
 3 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:52.820
 c 4618 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 If you look at the video of Iguchi part still 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.370
 The steps after Oita 3 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.640
 I wonder if it's different 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.640
 It may be thought that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.260
 Take me something 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.240
 When it was nice 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.470
 It will be almost 40 years ago from now 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.470
 so 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.610
 Now youtube something to at 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.100
 Because dance is Gras Well still a little 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.340
 Life 7 step later 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.820
 Broken 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.050
 There is also a simplified part 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.050
 This is a dancing person 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.760
 Maa-no by the sense of the dancing person 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.510
 When you get used to 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.220
 Some people say the change the step is unexpected dancing take 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.520
 You are there 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.570
 Well if even basic soup is remembered well 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.020
 Well , if it fits in the total eight steps 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:05.359
 Even if you dance in the same way, it will fit well 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.440
 I sometimes say, but also those who Well obtained the that in the beginning 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.710
 Rie 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.890
 The basic sermon enhance 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:17.750
 If you can learn later 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:21.810
 Also the fact that also match went on behalf of what Fu 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.450
 First of all that master 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.290
 It's hard to remember 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.310
 I can not step on the steps smoothly 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.310
 It is the 3-position No. 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:41.700
 Until the mountain in 12 but I'm very simple basic from here is going to pull back a two-step 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.310
 I will 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.830
 c 567 and 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.200
 It will be in the form 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:03:00.980
 So the individual parts more easily if the bridge thus simplified 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:06.650
 It can also be obtained. However this 123456 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.390
 Father 8 Pez that I will play in this 2 steps to draw in these 2 steps later 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.100
 Toka say that 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.480
 Yup 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.410
 The absolutely that Zupponzu step at that time if there are variations step 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.970
 I have to remember 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.390
 If it is not decided beautifully 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:28.920
 There is something to say, so hopefully this 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:31.210
 The part that plays in this important two steps among the most basic steps 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.319
 I want you to remember well 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.430
 First of all sacrifices when's the position 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.780
 this 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:47.990
 Weight is on the right foot with 123 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:51.010
 I can Tteyuu applied to the right foot is not so left foot can move freely in 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.849
 Then from this floating left foot 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.819
 c 56 Shichihachi 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.690
 Because it will be good in the form 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.520
 Weight shift 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.210
 Because dance is very important 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.130
 I think I should practice this point well 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.320
 Well then it's easy to rain again 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.250
 It will be 123456 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.680
 Item 7 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.860
 It is 1 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.620
 3 c 56 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.880
 Ground 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.880
 It will be in the form of 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.880
 12345 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:41.409
 It is in the act step of 4 bowls 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.239
 Well, this is the next video or day 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.239
 Every single variation step 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.090
 Though we will shoot 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.110
 That 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:57.110
 Say the last time you went 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:05:01.580
 Ne 123456 78 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:09.020
 It says that it will play with one foot in such two steps like that 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:11.100
 Step this that the well corresponding to you for a So the very first of the 123 good public 2 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.320

 I will 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.139
 This way 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.139
 I think it was good practice how to take 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.889
 You are not surprised 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.310

 567 mag 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.950
 Well, I feel that say: 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.960
 Then that again 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.370
 Next variation step 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.370
