00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.050
 hero 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.240
 This is the most common driver of a car. 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.220
 businessman or just a robot she but him 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.810

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.900
 this is a towing vehicle driver 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.220
 here is a little more interesting to hire this 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.470
 blue workwear 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.150

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.490
 pen and print we only have one 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.760
 side on the other there is nothing face also 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.020
 one way 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.200
 and on the head there is such a cap 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.230
 our cars first is the most 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.380
 ordinary passenger car nothing more 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.380
 Natural you will not see here 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.170
 such corrugated wheels number in the form 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.220
 stickers from one and the other 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:12.400
 also here we have a pair 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.050
 side windows and of course the doors 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.540
 which open 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.480
 him inside you can sit our 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.050
 man also pay attention to 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.180
 tinted glass 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:31.120
 take and try to plant our 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.930
 hero now the driver can 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.760
 hit the road 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.910
 move on to our towing here 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.580
 there are a lot of interesting things to begin with 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.580
 the small elements are the first two 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.580
 such protective signaling cones of their 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.830
 can be delivered then when we 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.570
 evacuating the car is also here 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.820
 there is one fire extinguisher on the side you 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.220
 can see and 2 large antennas 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.730
 most likely it is in order that you can 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.890
 it was immediately take a signal that 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.130
 somewhere a car broke down and drive out 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.670
 place top signal lights also 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.560
 everywhere you can see stickers with 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.810
 phone number so that you can 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.690
 it was quick and convenient to call our service 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.910
 evacuation to the workshop 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.870
 I will say right away that in this car is very 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.729
 many stickers 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.330
 they are everywhere in front on the sides and even 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.510
 here 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:39.460
 that is, wherever you look everywhere 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.860
 will see the stickers huge wheels also 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.090
 here we are tools 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.130
 a hammer and a big wrench 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.060
 inward we also 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.910
 put to sleep the little man and he can go 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:01.200
 heading way 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.200
 front and here are the back 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.180
 I would like to separately consider our 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.940
 towing mechanism 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.150
 it rises and falls about 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.240
 180 degrees now I will demonstrate 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.890
 how does it work suppose we 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.240
 car broke down 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:25.930
 our tugboat drives up to him further 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.340
 with the help of this lever lowers under 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.130
 the form picks up our car and 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.330
 then raises and everything is possible 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.250
 vacuum our car to the workshop 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.250
 also pay attention here this 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.310
 platform she can move 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.950
 almost 360 degrees so on 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.010
 any road with any turns our 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:54.450
 the tow will easily pass and deliver 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:57.130
 car to destination 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.530
