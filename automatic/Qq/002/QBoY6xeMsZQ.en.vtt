00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.840
 speak personal beauty here and act more 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.990
 nothing happy New Year is personal that 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.090
 there are better in 2003 and 2012 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.949
 taking advantage of the spirit of knowing 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.279
 goals for the coming year is because 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.539
 start the year looking to play better 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.939
 in the guinea 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.699
 there begins with the question you are a 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.570
 complete player you find yourself a player 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.040
 complete 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.900
 and when I say it fully I'm not 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.650
 meaning necessarily good in 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.110
 all 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.170
 I say you can do it until you 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.690
 can deal with various situations for 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.710
 example if your team is missing 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.620
 snibbe you can replace the face 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.440
 of course, it is not just Israel that is 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.940
 important but it is usually the function 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.969
 with less people know how to play 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.230
 then do the following evaluate your points 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.980
 strong and weak 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.340
 For example you know how to play and I do not 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.920
 I mean just give one more map and also the 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.950
 lancenet finds dawn still bid 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.230
 closed with more than you only play 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.480
 lancenet sometimes happens you do not have 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.610
 more ammunition who pick up what they have on 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.190
 ground and then you have to 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.000
 will give you know of the relevance of the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.370
 throw 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.430
 I sometimes sometimes not so much that I 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.990
 had no more patient ammunition 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.960
 with people who use retro launches and I 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.840
 I do it for everyone and also 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.690
 judgment whether or not the penalty is 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.060
 my way of dealing with the situation is 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.380
 a team full of people exchanging me 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.930
 retro there 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.700
 hence for example you just move to the only 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 has fallen to the ground and there it will be like this 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.200
 move will look like shotgun 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.000
 also learn to use others 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.920
 the one you do not like very much 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.260
 I learned until more or less quickly. 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.350
 wore a short and daring and such but until 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.700
 today he has a certain laziness in 71 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.920
 difficulty understanding with fifa 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.010
 student Jorge, but it does not mean that I 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.489
 do not try to look for more matches or 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.760
 less tense to learn how to use it 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.640
 Also, for your sake, it's always improving. 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.950
 A little more in the game you can stay in 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.250
 practice right? 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.760
 It is another point is how I'm playing you 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.920
 alone or you play in the group 1 cm knows 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.720
 play both ways 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.650
 alone you have the need to 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 turn 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.580
 always have to be aware of who is 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.100
 I live in the match 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.870
 if you have any close ally if you 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.070
 usually you can not count on 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.840
 this ally in sadly the gandaia and 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.300
 flexibility has been developed. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.130
 an ability to adapt to the situation 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.280
 competitiveness 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.470
 all this to be able to play better and 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.490
 daughter have achieved an easier victory 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.760
 your team 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.800
 already in a group, or you fall a little 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.720
 need a good rate to talk to 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.700
 your team to see who has a bigger 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.120
 ability with such a weapon which can 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.290
 to take care of taltal lugato you know one 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.930
 cooperation and good communication clear whether 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.420
 specialize in what you have 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.060
 been assigned to do here you have the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.950
 habit of making nails 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.720
 My tip that if you do not know where 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.390
 these modes and start playing me 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.640
 I particularly think I play a 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.660
 way to learn the play that 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.940
 play in group 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.070
 You have to say that maybe in the game 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.190
 I was more challenging this way not 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.440
 who did not neglect group play until 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.150
 because playing against people in a group 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.970
 difficult only so it was with a more 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.260
 alone is well always worse is the other 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.910
 thing to think about is how much you 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.100
 knows the maps is not simply 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.380
 to know where it was in shock of itagiba 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.200
 the grenade is not much more than that 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.350
 for example you have a x term tactic 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.720
 for that you happen to make a 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.500
 different thing and then try to do some 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.060
 thing 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.370
 Let's say you're used to going to 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.000
 a mall if you were not a shock 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.519
 if he was going to get the bow and get a shock 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.870
 But I took the grenade or it goes up to the 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.630
 hammer europe 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.890
 Do you know what this is all about if the 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.080
 your team needs help in another 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.600
 The point is that you can help 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.930
 that way he had 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.330
 are several maps are we think that type is 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.479
 impossible to dominate all of them dominate 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.940
 well but gives to you know well and know 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.420
 turn around 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.850
 The important thing is to know if turning the game 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.470
 the other was a question like that of your 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.200
 pocket and 6 3 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.090
 knows that both the boss contribution 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.830
 very important when you're face to 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.260
 face an enemy up to more than one 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.840
 heap you can not waste it 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.150
 knowledge does not know but these two 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.280
 techniques and can not but can also 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.840
 give much importance to one or the other 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.340
 two are quite important 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.890
 sometimes I get the impression that the staff 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.890
 has a right at the right time preference 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.260
 by the global we have learned but forget 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.690
 okay the bossa is beautiful is it is 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.520
 useful is the sheik is also quite 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.740
 important after all the map is not 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.860
 only made of corridors and walls then 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.120
 also has the open houses and then one 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.730
 thing happens very often in 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.970
 around the world at least once per 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.380
 week there and get a day there 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.000
 bad or suddenly a part is 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.130
 dying a lot and guilty 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.130
 So you 're on the bad day, there's not much. 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.990
 to do in this respect we have to improve 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.970
 from time to time the male is 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.890
 make it happen that you become a 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.100
 in the rear if you are not 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.830
 playing well above that more adapted the 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.080
 your game to your condition in the 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.419
 moment if you have playing bad and net 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.580
 Then suddenly you find yourself giving up. 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.550
 support for someone who is better off in 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.169
 day you get the rear to the then 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.870
 I'm throwing a grenade at it to give 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.120
 full support for there are other ways 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.680
 play that does not start with everything up 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.830
 of the opponent 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.470
 The last question I ask is the property 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.680
 You are more accustomed to playing I play. 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.440
 only one played more than one how is that 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.169
 Do you have a preferred way I suggest 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.880
 You always play more than 1 because you end up 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.370
 developing new skills by playing 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.190
 differently because he is the king of the 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.850
 I think it's a great piece of cake. 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.990
 situations of many near and 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.960
 different strategy for locations 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.300
 different from the map as it is suddenly 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.130
 find an enemy alone on the map that 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.290
 you do as you are conceived with it until 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.140
 because it's okay you die 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.180
 very important is to capture the ring then 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.600
 you can test the different way 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.390
 approach can make good use of this 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.240
 for 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.480
 It's better to play better and that's the purpose 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.020
 of the river is yours to develop 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.740
 skills to make you stronger 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.080
 personal jewelry 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.020
 so that's it hope to help you again 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.730
 Happy New Year if you liked it. 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.520
 Forget that I liked it 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.760
 anything just posting comments 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.760
 hello guys
