can be your future your past so I am
thinking<00:01:27.899> about<00:01:27.960> many<00:01:28.410> things<00:01:29.450> in<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.509> space

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
thinking about many things in that space

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.990 
thinking about many things in that space
is<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.160> important<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.880> own

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
is that important in your own

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.300 
is that important in your own
architecture<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.170> connection<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:35.040> nature

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
architecture that connection with nature

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.690 
architecture that connection with nature
and<00:01:36.300> no<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.600> difficult<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and no it's difficult to make it that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600 
and no it's difficult to make it that
happen<00:01:39.149> in<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> modern<00:01:39.840> high-rise<00:01:40.610> buildings

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
happen in the modern high-rise buildings

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
happen in the modern high-rise buildings
or<00:01:41.910> modern<00:01:42.330> cities<00:01:42.780> that's<00:01:43.380> why<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> lot<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
or modern cities that's why a lot of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.389 
or modern cities that's why a lot of
people<00:01:44.039> they<00:01:44.520> hate<00:01:44.700> modern<00:01:45.830> city<00:01:46.830> but<00:01:47.070> they

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
people they hate modern city but they

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.279 
people they hate modern city but they
have<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.729> live<00:01:47.910> there<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.600> opportunity

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
have to live there because opportunity

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.160 
have to live there because opportunity
but<00:01:49.800> I<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> future<00:01:50.840> there<00:01:51.840> should

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
but I think in the future there should

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.760 
but I think in the future there should
be<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> way<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.729> make<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.479> modern<00:01:55.050> city<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
be a way to make a modern city with a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.260 
be a way to make a modern city with a
human<00:01:56.369> touch

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.310
