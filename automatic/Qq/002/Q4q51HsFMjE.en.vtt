Minecraft<00:00:24.689> 1.2.3<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.300> first<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.420> all<00:00:27.510> I'll

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
Minecraft 1.2.3 and first of all I'll

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.790 
Minecraft 1.2.3 and first of all I'll
start<00:00:28.019> off<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.519> less<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.240> cool<00:00:30.810> or

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
start off with the less of the cool or

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.080 
start off with the less of the cool or
the<00:00:31.949> lesser<00:00:32.250> cool<00:00:32.640> one

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the lesser cool one

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.049 
the lesser cool one
just<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:34.190> only<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.520> reason<00:00:35.910> why<00:00:35.940> this

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
just because only one reason why this

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.600 
just because only one reason why this
isn't<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.690> good<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.320> yellow<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> that's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
isn't as good as yellow on and that's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.780 
isn't as good as yellow on and that's
for<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> simple<00:00:39.210> fact<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:40.700> firstly<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
for the simple fact that firstly you

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.200 
for the simple fact that firstly you
don't<00:00:41.820> spawn<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.079> many<00:00:43.680> diamonds<00:00:44.210> yes

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
don't spawn as with as many diamonds yes

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.130 
don't spawn as with as many diamonds yes
you<00:00:45.480> spawn<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.840> diamonds<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.469> both<00:00:48.140> but

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you spawn with diamonds in them both but

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.090 
you spawn with diamonds in them both but
the<00:00:50.039> only<00:00:50.160> problem<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.469> super

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the only problem is is it's in a super

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.970 
the only problem is is it's in a super
flat<00:00:53.370> world<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:55.649> which

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
flat world so that's to see there which

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.459 
flat world so that's to see there which
I<00:00:56.100> also<00:00:56.250> call<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.820> world<00:00:57.030> name<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
I also call the world name so just in

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
case you miss it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160

this<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.080> load<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:08.060> shouldn't<00:01:09.060> take<00:01:09.210> too<00:01:09.240> long

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this one load up shouldn't take too long

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.929 
this one load up shouldn't take too long
I<00:01:09.689> hope<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:11.220> was<00:01:11.369> pretty<00:01:11.520> quick

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
I hope that was pretty quick

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.510 
I hope that was pretty quick
alright<00:01:12.360> nice<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.380> we've<00:01:13.770> spawned<00:01:14.010> right<00:01:14.159> in

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
alright nice so we've spawned right in

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700 
alright nice so we've spawned right in
MPC<00:01:15.000> village<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.200> super<00:01:16.500> flat

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
MPC village and we're in a super flat

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350 
MPC village and we're in a super flat
world<00:01:16.920> which<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.549> didn't<00:01:17.850> actually<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.150> as

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
world which I didn't actually know as

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.520 
world which I didn't actually know as
possible<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.860> not<00:01:20.250> exactly<00:01:20.430> sure<00:01:21.000> how

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
possible so I'm not exactly sure how

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.840 
possible so I'm not exactly sure how
this<00:01:22.530> would<00:01:22.710> work<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:22.950> maybe<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.700> could

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this would work but maybe you could

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.200 
this would work but maybe you could
almost<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.430> could<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
almost do a and I could do like a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.929 
almost do a and I could do like a
survival<00:01:28.020> type<00:01:28.259> gameplay<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.369> map<00:01:29.670> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
survival type gameplay in this map just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.789 
survival type gameplay in this map just
because<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.079> got<00:01:31.470> some

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
because you have actually got some

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.030 
because you have actually got some
resources<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.579> use<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.570> anyway<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.710> come<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
resources to use but anyway we come to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.530 
resources to use but anyway we come to
the<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.340> village<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.329> got<00:01:36.450> the

diamonds<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.040> we've<00:02:02.189> got<00:02:02.340> six

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
diamonds so this one we've got six

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.179 
diamonds so this one we've got six
diamonds<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.240> total<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.750> well<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.890> some<00:02:05.070> other

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
diamonds in total as well as some other

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.310 
diamonds in total as well as some other
cool<00:02:05.430> things<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.850> that's<00:02:06.000> pretty<00:02:06.180> cool<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:07.020> as

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
cool things so that's pretty cool but as

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.949 
cool things so that's pretty cool but as
I<00:02:07.469> said<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.099> not<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.959> world

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
I said you know it's not really a world

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
I said you know it's not really a world
that<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.379> really<00:02:10.590> play<00:02:10.739> survival<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.520> but

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that you can really play survival on but

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.430 
that you can really play survival on but
definitely<00:02:12.180> something<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.480> keep<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.750> mind

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
definitely something to keep in mind

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.110 
definitely something to keep in mind
so<00:02:13.650> anyway<00:02:14.130> let's<00:02:14.340> move<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.820> next<00:02:14.970> one

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
so anyway let's move on to the next one

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.810 
so anyway let's move on to the next one
before<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:16.350> stuck<00:02:16.770> talking<00:02:17.040> about<00:02:17.460> nothing

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820

Minecraft 1.1 when there was that
dovahkiin<00:03:47.700> seed<00:03:48.410> was<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.770> fact<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.070> the

dovahkiin seed was the fact that the
