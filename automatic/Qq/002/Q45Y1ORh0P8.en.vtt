00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
smarts she has no experience so she

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.010 
smarts she has no experience so she
doesn't<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.850> how<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> things<00:01:27.479> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
doesn't know how to do the things that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
doesn't know how to do the things that
she<00:01:28.049> will<00:01:28.290> eventually<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.710> how<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
she will eventually know how to do and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.690 
she will eventually know how to do and
we<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.430> wanted<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.880> her

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
we really wanted to have her

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.580 
we really wanted to have her
and<00:01:30.939> seeing<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:31.630> character<00:01:32.049> growth<00:01:32.320> and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
and seeing that character growth and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.050 
and seeing that character growth and
seeing<00:01:32.829> her<00:01:32.950> sort<00:01:33.189> of<00:01:33.280> struggle<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.909> survive

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
seeing her sort of struggle to survive

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.880 
seeing her sort of struggle to survive
is<00:01:34.810> what<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.079> think<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.350> really<00:01:35.619> bringing

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
is what we think is really bringing

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.910 
is what we think is really bringing
people<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.399> start<00:01:36.579> to<00:01:36.640> care<00:01:36.880> for<00:01:37.060> Lara<00:01:37.240> again

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
people to start to care for Lara again

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.709 
people to start to care for Lara again
that<00:01:38.920> lack<00:01:39.159> of<00:01:39.340> experience<00:01:39.670> transfer<00:01:40.420> over

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
that lack of experience transfer over

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.600 
that lack of experience transfer over
into<00:01:40.750> game<00:01:41.409> played<00:01:41.740> even<00:01:42.070> though<00:01:42.159> she<00:01:42.219> doesn't
