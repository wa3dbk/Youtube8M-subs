00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 when we all write youtubers of 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.960
 mexico and the world as they are here 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.990
 knees commenting on a video tutorial and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.730
 today we are in a kraft and we are going to see 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.740
 what are we going to do this, what are we going 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.930
 to do today is what the title says 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 automatic light 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.310
 and well previously not to do this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.080
 very very long tutorial and build a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.080
 house of this house 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 5 x 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:37.730
 7 I believe 5 by 7 to 1 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.310
 406 5 x 7 is the minimum that you 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.530
 can do for this invention and 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.260
 then they need blocks of any 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.550
 of the material that you want and good 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 let's get to the back first 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.210
 this block is the material from which 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.970
 you want redstone xin wang torch 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.160
 the redstone one sticky piston two 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.590
 normal pistons two repeaters 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.990
 reddish stone and a good button let's go 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.510
 Beyond first let's do this we will 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.640
 leave one and here we are going to put one 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.140
 reston torch with the material 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.680
 we want, let's go 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.490
 going up let's put another one here 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:18.430
 let's put 11 and here we're going to put 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.430
 another here so that this one 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.869
 this is going to stay on here what 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.740
 first that the second one on 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.869
 off and the third has to also 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.270
 it is lit even though this third 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.240
 let's put two blocks here two 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.369
 blocks one two ok and we're going to put the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.039
 registration torches on both sides 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.759
 they will be turned on later with this 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.369
 reddish stone 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.670
 let's put up here in the two 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.119
 pictures so that they are turned off 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.580
 both this one and this ready torch 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.000
 now here we are going to leave a little square and 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.040
 we will break it well from our house 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.920
 and with the material that we want we are going to 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.450
 do this two cubes really just 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.000
 ash this but it's the way to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 put them and well then we go down 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.069
 here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.289
 and with our strict piston we're going to 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.330
 place there then as you see going to 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.760
 stay here 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.240
 well then having that we go back 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.240
 Up there 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.750
 this is provisional they do not have to be 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.290
 you can do stairs or what 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.000
 we want 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.170
 to remove this since we put our 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.660
 stand since they are not necessary 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.910
 and here we are going to grab our 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.849
 repeaters and in the block ahead 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.430
 of the torch we are going to put it and we are going to 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.890
 separate it to the second the second time 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.780
 that would be doing just giving him a 1 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.989
 that is, there are four years this is the first 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.840
 2 3 and 4 we have to give in the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.819
 second both ok 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.349
 well, having this, let's leave 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.590
 here a little picture and we are going to put the 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.110
 normal pistons here one and here the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.870
 another ok that is here a little box is 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.160
 important but what remains and the small 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.430
 now with the block that we want we are going to 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.890
 put two next to the pistons ok 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.980
 good having this we are going to do well 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.330
 two of network are here another of the rector who 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.010
 stay here in small squares 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.930
 with our shiny stone that goes to 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.880
 be our lighting we are going to put 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.250
 here and the material that is our house 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.330
 or what they want to cover there is the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.560
 let's put here ok 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.450
 is a blandito I 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.870
 I'm going through this even though it 's what my 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.190
 chest is not pebbles and is not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.200
 normal stone then we will do so ok 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.180
 let's put here a block of what 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.750
 is the material that is at home and here 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.790
 the bright stone 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.460
 and good with this do not finish the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.320
 circuit up ok now let's go 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.320
 down we are going to enter the house 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.459
 and good and here in the house as they see that 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.400
 It's pretty weird but here we are going to 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.860
 place let's break one and where this one 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.390
 we reston torch let's put the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.660
 button then like him 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.940
 when pressing the light comes out ok or look 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.860
 let's go in and out light 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.030
 and good to remove it simple and 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.000
 we simply re-apply the 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.220
 button and how I come to be our 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.200
 normal ceiling then this is a good 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.150
 invention I hope you liked it 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.270

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.340
 a favorite show subscribe to my channel and 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.950
 good come down the new 15 topics that 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.800
 they are pretty good and they are free and good 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.690
 As you can see, it works quite well and 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.940
 outside of your house you do not see unless you 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.620
 They are very here and well that already 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.220
