00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
but talk about the positives that you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.050 
but talk about the positives that you
took<00:00:41.210> from<00:00:41.270> from<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.960> match<00:00:42.310> six<00:00:43.310> goals<00:00:43.580> and

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
took from from the match six goals and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.860 
took from from the match six goals and
some<00:00:45.020> of<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:45.500> wave<00:00:45.710> score<00:00:46.100> goals<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.750> the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
some of the wave score goals and the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.570 
some of the wave score goals and the
fact<00:00:48.110> even<00:00:48.350> though<00:00:48.470> we<00:00:48.680> were<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:48.890> little<00:00:49.370> bit

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
fact even though we were a little bit

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.850 
fact even though we were a little bit
frustrated<00:00:50.300> because<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:50.930> couldn't<00:00:51.230> find<00:00:51.680> the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
frustrated because we couldn't find the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.240 
frustrated because we couldn't find the
rhythm<00:00:52.160> of<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.550> game<00:00:52.690> we<00:00:53.690> continue<00:00:54.470> we<00:00:54.800> try<00:00:55.190> it

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
rhythm of the game we continue we try it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.520 
rhythm of the game we continue we try it
over<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.000> over<00:00:56.030> again<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.750> at<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.230> end<00:00:57.440> of

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
over and over again and at the end of

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.030 
over and over again and at the end of
the<00:00:57.650> day<00:00:57.860> we<00:00:58.520> won<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.910> game<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.830> scored<00:01:00.830> six

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
the day we won the game and scored six

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.590 
the day we won the game and scored six
goals<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.520> think<00:01:01.879> we<00:01:02.000> did<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.180> little<00:01:02.390> bit<00:01:02.510> better

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
goals I think we did a little bit better

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.360 
goals I think we did a little bit better
job<00:01:02.900> in<00:01:03.050> second<00:01:03.350> half<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.830> we<00:01:03.950> change<00:01:04.280> the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
job in second half and we change the

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.300 
job in second half and we change the
system<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> little<00:01:05.119> bit<00:01:05.270> played<00:01:05.810> more<00:01:06.229> for<00:01:06.530> 42

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
system a little bit played more for 42

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.780 
system a little bit played more for 42
flat<00:01:07.750> traditional<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.260> that<00:01:10.250> someone<00:01:10.610> was

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
flat traditional and that someone was

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.810 
flat traditional and that someone was
really<00:01:11.030> good<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.509> I<00:01:11.869> remember<00:01:12.680> when<00:01:13.190> top<00:01:13.520> went

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
really good and I remember when top went

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.350 
really good and I remember when top went
down<00:01:14.119> by<00:01:14.630> line<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:14.990> played<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:15.410> back<00:01:16.360> great

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
down by line and played it back great

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.410 
down by line and played it back great
goal<00:01:17.660> I<00:01:17.690> hey<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.790> thought<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:20.060> was<00:01:20.300> a<00:01:20.360> really

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
goal I hey I thought it was a really

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.870 
goal I hey I thought it was a really
good<00:01:20.750> game<00:01:20.780> for<00:01:21.140> us<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.410> think<00:01:21.440> that<00:01:22.009> we<00:01:22.700> did

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
good game for us I think that we did

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.850 
good game for us I think that we did
solve<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:23.300> with<00:01:23.420> sports<00:01:23.720> six<00:01:23.960> great<00:01:24.229> goals<00:01:24.470> and

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
solve it with sports six great goals and

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.920 
solve it with sports six great goals and
even<00:01:25.610> Jamaica<00:01:25.910> played<00:01:26.149> a<00:01:26.180> really<00:01:26.390> high<00:01:26.660> line

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
even Jamaica played a really high line

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.330 
even Jamaica played a really high line
so<00:01:27.259> it<00:01:27.320> took<00:01:27.470> us<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.710> little<00:01:27.770> while<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.190> figure

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
so it took us a little while to figure

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.370 
so it took us a little while to figure
out<00:01:28.520> how<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.729> break<00:01:28.940> him<00:01:29.149> down<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:29.720> eventually

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
out how to break him down but eventually

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.680 
out how to break him down but eventually
we<00:01:30.710> did<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.220> everybody<00:01:31.970> did<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.240> great<00:01:32.270> job<00:01:32.450> of

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
we did and everybody did a great job of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.350 
we did and everybody did a great job of
coming<00:01:33.259> in<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.500> giving<00:01:33.710> us<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.070> lift<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.700> think

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
coming in and giving us a lift I think

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.050 
coming in and giving us a lift I think
we<00:01:35.450> did<00:01:35.600> well<00:01:35.660> handling<00:01:36.320> adversity<00:01:36.610> they<00:01:37.610> took

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
we did well handling adversity they took

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.700 
we did well handling adversity they took
their<00:01:38.210> time<00:01:38.240> on<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.690> ball<00:01:38.840> early<00:01:39.140> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
their time on the ball early and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.070 
their time on the ball early and
continue<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.729> throughout<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.119> game<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.540> we

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
continue that throughout the game and we

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.719 
continue that throughout the game and we
did<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.290> good<00:01:42.410> job<00:01:42.470> keeping<00:01:42.950> our<00:01:43.069> composure<00:01:43.429> and

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
did a good job keeping our composure and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.699 
did a good job keeping our composure and
just<00:01:43.910> playing<00:01:44.119> soccer<00:01:44.450> not<00:01:45.200> letting<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.560> get

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
just playing soccer not letting it get

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.040 
just playing soccer not letting it get
to<00:01:45.770> our<00:01:45.920> heads<00:01:46.190> too<00:01:46.520> much<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:47.090> think<00:01:47.750> they<00:01:47.869> did<00:01:47.990> a

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
to our heads too much I think they did a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.870 
to our heads too much I think they did a
good<00:01:48.170> job<00:01:48.229> at<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.619> they<00:01:49.039> got<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.280> soft<00:01:49.520> side<00:01:49.729> it's

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
good job at it they got a soft side it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.370 
good job at it they got a soft side it's
quite<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> few<00:01:50.330> times<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:50.720> once<00:01:50.899> we<00:01:51.050> started<00:01:51.080> to

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
quite a few times but once we started to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.770 
quite a few times but once we started to
figure<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.800> out<00:01:51.920> calm<00:01:52.369> down<00:01:52.459> and<00:01:52.850> just<00:01:52.910> knock

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
figure it out calm down and just knock

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.270 
figure it out calm down and just knock
the<00:01:54.020> ball<00:01:54.170> instead<00:01:54.470> of<00:01:54.649> playing<00:01:54.860> everything

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
the ball instead of playing everything

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.740 
the ball instead of playing everything
over<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> top<00:01:55.819> I<00:01:56.060> think<00:01:56.240> we<00:01:56.330> did<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.509> good<00:01:56.690> job

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
over the top I think we did a good job

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.020 
over the top I think we did a good job
with<00:01:57.259> solving<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.100> especially<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.729> second

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
with solving it especially in the second

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.290 
with solving it especially in the second
half<00:01:59.080> it<00:02:00.080> can<00:02:00.319> get<00:02:00.470> pretty<00:02:00.530> frustrating

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
half it can get pretty frustrating

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.970 
half it can get pretty frustrating
when<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.840> play<00:02:03.020> against<00:02:03.320> an<00:02:03.410> opponent<00:02:03.680> who's

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
when you play against an opponent who's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.760 
when you play against an opponent who's
always<00:02:04.250> trying<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.610> frustrate<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.710> trying<00:02:06.710> to

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
always trying to frustrate you trying to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.040 
always trying to frustrate you trying to
slow<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.010> game<00:02:07.160> down<00:02:07.630> prevent<00:02:08.630> as<00:02:08.720> many<00:02:08.840> goals

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
slow the game down prevent as many goals

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.100 
slow the game down prevent as many goals
as<00:02:09.229> possible<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.940> think<00:02:11.240> Jamaica<00:02:11.510> did<00:02:12.050> a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
as possible and I think Jamaica did a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.050 
as possible and I think Jamaica did a
really<00:02:12.320> great<00:02:12.470> job<00:02:12.590> at<00:02:12.980> doing<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.610> lot<00:02:13.910> of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
really great job at doing that a lot of

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.170 
really great job at doing that a lot of
us<00:02:14.180> were<00:02:14.300> frustrated<00:02:14.840> out<00:02:14.960> there<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.180> you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
us were frustrated out there and you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.760 
us were frustrated out there and you
know<00:02:17.270> it's<00:02:17.450> just<00:02:17.540> proves<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.680> to

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
know it's just proves that we have to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.330 
know it's just proves that we have to
come<00:02:18.920> out<00:02:18.950> here<00:02:19.240> against<00:02:20.240> mexico<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.830> get

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
come out here against mexico and and get
