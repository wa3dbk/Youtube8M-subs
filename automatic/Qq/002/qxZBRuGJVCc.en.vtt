00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.970
 the first is the oldest and the one that 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.590
 accompanies our lives and get to know each other 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.680
 he knows our true deeply 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:38.350
 nature and being light be careful and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.809
 to observe the observation of what 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.410
 we are really and no longer those 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.339
 homologation drives, that is, to do as 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:52.059
 make others follow follow the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.640
 rules always follow fashions 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.640
 how others want us to be and 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.170
 this obviously brings us an act of 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.440
 independence also have the courage to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.590
 be different from a strict with respect to 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.510
 a multitude that maybe goes for his 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.220
 street in a certain way 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.570
 so already realize this e 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.369
 to watch oneself observe what happens 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.049
 in the body 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.259
 I think it's very important today 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.950
 return to our intelligence body 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:27.520
 his that permeates us and always tells us 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.310
 what is good for us and what is not 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.000
 okay warns us in so many ways 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.850
 so many signs but we are always like this or 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.690
 mentally ill we are always in the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.790
 thought and mental construction that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.760
 let's just ignore these 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.560
 signals or sometimes we can 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.020
 enter into conflict 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.920
 that is, my mind wants something mine 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.979
 body feels another the body feels the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.670
 mind thinks and there is also within us 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:05.409
 a dimension that is no longer the feeling 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.619
 or to think but to know that 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.899
 size we already know what good 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.629
 because our way the way of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.780
 manifest our talents and gifts then 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.549
 a work on yourself to attend of 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.409
 plus the people who are in all of his 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:25.090
 multidimensional aspects and observing oneself e 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.260
 make choices 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.459
 what makes me feel 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:36.019
 what matches me where I feel there is joy 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.870
 a good thing for me and where I feel 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.450
 contraction shortness of breath or stress 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.310
 maybe this thing is not that thing 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.410
 I have to do so for me it's a lot 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.799
 important this self observations 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.280
 constant considering that we have many 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.470
 different levels of body expression 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.810
 mental but also a lot more feeling 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.489
 refined a profound wisdom that knows 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.579
 what have we come to do here on earth 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.110
 and that gives us so many signs through the 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.190
 coincidences through dreams 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.230
 through meetings through 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.470
 very special situations of the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.079
 our life and through ours 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.599
 metamorphosis here is this the road that 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.540
 I have to run that I'm still traveling 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.810
 and that for me so far represents that 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.799
 more valid than the one i always 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.030
 philosophers and spiritual systems have 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.480
 recommended 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.150
 and this in my opinion is a royal road 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.329
 an eternal road from which one cannot 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.329
 prescind
