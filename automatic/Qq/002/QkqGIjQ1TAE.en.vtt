yet but you never know it may have the
issue<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:20.030> hope<00:01:20.360> really<00:01:20.570> hope<00:01:20.810> they<00:01:20.990> fixed<00:01:21.320> it

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
issue I hope really hope they fixed it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.360 
issue I hope really hope they fixed it
because<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:21.710> been<00:01:21.860> quite<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.130> while<00:01:22.310> since

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
because it's been quite a while since

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.720 
because it's been quite a while since
that<00:01:22.730> original<00:01:22.910> release<00:01:23.920> my<00:01:24.920> other<00:01:25.130> American

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
that original release my other American

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.540 
that original release my other American
Gemini<00:01:26.600> models<00:01:27.020> haven't<00:01:27.380> tarnished<00:01:27.830> so<00:01:28.520> I

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
Gemini models haven't tarnished so I

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.070 
Gemini models haven't tarnished so I
think<00:01:28.850> they<00:01:29.090> probably<00:01:29.330> have<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.570> fixed<00:01:29.840> on

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
think they probably have it fixed on

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.920 
think they probably have it fixed on
this<00:01:30.260> model<00:01:30.470> as<00:01:30.650> well<00:01:31.540> now<00:01:32.540> if<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.690> get<00:01:32.810> this

nose gear doors or there were a little
long<00:01:54.890> now<00:01:55.760> I<00:01:56.060> see<00:01:56.540> what<00:01:56.720> they're<00:01:56.810> talking

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.660 
long now I see what they're talking
about<00:01:57.350> but<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.799> don't<00:01:58.040> think<00:01:58.190> it's<00:01:58.430> really<00:01:58.640> a

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
about but I don't think it's really a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.700 
about but I don't think it's really a
big<00:01:58.970> deal<00:01:59.180> some<00:01:59.750> people<00:02:00.110> seem<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.350> be<00:02:00.470> pretty

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
big deal some people seem to be pretty

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.289 
big deal some people seem to be pretty
picky<00:02:01.130> about<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.520> don't<00:02:01.700> like<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:02.090> and

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
picky about it and don't like that and

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.640 
picky about it and don't like that and
that's<00:02:02.390> an<00:02:02.570> issue<00:02:02.690> preventing<00:02:03.500> them<00:02:03.620> from
