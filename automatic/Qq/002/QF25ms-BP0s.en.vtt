00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
well I think you don't think just did

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.260 
well I think you don't think just did
because<00:03:32.070> with<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.430> classic<00:03:32.880> oh<00:03:33.030> they're

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
because with a classic oh they're

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.760 
because with a classic oh they're
certainly<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.320> was<00:03:34.560> just

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
certainly and that was just

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.860 
certainly and that was just
seeing<00:03:37.010> something<00:03:37.340> like<00:03:37.550> that<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.210> don't<00:03:38.450> think

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
seeing something like that I don't think

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.430 
seeing something like that I don't think
ever<00:03:39.140> wanna<00:03:39.350> say<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.740> was<00:03:40.150> because<00:03:41.440> they

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
ever wanna say that was because they

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.010 
ever wanna say that was because they
knew<00:03:42.620> if<00:03:43.100> if<00:03:43.550> tekhelet<00:03:44.000> died<00:03:44.360> in<00:03:44.570> he<00:03:44.660> was<00:03:44.780> one

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
knew if if tekhelet died in he was one

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.990 
knew if if tekhelet died in he was one
hit<00:03:45.380> away<00:03:45.530> from<00:03:45.860> death<00:03:46.100> they<00:03:46.520> would<00:03:46.700> have<00:03:46.820> lost

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
hit away from death they would have lost

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.030 
hit away from death they would have lost
because<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.510> Cathy<00:03:48.290> banner<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.710> on<00:03:48.890> their
