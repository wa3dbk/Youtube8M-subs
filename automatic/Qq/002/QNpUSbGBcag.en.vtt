00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hey, guys, I'm over here, who's talking? 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.770
 I came and today I'm here saying a mini 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.750
 very cool game very frenetic and I 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.960
 I really like to play nobody that you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.590
 do not pay any second what it's yesterday I 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.090
 te mt wizard is a very ugly name 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.689
 I'll show u ugly 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.330
 it consists of two teams that have to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.619
 Pick up your seats, you do not have to pick up. 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.019
 your bases to earn scores and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.910
 People are going to get this one from here they will arrive 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.550
 with everything and play everybody high and have 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.980
 several kits have several right I will 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 catch everyone here for you to show 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.030
 for you 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.039
 this kit is a kit that when I click 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 with this stick he plays everybody for 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.289
 high and when I click the one that was 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 Everything is going to break everything and I go 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.210
 pick up here and get this deal here the guy 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:05.549
 can not you see the soul here for good deeds 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:09.330
 the mythological flies fly grandmother 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.369
 then the guy will kill for sure but at least 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.770
 At least I got this deal and today I 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.530
 I'll get the fire fai's kit, huh? 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.600
 and it is this kit with tie the teleportation and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.140
 This is very good and things from here I'll shoot 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 fireball fireballs I do not like 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.930
 a lot of this kit because you do not even have any type 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.420
 It's very rare that you hit the guy. 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.970
 so I do not know how to actually play with 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.310
 so I do not like it and also have that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.820
 there said that the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.770
 the ice is the name itself says and I go 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.570
 pick up the next round and forget I 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.289
 Gotta catch it before you die. 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.720
 otherwise I can not catch I can not 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.700
 show you guys and there's a delay 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 logically has a delay for you to use 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.460
 This is not really a law. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.490
 a power rate you can use and 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.060
 then reloading the hunger rate 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.580
 no, the hunger indicates that you are ready 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.790
 to use the power or if you still 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.400
 You need to upload it and maybe 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.600
 I'm going to pick up this place here already 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.580
 It's winning, huh? 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.819
 My team is winning. It's okay. 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.560
 to speak the truth is there in the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.440
 corner instinct right corner is so 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.440
 right our catch here is in the corner 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.269
 right, where how many points in each 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.290
 one with how many points is the team 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.920
 red the blue team as I am the team 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.090
 blue I have the 600 points and the team 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.980
 red has 400 ac galera I already got 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.709
 o the ice kit what draws the ice it is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.650
 pretty cool especially for protecting you 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.500
 it has some more legal functions to 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.109
 protect is like this one that makes a 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.640
 to be in the truth was to do 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.489
 the ice wall 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.380
 I do not remember what you did and what I'm doing. 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.920
 being solated here I will prepare the 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.400
 kit that he is here that he is well 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.709
 cool, it's soft here. 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.430
 Good, I'm going to build here more or less. 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.400
 as that is only you build the Pope 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.900
 dies dies I do not know where I do not know 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.959
 Why but I died? 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.540
 then bora bora use this kit I 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.180
 using graf and you with that with this kit 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.920
 here it is a little different because he 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.380
 it will only give you life 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.180
 This is good, honestly, this is good or 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.500
 I used it here, I kill those guys who 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.670
 here's a reason 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.490
 only the most expensive cars 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.670
 very strong magic I top mud that has 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.010
 a kangaroo and even then Oscar me taca 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.550
 far more ball, right? 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.630
 I used a super power box here I loaded 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.910
 I'm here again. 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.010
 I carried it back, I'm here, the guy. 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.600
 stay there the guy where the guy I stayed 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.350
 frozen where is he? 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.959
 good I do not know where he is not to be 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.110
 it's there it's up here 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.590
 I understood he's up the chain here. 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.780
 Wow, he's beside the other side. 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.650
 well I already got it so it does not matter 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.290
 it 's the last one here this is a lot 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.210
 cool I do not know exactly what they are like 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.460
 the powers I know more or less so 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.979
 even because I'm not too addicted 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.240
 In this game I play is a game is well of 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.840
 sometimes I really like to play 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.470
 he's just that I'm not much of a vice, I do not 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.510
 I know all access to the edict and so 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.880
 that I do not know how to explain it right 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.639
 I just really like his dynamics. 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.610
 because he is very frantic too 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.070
 frantic even you do not stop to think 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.010
 and maybe can not stop you have to 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.479
 fast fast otherwise you start to lose 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.060
 points and tals 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.419
 This is very cool, I did not know that 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.880
 It's just that I did not know this and that. 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.700
 what time does he release a little power 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.910
 of legal legal iter did not know that 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.390
 existed that the pan has a guy comin ' 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.640
 here is a bad one there and if this super 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.940
 super leap speed confuses much 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.610
 head start spin there you get dizzy 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.770
 life is a little bad 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.460
 only without it we would not be able to 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.150
 if we locate and locate our move 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.000
 inside the map is would be a locomotion 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:38.910
 too slow too slow even there 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.880
 Caca opa caught the game by the way 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.770
 caught said I will and I'll it gives 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.900
 this fall because it is a good mini game 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.060
 very complicated is 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.910
 it is many blocks and not one 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.790
 side very block naked other and this 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.520
 also complicates southern complications 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.639
 only nothing to panic very Caracu 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.650
 dude, we got the boat. 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:07.460
 could get it I'm frozen there 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.430
 Good luck, I got out, and we're going to win. 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.830
 It was not well fierce okay fierce 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.520
 usually when a team 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:20.930
 he wins he gets washed he wins 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:24.560
 2,000 points to 300 points is very well 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.560
 crazy the score, right? 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.380
 It's good that we stayed longer or 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.590
 least one side of the other so did not have 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.169
 a lot of difference and this is good give a game 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.830
 The harder it lasts the more the game is more fun. 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:41.300
 It's good, now I've got the last one. 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.729
 kit ne 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.039
 this kit when you click the I 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.650
 right click on that hoe he is 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:51.949
 with a lot of potion that's really cool 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.030
 It's really cool, and I'm going to play there. 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:07:01.370
 you have an idea of the positions coming out 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:04.909
 You saw here and here and that's good. 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.300
 our meat hit beautifully here 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:12.770
 I'm going to get these people people to take away here. 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:15.139
 I'm going to take good care of ours here. 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.880
 Let's stay here, I'll stay here. 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:20.900
 take away somewhere here 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.330
 Boot the guy and we won people we won. 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.220
 we were not among the top three 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.349
 right players 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.680
 I think it's just that our team 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:32.930
 won and if what matters looks at 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.530
 destruction of the map gets very 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.990
 map after all, I hope that 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:42.409
 You liked it, it was a nobody there. 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.000
 which I played much more before today in 

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:45.949
 day has changed so much 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.560
 only it 's the least I like a lot 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:50.030
 I think the dynamics of it pretty cool I 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.889
 I will make staying here hope 

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.930
 did you like it do not forget 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:57.580
 leave the one you liked then it's 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.580
 This, he said, okay, bye.
