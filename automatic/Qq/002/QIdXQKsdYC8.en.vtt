that let's move on to the next bag so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200 
that let's move on to the next bag so
the<00:01:39.720> next<00:01:39.900> bag<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.920> orchard<00:01:41.549> grass<00:01:41.820> mix

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
so if we open this one up I think this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.399

is orchard grass completely orchard

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
is orchard grass completely orchard
grass<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> has<00:01:47.250> something<00:01:47.579> else<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.939> too

grass or it has something else in it too

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.679 
grass or it has something else in it too
but<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> lot<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:49.610> grassy<00:01:50.610> than<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.289 
but this is a lot more grassy than the
timothy<00:01:52.409> hay<00:01:52.560> again<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.490> dusty<00:01:53.790> it

called<00:02:05.189> house<00:02:05.490> blend<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.360> I'm<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.810> quite<00:02:07.290> sure

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320

what<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.489> think

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
what this is I think

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.130 
what this is I think
this<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.040> a<00:02:09.070> mix<00:02:09.400> of<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.940> lot<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.240> stuff<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.020> in

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
this is a mix of a lot of stuff so in

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.190 
this is a mix of a lot of stuff so in
this<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.650> think<00:02:11.950> there<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.400> some<00:02:12.970> timothy<00:02:13.930> hay

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
this I think there is some timothy hay

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520 
this I think there is some timothy hay
maybe<00:02:15.010> some<00:02:15.430> other<00:02:15.730> types<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.540> hay<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:17.110> well

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
maybe some other types of hay as well

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.400 
maybe some other types of hay as well
there's<00:02:18.040> some<00:02:18.370> herb<00:02:18.640> type<00:02:19.060> stuff<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.170> can

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
there's some herb type stuff that I can

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.500 
there's some herb type stuff that I can
smell<00:02:20.710> and<00:02:21.100> all<00:02:21.430> know<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.730> think<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.300> would

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
smell and all know I think this would
