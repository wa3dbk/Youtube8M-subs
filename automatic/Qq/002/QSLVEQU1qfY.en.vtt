00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
that site he was just the weight on it

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.780 
that site he was just the weight on it
and<00:00:31.989> that<00:00:32.680> was<00:00:32.800> about<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.190> only<00:00:33.220> complaint<00:00:33.700> I

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
and that was about the only complaint I

and that was about the only complaint I
had<00:00:33.970> on<00:00:34.090> it<00:00:34.210> was<00:00:34.540> a<00:00:34.570> little<00:00:34.840> bit<00:00:34.960> heavy<00:00:35.110> but

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
had on it was a little bit heavy but

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.560 
had on it was a little bit heavy but
that<00:00:36.039> definitely<00:00:36.609> the<00:00:37.059> advantage<00:00:37.449> is

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
that definitely the advantage is

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.930

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
definitely outweigh the weight of it and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.849 
definitely outweigh the weight of it and

and<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.520> host<00:01:42.909> you<00:01:43.119> with<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:43.390> react<00:01:43.689> Pro<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:45.060> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and I host you with this react Pro is I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.230 
and I host you with this react Pro is I
get<00:01:47.079> my<00:01:47.200> 30-yard<00:01:47.740> dialed<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.579> my<00:01:48.700> 40<00:01:49.060> yard

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
get my 30-yard dialed in and my 40 yard

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.389 
get my 30-yard dialed in and my 40 yard
is<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:49.570> really<00:01:50.079> really<00:01:50.350> close<00:01:50.649> but<00:01:51.189> what<00:01:51.369> I

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
is is really really close but what I

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.480 
is is really really close but what I
found<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.969> if<00:01:52.329> I'll<00:01:52.509> go<00:01:52.719> 20<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.770> then<00:01:53.890> 40<00:01:54.310> and

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
found is if I'll go 20 and then 40 and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.090 
found is if I'll go 20 and then 40 and
really<00:01:55.240> dial<00:01:55.479> in<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.780> 40<00:01:56.289> yard<00:01:56.500> pin<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.860> makes

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
really dial in that 40 yard pin it makes

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.789 
really dial in that 40 yard pin it makes
it<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> little<00:01:57.610> bit<00:01:57.789> more<00:01:58.000> accurate<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:59.770> I

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
it a little bit more accurate so when I

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.399 
it a little bit more accurate so when I
go<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.070> 30<00:02:00.430> I'll<00:02:01.420> go<00:02:01.509> ahead<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.750> side<00:02:01.930> in<00:02:02.049> my<00:02:02.200> 30

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
go to 30 I'll go ahead and side in my 30

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.109 
go to 30 I'll go ahead and side in my 30
yard<00:02:02.649> pin<00:02:02.859> and<00:02:02.979> when<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.100> go<00:02:03.219> back<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.399> 40<00:02:03.759> I'll

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
yard pin and when I go back to 40 I'll

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.270 
yard pin and when I go back to 40 I'll
make<00:02:04.359> just<00:02:04.390> this<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:05.350> fine-tune<00:02:05.979> little

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
make just this to fine-tune little

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.969 
make just this to fine-tune little
adjustments<00:02:06.880> at<00:02:06.969> 40<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.479> my<00:02:08.110> 50<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.530> 60<00:02:08.830> are

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
adjustments at 40 and my 50 and 60 are

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.430 
adjustments at 40 and my 50 and 60 are
just<00:02:09.220> absolutely<00:02:09.820> dead<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.149> from<00:02:10.570> there<00:02:10.780> so

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
know my 4 yard pin I don't look at color

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.880 
know my 4 yard pin I don't look at color
so<00:02:27.700> color<00:02:27.910> doesn't<00:02:28.180> matter<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.600> me<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.990> count<00:02:29.560> I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
so color doesn't matter to me I count I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.530 
so color doesn't matter to me I count I
go<00:02:30.160> by<00:02:30.310> number<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.700> got<00:02:30.910> number<00:02:31.120> 1<00:02:31.240> number<00:02:31.420> 2

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
go by number I got number 1 number 2

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.620 
go by number I got number 1 number 2
number<00:02:31.690> 3<00:02:31.960> when<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.830> get<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.190> full<00:02:33.370> draw<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:34.030> know

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
number 3 when I get to full draw I know

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.050 
number 3 when I get to full draw I know
with<00:02:34.990> that<00:02:35.110> red<00:02:35.260> pin<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.620> my<00:02:35.770> 40<00:02:36.100> yard<00:02:36.310> my<00:02:36.760> 40

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
with that red pin is my 40 yard my 40

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.510 
with that red pin is my 40 yard my 40
yard<00:02:37.210> pin<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.990> 4<00:02:38.350> yard<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.830> go<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.160> or<00:02:39.490> go

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
yard pin so 4 yard and I go up or go

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.400 
yard pin so 4 yard and I go up or go
down<00:02:39.730> from<00:02:40.090> there<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.690> really<00:02:40.720> makes<00:02:41.230> it

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
down from there so it really makes it

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.190 
down from there so it really makes it
easy<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:41.800> me<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.100> pick<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.580> out<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:43.540> has<00:02:43.810> a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
easy for me to pick it out this has a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.650 
easy for me to pick it out this has a
ton<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.070> fiber-optic<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.330> it's<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.510> good

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
ton of fiber-optic in it so it's a good

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.780 
ton of fiber-optic in it so it's a good
nice<00:02:46.930> right<00:02:47.680> side<00:02:48.040> got<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> lot<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.460> fiber-optic

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
nice right side got a lot of fiber-optic

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.940 
nice right side got a lot of fiber-optic

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
dialed in and get it really really like

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.020 
dialed in and get it really really like
I<00:03:35.950> said<00:03:36.100> stainless<00:03:37.090> steel<00:03:38.520> throughout<00:03:39.520> and<00:03:39.940> it

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
I said stainless steel throughout and it

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.540 
I said stainless steel throughout and it
also<00:03:40.209> has<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:41.020> second<00:03:41.590> axis<00:03:41.860> adjustment<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.459> it

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
also has a second axis adjustment on it

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.770 
also has a second axis adjustment on it
which<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.790> really<00:03:43.000> like<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.300> don't<00:03:43.330> ever<00:03:43.510> mess

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
which I really like I don't ever mess

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.660 
which I really like I don't ever mess
with<00:03:43.870> third<00:03:44.620> axis<00:03:45.010> getting<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.400> messed

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
with third axis getting that messed

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.280 
with third axis getting that messed
around<00:03:45.790> but<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.060> really<00:03:46.330> like<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.930> second

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
around but I really like that the second

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.110 
around but I really like that the second
x<00:03:47.410> axis<00:03:47.920> adjustment<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.760> got<00:03:48.910> multiple

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
x axis adjustment it's got multiple

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.940 
x axis adjustment it's got multiple
mounting<00:03:49.840> holes<00:03:50.200> in<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.530> that's<00:03:50.650> out<00:03:50.770> like<00:03:50.860> I

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
mounting holes in it that's out like I

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.260 
mounting holes in it that's out like I
said<00:03:51.100> it's<00:03:51.190> got<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.340> little<00:03:51.489> bit<00:03:51.640> more<00:03:51.850> but<00:03:52.090> a

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
said it's got a little bit more but a

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.600 
said it's got a little bit more but a
slimline<00:03:52.930> design<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.440> one<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.800> lighter<00:03:54.340> than

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
slimline design this one is lighter than

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.490 
slimline design this one is lighter than
the<00:03:54.760> old<00:03:54.970> react<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.110> can<00:03:56.230> really

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
the old react and just you can really

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.070 
the old react and just you can really
tell<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.760> weight<00:03:58.300> difference<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.930> two

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
tell the weight difference in the two

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.930 
tell the weight difference in the two
when<00:03:59.260> you<00:03:59.320> sit<00:03:59.530> there<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.739> hold<00:03:59.920> them<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:00.760> is

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
when you sit there and hold them this is

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.110 
when you sit there and hold them this is
made<00:04:01.150> out<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.360> solid<00:04:01.800> 6061<00:04:02.800> aluminum<00:04:03.370> which<00:04:03.850> is

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
made out of solid 6061 aluminum which is

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.990 
made out of solid 6061 aluminum which is
a<00:04:04.150> very<00:04:04.780> good<00:04:04.989> high<00:04:05.290> quality<00:04:05.320> aluminum<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.940> I

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
a very good high quality aluminum like I

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.850 
a very good high quality aluminum like I
said<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.209> has<00:04:07.330> second<00:04:07.720> third<00:04:07.930> axis<00:04:08.380> leveling

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
said it has second third axis leveling

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.150 
said it has second third axis leveling

micro click windage adjustment and one

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.910 
micro click windage adjustment and one
of<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.310> things<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.610> noticed<00:04:12.940> too<00:04:13.120> on<00:04:13.330> this<00:04:13.510> one

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
of the things I noticed too on this one

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.479 
of the things I noticed too on this one
the<00:04:14.920> react

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
the react

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.000 
the react
whenever<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.120> loosen<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.660> react<00:04:17.169> up<00:04:17.410> on<00:04:17.709> it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
whenever you loosen the react up on it

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.500 
whenever you loosen the react up on it
didn't<00:04:18.340> happen<00:04:18.580> on<00:04:18.640> all<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:19.000> them<00:04:19.150> one<00:04:19.359> of<00:04:19.450> my

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
didn't happen on all of them one of my

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.390 
didn't happen on all of them one of my
reacts<00:04:19.780> whenever<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.620> loosen<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.100> up<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
reacts whenever I loosen that up the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.190 
reacts whenever I loosen that up the
housing<00:04:21.850> would<00:04:22.000> would<00:04:22.330> drop<00:04:22.570> just<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.990> little

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
housing would would drop just a little

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.170 
housing would would drop just a little
bit<00:04:23.350> this<00:04:23.800> one<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.550> notice<00:04:24.700> whenever<00:04:25.000> I

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
bit this one you notice whenever I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.200 
bit this one you notice whenever I
loosen<00:04:25.570> it<00:04:25.630> up

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
loosen it up

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.059 
loosen it up
stays<00:04:26.630> absolutely<00:04:26.900> still<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:27.889> has

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
stays absolutely still so it has

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.760 
stays absolutely still so it has
absolutely<00:04:28.479> no<00:04:29.479> slop<00:04:29.930> in<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.319> machining

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
absolutely no slop in it the machining

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.249 
absolutely no slop in it the machining
on<00:04:30.889> this<00:04:31.100> is<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.550> lot<00:04:32.000> better<00:04:32.270> than<00:04:32.810> what<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.139> is

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
on this is a lot better than what it is

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.800 
on this is a lot better than what it is
on<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.470> standard<00:04:33.919> react<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:35.330> has<00:04:35.479> a<00:04:35.509> bubble

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
on the standard react it has a bubble

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.540 
on the standard react it has a bubble
level<00:04:36.199> inside<00:04:36.590> like<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:36.979> said<00:04:37.099> it<00:04:37.160> has<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.370> glow

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
level inside like I said it has the glow

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.719 
level inside like I said it has the glow
ring<00:04:37.789> in<00:04:37.970> here<00:04:38.210> that<00:04:39.169> looks<00:04:39.620> like<00:04:39.860> about<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.490> two

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
ring in here that looks like about a two

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.089 
ring in here that looks like about a two
inch<00:04:40.759> housing<00:04:41.389> so<00:04:41.960> I'm<00:04:42.229> just<00:04:42.560> guessing<00:04:42.740> there

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
inch housing so I'm just guessing there

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.969 
inch housing so I'm just guessing there
but<00:04:43.310> glow<00:04:44.090> ring<00:04:44.300> is<00:04:44.630> in<00:04:45.259> there<00:04:45.440> really<00:04:45.620> helps

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
but glow ring is in there really helps

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.680 
but glow ring is in there really helps
in<00:04:46.099> low-light<00:04:46.520> really<00:04:46.819> makes<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.180> pick<00:04:47.509> it<00:04:47.599> up

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
in low-light really makes you pick it up

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.710 
in low-light really makes you pick it up
easy<00:04:48.020> whenever<00:04:48.770> your<00:04:48.919> flat<00:04:49.160> folderol<00:04:49.720> except

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
easy whenever your flat folderol except

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.809 
easy whenever your flat folderol except
to<00:04:50.840> us<00:04:50.870> adjustments<00:04:51.620> on<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:51.979> your<00:04:52.550> fiber

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
to us adjustments on it your fiber

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.700 
to us adjustments on it your fiber
optics<00:04:53.240> are<00:04:53.360> all<00:04:53.449> protected<00:04:53.960> really<00:04:54.229> well<00:04:54.440> and

optics are all protected really well and

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.390 
optics are all protected really well and
I'm<00:04:55.550> just<00:04:56.150> absolutely<00:04:56.300> impressed<00:04:57.199> with<00:04:57.889> this

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
that wrap technology and made it that

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.749 
that wrap technology and made it that
much<00:05:06.830> better<00:05:07.039> it's<00:05:07.610> lightweight<00:05:08.030> it's<00:05:08.780> it's
