00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.099 
how I'm comfortable I'm really
comfortable<00:03:57.220> actually<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:58.720> case<00:03:58.930> you're

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
comfortable actually in case you're

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.569

wondering<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.560> guess<00:03:59.769> at<00:04:00.040> least<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.370> my<00:04:00.489> opinion

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
wondering I guess at least in my opinion

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.089 
wondering I guess at least in my opinion
and<00:04:01.569> skinny<00:04:01.959> seat<00:04:02.170> doesn't<00:04:02.470> necessarily<00:04:02.980> mean

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
I'm uncomfortable part of that has to do

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.129 
I'm uncomfortable part of that has to do
with<00:04:04.889> freaking<00:04:05.889> cloud-like<00:04:06.569> suspension<00:04:07.569> as

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
with freaking cloud-like suspension as

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.720 
with freaking cloud-like suspension as
if<00:04:08.380> clouds<00:04:08.620> actually<00:04:08.889> move<00:04:09.190> up<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.400> down<00:04:09.489> like

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
if clouds actually move up and down like

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.309 
if clouds actually move up and down like
that<00:04:09.880> they<00:04:10.120> don't<00:04:10.269> let's<00:04:10.750> just<00:04:10.870> pretend<00:04:11.049> they

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
that they don't let's just pretend they

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.629 
that they don't let's just pretend they
do<00:04:11.380> because<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.799> made<00:04:11.950> sense<00:04:12.190> when<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.459> thought

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639
