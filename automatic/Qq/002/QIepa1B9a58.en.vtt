00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:17.220
 rick the man am idec of the boy was spicy 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.350
 Nobody leaves, leaves, leaves, and people here are from 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.460
 filling up the biggest problem is the second 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.859
 video on the channel 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.980
 good today in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.990
 make an underwater house 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.090
 creative here to not take too long, huh? 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 first you think you find a place is 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.969
 very deep but you have to make your 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.950
 House 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 first you see boot in gladstone 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:52.649
 to light underneath make a house 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:55.370
 very big and you put on glass do 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.370
 your base 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.330
 looks 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.120
 well you must be wondering 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.330
 How are we going to draw all this water? 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.240
 from within it is very simple when 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.720
 you do the whole cube from the inside and 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.380
 close it you good have some block by 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.000
 inside is to fill in everything the water will 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.590
 coming up of course 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.590
 so let's do it 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:12.610
 leaves the patient for climbing right 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.610
 to close here just put wood 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:29.360
 shaq is broken and pro solved 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:31.550
 Look, I'll have it here soon, but 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.069
 Of course you 're going to come in here, but why? 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:40.180
 I did not 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.180
 You see you made the bridge up. 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.600
 and also complicated to fight against 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.680
 good sakineh stream though 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.330
 realized is that the house is in a good 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.270
 here with no water in you guys do it 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.880
 the bridge is not 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.820
 there you must if you must 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.710
 be wondering how we 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.050
 will do to put a bed 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:41.890
 If you can not put a bed on the glass, I 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:45.280
 We're here to help, right? 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.940
 so it's very simple you come here 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.940
 down 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.760
 button anyone any block if I 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.760
 get out of here 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:13.540
 although it has bed break and wood 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.049
 while living again and ready from here 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.510
 can build their house is a good 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.120
 simpler than I imagined right? 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.120
 well, that's it, that's it, people
