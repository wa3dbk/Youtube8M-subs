00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:14.030
 friends I'm going to play the arpeggios that 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.650
 form on the tonal notes of the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:21.980
 scale everything and then I will explain the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.950
 why and the notes that form each 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.260
 arpeggio and after explaining what 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.330
 verbally by what he has taught 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.330
 note by notes with the score 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.160
 before and fingers arpey and of fa and fed up 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.160
 sun with seventh 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.790
 yes no 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.790
 i 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.079
 d 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.890
 well one year 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.470
 comes from a chord a chord are 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.210
 several notes that are played 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.960
 simultaneously with the instruments of 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.509
 wind 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.610
 that is metaphysically impossible if 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.380
 we play several notes at the same 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:26.210
 time but we only issue one 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.180
 good because the tonal chords better 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.000
 said the tonal notes of the scale of 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.250
 any major scale are the first 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.650
 grade 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.680
 that are called tonic in fourth degree 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.760
 which is called sub-dominant and the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.370
 fifth dominant 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.230
 the first degree of the scale of two is 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.870
 the fourth degree is fa do re mi fa and the 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.480
 fifth Sun 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.210
 first we form the chord to know 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.290
 the notes 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.830
 the agreed upon envelope in the tonic is 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.230
 2000 sun 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.420
 then with those three notes 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:12.420
 we evolved up and down 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.319
 the agreed that is formed on the sub 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.870
 dominant over the fa is faking we do 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.780
 even the region of the de fa is stopped 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.780
 stopped standing of the fad a photographer 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:32.270
 and he agreed that it forms about the fifth 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:35.650
 degree the dominant sun the sun is re but 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.590
 I played with seventh because the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.230
 dominant fifth-degree chord is 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.130
 very characteristic do it with seventh 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.800
 therefore I have made sun if rafa 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.500
 and that agreement is called seventh accord 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.510
 of dominant and after doing his 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.180
 close fa lagged behind and after extending 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.750
 ended in the tonic because the arpeggio 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.050
 chord has repeated of dominant is a 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.630
 chord tension arpeggio and then 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.760
 after doing that arpeggio it agrees 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.650
 rest on the tonic in 2000 welded my 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.659
 sun forgot he forgot 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.360
 well there is one thing that a small 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.260
 detail when I have done the art you will 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.260
 fa fa 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:37.390
 the 2 for the forgiveness for the 2 for the 2 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.970
 then I came fox super sharp but I in 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.410
 place to do this because it 's very 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.040
 uncomfortable to pass 2 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:49.740
 Super sharp anfas I've made 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:54.620
 the do driven this key quote 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.660
 this button left the voice quiet and sharp 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.300
 22 with which we saved that then 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.040
 that position 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.040
 so hard we have 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.700
 well now you are going to see in 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.310
 score what I just told you 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.340
 because maybe if there is something that I 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.870
 I have not explained well to see them to see what 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.870
 written you will understand it better 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.820
 yes 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:48.050
 Tonal arpeggios of C major 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:52.819
 come here we have the scale of re my fa 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:55.789
 Sun yes and again two if we want 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:59.810
 start another new scale an octave 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:03.770
 highest well the first degree is called 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.840
 tonic then we form the chord of 22 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.319
 my sun 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.470
 and that is the arpeggio of 2do let go of me 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:16.599
 only sun forgot the sun looked well 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.599
 the fourth degree is fa 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.990
 it's called sub dominant 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:28.070
 and we do the training arpeggio 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:32.470
 sorry first we have the salty chord 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.990
 well then we do in the region 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.510
 and then we have 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.390
 another tonal note 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:44.430
 which is the fifth degree sun and we form 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.430
 we do the agreed solís and rafa 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.889
 the sun is the dominant of the scale the 

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:58.949
 fifth grade and that its encrypted be with 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:03.029
 seventh and we do the arpeggio 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.030
 solís and re fa sun if rafa farrés and sun 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:07.200
 ferriz and sun 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.900
 and we came out 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.730
 as I told you if we want and want 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.970
 make a cadence a cadence is a 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.660
 rest after being lost of 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.930
 tension flow into the tonic in sun 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.930
 and psoe 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:43.050
 good friends will make many will 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.920
 study in many tutorials with all 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:49.170
 the scales is not the basic scale but 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.980
 will come later with flats and with 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.000
 sharp 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.000
 a greeting friends
