00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello to all and all these pc ferret 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.190
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.289
 today I show you how are you 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.880
 you were going to a theme on league of legends 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.530
 well then for some 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.270
 month I finally lean a few months 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.680
 a few weeks I look at the 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.810
 fashions and it's up to league of legend 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 add-on will exist so I will make you 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.219
 maybe other videos on it but 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.260
 in any case here I will be able to you 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.699
 show how we added mode then 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.699
 like this so I'm going to show you 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:48.290
 so here I am so on the setting to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.250
 day I do not know exactly what daytona 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.899
 finally you will see the date of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.220
 video output anyway I you 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.960
 learn to put customers 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.140
 custom so like this one by 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.930
 example I'm going to connect game on 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 is on the page so here we are 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 are in connection so I'm trying to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.090
 so log on to monza done I have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.709
 so or so we can see that everything is 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.130
 green and so that's where it's a sieve of 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:13.170
 cribs 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.609
 I put an end jing that's why 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.740
 than that to combine stuff at the same 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:17.369
 time for example if I use the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.380
 matchmaking 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.729
 we can see that when the announcement of a 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.649
 part has happened that we can accept it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.409
 or refuse 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.670
 there is a specific black color which 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.689
 I show you how one installs his 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.740
 so on this site 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.590
 so in fact you will have to look for your 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.279
 modes and so for example brand that's it and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.349
 there I will show you so with two 

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:47.549
 different possibilities of me than you 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:49.789
 have downloaded so how does that do and 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.560
 how to install them 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.560
 so for example 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.610
 that's when we find a game that 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.740
 looks like that so the severe because 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.040
 it to combine the djing theme and the theme 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.940
 TrÃ¨che but this example it can 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.940
 do this stuff so that's it I 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.080
 will show you 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.780
 so in fact I just noticed that 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.360
 it's not exactly the right file 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.740
 so we end up with the good fit so 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.240
 that's it, we'll start with 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.780
 simplest method for example this 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.040
 jing theme this live one gives you in 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.040
 common a link so you go on it 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.490
 so that sounds weird 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.020
 that's it so for example I leave the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.510
 here it opens me a thing we modify jean 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.760
 flint etc 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.240
 and so I just have to click on it and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.240
 click on it 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:00.860
 you are a little bit I can do 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.459
 but come out here so I louvre I them 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.000
 executed 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.430
 so if I put 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 etc and here is the jemaye the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.680
 league of legends folder and then 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.720
 I do next and I install it so here we go 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.560
 it's quite simple for this theme 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.700
 against it's themes for example 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.900
 like the braids theme that's pretty 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.510
 complex of which for example you can 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.580
 open and a half is so here you see 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.090
 that you're wondering about placing by 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.300
 example in the folders of the gaffes the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.620
 people a lot of things so I'm going 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.390
 show you for one but I'm not going 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.120
 show you for all because otherwise 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.160
 it will really be very long that finally 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.620
 this is my half a dozen minutes but I 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.850
 think you want to understand so 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.010
 So for example it talks about 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.700
 first of one of your pages to 7 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:58.370
 this is the one I have in my computer 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:04:05.480
 bah I lol is so here tell us arad 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:10.640
 project to quillan you reread the playes 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.640
 I think that's after 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.410
 lp mode 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.280
 and here we will be able to put between 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.470
 landing pages at this so does that by little 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.190
 close for all the stuff and it's going us 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.920
 to do england 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.720
 they boost the press legs so 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:42.500
 So here we have to know that the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:45.170
 site so here's this site will be in the 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.750
 description with different links here 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.750
