front of the rear wheels because somehow

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.789 
front of the rear wheels because somehow
you<00:01:29.000> tend<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.719> think<00:01:29.810> that's<00:01:30.200> going<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.500> scrape

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
you tend to think that's going to scrape

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
about how to narrow this car is but now

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.300 
about how to narrow this car is but now
in<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.849> next<00:01:44.659> obstacle<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.679> makes<00:01:46.009> sense

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
in this next obstacle it makes sense

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.490 
in this next obstacle it makes sense
because<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:47.060> have<00:01:47.479> such<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> great<00:01:48.049> view<00:01:48.469> of

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
because you have such a great view of

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.279 
because you have such a great view of
your<00:01:49.069> surroundings<00:01:49.700> as<00:01:50.329> you'd<00:01:50.659> expect<00:01:51.049> from<00:01:51.140> a

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
your surroundings as you'd expect from a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.050 
your surroundings as you'd expect from a
GUI<00:01:51.649> again<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.009> got<00:01:52.129> a<00:01:52.189> center<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:52.670> block

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
GUI again it's got a center that block

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.569 
GUI again it's got a center that block
we<00:01:53.390> add<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.509> block<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.679> funder<00:01:55.069> flock<00:01:55.310> so

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
we add a block and a funder flock so

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.899 
we add a block and a funder flock so
very<00:01:56.060> very<00:01:56.539> standard<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:58.340> for<00:01:58.579> me<00:01:58.729> is

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
very very standard and that for me is

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:12.619 
very very standard and that for me is
what<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.299> makes

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.420 

this<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.469> heel<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:13.950> obstacle<00:02:14.400> course

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
this is the heel on the obstacle course

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.970 
this is the heel on the obstacle course
and<00:02:14.939> I'm<00:02:15.900> going<00:02:16.109> to<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.469> here<00:02:16.739> without

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and I'm going to do this here without

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.550 
and I'm going to do this here without
any<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.239> tip<00:02:18.420> locks<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.870> relying<00:02:22.230> on

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
any of the tip locks just relying on

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.550 
any of the tip locks just relying on
power<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.129> torque<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.109> see<00:02:25.349> where

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
power and torque so you can see where

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.160 
power and torque so you can see where
your<00:02:25.680> two<00:02:25.980> million<00:02:26.280> boxes<00:02:26.639> go<00:02:32.900> after<00:02:33.900> spending

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
your two million boxes go after spending

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.770 
your two million boxes go after spending
some<00:02:34.439> time<00:02:34.500> behind<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.189> wheel<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.609> the<00:02:35.730> g63<00:02:36.359> I

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
some time behind the wheel of the g63 I

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.990 
some time behind the wheel of the g63 I
can<00:02:37.349> understand<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.950> expression<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.639> power

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
can understand the expression that power

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.649 
can understand the expression that power
