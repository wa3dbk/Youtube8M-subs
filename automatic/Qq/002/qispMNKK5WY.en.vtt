 bringing this map that just to close the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 summer series crossfire close no 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.789
 close the series only close the part 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.129
 confronts the team that the last map of 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.780
 conflict that we had and I wanted to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.059
 bring one here with a party with 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.640
 a check just for us to exchange an idea 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.379
 And why do you fuck me up? 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.510
 Geez speaking a prodigy that was not 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.700
 I know how I was his girlfriend, right? 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 Um, and there's a crew that should be 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.310
 wondering who is that Czech was a 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.080
 which was practically the result of the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 channel growth and the beginning of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 caramba help he had a channel 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.860
 also for those who do not know is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.880
 impossible to recognize and the first self 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.030
 I have to, I think everyone wants to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 know that you intend to vote in a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.640
 channel I'm actually going to leave the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.290
 final answer 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:37.170
 the guys look good and at the end of the day 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:40.790
 video mask is telling you what I'm there 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.259
 I said because the channel then closed was 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:49.170
 basically because of the old because the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.700
 game was dominated almost was already 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.579
 difficult to even see who was playing 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.430
 For example, look for destroy is 3 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.090
 round did not expect me to be alone in the 12th 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.310
 round 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.009
 I don't get any shit. 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.020
 no and I gave myself did not 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.119
 did nothing looked like it was trying 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.840
 sing looking looking for something 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.379
 did not happen 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.840
 andrÃ© casa is going to lose all of it will i 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.319
 I do not even think the game is connected. I might want to. 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.620
 So I was thinking of making a channel 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.629
 that was not aimed only at the cross will 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.930
 then sign the extended 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.769
 only for now on the computer yet 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.540
 does not support us to play games of the type 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.760
 butterfield business is the crank still is 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.730
 mine here too, the thing is rolling 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.170
 a noise here will end the energy of 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.610
 each shareholder is the only one that does not 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.269
 it's been a very cool thing to 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.730
 play here and if this mode that the 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.709
 Appliance is annoying to put 15 minutes 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.280
 just to exchange ideas fast here with you 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.430

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.040
 practically 24 hours or was 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.980
 I find it very difficult, but half a dozen 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.590
 head debut is talking a little bit with 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.600

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.319

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.950
 it is not easy in order to answer all 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.579
