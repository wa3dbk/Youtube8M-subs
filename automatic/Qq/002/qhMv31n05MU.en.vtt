00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.200
 so today's wish criticism the 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.879
 we take precaution because that 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.400
 a movie is really great for both of us 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.730
 because he is really nice and dark 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.410
 and it's really harder after that 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.620
 psychic or just great atmosphere 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.470
 two well-known leading actors brad 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.170
 pitt and morgan freeman and bold postage 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.420
 even came to say 3 even and yes 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.760
 the movie has the wonderful title looks 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.649
 I'm not exactly ours at the seven 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.440
 to do dwarves 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.699
 definitely not 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.840
 They like to earn theirs 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:43.019
 livelihood with everything you have to 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.019
 see 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:50.219
 sometimes it is better if you do not 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.219
 usually even looks 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:04.129
 detective william somerset looking for 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:07.430
 fragment detective david mills searched 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.020
 an entrance every hour with each other 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.340
 I 'll show you who 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.340
 friend and who is enemy 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.630
 she did not say that I am here 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.290
 caught in the market sensi in a game 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.520
 There is somewhere you want to witness 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.310
 it is clear that he is perfect 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.510
 must be insane that every sin 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.820
 punished death 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.350
 There are seven dead was as safe as 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.380
 should take a look at this 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.230
 there is nothing to inertia touched 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.570
 anger and suffering wollust 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.600
 7 we also have to deal with others 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.600
 expected 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.409
 Compare Tuesday to Tuesday morning 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.479
 either for this city get 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.490
 this will be a model example of place 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.110
 justice 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.659
 one has found two more corpses 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.840
 2000 power plants is methodically 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.259
 she is 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.259
 he has patience 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.040
 out loud 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.810
 to be over 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.640
 to install 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.640
 completed 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.610
 we bring it to the end brad pitt morgan 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.610
 freeman 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:42.189
 have you seen something like that? 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.510
 no 7 yes a serial killer of a bad one 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.900
 Cat and mouse play with the police 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.870
 is not brand new right now 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.120
 history but how it is structured 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.959
 that's something special in the film 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.079
 yes, this killer pretends to be 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.750
 seven so-called deadly sins 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:07.629
 greedy inertia lust lustiness envy 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:11.980
 and anger and that means full of reid 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:15.510
 for example da da da, he would have someone 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.519
 long time and that he is incredible 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.200
 brutal killer of the occasional 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.790
 or sometimes for a long time 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.290
 somehow slows people down 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.810
 it's really great 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.340
 was exactly like the one over a year 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.780
 for over a year and then does too 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.060
 take a picture of you as you always do 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.290
 either always fuller or always 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.209
 so he got narrower 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.840
 different approaches to the in 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.930
 the murder 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.959
 So it's really pretty hard 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.340
 and the whole thing is pretty 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.379
 heavily staged by david fincher 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.440
 So it seems ekelfaktor for humans 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.949
 partly yes absolutely 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.299
 and it is a very dark atmosphere 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:58.560
 consistently it always rains a lot 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.690
 understood digested it is wet and and 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.419
 yes and it's all very, very somehow 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.760
 no perspective it is simply the states 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:11.590
 even those who are so scary perverse 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.639
 you are not staged at all 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.639
 you have to explain yourself 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.020
 The film worked alongside on all 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.280
 for a fierce final too 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.190
 that of course not allowed to reveal 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.960
 and you should definitely have seen 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.950
 this movie so seven right one 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.570
 violent psycho thriller 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.310
 I also find it interesting how he likes that 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.230
 police so the hints around that 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.310
 get ahead so you can tell 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.100
 directly that it is a very clever claus of 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:48.560
 police as well as puzzles on the anyway 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.480
 yes, it would have to solve this partially 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.570
 is the second film by david fincher 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.930
 been after the alien 3 he had as 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.240
 first turned and then came yet 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.310
 many other big movie so fightclub 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.150
 he has become a cult, too 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.620
 brad pitt shot and the game with 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.970
 michael jackson will or we will 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.390
 Shortly tend to shake delusions though 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.680
 so the remake of him so somebody 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.050
 always like a bit like that 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.090
 the psycho level 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.710
 that's the panic room for that too 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.160
 super with super something seems synonymous 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.180
 really great movie dvd version 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.370
 Of course, there is also 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.160
 So that's the flower here 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.900
 Kindly sent was also 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.000
 not the dvd release of the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.020
 West Indian then also a lot 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.880
 Extras on it 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.800
 So they are all taken over here as well 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.810
 were on the blu-ray and yes, there 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.620
 I would say there is hardly a 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.410
 wish open 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.590
 although the dvd still a few extras 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.220
 has more than the older version needs 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.900
 have to watch 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:59.750
 this is one in his shoe 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:01.580
 there is in this book about the 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:07.220
 it was my previous version my 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:10.460
 as before the version and from the outside almost 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.490
 just like that but only has a dvd player 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.890
 also has an extra Wednesday 2 anyway 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.630
 has standing in the 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:22.100
 that's exactly what it's called 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.610
 platinum edition and that's the special 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.110
 edition 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.370
 the jury has the most of all this 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.680
 crammed we have everything here 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.320
 So also a great picture belongs to audio 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.659
 have commentary alternative of the season 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.210
 the dvds too 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:41.900
 picture gallery audio commentary kruse 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.090
 great making ofs interesting this too 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.550
 the different camera angles 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.650
 it can bernd itself from the camera 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.120
 Select services and trailer travel 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.110
 shot in the scene from several angles 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.750
 have exactly 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.210
 funny extra so a great citizen so 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.240
 definitely stuffed yes and also 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.639
 especially a very nice dolby digital 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.319
 sound like the pattering sound 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.110
 for example rain themselves exceedingly 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.879
 come and as is already the picture 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:14.029
 Of course I also drobny that Canada 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:16.949
 So expect if you are a fan of 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:18.150
 definitely harder two land where 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:20.550
 pretty much goes to the point 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.620
 on the psycho level too and son then 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.360
 are you at the movie just right lifted 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.080
 Immediately fans will get this movie too 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.629
 Of course, joy was not like that 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:35.789
 brutal like songs 21 but maybe 

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:38.219
 even a little or even that 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:41.460
 silence of the lambs city is indeed 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:42.629
 so a bit serial killer and so that 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.479
 you can not compare 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:48.330
 great movie of only the ten points 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:50.520
 can get a really great 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.339
 psycho thriller and for the extras there 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.779
 it from me new points 

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:59.870
 Again , we are one of 

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:59.870
 me too 14.6 street rooms boring 

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:07.469
 So many thanks for watching or was 

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:10.370
 a joy 

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:10.370
 great go on
