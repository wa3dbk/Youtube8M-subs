and what we're going to do is instead of

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.139 
and what we're going to do is instead of
just<00:01:41.590> resting<00:01:42.590> because<00:01:43.070> when<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:43.820> rent

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
something it doesn't take the pesticides

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.810 
something it doesn't take the pesticides
off<00:01:46.880> that's<00:01:47.240> because<00:01:47.630> they<00:01:47.840> make<00:01:48.020> pesticides

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
off that's because they make pesticides

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.020 
off that's because they make pesticides
that<00:01:49.820> are<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.920> can't<00:01:52.280> be<00:01:52.399> washed<00:01:52.579> away<00:01:52.759> by

that are that can't be washed away by
the<00:01:53.060> rain<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:54.020> have<00:01:54.229> to<00:01:54.380> use<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.770> chemical

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
the rain so you have to use a chemical

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.399 
the rain so you have to use a chemical
in<00:01:55.610> order<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:57.700> get<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.789> pesticides<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.569> so

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
in order to get the pesticides on so
