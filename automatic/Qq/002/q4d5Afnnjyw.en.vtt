batteries not triple a double a
batteries<00:03:32.590> these<00:03:33.519> all<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:34.060> go<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.239> the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
batteries these all do go to the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.060 
batteries these all do go to the
keyboard<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.080> does<00:03:35.230> take<00:03:35.260> quite<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.830> bit<00:03:36.010> of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
keyboard so it does take quite a bit of

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.590 
keyboard so it does take quite a bit of
battery<00:03:36.430> power<00:03:36.459> but<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:36.880> heard<00:03:37.209> it's<00:03:37.420> got<00:03:37.570> a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
battery power but I heard it's got a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.930 
battery power but I heard it's got a
good<00:03:37.810> battery<00:03:38.170> life<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.739> think<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.519> batteries

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
good battery life I think the batteries

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.830 
good battery life I think the batteries

really want to take up to so guys that's

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.439 
really want to take up to so guys that's
it<00:04:51.660> for<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.990> unboxing<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.130> logitech<00:04:53.729> MX

revolution<00:04:54.660> mouse<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.770> keyboard<00:04:55.889> combo<00:04:56.720> Oh<00:04:57.720> a

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
revolution mouse and keyboard combo Oh a

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.219 
revolution mouse and keyboard combo Oh a
this<00:04:58.650> retails<00:04:59.039> for<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.550> little<00:04:59.789> more<00:05:00.030> than<00:05:00.229> 160

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
this retails for a little more than 160

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.680 
this retails for a little more than 160
i<00:05:01.259> think<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:01.560> was<00:05:01.620> 160<00:05:02.460> might<00:05:02.669> have<00:05:02.759> been<00:05:02.849> 170

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
i think it was 160 might have been 170

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.770 
i think it was 160 might have been 170
but<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:05.099> it<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.310> on<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.610> pricey<00:05:06.000> side<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:06.599> terms

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
but so it is on the pricey side in terms

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.270 
but so it is on the pricey side in terms
of<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.080> mouse<00:05:07.259> keyboard<00:05:07.560> combo<00:05:08.210> but<00:05:09.620> i<00:05:10.620> really

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
of a mouse keyboard combo but i really

of a mouse keyboard combo but i really
