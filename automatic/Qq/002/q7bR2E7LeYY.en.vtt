really<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> big<00:02:36.390> difference<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:38.010> closure<00:02:38.849> does

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
really a big difference and closure does

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.630 
really a big difference and closure does
come<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.599> baby<00:02:39.870> hairs<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.799> see<00:02:43.640> to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
come in the baby hairs you can see to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.500 
come in the baby hairs you can see to
give<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:44.940> an<00:02:45.060> even<00:02:45.329> more<00:02:47.510> unnatural

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
give it an even more unnatural

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.240 
give it an even more unnatural
appearance

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.699 

yeah<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.780> guys<00:02:54.900> should<00:02:55.079> really<00:02:55.170> check<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.590> out

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.539 
it
I<00:02:56.280> think<00:02:56.849> closures<00:02:57.329> are<00:02:57.569> really<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.549> great

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
I think closures are really like great

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.150 
I think closures are really like great
for<00:02:59.900> people<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.110> do<00:03:01.290> not<00:03:01.349> want<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> leave<00:03:01.920> any

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
for people that do not want to leave any

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.259 
for people that do not want to leave any
of<00:03:02.280> their<00:03:02.459> here<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> which<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.599> find<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.709> be<00:03:04.739> very

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
of their here I which I find to be very

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.640 
of their here I which I find to be very
difficult<00:03:06.269> when<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.420> try<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.660> do<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.319> I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
difficult when I try to do that so I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.410 
difficult when I try to do that so I
prefer<00:03:08.310> closures<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.519> greatest
