for<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.970> things<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.500> use

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
for a lot of things like you can use

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.400 
for a lot of things like you can use
them<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:28.980> FLL<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.880> various<00:00:30.210> missions<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
them in FLL for various missions but the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.780 
them in FLL for various missions but the
reason<00:00:31.740> why<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.009> making<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.430> video<00:00:32.700> today

is a Lego linear actuator the third is
pneumatic<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.180> don't<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.570> any<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
pneumatic and if you don't have any of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.990 
pneumatic and if you don't have any of
those<00:01:01.020> specialty<00:01:01.620> pieces<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.730> fourth

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
those specialty pieces in the fourth

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
those specialty pieces in the fourth
section<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.409> teaching<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.890> how

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
section I'm going to be teaching you how

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.219 
section I'm going to be teaching you how
to<00:01:05.129> build<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.519> linear<00:01:05.820> actuator<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.900> just

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to build a linear actuator with just

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.500 
to build a linear actuator with just
common<00:01:07.740> Technic<00:01:08.250> parts<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.090> type<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
common Technic parts the first type of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170 
common Technic parts the first type of
linear<00:01:09.780> actuator<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.770> rack-and-pinion<00:01:11.180> this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
linear actuator is rack-and-pinion this

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.420 
linear actuator is rack-and-pinion this
is<00:01:12.390> definitely<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.200> easiest<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
is definitely the easiest way to do it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
is definitely the easiest way to do it
and<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> way<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> recommend<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.409> if

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and this is the way I recommend it if

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.060 
and this is the way I recommend it if
you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.790> 13<00:01:18.360> module<00:01:18.810> rack<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.619> which

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
you have the 13 module rack here which

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.179 
you have the 13 module rack here which
comes<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> ev3<00:01:21.030> expansion<00:01:21.900> set<00:01:22.170> now<00:01:22.799> how

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
comes with the ev3 expansion set now how

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.969 
comes with the ev3 expansion set now how
it<00:01:23.340> works<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.990> motor<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.950> spins

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it works is you have a motor that spins

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.760 
it works is you have a motor that spins
a<00:01:26.759> smaller<00:01:27.210> pinion<00:01:27.750> gear<00:01:27.990> which<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.590> your

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
a smaller pinion gear which is your

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.920 
a smaller pinion gear which is your
traditional<00:01:29.280> type<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.520> circle<00:01:30.030> gear<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> then

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
traditional type of circle gear and then

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
traditional type of circle gear and then
the<00:01:31.079> rack<00:01:31.259> gear<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.740> basically<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.579> toothed<00:01:32.850> bar

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the rack gear is basically a toothed bar

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
the rack gear is basically a toothed bar
which<00:01:33.720> slides<00:01:34.170> forward<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.009> backward<00:01:35.460> when

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
which slides forward and backward when

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
which slides forward and backward when
the<00:01:36.000> pinion<00:01:36.390> gear<00:01:36.420> rotates<00:01:37.130> when<00:01:38.130> you're

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the pinion gear rotates when you're

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
the pinion gear rotates when you're
building<00:01:38.520> make<00:01:39.119> sure<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.750> pinion<00:01:40.140> gear

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
building make sure that your pinion gear

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.100 
building make sure that your pinion gear
securely<00:01:41.189> meshes<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.090> rack<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.600> without

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
securely meshes the rack here without

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.580 
securely meshes the rack here without
any<00:01:43.590> sort<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.100> skipping<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.170> for<00:01:46.170> extra

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
any sort of skipping and for extra

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.429 
any sort of skipping and for extra
strength<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.610> add<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> worm<00:01:48.479> gear<00:01:48.509> which

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
strength you can add a worm gear which

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.980 
strength you can add a worm gear which
increases<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> gear<00:01:50.460> reduction<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.180> reduces

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
increases the gear reduction and reduces

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.499 
increases the gear reduction and reduces
any<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.680> backlash<00:01:52.920> now<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.420> in

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
any kind of backlash now as you see in

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
any kind of backlash now as you see in
this<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.840> video<00:01:55.200> clip<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.009> worm<00:01:56.250> gear

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
this little video clip the worm gear

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.120 
this little video clip the worm gear
drastically<00:01:57.390> slows<00:01:57.810> down<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.439> mechanism

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
drastically slows down the mechanism

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.850 
drastically slows down the mechanism
what<00:01:59.729> gives<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.329> lot<00:02:00.570> more<00:02:00.630> driving<00:02:01.500> torque

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
what gives it a lot more driving torque

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.370 
what gives it a lot more driving torque
or<00:02:02.100> power<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.540> some<00:02:03.719> applications

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
or power which for some applications

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.100 
or power which for some applications
would<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.920> very<00:02:05.520> beneficial<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.930> also

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
would be very beneficial and it also

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.499 
would be very beneficial and it also
gets<00:02:07.500> rid<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.770> any<00:02:08.009> backlash<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.000> what<00:02:09.360> this

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
gets rid of any backlash and what this

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.990 
gets rid of any backlash and what this
means<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> heavy<00:02:11.760> weight

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
means is that if you have a heavy weight

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.050 
means is that if you have a heavy weight
it<00:02:12.390> can't<00:02:12.810> push<00:02:13.110> down<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.739> motor<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.520> only

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
it can't push down on the motor the only

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.210 
it can't push down on the motor the only
way<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.599> mechanism<00:02:16.140> will<00:02:16.290> move<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.830> if<00:02:17.099> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
way the mechanism will move is if the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.240 
way the mechanism will move is if the
motor<00:02:17.489> drives<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.150> mechanism<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.860> second

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
motor drives the mechanism the second

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.460 
motor drives the mechanism the second
type<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.550> linear<00:02:20.730> actuator<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.989> use<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.230> Lego

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
type of linear actuator is to use a Lego

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.740 
type of linear actuator is to use a Lego
linear<00:02:22.890> actuator<00:02:23.129> these<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.330> actually

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
linear actuator these are actually

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.470 
linear actuator these are actually
pre-made<00:02:25.319> elements<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.640> are<00:02:26.760> made<00:02:26.940> by<00:02:26.970> Lego

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
pre-made elements that are made by Lego

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.300 
pre-made elements that are made by Lego
and<00:02:27.810> they're<00:02:28.230> available<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.920> many<00:02:29.220> different

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and they're available in many different

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.430 
and they're available in many different
technic<00:02:30.090> sets<00:02:30.360> out<00:02:30.599> there<00:02:30.870> today<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
technic sets out there today and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.250 
technic sets out there today and
basically<00:02:32.400> how<00:02:32.670> these<00:02:32.849> work<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:34.019> motor

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
basically how these work is the motor

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.470 
basically how these work is the motor
the<00:02:34.650> rotating<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.819> motor<00:02:36.030> will<00:02:36.209> hook<00:02:36.360> up

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the rotating of the motor will hook up

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.570 
the rotating of the motor will hook up
to<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> shaft<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> back<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.860> rotate<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.400> and

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
to a shaft in the back and rotate it and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.770 
to a shaft in the back and rotate it and
the<00:02:39.269> element<00:02:39.840> will<00:02:39.989> actually<00:02:40.319> convert<00:02:40.739> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
the element will actually convert the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.050 
the element will actually convert the
rotary<00:02:42.780> motion<00:02:42.900> into<00:02:43.410> linear<00:02:43.739> motion<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:44.879> you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
rotary motion into linear motion for you

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.040 
rotary motion into linear motion for you
so<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.360> don't<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.810> worry<00:02:45.959> about

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
so you don't have to worry about

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.410 
so you don't have to worry about
building<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.650> fancy<00:02:46.890> mechanism<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.790> these

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
building a fancy mechanism and these

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.259 
building a fancy mechanism and these
come<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:48.810> two<00:02:48.870> sizes<00:02:49.230> large<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.489> small<00:02:50.819> you'll

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
come in two sizes large and small you'll

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.970 
come in two sizes large and small you'll
see<00:02:51.510> here<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.840> I'm<00:02:52.140> using<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.650> small<00:02:52.950> one

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
see here that I'm using the small one

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.630 
see here that I'm using the small one
the<00:02:53.510> third<00:02:54.510> type<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.840> linear<00:02:55.260> actuator<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.160> to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
the third type of linear actuator is to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.770 
the third type of linear actuator is to
use<00:02:56.790> pneumatics

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
use pneumatics

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.869 
use pneumatics
now<00:02:58.349> there's<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.950> whole<00:02:59.190> pneumatic<00:02:59.730> it

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
now there's a whole pneumatic it

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.790 
now there's a whole pneumatic it
available<00:03:00.239> through<00:03:00.450> Lego<00:03:00.870> education<00:03:01.620> I'll

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
available through Lego education I'll

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.410 
available through Lego education I'll
put<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.129> part<00:03:02.370> number<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.760> right<00:03:02.970> now<00:03:03.150> and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
put the part number up right now and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.660 
put the part number up right now and
this<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.560> definitely<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.250> most<00:03:05.370> difficult

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
this is definitely the most difficult

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.960 
this is definitely the most difficult
most<00:03:06.540> expensive<00:03:07.230> least<00:03:07.830> reliable<00:03:08.220> least

common way to build a linear actuator

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.339 
common way to build a linear actuator
system<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.420> personally<00:03:12.930> don't<00:03:13.170> recommend

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
system and I personally don't recommend

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.470 
system and I personally don't recommend
it<00:03:13.769> unless<00:03:14.370> you're<00:03:14.610> really<00:03:14.760> keen<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.239> use

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
it unless you're really keen to use

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.170 
it unless you're really keen to use
pneumatics<00:03:16.230> how<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.069> works<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.879> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
pneumatics how it works is that the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.210 
pneumatics how it works is that the
rotary<00:03:18.510> motion<00:03:18.599> goes<00:03:19.230> into<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.800> compressor

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
rotary motion goes into the compressor

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.750 
rotary motion goes into the compressor
to<00:03:20.909> pump<00:03:21.239> air<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.200> then<00:03:22.860> there's<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.159> piston

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
to pump air and then there's a piston

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.759 
to pump air and then there's a piston
that<00:03:24.239> yellow<00:03:24.569> part<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.049> video<00:03:25.290> there<00:03:25.590> that

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
that yellow part in the video there that

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.160 
that yellow part in the video there that
will<00:03:26.340> actually<00:03:26.370> take<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.150> air<00:03:27.420> pressure<00:03:27.780> and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
will actually take this air pressure and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.410 
will actually take this air pressure and
when<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> air<00:03:28.890> moves<00:03:29.220> into<00:03:29.549> it<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.970> makes<00:03:30.269> a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
when the air moves into it it makes a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.839 
when the air moves into it it makes a
piston<00:03:30.870> extend<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.709> contract<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.370> that's

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
piston extend and contract and that's

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.539 
piston extend and contract and that's
where<00:03:33.030> your<00:03:33.150> linear<00:03:33.480> motion<00:03:33.959> comes<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:35.370> now

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
where your linear motion comes in so now

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.149 
where your linear motion comes in so now
for<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.940> fourth<00:03:36.239> method<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.560> don't<00:03:37.950> have

for the fourth method if you don't have
any<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.700> specialty<00:03:39.180> elements<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.959> make

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
any of the specialty elements to make

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080 
any of the specialty elements to make
any<00:03:40.349> of<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.650> mechanisms<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.489> mentioned

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
any of the mechanisms that I mentioned

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.240 
any of the mechanisms that I mentioned
and<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.599> first<00:03:42.840> three<00:03:43.110> ones<00:03:43.290> don't<00:03:43.890> fret

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
and the first three ones don't fret

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.869 
and the first three ones don't fret
because<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.360> make<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.780> linear<00:03:46.319> actuator

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
because you can make a linear actuator

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.750 
because you can make a linear actuator
using<00:03:47.879> just<00:03:48.239> ordinary<00:03:48.959> common<00:03:49.470> parts<00:03:49.890> many<00:03:50.610> of

using just ordinary common parts many of
which<00:03:50.909> are<00:03:51.090> found<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.629> ev3<00:03:51.959> set<00:03:52.470> all<00:03:52.980> you

which are found in the ev3 set all you

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.390 
which are found in the ev3 set all you
really<00:03:53.430> need<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.970> Technic<00:03:54.569> beams<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.400> this

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
really need is Technic beams and this

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.789 
really need is Technic beams and this
may<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.849> little<00:03:57.299> bit<00:03:57.480> tricky<00:03:57.780> but<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.590> uses

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
may be a little bit tricky but it uses

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.160 
may be a little bit tricky but it uses
some<00:03:59.189> very<00:03:59.220> common<00:03:59.730> pieces<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.780> once<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.049> get

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
some very common pieces and once you get

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.949 
some very common pieces and once you get
the<00:04:01.260> hang<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:01.950> not<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.189> bad<00:04:02.549> it

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
the hang of it it's not that bad it

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.869 
the hang of it it's not that bad it
consists<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.049> two<00:04:04.319> Technic<00:04:04.799> beams<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.730> are

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
consists of two Technic beams that are

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.179 
consists of two Technic beams that are
joined<00:04:06.180> by<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.510> peg<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.260> middle<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.709> the

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
joined by a peg in the middle and the

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.460 
joined by a peg in the middle and the
motor<00:04:08.400> rotates<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.299> it's<00:04:09.659> kind<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.019> like<00:04:10.319> if

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
motor rotates and it's kind of like if

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.050 
motor rotates and it's kind of like if
you<00:04:10.560> can<00:04:10.709> imagine<00:04:10.739> it's<00:04:11.250> kind<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.489> like<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.700> pair

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
you can imagine it's kind of like a pair

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.020 
you can imagine it's kind of like a pair
of<00:04:12.090> scissors<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:13.110> way<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.349> in<00:04:13.439> a<00:04:13.670> way<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.819> moves

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
of scissors the way it in a way it moves

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.539 
of scissors the way it in a way it moves
so<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:15.689> motor<00:04:15.989> rotates<00:04:16.229> one<00:04:16.739> end<00:04:16.949> and<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
so the motor rotates one end and the

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.410 
so the motor rotates one end and the
other<00:04:17.579> end<00:04:17.790> pushing

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
other end pushing

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.080 
other end pushing
up<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.890> one<00:04:20.190> thing<00:04:20.460> is<00:04:20.610> you<00:04:20.760> need<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:20.970> make

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
up and the one thing is you need to make

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.300 
up and the one thing is you need to make
sure<00:04:21.390> there's<00:04:21.630> some<00:04:21.690> kind<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.140> rail<00:04:22.380> or<00:04:22.980> this

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
sure there's some kind of rail or this

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.400 
sure there's some kind of rail or this
mechanism<00:04:23.670> won't<00:04:24.150> really<00:04:24.390> be<00:04:24.690> linear<00:04:25.080> motion

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
mechanism won't really be linear motion

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.440 
mechanism won't really be linear motion
no<00:04:25.560> cottages<00:04:26.130> flop<00:04:26.430> around<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.060> make<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.180> mess

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
no cottages flop around and make a mess

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.960 
no cottages flop around and make a mess
and<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.900> can<00:04:28.050> also<00:04:28.290> add<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> worm<00:04:28.980> gear<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.820> this

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
and you can also add a worm gear to this

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.720 
and you can also add a worm gear to this
mechanism<00:04:30.630> for<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.350> same<00:04:31.560> reasons<00:04:32.130> as<00:04:32.250> before

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
mechanism for the same reasons as before

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.180 
mechanism for the same reasons as before
to<00:04:33.240> add<00:04:33.420> more<00:04:33.750> torque<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.950> reduce

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
to add more torque and to reduce

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.970 
to add more torque and to reduce
Backlund<00:04:36.080> thank<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.260> for<00:04:37.470> watching<00:04:37.860> this

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
Backlund thank you for watching this

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.850 
Backlund thank you for watching this
video<00:04:38.340> my<00:04:39.090> next<00:04:39.390> tutorial<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.230> probably<00:04:40.650> going

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
video my next tutorial is probably going

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.740 
video my next tutorial is probably going
to<00:04:41.010> be<00:04:41.130> about<00:04:41.250> worm<00:04:41.760> gears<00:04:42.090> why<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.420> should

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
to be about worm gears why you should

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.560 
to be about worm gears why you should
use<00:04:42.990> them<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.380> how<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.070> make<00:04:44.340> them<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:45.300> I'll

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
use them and how to make them so I'll

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.710 
use them and how to make them so I'll
see<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.840> next<00:04:45.930> time<00:04:46.320> bye
