you know the inside smells like this I
can't<00:02:33.010> even<00:02:33.130> look<00:02:33.489> I'm<00:02:34.360> gonna<00:02:34.540> I'm<00:02:35.140> gonna<00:02:35.260> be

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
can't even look I'm gonna I'm gonna be

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.630 
can't even look I'm gonna I'm gonna be
keeping<00:02:35.709> all<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.040> end

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.320 

so<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:39.970> soap<00:02:40.810> here<00:02:42.540> gets<00:02:43.540> its<00:02:43.780> color<00:02:44.049> from

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
so this soap here gets its color from

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:54.740 
so this soap here gets its color from
the<00:02:46.330> milk<00:02:47.400> pumpkin<00:02:48.510> spices<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.980> ingredients

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.569 

so<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.989> this<00:02:56.079> is<00:02:56.290> not<00:02:56.470> an<00:02:56.709> artificial<00:02:57.160> color

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
so that this is not an artificial color

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.699 
so that this is not an artificial color
this<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> natural<00:02:58.900> color<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.500> soap<00:02:59.890> and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
this is a natural color of the soap and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.500 
this is a natural color of the soap and
there<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:02.980> was<00:03:03.280> going<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:04.000> make<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.209> whipped

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
there I was going to make a whipped

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.240 
there I was going to make a whipped
cream<00:03:04.840> frosting<00:03:05.200> for<00:03:05.890> it

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
cream frosting for it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.250 
cream frosting for it

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
but I was trying to make my whipped

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.180 
but I was trying to make my whipped
cream<00:03:08.470> frosting<00:03:08.850> cold<00:03:09.850> processed<00:03:10.390> frosting

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
cream frosting cold processed frosting

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.190 
cream frosting cold processed frosting
the<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:13.030> tripped<00:03:13.690> over<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.230> cord<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:16.390> my<00:03:16.660> stick

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200

moisturizing experience it also has some
added<00:04:16.959> role<00:04:17.229> not<00:04:18.160> wrong<00:04:19.769> Organic<00:04:20.769> cream<00:04:21.130> and

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
added role not wrong Organic cream and

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.430 
added role not wrong Organic cream and
lots<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.320> organic<00:04:24.010> milk<00:04:24.900> usually<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.960> do<00:04:26.050> use

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
lots of organic milk usually I do use

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.930 
lots of organic milk usually I do use
for<00:04:26.680> all<00:04:26.740> but<00:04:26.979> I'm<00:04:27.070> not<00:04:27.250> using<00:04:27.430> her<00:04:27.700> all<00:04:27.789> this

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
for all but I'm not using her all this

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.770 
for all but I'm not using her all this
time<00:04:28.240> because<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.720> farm<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.229> I<00:04:29.260> get<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
time because the farm that I get the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.400 
time because the farm that I get the
organic<00:04:31.780> milk<00:04:32.169> from<00:04:32.470> is<00:04:33.130> out<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.760> production

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
organic milk from is out of production

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.840 
organic milk from is out of production
for<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.470> four-week<00:04:35.860> period<00:04:36.190> but<00:04:36.550> they<00:04:36.669> should

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
for a four-week period but they should

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.310 
for a four-week period but they should
be<00:04:36.940> back<00:04:36.970> soon

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.140 

so<00:04:41.320> that's<00:04:41.770> why<00:04:41.889> I<00:04:41.950> added<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.370> extra<00:04:42.490> cream

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
so that's why I added the extra cream

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.129 
so that's why I added the extra cream
because<00:04:43.600> when<00:04:43.990> milk<00:04:44.229> is<00:04:45.450> homogenized<00:04:46.450> it

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
because when milk is homogenized it

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.870 
because when milk is homogenized it
loses<00:04:47.710> some<00:04:47.950> of<00:04:47.979> its<00:04:48.220> fat<00:04:49.350> stream<00:04:50.350> is<00:04:50.889> pure<00:04:51.639> fat

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
loses some of its fat stream is pure fat

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.110 
loses some of its fat stream is pure fat
so<00:04:52.419> if<00:04:52.539> you<00:04:52.630> just<00:04:52.780> add<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:53.020> little<00:04:53.110> bit<00:04:53.349> back<00:04:53.590> in

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
so if you just add a little bit back in

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.950 
so if you just add a little bit back in
there

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
there

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.620 
there
and<00:04:56.889> if<00:04:57.009> you<00:04:57.100> add<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.280> little<00:04:57.520> bit<00:04:57.639> more<00:04:57.759> even

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
and if you add a little bit more even

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:16.340 
and if you add a little bit more even
better

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.220 

here<00:05:17.350> they<00:05:17.530> are

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.930
