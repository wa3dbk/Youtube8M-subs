00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.210
 - Hi Jakob! - Joltter 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.900
 - And this is the World Cup with Unisport. And we're back. 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.270
 - We're back for some really bad predictions around 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.580
 Brazil - Croatia fight. - And we do that with today 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.820
 By predicting the outcome of England - Italy fight 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.090
 By playing a game of FIFA. 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.630
 And as you can see, I am England 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 Jay Mike is Italy, so let's play a game of FIFA! 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.960
 Let's get started! 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.020
 - Where do they play? Don't they play in Manaus? Yes! Manaus! 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.040
 - Do you know what Manaus means in Finnish? - No? 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.430
 That means exorcism. 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.670
 When there is devil inside your body and one comes and drives it out. 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.850
 - Theo Walcott? He is not in the World Cup? 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.600
 It's cheating! - Haha, that's bending the rules. 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.750
 And you know what? I HAVE NO RULES! 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.100
 - Oh oh, watch him! Oh no! 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.390
 Theo Walcott is through ... HEY, JUDGMENT! 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.300
 It would have been a penalty in Brazil - the Croatia match. 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.650
 What do you think the right match will be? It ends up like this one, so we have to see 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.410
 what it gets. That's why we play, Jay Mike. 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.100
 - Oh no! - What a beautiful attack! 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.670
 - WHAT IS THIS? SCOR! 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.190
 Offside. There is offside! 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.060
 You shouldn't play it safe, you have to bet everything, and you did, 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.250
 Oh no! 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.940
 Øøøv! - Jay Mike, get started! 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.790
 - Oops. - Clearly none of my players will be there. 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.480
 - It was the best day of my life! 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.250
 And I've had some good days. - But it was Theo Walcott ... 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.780
 Haha, Joga B ... Wait, I see Brazil or England, I don't know. 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.720
 Ah, it's too easy for me. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500
 NO! 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.040
 Jay Mike, this is a joke. 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.860
 I mean, classic goalie drop. 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.360
 OH NO! 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.540
 WOW! Penalty ... That ... If it's not a penalty kick ... 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.100
 Dommeeeer! 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.880
 OK, so 2-1. A little lucky goal for me. 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.120
 - You've had the most shots. - Of course. 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.260
 I was a goalie once. That's why I'm so bad. 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.590
 - What a pass! - But it was a good handover. 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.770
 No, no, no, no - not him! 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.040
 Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.190
 Haha, Jay Mike you take MY glasses on ... 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.780
 It's wild move! - I know you would have used them. 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.420
 But I scored a lob with Balotelli and they have camouflage on it 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.700
 I do not care. 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.120
 There is no offside ... - I take off my glasses. 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.190
 OK, I'll put on the glasses again. 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.790
 For Mario Balotelli tear things apart! 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.190
 OK, I know I should have taken the shirt off, but you know ... 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.430
 There is a little difference between me and Mario Balotelli, it just says. 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.520
 Oh no, D-Studge. What are you doing? No! 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.640
 What a beautiful goal! You may wear the glasses. 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.780
 It was a good goal, but ... - Shh! Ladies and gentlemen ... 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.550
 It's about time. 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.850
 Like that. - Oh my God! 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.130
 You know the man, the legend. It's Andrea Pirlo! 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.950
 OK, OK. He doesn't like angel ... Arh, why do I focus 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.060
 - Wayne Rooney knows how to lob! 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.240
 Why do I focus on shutting down your players? It was stupid. 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.140
 So, Joltter, I think all I want to say is that 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.740
 I wear your sunglasses, because Italy won 5-4, 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.580
 according to our struggle, and if so, I'd like to see it! 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.280
 It will be a good match, especially if 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.930
 Sir. Camouflage himself, Mario Balotelli makes hattrick exactly like Wayne Rooney 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.890
 So what do you think the fight will be? It probably won't be 5-4. 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.880
 Jacob, it's 5-4, that's why we played the game! 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.450
 But where do you think? Tell us this below. 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.570
 And say if you want to see more FIFA. - Yes, because we love FIFA. 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.860
 - We love football. - And we love the World Cup. 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.550
 - Stay tuned, we go! 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.850
 - See you later! 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.280
 Did you know that you can use it as a mirror? 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.480
 - I think it's time you leave the picture now ...
