playing<00:01:25.560> some<00:01:25.710> starcraft<00:01:25.830> 2

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.770 

alright<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.490> we've<00:01:34.610> got<00:01:34.790> starcraft<00:01:35.210> 2<00:01:35.450> loaded

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
alright so we've got starcraft 2 loaded

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.240 
alright so we've got starcraft 2 loaded
up<00:01:35.900> we're<00:01:36.260> going<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.470> be<00:01:36.530> using<00:01:36.560> fraps<00:01:37.040> to

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
up we're going to be using fraps to

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.770 
up we're going to be using fraps to
measure<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.520> frame<00:01:37.850> rate<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:38.480> also<00:01:38.630> have

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
measure a frame rate and we also have

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.990 
measure a frame rate and we also have
the<00:01:39.110> software<00:01:39.590> from<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.890> killer<00:01:40.100> n<00:01:40.280> IC<00:01:40.700> card

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the software from the killer n IC card

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.790 
the software from the killer n IC card
installed<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.020> cards<00:01:42.260> not<00:01:42.380> installed<00:01:42.710> yet

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
installed the cards not installed yet

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.380 
installed the cards not installed yet
but<00:01:43.130> we'll<00:01:43.310> be<00:01:43.400> using<00:01:43.550> that<00:01:43.760> software<00:01:44.030> to

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
going to see what sort of performance

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.450 
going to see what sort of performance
change<00:04:30.110> we<00:04:30.290> get<00:04:30.470> after<00:04:31.070> making<00:04:31.250> those

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
change we get after making those

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.379 
change we get after making those
upgrades

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.719

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
so with the radeon HD 5770 installed

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.429 
so with the radeon HD 5770 installed
we've<00:04:40.879> now<00:04:41.029> loaded<00:04:41.330> up<00:04:41.449> starcraft<00:04:41.779> again<00:04:42.169> and

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:42.439 
we've now loaded up starcraft again and

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.950 
we've now loaded up starcraft again and
the<00:04:42.800> first<00:04:43.099> and<00:04:43.309> most<00:04:43.369> apparent<00:04:43.909> change<00:04:43.969> is

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
the first and most apparent change is

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.049 
the first and most apparent change is
that<00:04:45.379> starcraft<00:04:45.889> is<00:04:46.129> automatically<00:04:46.610> reset

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:47.059 
that starcraft is automatically reset

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:48.909 
that starcraft is automatically reset
all<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.240> our<00:04:47.479> video<00:04:47.749> settings<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:48.349> we're<00:04:48.800> now

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
all of our video settings so we're now

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.950

looking<00:06:14.659> at<00:06:14.779> our<00:06:14.930> killer<00:06:15.560> network<00:06:15.889> manager

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
looking at our killer network manager

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.100 
looking at our killer network manager
here<00:06:16.610> we<00:06:16.759> can<00:06:16.939> see<00:06:17.120> that<00:06:17.300> throughout<00:06:17.930> the

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
here we can see that throughout the

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.110 
here we can see that throughout the
course<00:06:18.349> of<00:06:18.469> most<00:06:18.650> of<00:06:18.740> the<00:06:18.800> game<00:06:19.039> they<00:06:19.639> kept<00:06:19.999> the

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
course of most of the game they kept the

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.779 
course of most of the game they kept the
pings<00:06:20.419> pretty<00:06:21.139> low<00:06:21.460> definitely<00:06:22.460> didn't<00:06:22.669> go

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
pings pretty low definitely didn't go

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.119 
pings pretty low definitely didn't go
above<00:06:23.029> 150<00:06:23.599> definitely<00:06:24.560> wasn't<00:06:24.710> hitting<00:06:25.039> the

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
above 150 definitely wasn't hitting the

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.519 
above 150 definitely wasn't hitting the
300<00:06:25.699> ping<00:06:26.419> spikes<00:06:26.810> that<00:06:27.050> we<00:06:27.169> were<00:06:27.259> getting

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:27.529 
300 ping spikes that we were getting

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:29.619 
300 ping spikes that we were getting
with<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:27.830> built-in<00:06:28.490> network<00:06:28.789> card<00:06:29.060> did<00:06:29.479> have

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
with the built-in network card did have

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.320 
with the built-in network card did have
one<00:06:29.810> time<00:06:30.050> when<00:06:30.199> it<00:06:30.289> jumped<00:06:30.560> up<00:06:30.650> to<00:06:30.800> 500<00:06:31.520> but

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
one time when it jumped up to 500 but

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.730 
one time when it jumped up to 500 but
that<00:06:32.479> was<00:06:32.629> just<00:06:32.659> the<00:06:32.960> single<00:06:33.169> time<00:06:33.439> so<00:06:33.650> I'm

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
that was just the single time so I'm

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.779 
that was just the single time so I'm
guessing<00:06:33.889> that<00:06:34.099> has<00:06:34.249> something<00:06:34.430> to<00:06:34.520> do<00:06:34.639> with

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789 
guessing that has something to do with

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:36.760 
guessing that has something to do with
our<00:06:34.939> dsl<00:06:35.689> line<00:06:35.960> that<00:06:36.139> were<00:06:36.229> connected<00:06:36.650> to

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
our dsl line that were connected to

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.820 
our dsl line that were connected to
right<00:06:36.949> now<00:06:37.750> frame<00:06:38.750> rate<00:06:38.960> with<00:06:39.199> the<00:06:39.319> video<00:06:39.529> card

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
right now frame rate with the video card

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.890 
right now frame rate with the video card
was<00:06:40.039> awesome<00:06:40.430> we<00:06:40.610> got<00:06:40.729> 60<00:06:41.120> frames<00:06:41.360> per<00:06:41.449> second

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
was awesome we got 60 frames per second

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.600 
was awesome we got 60 frames per second
across<00:06:42.080> the<00:06:42.319> entire<00:06:42.590> game<00:06:42.830> and<00:06:43.039> definitely

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
across the entire game and definitely

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.459 
across the entire game and definitely
being<00:06:43.789> able<00:06:44.060> to<00:06:44.120> play<00:06:44.330> at<00:06:44.479> the<00:06:44.629> much<00:06:45.259> better

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:45.469 
being able to play at the much better

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.580 
being able to play at the much better
1080<00:06:45.860> resolution<00:06:46.129> really<00:06:47.090> improved<00:06:47.449> the<00:06:47.629> look

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
1080 resolution really improved the look

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.779 
1080 resolution really improved the look
of<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:48.770> game<00:06:48.979> as<00:06:49.159> well<00:06:49.279> as<00:06:49.400> being<00:06:49.520> able<00:06:49.729> to

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
of the game as well as being able to

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.129 
of the game as well as being able to
read<00:06:49.909> the<00:06:50.029> little<00:06:50.180> menus<00:06:50.479> and<00:06:50.629> everything<00:06:50.990> as
