alright we're going to get to the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.170 
alright we're going to get to the
southern<00:01:55.950> part<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:57.000> we're<00:01:57.149> just

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
southern part of it and then we're just

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.550 
southern part of it and then we're just
going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> hunker<00:01:57.750> down<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.350> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
going to hunker down in that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.539 
going to hunker down in that
intersection<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.460> dig<00:02:00.030> straight<00:02:00.299> down<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
intersection and dig straight down and

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.999 
intersection and dig straight down and
will<00:02:02.549> fortify<00:02:02.850> well<00:02:03.689> there's<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.799> problem

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
will fortify well there's one problem

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.469 
will fortify well there's one problem
with<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.790> zombies<00:02:06.180> are<00:02:06.210> very

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
with that the zombies are very

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.290 
with that the zombies are very
persistent<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.439> don't<00:02:07.710> give<00:02:07.860> up<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.759> when<00:02:09.179> we

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
persistent they don't give up so when we

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.530 
persistent they don't give up so when we
dug<00:02:09.509> straight<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:10.730> we<00:02:11.730> had<00:02:11.879> an<00:02:12.030> issue<00:02:12.120> coming

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
dug straight down we had an issue coming

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.940 
dug straight down we had an issue coming
back

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
back

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.460 
back
out<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.760> morning<00:02:14.090> because<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:15.080> know<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
out in the morning because you know the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.890 
out in the morning because you know the
50<00:02:16.040> zombies<00:02:16.459> were<00:02:16.700> standing<00:02:17.209> right<00:02:17.420> here<00:02:17.450> and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
50 zombies were standing right here and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.059 
50 zombies were standing right here and
I<00:02:18.019> hey<00:02:19.390> how<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.450> doing<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.709> didn't<00:02:21.920> like

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
I hey how you doing and we didn't like

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.339 
I hey how you doing and we didn't like
that<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.550> we<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.569> appear<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:23.959> him<00:02:24.050> which

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
that so we have it appear in him which

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.290 
that so we have it appear in him which
was<00:02:24.500> pretty<00:02:24.650> good<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.069> I<00:02:25.459> did<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:25.790> blasted<00:02:26.000> by

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
was pretty good and I did get blasted by

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.940 
was pretty good and I did get blasted by
the<00:02:26.330> rocket<00:02:26.660> launcher<00:02:26.690> that's<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.500> different

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
the rocket launcher that's so different

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.300 
the rocket launcher that's so different
thing<00:02:28.280> altogether<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.650> end<00:02:30.739> result<00:02:30.950> was

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
thing altogether and the end result was

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.610 
thing altogether and the end result was
once<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:31.910> made<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.330> up<00:02:32.450> here<00:02:32.780> we<00:02:33.080> started<00:02:33.500> just

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
once we made it up here we started just

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.020 
once we made it up here we started just
building<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.010> perimeter<00:02:34.220> with<00:02:34.489> dirt<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.700> stuff

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
building a perimeter with dirt and stuff

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.490 
building a perimeter with dirt and stuff
again<00:02:35.239> like<00:02:35.390> we<00:02:35.480> did<00:02:35.510> at<00:02:35.660> other<00:02:35.989> place<00:02:36.290> but

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
again like we did at other place but

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.170 
again like we did at other place but
once<00:02:37.160> we<00:02:37.340> figured<00:02:37.640> out<00:02:37.730> how<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.970> build

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
once we figured out how to build

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.850 
once we figured out how to build
concrete<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.900> then<00:02:39.049> reinforced<00:02:39.680> concrete

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
concrete and then reinforced concrete

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.470 
concrete and then reinforced concrete
thanks<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.489> digging<00:02:40.790> out<00:02:40.910> all<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.209> stuff

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
thanks to digging out all that stuff

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.970 
thanks to digging out all that stuff
down<00:02:41.660> there<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:42.019> got<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.170> lot<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.440> stone<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:42.950> a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
down there we got a lot of stone and a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.789 
down there we got a lot of stone and a
lot<00:02:43.099> of<00:02:43.220> iron<00:02:43.959> we<00:02:44.959> turn<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.349> thing<00:02:45.410> into<00:02:45.709> a

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
lot of iron we turn this thing into a

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.100 
lot of iron we turn this thing into a
fortress<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:46.730> we've<00:02:47.030> pretty<00:02:47.450> much<00:02:47.569> made<00:02:47.959> it

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
fortress so we've pretty much made it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.270 
fortress so we've pretty much made it
where<00:02:48.260> we<00:02:48.290> don't<00:02:48.590> have<00:02:48.769> much<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.069> worry<00:02:49.220> about

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
where we don't have much to worry about

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.680 
where we don't have much to worry about
they<00:02:49.549> bust<00:02:49.790> through<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.120> door<00:02:50.239> every<00:02:50.510> night

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
they bust through the door every night

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.539 
they bust through the door every night
if<00:02:51.019> we<00:02:51.140> let<00:02:51.319> them<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:51.950> that's<00:02:52.130> why<00:02:52.280> I've<00:02:52.400> got

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
if we let them but that's why I've got

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.759 
if we let them but that's why I've got
an<00:02:52.670> iron<00:02:52.819> gate<00:02:53.120> here<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.660> whatnot<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.560> works

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
an iron gate here and whatnot it works

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.830 
an iron gate here and whatnot it works
out<00:02:54.950> pretty<00:02:55.040> good<00:02:55.280> we<00:02:56.060> usually<00:02:56.180> have<00:02:56.480> spikes

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
out pretty good we usually have spikes

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.780 
out pretty good we usually have spikes
but<00:02:57.140> right<00:02:57.319> now<00:02:57.470> we're<00:02:57.799> obviously<00:02:58.400> running

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
but right now we're obviously running

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.039 
but right now we're obviously running
low<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.239> zombies<00:02:59.540> have<00:02:59.660> ripped<00:02:59.840> them<00:03:00.019> apart

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
low the zombies have ripped them apart

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.539 
low the zombies have ripped them apart
pretty<00:03:00.380> good<00:03:01.660> otherwise<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.709> idea<00:03:03.980> was<00:03:04.220> oh

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
pretty good otherwise the idea was oh

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.940 
pretty good otherwise the idea was oh
and<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.420> learn<00:03:05.599> how<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.780> make<00:03:05.900> TNT<00:03:06.140> check<00:03:06.769> that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
and we learn how to make TNT check that

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.370 
and we learn how to make TNT check that
out<00:03:07.420> unfortunately<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.510> house<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> weird

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
out unfortunately the house is a weird

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.270 
out unfortunately the house is a weird
floating<00:03:09.920> paradox<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.640> no<00:03:11.000> support<00:03:11.470> but<00:03:12.470> yeah

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
floating paradox of no support but yeah

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.759 
floating paradox of no support but yeah
you<00:03:14.000> know<00:03:15.220> logic<00:03:16.220> how<00:03:16.610> does<00:03:16.849> it<00:03:17.000> work<00:03:17.769> really

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
you know logic how does it work really

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.430 
you know logic how does it work really
