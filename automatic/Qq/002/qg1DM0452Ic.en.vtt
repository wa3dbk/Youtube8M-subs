00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
internet so your phone your tablet your

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.950 
internet so your phone your tablet your
laptop<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:29.279> about<00:00:30.000> anywhere<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.420> tree<00:00:30.779> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
laptop just about anywhere a tree I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.150 
laptop just about anywhere a tree I
don't<00:00:31.019> know<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> tree<00:00:31.619> has<00:00:31.710> internet<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
don't know if the tree has internet you

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
don't know if the tree has internet you
could<00:00:32.250> probably<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.610> from<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
could probably get from there so the
