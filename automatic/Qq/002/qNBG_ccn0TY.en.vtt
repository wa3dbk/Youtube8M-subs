00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.900
 Many of you have asked me which one 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.440
 is the correct way to do the 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.710
 I took the rest of the pine forest and ex did 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.560

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.110

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.760
 Knowing well doing the glory of everything 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.970
 Now I have some earrings 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.130
 little things to do on the street then 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.570
 from that to nothing then I did my 30 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.830
 minutes from the cardio twister 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.430

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.450
 squats I'll show you the way 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.460
 correct to do them is I want you to 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.619
 please be very careful with your 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.250
 back try to keep it always 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.670
 straight 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.990
 Low whom I am going to lower the camera 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.700
 If they want to use weight I use weight to 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.600
 you this that you do a little 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.140
 hard 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.320
 try to simply use your weight here 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.560
 low 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.070
 will show us the days how they should 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.230
 to go 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.710
 parallel to your shoulders try 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.490
 find me use 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.710
 the floor that has hairlines for 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.380
 make sure that my children are aligned 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.090
 how good I am going to leave this already the leg 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.869
 boy 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.869
 let's not lose 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.110
 here is my warner 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.990
 good feet to see them on the shoulders of 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.110
 Egypt feet parallel to the shoulders and what 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.940
 what are we going to do, it 's as if we 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.140
 we were to sit in a chair we are going to 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.560
 use an imaginary chair ok down 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.260
 we go like this 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.300
 1 remember your right back and you're 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:37.170
 looking up and breathing inhale 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.180
 when bending over and exhale when going up ok let's go 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.180
 1 2 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.120
 3 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.060
 5 ok now I'm going to do it aside for 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.050
 to see how it should be monitored 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:04.170
 the hairline want two floors and so we go 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.170
 to ok the baby does not stop seeing the camera 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.489
 two 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.740
 4 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.500
 if everyone thinking to do them 50-60 like this 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.390
 easy then it 's probably because 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.770
 you're doing wrong you have to focus 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.390
 very good in your breathing on your back 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.920
 in your legs 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.920
 ok always keep the abdomen 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.629
 pressed tense so that if also 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.269
 work ok if you were doing this 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.280
 It's too bad that because you are 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.470
 resting your body I do not know if nothing 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.540
 I'm not in any effort it does not work 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.660
 nothing 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.740
 then we do this 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.740
 as if you were going to sit 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.740
 ace 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.010
 They use counterweights to boost 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.470
 when 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:27.449
 Always remember to hydrate well 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.219
 his back always straight care that 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.909
 be here stable for any 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:39.460
 question that they have doubt boys is the 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:41.770
 third day good but I assure you that 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.210
 it's going to work after this 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.270
 you will want to continue and follow 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.610
 follow and that's really good really 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.160
 another thing that I wanted to tell you was not 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.350
 pass 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.740
 well then 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.650
 and 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.720
 already being here in the squats you 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.849
 can do another type of exercise 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.289
 truth I know that sometimes many do not 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:09.380
 we have time to do nothing today but 15 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.639
 Real minutes and they will see a change 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.099
 in their life 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.099
 goodbye mommy
