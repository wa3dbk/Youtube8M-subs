enough<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.360> around<00:01:48.539> your<00:01:48.840> wrist<00:01:50.690> tie<00:01:51.690> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
enough to go around your wrist tie a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.399 
enough to go around your wrist tie a
knot<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.229> secure<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.740> three<00:01:52.979> ends<00:01:53.929> now<00:01:54.929> untie

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
knot to secure the three ends now untie

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260 
knot to secure the three ends now untie
the<00:01:55.470> knot<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.950> made<00:01:56.100> earlier<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.880> mark<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the knot you made earlier to mark the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.109 
the knot you made earlier to mark the
starting<00:01:57.630> strands<00:02:01.130> now<00:02:02.130> take<00:02:02.399> your<00:02:02.729> scissors

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
starting strands now take your scissors

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.850 
starting strands now take your scissors
you<00:02:03.149> want<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.600> cut<00:02:03.780> off<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.110> shortest<00:02:04.500> string

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you want to cut off the shortest string

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:14.300 
you want to cut off the shortest string
on<00:02:05.069> each<00:02:05.220> side<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:12.600> trim<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.709> ends<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.280> make

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
on each side and trim the ends to make

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.520 
on each side and trim the ends to make
it<00:02:14.640> ollie<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.540> how<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> class<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
it ollie so this is how the class is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.770 
it ollie so this is how the class is
going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.829> work<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.760> basically<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.360> two<00:02:21.570> ends

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
going to work so basically the two ends

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.650 
going to work so basically the two ends
are<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.140> cross<00:02:22.350> inside<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.160> hex<00:02:23.340> nut<00:02:23.660> so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
are going to cross inside the hex nut so

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.850 
are going to cross inside the hex nut so
string<00:02:25.049> your<00:02:25.200> hex<00:02:25.380> nut<00:02:25.650> through<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.130> end

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.950 

I<00:02:28.890> take<00:02:29.550> your<00:02:29.730> other<00:02:29.910> end<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.510> string<00:02:30.840> it

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
I take your other end and string it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.240 
I take your other end and string it
through<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.200> hex<00:02:31.410> nut<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> opposite

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
through the hex nut in the opposite

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.330 
through the hex nut in the opposite
direction

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.890 

now<00:02:41.340> you've<00:02:41.580> made<00:02:41.819> your<00:02:42.090> adjustable<00:02:42.510> clasp

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
now you've made your adjustable clasp

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.199 
now you've made your adjustable clasp
when<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.770> pull<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.069> both<00:02:44.250> ends<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.819> bracelet

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
when you pull on both ends the bracelet

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.120 
when you pull on both ends the bracelet
will<00:02:45.330> get<00:02:45.450> smaller<00:02:45.720> now<00:02:46.260> pull<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.800> strings

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
will get smaller now pull on the strings

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.130 
will get smaller now pull on the strings
to<00:02:47.370> tighten<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.819> bracelet<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.660> small<00:02:49.020> as

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
to tighten the bracelet to a small as

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.860 
to tighten the bracelet to a small as
possible<00:02:49.430> measure<00:02:50.430> down<00:02:50.730> two<00:02:51.060> inches<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.690> tie

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
possible measure down two inches and tie

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.930 
possible measure down two inches and tie
a<00:02:51.900> knot<00:02:54.830> now<00:02:55.830> do<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.190> same<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.790> other
