00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello I 'm simon dine muscle maker 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.190
 In this video I'll show you that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.700
 abdominal muscle training after the 48 explosive 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.019
 method 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.370
 I do not know that quite a lot 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.619
 asked how shall I my now 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.150
 Exercise abdominal explosive after 48 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.529
 I have shown in a video as 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.390
 you can do that with the ball 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.880
 since you can of course already 148 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.160
 explosive system but still much use 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.310
 I find the whole apartment more effective 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.349
 is negatively inclined at a 45 degrees 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.399
 Bank makes me show you how I do it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.140
 Of course , I had the training 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.950
 advantage that I'm really cool this 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.500
 have devices 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.480
 that means this wall with a 45 degrees 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 angle like that goes down 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.079
 negative equity potential 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 my feet behind it can pinch me 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.950
 So my feet can sit here 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.559
 can and do roll under these 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.440
 go relatively far down that is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.510
 I speak now and have the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.969
 possibility my lateral 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.090
 to train abdominal muscles by myself 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.920
 Freeze me sideways when I am completely 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.640
 classic and go forward child 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.890
 reveals just looking almost to the breast 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.119
 through the hands 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.799
 almost the control of the face 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.170
 take over the higher my hands are 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.150
 the more difficult it gets 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.009
 I have the dealers on the sausage 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.479
 maybe the best cover cocking and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.520
 the whole thing will be too hard for you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.409
 The thing is of course just when you 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.570
 in abdominal area already relatively 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.520
 strong musculature has built up and at 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.259
 The exercise is very important in the lower part 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.090
 back area has a strong musculature 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.070
 I have to be in the studio right away 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.630
 Commit the prerequisite to ever 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.640
 on this device abdominal muscle training 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.040
 to be able to do and without being allowed 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.360
 doing it somehow if you just 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.430
 so far is that my strong muscles 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.960
 has and says your own body weight 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.369
 is no real attraction there 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.590
 I think I could do it 100 now 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.960
 maybe even make 120 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.789
 we have to believe it in front of you 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.240
 easy but I have one more here 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.909
 another idea 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 I take a dumbbell slice like that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.939
 have also times ants with which 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.229
 his grip but ten kilos are ten 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.939
 kilo can also take another 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.899
 someone just keeps it that way 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.630
 no difference at all 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.819
 besides these differences they take 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.019
 just behind the back 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.140
 of course not quite like that with my kepi 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:18.290
 Optimal I continue and turn 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.660
 so this here is the possibility 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.069
 about quite simple lever laws the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.690
 burden to make it harder 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.569
 if I still have a 15 kilo 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.590
 or 20 kilo slice is the 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.540
 whole more difficult 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.890
 so i dont like most videos 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.319
 I'm completely out of breath when I'm at the end 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.910
 want to say I show you her 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.680
 after 48 explosive training of the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.640
 abdominal muscle training is best done by her 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.150
 a look now a bit of the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.920
 page on 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.599
 Camerawoman please come here once 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.010
 so that you see how that from the side 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.720
 looks 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.709
 You have to introduce yourself to me now 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.209
 still in the hand in the 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.769
 appropriate size you have to 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.810
 Of course, try it out individually 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.970
 I would be the weight behind 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.430
 head today so that eventually 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.069
 it gets harder for the stomach 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.160
 important is that you are not too far under 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.120
 go if this area go there 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.680
 Just then back in 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.040
 drawn by her use 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.819
 heavy falling corresponding weight 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.170
 even to keep the tension 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.150
 that means you do it then 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.239
 guarantees and seeks out the maximum 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.540
 tension area in the belly turns sideways 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.069
 on 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.750
 I have to introduce you to this now 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.400
 so that the load increases with the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.239
 corresponding trade disc which i 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.510
 behind my head 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.109
 So you make five repetitions 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:38.000
 every page 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:38.000
 the whole name is 11 22 33 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:49.880
 44 55 now the maximum 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.410
 voltage range I found at 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.330
 me in this area must now a little 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:06.020
 movement make much smaller 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:13.460
 movement as with other exercises 110 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:14.120
 Going to work was now for each side 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.260
 4 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:25.030
 and then come back the long 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:25.030
 repetitions 11 22 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.470
 3 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.310
 So of course it was 54 and three in the end 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.289
 repeats 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.919
 I must say in all honesty I would 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.960
 currently far away from my 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.400
 summer shape and my compact horny 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.990
 Definitely schmidt who is bigger 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.789
 I just feel like that 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.250
 abdominal muscles are at the training 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.039
 that I'm doing relatively slowly 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.930
 every case is top form 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.389
 the burden though I'm straight without 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.650
 have trained additional weight 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.729
 really intense throughout 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.349
 belly area him above all things in the 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.090
 lateral pressure range it means that 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.400
 luck not only this front area 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.080
 but you train and so on 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.940
 turn the more you realize that the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.490
 lateral abdominal area trede is vom 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.190
 feel it goes up here in the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.650
 So store you notice the more intense you 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.009
 says does not break down how intense the 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.150
 Stress becomes very important 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.130
 try to make it slow and straight 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.690
 at the four repetitions in the 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.419
 These short repetitions come in the middle 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.889
 to make the slow by 48 explosive 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.300
 Training you will often see that 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.099
 just these four repetitions of this 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.659
 short repetitions maximum 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.130
 voltage range are made quickly 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.900
 Of course that has some exercises 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.310
 also an advantage is not so 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.900
 bad but just when 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.120
 abdominal muscle training does this 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.370
 repetition of radius of motion entirely 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.199
 small but quiet very slowly 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.090
 I have to say that I have 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.070
 really noticed again and again 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.150
 new these four repetitions and then 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.860
 the changeover to the three 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.259
 repetitions with the slightly longer one 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.120
 movement radius, the muscles will 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.800
 easy under highest load 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.840
 and I'm doing that now 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.539
 even a minute later on musculature 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.219
 the six right ones maxed out and how 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.169
 told them at the appropriate rate 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.539
 pay attention to such an intense 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.979
 bokelberg must have had so seldom 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.360
 See you in the next video many 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.360
 greet your 7th
