well<00:00:00.359> in<00:00:00.570> my<00:00:00.719> opinion<00:00:00.949> any<00:00:01.949> deck<00:00:02.370> that<00:00:02.879> you<00:00:03.030> get

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
well in my opinion any deck that you get

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.480 
well in my opinion any deck that you get
from<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.529> poker<00:00:04.859> set<00:00:05.190> or<00:00:05.430> whatnot<00:00:05.960> is<00:00:07.309> going<00:00:08.309> to

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
from a poker set or whatnot is going to

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.980 
from a poker set or whatnot is going to
be<00:00:08.700> an<00:00:09.059> extremely<00:00:09.540> bad<00:00:09.809> deck<00:00:10.880> unless<00:00:11.990> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
be an extremely bad deck unless the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.230 
be an extremely bad deck unless the
poker<00:00:13.349> said<00:00:14.809> was<00:00:15.809> expensive<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:17.760> box<00:00:18.000> looks

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
poker said was expensive the box looks

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.279 
poker said was expensive the box looks
nice<00:00:18.710> problem<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:20.600> first<00:00:21.600> problem<00:00:21.990> at<00:00:22.080> least

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
nice problem is first problem at least

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.460 
nice problem is first problem at least
is<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.910> box<00:00:24.150> doesn't<00:00:24.840> seem<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.260> like

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is that the box doesn't seem to be like

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.400 
is that the box doesn't seem to be like
a<00:00:25.500> card<00:00:25.859> box<00:00:26.570> first<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.869> has<00:00:27.930> two<00:00:28.170> flaps

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
a card box first of all it has two flaps

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.790 
a card box first of all it has two flaps
from<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> bottom<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> top<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
from at the bottom one at the top so you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.709 
from at the bottom one at the top so you
can<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.130> how<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.579> makes<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> hard<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> get

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
can see how that makes it hard to get

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.680 
can see how that makes it hard to get
cards<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.380> cards<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:35.059> but<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.540> see

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
cards and take cards out but you see

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.350 
cards and take cards out but you see
here<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.710> there's<00:00:37.950> usually<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.550> thumb<00:00:39.149> tab

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
here where there's usually a thumb tab

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.160 
here where there's usually a thumb tab
or<00:00:39.570> something<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.020> pull<00:00:40.379> open<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.680> box

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
or something to pull open the box

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
or something to pull open the box
there's<00:00:43.170> no<00:00:43.320> thumb<00:00:43.559> tab<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:45.030> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
there's no thumb tab so you have to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.720 
there's no thumb tab so you have to
stick<00:00:45.570> your<00:00:45.600> thumb<00:00:45.809> inside<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.950> box<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> try

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
stick your thumb inside the box and try

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760 
stick your thumb inside the box and try
and<00:00:47.850> pull<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.059> out<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> even<00:00:49.649> get

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and pull it out but then you even get

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.040 
and pull it out but then you even get
this<00:00:49.920> problem<00:00:50.190> where<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> whole<00:00:51.059> box<00:00:51.750> just

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
this problem where the whole box just

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.340 
this problem where the whole box just
gets<00:00:52.260> messed<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.969> pull<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:55.260> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
gets messed up pull it out and there you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.250 
gets messed up pull it out and there you

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
it off that's actually funny I didn't

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.910 
it off that's actually funny I didn't
notice<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.030> till<00:02:51.299> now<00:02:52.730> yeah

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
notice that till now yeah

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.180 
notice that till now yeah
otherwise<00:02:57.380> these<00:02:58.380> are<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> worst<00:02:58.829> cards<00:02:59.099> I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
otherwise these are the worst cards I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.240 
otherwise these are the worst cards I
have<00:03:00.019> actually<00:03:01.280> all<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.340> had<00:03:03.000> worse<00:03:03.480> cards<00:03:04.250> but

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
have actually all I had worse cards but

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.130 
have actually all I had worse cards but
I<00:03:05.750> made<00:03:06.750> them<00:03:06.900> into<00:03:07.200> something<00:03:07.380> useful

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
I made them into something useful

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.830 
I made them into something useful
which<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.950> don't<00:03:12.859> know<00:03:13.859> where<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> put<00:03:14.519> it

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
which I don't know where I put it

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.270 
which I don't know where I put it
so<00:03:15.840> clearly<00:03:16.109> not<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.380> useful<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:17.010> still

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
so clearly not that useful but still

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.979 
so clearly not that useful but still
anyways<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> cards<00:03:19.170> back<00:03:19.260> in

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
anyways to get the cards back in

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.199 
anyways to get the cards back in
so<00:03:21.989> these<00:03:22.370> compared<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.639> bicycle<00:03:24.000> yeah

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
so these compared to the bicycle yeah

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.819 
so these compared to the bicycle yeah
you<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.510> see<00:03:24.690> all<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.870> white<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:28.319> plastic

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829
