00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:01.449
 good guys 

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.500
 I'll talk a little bit about the voltage regulators. 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.289
 the program justified in this matter 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.929
 with the advent of polymer batteries 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 some terms of views to have 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.289
 the sister of lists also that with airplanes 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.949
 started using these batteries 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.380
 your models then this happens is as follows 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.449
 therefore use four-point batteries prepared for many sectors that 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.760
 worked with six-goal drums that arrived today available with seven 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.660
 points 4 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.940
 then some manufacturers have developed such 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.600
 with the allowable 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 if you used the lithium-polymer batteries 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.130
 used models 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.980
 the following question 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.740
 many people ask me 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.550
 Syria and uses batteries of lifepo4 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.560
 because of the wide age of points that we could give with his atelier 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.130
 they participated in victimizing nickel cadmium batteries 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.300
 from there I started to do very well the few good batteries of 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.850
 gentili ninja type this is not true 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.340
 regulator function and works to lithium polymer battery 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.650
 it is not allowing unlimited funds to be made 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.860
 the anacom 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.420
 the battery with a few little markets as is the function of the regulator 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.350
 tension 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.409
 the first 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.490
 I find 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.940
 after supplying this type 4 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.880
 supply compatible with the service of your equipment and with this 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.810
 all your equipment 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 the second function of this leading the voltage regulator 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.540
 Web 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.200
 to provide 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.700
 the attention 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
 constant for the saints you're used to so you mean 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.630
 if you have an entry a seven point battery 4 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.140
 and imposed his style of work of six points that means that 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.390
 his servants will constantly receive six points 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.700
 This will not go up or seem 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.600
 consequently your battery will be charged 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.480
 most requested as time goes by this is a poet 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.590
 a week a month or a year is that as you go where your battery 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.669
 was arrested 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.489
 But she will be asked for you. 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.450
 to be able to continue to maintain the six volts that are being provided by uci 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:34.069
 so you have to be very careful about your uncle joÃ£o rocha jr 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.209
 You are very anxious about the substitution you make. 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.479
 consumption of your battery is excessive and you will need to 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.320
 recharge in my case 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.419
 I have to do a recharge every three own flights and security 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.029
 a test flight consumes much more 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:57.239
 than a flight 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.359
 sport flight with scale 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:09.339
 check with each flight how this thesis controlling this is 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.929
 ah Ana 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.909
 household consumption as to what to do constant measurements see how 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.399
 is behaving 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:20.480
 the charge on your battery, understand how you released it. 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.959
 and how your helicopter is consuming uses battery 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.400
 r learn if you cross farm every five to six points 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.629
 or if you will need to make box at each stretch 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.629
 in my case you will notice that I have two batteries connected in my place 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.109
 next to 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.229
 why that 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.689
 the consumption is very high I did not have three falls due to 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.639
 what happened 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.589
 the battery panel arrived 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:49.909
 dropped a lot 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.090
 the regulator 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.280
 to cut off the power supply that will process it 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.459
 the team that goes to 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.449
 cuca receptors 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.579
 so the little ones he shut down deal with it gave me three seconds 100 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.339
 looking at radio reception until the spectrum comes back on 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.480
 truth or to make the fourth goal empty 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.180
 this gave three seconds floor with helicopters second phenomenon is a 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.249
 eternity 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:17.259
 so I put 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:22.949
 is the ic2 internal batteries in parallel are two batteries of 2 67 point 4 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.949
 a law and I returned to gain such a front 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.360
 so how do I behave two matters connected to the parallel 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.669
 ah 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.300
 to delay every three flights 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900
 Searching on the site 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.660
 given the spectrum itself 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.020
 giving appearance does not give 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.340
 that way and other 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340
 After that, I'll post the video for you. 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.030
 vidic is the spectrum itself inquire with the trained 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.040
 reading about it 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.150
 he and I know that the 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.770
 it's seven thousand 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.979
 it seems that this fault in Constantine has a constant failure but a failure that 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.169
 everyday 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.439
 and they come from lucapa sector 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.699
 for you is to couple one of the free channels of the dodo brain 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.099
 what the sector 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.099
 and so 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:22.839
 minimize 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:28.789
 this reciprocal motto of lack is his g of the prisoner sports energy program 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.029
 that is 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.889
 you supplying power to the spectrum 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.130
 I'm going to quote just a little, the midfielder commented. 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.970
 tension 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.949
 in the use of this in light of its 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.259
 I am arrested 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.509
 many supply is interrupted by spectrum 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.520
 security was provided for some 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.120
 milliseconds is not going to be more than a year 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.350
 is the flu arrived in the second and half with the with energy provided by the trained 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.819
 because that's not his job 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.509
 its function is to ensure power for milliseconds 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:04.600
 and thus prevent 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.490
 that you mentioned spectrum 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.310
 disconnect and you normally have to know and principles for 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.360
 beach for energy and communication if you restore 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.809
 and the other last December common 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:20.759
 with an eye on or out of 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.900
 dc enabled if you compare in any goalless store is a comma 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.770
 another microphone 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.029
 of braga desenoltos 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:32.550
 connected by chance in the supply channel 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.710
 heidi energy that the channel of the battery he does not carry Democrat connected to the club 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.460
 because 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.789
 the voltage regulator since the USA has 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:44.720
 own team 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.639
 the helicopter manufacturer 21 50 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.639
 I'm using their own regulator. 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.030
 this regulator already provide power for the industry. 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.030
 through one of the channels
