00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.190
 no content to this channel but 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.840
 now given the circumstances of that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.210
 I'm on vacation I know I left 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.710
 a few times ago but then 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.680
 until now I have time to be able 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.960
 record quality things as well as 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.230
 it says right now the video in a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.810
 microphone boxing 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.560
 in audio that is in studio vocal audio 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.960
 the truth this 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.510
 I was checking different microphones and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.980
 was the one that caught my attention 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.950
 then good we go directly to 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.920
 boxing and I bought it today Sunday 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.260
 and because the truth had not opened 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.870
 you can still see that it is not open what 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.930
 I bought in a store that the truth 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.610
 I highly recommend that you almost buy 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.700
 all my technology things like 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.560
 what video games is baseball 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.510
 but as I tell you in the city of 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.850
 tijuana because there is no verb 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.550
 Then I have to cross the United States 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.060
 to buy the good we can see that everything 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.700
 it's already closed or in the envelope 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.700
 to open it open it carefully 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.600
 or 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.509
 in the part of the page 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.509
 and the powerful barrel scissors 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.000
 we are here 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.300
 and let's go to this let's make a 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.710
 fast commercial to psoe 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.810
 same 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.710
 around here so they do not get in the way 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.690
 and here is 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.580
 is this the vocal audio study this the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.950
 truth is very good is a charge today of 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.670
 so it's called cardio and d 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.390
 and well, this back comes all the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.950
 information 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.440
 the specifications 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.630
 but this stage is that this thing that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.040
 It is from here 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.040
 I think it's from Castilla or something 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.280
 good 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.280
 well we have little things we are going to see 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.340
 then let's open it let's go 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.540
 the scissors 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.540
 let's add here 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.760
 i 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.760
 and let's see what it brings 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.870
 in the box there is nothing else is empty 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.610
 so let's leave it is like 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.480
 here 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:06.080
 this side and good we go in the part of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.080
 down comes this case 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.329
 the case comes 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.750
 the connector that is the usb computer 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.340
 here I am connected that goes to the microphone and 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.400
 this one that goes to the computer 2.0 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.860
 This is the cover that brings microphone 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.350
 protect what was expected 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.250
 well in what has been the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.850
 instructions to download a 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.590
 program to record and edit the 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.030
 same 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.030
 let's see if nothing else comes 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.140
 he only has this 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.900
 has the guarantee in the user guide 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.900
 in different languages that is very good 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.069
 a new and good device this is the 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.430
 own microphone let's see the parts 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.430
 that have 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.049
 here 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.370
 this is where it is put I suppose and where it 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.370
 put the microphone like this 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.130
 I do not know how I go because this goes here 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.070
 in 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.760
 here is moored is screwed here in 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.760
 the part of here 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.760
 this microphone came out 99 dollars already 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:45.210
 with taxes would be about 107 dollars 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.130
 107 dollars that is very good for the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.800
 quality that gives us the good microphone 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.830
 here is here we put the microphone and already 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.590
 screwed this is the tripod that 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.080
 to place him 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:03.610
 and well, here it is 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.090
 in the microphone comes with its gel 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.090
 and already 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.770
 this is the first microphone that I hold 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:17.940
 Caribbean like this 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:20.440
 and the truth is this 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.820
 nightmare 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.220
 we know that here it brings the connector of 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.530
 hearing aids in order to control what 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:34.120
 comes into the microphone how is it 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.790
 produces and here is the usb connection 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.050
 here you have as installed so that 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.870
 speak where the voice comes 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.500
 and well I do not know if you can disarm this 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.920
 part of here 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.320
 show them the 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.889
 you can not and well this more than anything 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.510
 I think I would go 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:59.880
 what I do not know how everything is put together 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:03.170
 is the little study opener that I'm going to 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.170
 be recording with this 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.630
 yes 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.620
 and good more than anything is this boxing 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.420
 it's quick fire I thought it was going to take 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.730
 a little more labaque 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.580
 you could tell it was more bulky this 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.460
 but well that's more than anything 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.500
 unboxing 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:55.090
 this water is recording more 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.090
 obviously videos 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.790
 and good those who wondered but with 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.920
 what was recording before is good 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.100
 show 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.700
 my first videos that I made with the 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.100
 channel was with the lecrÃ­n microphone and 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.810
 with the camera later I bought a hands 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.370
 iphone free I connected it to the ipod and it's 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.770
 with what I'm recording right now with the 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.460
 micro phone system and everything again that 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.410
 the truth of a much higher quality 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.800
 microphone that comes from that of the 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.139
 camera 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.280
 then it goes up with the ipod until 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:36.860
 buy my hands free and well 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.069
 a better and good quality then now with 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:43.490
 this microphone of magnificent microphone in 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:45.830
 studio vocal audio may be enough for us 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.270
 but no, well, I hope that I have 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:52.039
 liked after I'll be going up 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:55.009
