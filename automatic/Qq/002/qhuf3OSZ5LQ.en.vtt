00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.769
 to see how it went 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.069
 but the work that made a sound 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.359
 did not escape the problems of the genre resulting in a wine made for a 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.359
 very specific niche of players 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.069
 the plot takes place in the near future 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.970
 in which many people live on a planet 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.480
 destroyed by nuclear war 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.120

 from whom the raul was separated 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.950
 his evil adoptive brother in martial arts 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.510
 the guerrilla's body has conquered many fans of the 80's 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.610
 but it is not enough to keep the player connected in cristopher north star 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.900
 cinderella is that the organ is crazy princess aiko 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.820
 he has done is an extreme 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.950
 the drive body the sock 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.689
 the enemies have no cunning and intelligence or variety 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.130
 just go ahead and distributed soup put in hundreds of bikers 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.729
 seeds waiting patiently for the benches 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.360
 every once in a while you're smarter and you stand out 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.280
 but predictable movement 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.069
 and allow the hero defined 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.069
 the missile attack 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.499
 who is armed with weak and strong blows this use to fill waves of blows 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.189
 special exaggerated 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.979
 philipe coutinho 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.989
 out this does not hide the repetition of staying pressed the same infinite button 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.059
 sometimes 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.059
 the player only feels challenged in battles 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.069
 more varied than the rest of dem 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.539
 by defeating enemies 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.599
 had nine points of karma experience 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.839
 which enables the new blocks and better the marfrig 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.159
 The stronger we do not get 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.639
 the easier it becomes 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.169
 fist of the north star 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.169
 only with this lack of policing 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.749
 after increasing the strength of the hero five or six times can end with 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.609
 henchmen with only one sketch hide 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.179
 other characters 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.120
 released according to the lusomotors 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.679
 should please fans of the series 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.820
 each of them has its own history and events 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.770
 but this does not get the variety for the game and after some time up 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.419
 even these new figures in play 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.579
 the post-apocalyptic scenarios are well designed 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.289
 as well as the animations of the characters 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.430
 some real-time scenes can even be more beautiful 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.529
 than those presented in computer graphics 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:02.459
 the game runs without cases 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.849
 even with many opponents on the screen 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.049
 japanese cartoon fans 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:09.889
 I'll love it 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.229
 see the resurgence of fuel in video games 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:18.370
 and it is exactly for that audience and I made tokyo in the star we want milk was 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.650
 developed 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.200
 even using the douglas formula as the reuse the game stayed in a very 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.759
 repetitive 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.259
 not even the traditional characters managed to break the monotony of always 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.949
 tight same button 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:33.409
