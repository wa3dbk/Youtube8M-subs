drawn with my pencil liner and then it

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.740 
drawn with my pencil liner and then it
comes<00:07:04.770> out<00:07:04.919> pretty<00:07:05.129> straight<00:07:05.550> that<00:07:05.759> way<00:07:05.789> and

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
comes out pretty straight that way and

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.649 
comes out pretty straight that way and
it's<00:07:06.930> a<00:07:07.020> lot<00:07:07.139> quicker<00:07:07.490> so<00:07:08.490> then<00:07:08.639> I<00:07:08.669> move<00:07:08.879> on<00:07:09.060> to

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:09.659 
it's a lot quicker so then I move on to

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.580 
it's a lot quicker so then I move on to

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690
