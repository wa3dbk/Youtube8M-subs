00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
want to roll it from bottom to top just

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.170 
want to roll it from bottom to top just
like<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:46.710> easy<00:01:46.939> then<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.030> want

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
like that it's pretty easy then you want

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.719 
like that it's pretty easy then you want
to<00:01:48.210> find<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:49.170> rubber<00:01:49.350> band<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
to find a little rubber band one of the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.170 
to find a little rubber band one of the
smaller<00:01:51.030> ones<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:53.579> go<00:01:53.729> around<00:01:54.000> that

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
smaller ones like this to go around that

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.499 
smaller ones like this to go around that
just<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.500> keep<00:01:58.680> rolling

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
just like that and then you keep rolling

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.219 
just like that and then you keep rolling
and<00:02:00.920> then<00:02:01.920> you're<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> add<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:03.840> your

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
and then you're going to add it to your

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.730 
and then you're going to add it to your
other<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:06.570> try<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> tuck<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.290> insights

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
other one you try to tuck the insights

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.490 
other one you try to tuck the insights
and

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
and

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.550 
and
they<00:02:08.710> don't<00:02:08.890> show<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.690> top<00:02:10.899> just<00:02:11.410> like<00:02:11.470> that

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
they don't show the top just like that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.470 
they don't show the top just like that
and<00:02:12.010> we're<00:02:12.490> going<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.640> create<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.030> circle

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
and we're going to create a circle

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.970 
and we're going to create a circle
around<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.870> first<00:02:14.080> diaper<00:02:14.380> we<00:02:14.680> put<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:16.000> there

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.350 

there's<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.100> diaper<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.670> started<00:02:22.060> with<00:02:22.180> right

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
there's the diaper I started with right

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.250 
there's the diaper I started with right
there<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.630> then<00:02:22.690> I'm<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.960> create<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
there and then I'm going to create the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.680 
there and then I'm going to create the
circle<00:02:23.590> around<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.430> there<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.090> my<00:02:28.360> first

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
circle around it so there is my first

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.390 
circle around it so there is my first
little<00:02:28.870> rotation<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.740> have<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.010> middle<00:02:30.220> diaper

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
little rotation I have the middle diaper

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.770 
little rotation I have the middle diaper
right<00:02:30.610> there<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.120> then<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.270> diapers<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.570> go

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
right there and then the diapers that go

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.620 
right there and then the diapers that go
around<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:33.220> then<00:02:33.459> we'll<00:02:33.970> just<00:02:34.120> keep<00:02:34.300> going

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
around it and then we'll just keep going

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.000 
around it and then we'll just keep going
and<00:02:34.810> making<00:02:34.990> our<00:02:35.230> lay<00:02:35.380> our<00:02:35.530> bigger<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.860> bigger

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
and making our lay our bigger and bigger

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.280 
and making our lay our bigger and bigger
until<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.910> size<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.930> cake<00:02:38.080> pan

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
until it is the size of the cake pan

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.040 
until it is the size of the cake pan
okay<00:02:38.770> also<00:02:38.980> i<00:02:39.190> forgot<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.700> tell<00:02:39.850> you<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.570> I've

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.590 
okay also i forgot to tell you so I've
done<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.610> there's<00:02:42.970> my<00:02:43.150> middle<00:02:43.420> diaper

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
done be like there's my middle diaper

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.030 
done be like there's my middle diaper
I've<00:02:44.020> done<00:02:44.230> one<00:02:44.440> layer<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.770> then<00:02:44.860> another

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
I've done one layer and then another

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.620 
I've done one layer and then another
layer<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.610> first<00:02:45.820> rubber<00:02:45.970> band<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.270> used<00:02:46.450> is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
layer the first rubber band I used is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.420 
layer the first rubber band I used is
not<00:02:46.810> stretched<00:02:47.080> too<00:02:47.290> far<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:48.130> what<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.310> need

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
not stretched too far so what you need

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.890 
not stretched too far so what you need
to<00:02:48.489> do<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.700> find<00:02:49.120> their<00:02:49.300> next<00:02:49.450> size<00:02:49.750> rubber

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
to do is find their next size rubber

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.720 
to do is find their next size rubber
band<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.410> put<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.650> around<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:51.100> whole<00:02:51.400> thing

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
band and put it around the whole thing

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.270 
band and put it around the whole thing
that<00:02:52.600> way<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:52.959> add<00:02:53.140> more<00:02:53.380> diapers<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:54.100> it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
that way you can add more diapers to it

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.680 
that way you can add more diapers to it
I'm<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.000> put<00:02:55.150> these<00:02:55.239> rubber<00:02:55.480> bands

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
I'm just going to put these rubber bands

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.090 
I'm just going to put these rubber bands
out<00:02:55.840> here<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:56.230> easier<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.500> way<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.950> like

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
out here it's easier that way so like

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.070 
out here it's easier that way so like
this<00:02:57.220> one<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:58.120> bigger<00:02:58.390> rubber<00:02:58.570> band<00:02:58.810> it

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
this one is a bigger rubber band it

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.750 
this one is a bigger rubber band it
stretch<00:02:59.320> farther<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.220> I'm<00:03:00.400> gonna<00:03:00.489> put<00:03:00.700> that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
stretch farther so I'm gonna put that

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.540 
stretch farther so I'm gonna put that
around<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.810> whole<00:03:02.050> row<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.980> way<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.220> add

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
around the whole row that way I can add

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.310 
around the whole row that way I can add
more<00:03:04.239> diapers<00:03:04.420> without<00:03:04.810> breaking<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.200> Rev

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
more diapers without breaking the Rev

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.170 
more diapers without breaking the Rev
and<00:03:05.590> then<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.190> keep<00:03:06.310> adding<00:03:06.610> larger

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and then you just keep adding larger

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.330 
and then you just keep adding larger
rubber<00:03:07.540> bands<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.170> eventually<00:03:08.830> one<00:03:08.980> rubber

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
rubber bands and eventually one rubber

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.500 
rubber bands and eventually one rubber
band<00:03:09.370> will<00:03:09.730> go<00:03:09.850> around<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.120> whole<00:03:10.270> outside

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
band will go around the whole outside

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.509 
band will go around the whole outside
there's<00:03:11.290> my<00:03:11.440> first<00:03:11.680> layer<00:03:11.860> now<00:03:12.070> my<00:03:12.190> second

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
there's my first layer now my second

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.100 
there's my first layer now my second
layer<00:03:12.640> will<00:03:13.299> just<00:03:13.600> have<00:03:13.870> not<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:15.040> round<00:03:16.110> this

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
layer will just have not this round this

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.539 
layer will just have not this round this
last<00:03:17.350> round<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.680> diapers<00:03:17.980> it'll<00:03:18.280> be<00:03:18.370> one

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
last round of diapers it'll be one

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.400 
last round of diapers it'll be one
shorter<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.360> it'll<00:03:19.570> be<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.750> next<00:03:19.930> layer<00:03:20.080> so

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
shorter and it'll be the next layer so

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.430 
shorter and it'll be the next layer so
i'm<00:03:20.680> now<00:03:20.890> done<00:03:20.950> with<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.549> second<00:03:22.060> layer<00:03:22.440> just

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
i'm now done with the second layer just

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.870 
i'm now done with the second layer just
like<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.830> it's<00:03:24.160> gonna<00:03:24.280> go<00:03:24.459> right<00:03:24.580> on<00:03:24.700> top<00:03:24.850> of

the first I haven't tape them down yet

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.080 
the first I haven't tape them down yet
because<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.280> want<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.489> make<00:03:27.580> sure<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.940> they're

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
because I want to make sure that they're

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.810

gonna<00:03:28.269> fit<00:03:28.840> nicely<00:03:29.019> hey<00:03:29.830> um<00:03:30.040> I've<00:03:30.400> never<00:03:30.580> used

gloves<00:03:31.150> before<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.620> thought<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:32.920> a

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
gloves before and so I thought that a

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.590 
gloves before and so I thought that a
hundred<00:03:33.340> diapers<00:03:33.760> would<00:03:33.880> be<00:03:34.000> enough<00:03:34.239> but<00:03:34.420> it

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
hundred diapers would be enough but it

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.780 
hundred diapers would be enough but it
wasn't<00:03:35.110> you're<00:03:35.709> gonna<00:03:35.799> need<00:03:35.980> three<00:03:36.280> packages
