00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
I could show you about scaling that's

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.059 
I could show you about scaling that's
about<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
about it

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.860

well<00:02:21.069> let's<00:02:21.220> get<00:02:21.340> into<00:02:21.459> shading<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.450> lighting

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
well let's get into shading and lighting

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.259 
well let's get into shading and lighting
now<00:02:23.739> because<00:02:24.190> people<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.940> asked<00:02:25.120> me<00:02:25.239> about

to<00:02:50.830> just<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.190> do<00:02:51.340> shading<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.480> lighting<00:02:52.510> or

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
to just to do shading and lighting or

have<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.480> be<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.630> circle<00:03:08.050> it<00:03:08.170> could<00:03:08.320> be<00:03:09.480> like

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
have to be a circle it could be like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.540 
have to be a circle it could be like
like<00:03:12.340> enough<00:03:13.090> well<00:03:14.080> something<00:03:14.440> like

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
like a shiny on surface not like an eye

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.290 
like a shiny on surface not like an eye
I<00:03:22.450> mean<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.410> could<00:03:23.620> though<00:03:23.830> but<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.430> personally

really I just like you know using like
these<00:03:32.920> type<00:03:33.130> Cohn<00:03:33.340> technique<00:03:33.670> because<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.000> mean

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
these type Cohn technique because I mean

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.150 
these type Cohn technique because I mean
most<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.690> major<00:03:34.930> cartoons<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.830> would<00:03:35.950> see

most of the major cartoons you would see

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.850 
most of the major cartoons you would see
characters<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:37.540> shading<00:03:38.410> like<00:03:38.500> this<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.770> the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
characters have shading like this in the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.440 
characters have shading like this in the
right<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.550> see<00:03:41.100> all<00:03:42.100> right<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:43.300> last

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
right you see all right and the last

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.180 
right you see all right and the last

part I want to talk to in this video is
the<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:46.360> fading<00:03:46.810> technique<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.440> do<00:03:47.530> so

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
the the fading technique that I do so

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.490 
the the fading technique that I do so
you<00:03:48.370> know<00:03:48.490> I've<00:03:48.760> had<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.090> lot<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.570> people<00:03:50.230> asking

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
really quite simple but it's hard to
