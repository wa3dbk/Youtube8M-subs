Martin okay we've got more Kroger also
sell<00:00:17.250> them<00:00:17.430> too<00:00:18.320> they<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:20.030> six<00:00:21.030> inch<00:00:21.480> logs<00:00:21.810> in

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
sell them too they are six inch logs in

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.020 
sell them too they are six inch logs in
here<00:00:22.290> you<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.650> three<00:00:23.040> of<00:00:23.220> them<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> serving

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
here you get three of them as a serving

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.830 
here you get three of them as a serving
size<00:00:24.500> thus<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.950> three<00:00:26.220> enchiladas<00:00:26.910> at<00:00:27.060> 330

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
size thus the three enchiladas at 330

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.750 
size thus the three enchiladas at 330
calories<00:00:28.110> so<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.950> to<00:00:29.100> open<00:00:29.340> about<00:00:29.430> 100

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
calories so that's up to open about 100

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.850 
calories so that's up to open about 100
calories<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.180> an<00:00:30.270> enchilada<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.960> don't<00:00:31.710> think

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
calories for an enchilada I don't think

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.250 
calories for an enchilada I don't think
that's<00:00:32.009> too<00:00:32.160> awfully<00:00:32.489> severe<00:00:33.020> what<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.110> going

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
that's too awfully severe what I'm going

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170 
that's too awfully severe what I'm going
to<00:00:34.289> do<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.680> frozen<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:36.090> I'm

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
to do these are frozen and what I'm

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.670 
to do these are frozen and what I'm
going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.510> I'm<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> use<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> micro

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
going to do I'm going to use the micro

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.979 
going to do I'm going to use the micro
bake<00:00:37.950> directions<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.090> put<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
bake directions you can put it in the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.710 
bake directions you can put it in the
oven<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.620> by<00:00:41.460> themselves<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> takes<00:00:42.180> 40<00:00:42.630> to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
oven just by themselves it takes 40 to

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.330 
oven just by themselves it takes 40 to
45<00:00:43.230> minutes<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.770> takes<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> pretty<00:00:44.130> long

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
45 minutes so it takes a pretty long

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.979 
45 minutes so it takes a pretty long
time<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.540> put<00:00:45.720> them<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
time but if you put them in the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
time but if you put them in the
microwave<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.280> microwave<00:00:47.910> them<00:00:48.030> for

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
microwave you can microwave them for

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.049 
microwave you can microwave them for
three<00:00:48.450> minutes<00:00:49.280> actually<00:00:50.280> four<00:00:50.730> minutes

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
three minutes actually four minutes

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.490 
three minutes actually four minutes
three<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> six<00:00:51.750> minutes<00:00:52.079> I'll<00:00:52.170> probably<00:00:52.350> get

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
three to six minutes I'll probably get

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.440 
three to six minutes I'll probably get
four<00:00:52.770> minutes<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.880> put<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
four minutes and then you put it in a

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.979 
four minutes and then you put it in a
preheated<00:00:54.719> oven<00:00:55.170> we're<00:00:55.530> doing<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.130> 375<00:00:56.989> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
preheated oven we're doing for 375 you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
preheated oven we're doing for 375 you
put<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.380> oven<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.890> 20<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> 25<00:00:59.340> minutes

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
put it in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
put it in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes
so<00:01:00.210> basically<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.170> defrost<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
so basically just defrost it then you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.069 
so basically just defrost it then you
microwave<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> bake<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.540> just<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> finish

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
microwave or you bake it just to finish

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.639 
microwave or you bake it just to finish
it<00:01:04.320> off<00:01:04.469> so<00:01:04.729> we<00:01:05.729> will<00:01:05.909> probably<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.649> here

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
it off so we will probably do that here

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.139 
it off so we will probably do that here
as<00:01:07.770> soon<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.100> oven<00:01:08.369> preheats<00:01:08.759> I'll<00:01:08.939> put

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
as soon as the oven preheats I'll put

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.149 
as soon as the oven preheats I'll put
this<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.359> the<00:01:09.569> microwave<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.959> about<00:01:10.770> four

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
this in the microwave for about four

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.209 
this in the microwave for about four
minutes<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:11.819> then<00:01:12.679> you<00:01:13.679> know<00:01:13.799> we're<00:01:13.950> ready<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
minutes and then you know we're ready to

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.120 
minutes and then you know we're ready to
go<00:01:14.869> okay<00:01:15.899> no<00:01:16.170> no<00:01:16.319> it's<00:01:16.499> gone<00:01:16.709> for<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.069> few

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
go okay no no it's gone for a few

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.919 
go okay no no it's gone for a few
minutes<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.850> probably<00:01:18.119> warm<00:01:18.509> enough<00:01:18.749> to

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
minutes so it's probably warm enough to

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:20.779 
minutes so it's probably warm enough to
get<00:01:19.109> started<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.859> this<00:01:20.039> so<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.399> gonna<00:01:20.520> take<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
get started on this so I'm gonna take it

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.440 
get started on this so I'm gonna take it
out<00:01:20.819> of<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.969> package<00:01:21.359> and<00:01:23.060> what's<00:01:24.060> really

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
out of the package and what's really

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.749 
out of the package and what's really
good<00:01:24.659> lots<00:01:24.899> of<00:01:25.049> cheese<00:01:25.319> and<00:01:25.350> stuff<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.039> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
good lots of cheese and stuff like that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
good lots of cheese and stuff like that
what<00:01:27.149> you<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.959> think<00:01:28.079> it<00:01:28.259> says<00:01:28.469> vent<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
what you do is I think it says vent the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.910 
what you do is I think it says vent the
cover<00:01:29.719> pull<00:01:30.719> back<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> corner<00:01:31.349> of<00:01:31.469> the<00:01:31.590> other

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
cover pull back the corner of the other

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.559 
cover pull back the corner of the other
cover<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.369> VIN<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.029> little<00:01:33.149> bit<00:01:33.329> just

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
cover to VIN it just a little bit just

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.569 
cover to VIN it just a little bit just
to<00:01:33.749> let<00:01:33.899> some<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> steam<00:01:34.319> out<00:01:34.709> and<00:01:35.159> I'm

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
to let some of the steam out and I'm

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.910 
to let some of the steam out and I'm
gonna<00:01:35.729> stick<00:01:36.029> it<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.179> the<00:01:36.240> microwave<00:01:36.539> for

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
gonna stick it in the microwave for

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.319 
gonna stick it in the microwave for
three<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> six<00:01:38.189> minutes<00:01:38.639> all<00:01:38.759> microwaves

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
three to six minutes all microwaves

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.580 
three to six minutes all microwaves
usually<00:01:39.599> right<00:01:39.749> in<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:39.959> middle<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.319> I'll

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
usually right in the middle so I'll

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.160 
usually right in the middle so I'll
probably<00:01:40.740> put<00:01:41.099> it<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.310> about<00:01:41.579> four<00:01:42.049> four<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
probably put it on about four four and a

barbecue time to barking beans how much

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.240

like<00:04:09.970> like<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> rope<00:04:11.020> so<00:04:11.230> it's<00:04:11.350> not<00:04:11.440> hamburger

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
like like a rope so it's not hamburger

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.920 
like like a rope so it's not hamburger
so<00:04:12.520> that's<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:13.180> makes<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.480> R<00:04:13.600> it's<00:04:13.750> not<00:04:13.900> a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
so that's that makes it R it's not a

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.960 
so that's that makes it R it's not a
hamburger<00:04:14.170> type<00:04:14.590> beef<00:04:14.800> it's<00:04:15.340> more<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.700> roast

still not super strong I mean it's a

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.780 
still not super strong I mean it's a
little<00:04:32.470> spice<00:04:32.980> in<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.220> back<00:04:33.400> of<00:04:33.550> your<00:04:33.610> throat

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
make it a little spicy this is a good

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.600 
make it a little spicy this is a good
good<00:04:43.690> by<00:04:43.840> itself<00:04:43.980> still<00:04:44.980> doesn't<00:04:45.310> have<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:45.430> lot

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610

of beefy flavor an ancho a lot of flavor

of beefy flavor an ancho a lot of flavor
tip<00:04:48.190> though<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:49.540> tortilla<00:04:49.990> is<00:04:50.110> once<00:04:50.380> you

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
tip though and the tortilla is once you

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.810 
tip though and the tortilla is once you
get<00:04:50.650> underneath<00:04:50.920> there<00:04:51.130> are<00:04:51.190> still<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.550> little

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
get underneath there are still a little

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.510 
get underneath there are still a little
squishy<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:53.230> ones<00:04:53.440> who<00:04:53.560> made<00:04:53.770> ourselves<00:04:53.890> I

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
squishy the ones who made ourselves I

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.930 
squishy the ones who made ourselves I
fried<00:04:54.820> them<00:04:55.030> first<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:56.080> then<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.580> then<00:04:57.730> roll

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
fried them first and then and then roll

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.850 
fried them first and then and then roll
them<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.270> they<00:04:58.390> were<00:04:58.540> really<00:04:58.780> far<00:04:59.110> more<00:04:59.350> thing

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
them and they were really far more thing

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.850 
them and they were really far more thing
so<00:05:00.510> they<00:05:01.510> could<00:05:01.900> benefit<00:05:02.320> from<00:05:02.380> being<00:05:02.770> a

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
so they could benefit from being a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.760 
so they could benefit from being a
little<00:05:03.100> firmer<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.670> tortillas<00:05:04.150> are<00:05:04.770> but

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
little firmer of the tortillas are but

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.370 
little firmer of the tortillas are but
overall<00:05:06.040> I<00:05:06.520> like<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.420> I<00:05:07.630> still<00:05:08.080> think<00:05:08.260> I'd

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
overall I like it I still think I'd

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.620 
overall I like it I still think I'd
rather<00:05:08.530> make<00:05:08.800> my<00:05:08.830> own<00:05:09.480> honestly<00:05:10.480> it's

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
rather make my own honestly it's

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.980 
rather make my own honestly it's
probably<00:05:11.160> gonna<00:05:12.160> be<00:05:12.250> about<00:05:12.340> as<00:05:12.910> cheap<00:05:12.940> if<00:05:13.750> you

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
probably gonna be about as cheap if you

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.190 
probably gonna be about as cheap if you
pop<00:05:14.170> I<00:05:14.500> mean<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:15.040> made<00:05:15.400> two<00:05:15.640> full<00:05:16.000> pans<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.780> I

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
pop I mean I made two full pans and I

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.620 
pop I mean I made two full pans and I
probably<00:05:17.440> paid<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:18.580> know<00:05:18.670> around<00:05:19.240> twelve

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
probably paid you know around twelve

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.150 
probably paid you know around twelve
dollars<00:05:19.960> anyway<00:05:20.230> which<00:05:20.410> is<00:05:20.590> about<00:05:20.740> what<00:05:20.980> these

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
dollars anyway which is about what these

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.300 
dollars anyway which is about what these
two<00:05:21.370> meals<00:05:21.550> were<00:05:21.850> so<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.570> they<00:05:23.110> put<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.980> was<00:05:24.100> I

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
two meals were so and they put it was I

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.620 
two meals were so and they put it was I
knew<00:05:24.550> what<00:05:24.700> was<00:05:24.820> in<00:05:25.000> them<00:05:25.120> and<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.330> know<00:05:25.390> how<00:05:25.570> to

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
knew what was in them and I know how to

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.890 
knew what was in them and I know how to
make<00:05:25.870> them<00:05:26.080> so<00:05:26.970> good<00:05:27.970> if<00:05:28.390> you<00:05:28.540> want<00:05:28.720> something

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
make them so good if you want something

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.930 
make them so good if you want something
quick<00:05:29.050> but<00:05:29.500> you'd<00:05:29.950> probably<00:05:29.980> rather<00:05:30.430> make

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
quick but you'd probably rather make

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.360 
quick but you'd probably rather make
money<00:05:31.180> around
