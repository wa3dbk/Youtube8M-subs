we're going to be talking about the four
wheels<00:00:12.360> Walker<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.559> particular<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.280> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
wheels Walker this in particular is a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.550 
wheels Walker this in particular is a
Hugo<00:00:14.969> rule<00:00:15.240> later<00:00:15.420> rolaid<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.289> being

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
Hugo rule later rolaid are being

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.099 
Hugo rule later rolaid are being
interchangeable<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.550> term<00:00:17.820> Walker

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
interchangeable with the term Walker

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.130 
interchangeable with the term Walker
okay<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.590> why<00:00:20.220> might<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.670> use<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:21.270> Hugo<00:00:21.900> rule

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
okay so why might we use a Hugo rule

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.050 
okay so why might we use a Hugo rule
later<00:00:22.289> well<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.070> particular<00:00:23.220> people<00:00:23.910> that

the other videos I have on the two
wheeled<00:00:48.270> Walker<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.170> four-pronged<00:00:49.710> Walker

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
wheeled Walker the four-pronged Walker

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.920 
wheeled Walker the four-pronged Walker
and<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.510> designed<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:53.539> mobility<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and more designed for mobility and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
and more designed for mobility and
stability<00:00:55.340> respectively<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.940> in

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
stability respectively this in

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.599 
stability respectively this in
particular<00:00:57.600> moves<00:00:57.899> very<00:00:58.260> easily<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.489> that's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
particular moves very easily so that's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
particular moves very easily so that's
that's<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.570> advantage<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> disadvantage

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that's an advantage and a disadvantage

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.900 
that's an advantage and a disadvantage
if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> ask<00:01:02.399> me

if you ask me

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.960 
if you ask me
you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.359> move<00:01:03.539> along<00:01:03.660> quickly<00:01:04.760> make<00:01:05.760> sure<00:01:05.909> you

you can move along quickly make sure you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
you can move along quickly make sure you
don't<00:01:06.150> move<00:01:06.390> along<00:01:06.659> too<00:01:06.990> quickly<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
don't move along too quickly with this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.740 
don't move along too quickly with this
because<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.580> people<00:01:08.850> tend<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.360> short<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
because some people tend to get short of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.870 
because some people tend to get short of
breath<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.290> they're<00:01:10.890> moving<00:01:11.250> too<00:01:11.430> fast

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
