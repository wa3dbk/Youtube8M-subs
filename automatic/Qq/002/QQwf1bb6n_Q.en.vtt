00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.669
 it's our last second half-time songs left as its judge 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.570
 but contains 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.570
 and we are not putting in the sand to guess good for the kids 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:12.929
 Enemy is 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.989
 and 7 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.650
 wants to avenge later 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.570
 and 6 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.240
 from the 2 and without anything from where the owner permits 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.269
 easy to find quickly 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.850
 what the fashion 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.750
 and you're here scoring a goal 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.870
 I think 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 Playing field have to stand 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 in the last game for the "Reds" 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 loudest is the upper limit 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
 Hits of last paragraph 2 Lit 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.860
 and everything is different here 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.860
 when turning over overlooked 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.010
 advised that here 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.030
 but the same picture Raspo Brand out 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.930
 very weakly close it is wonderful here now 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.930
 we use 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.440
 the Hamburg goalkeeper 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.080
 meanwhile are rare 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 a fine 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.840
 Thanei's previous boss 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 We do not know that 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.710
 We stay to fight meet expected burdens 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.900
 «If now the topic 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 Worth seeing is Sauter 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.520
 we have consistent 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.330
 Kaiserslautern also be Manuela follow the role model 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.190
 Torsten Fricke 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.420
 In addition, Messi feels 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.219
 So far they have done the earthquake before Merkel's attempt 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.420
 the more incoming 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.420
 the two best 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.139
 so be up to the heights 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.759
 also cheap market 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.099
 that's the thing until the middle of August the last week 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.589
 and here is Marko Marin 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.589
 2 is with Hans statements Sandro Wagner 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.489
 the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.539
 and now threatens 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.539
 Nice to collect Catherine 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.669
 in the single 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.429
 now at 3 5 1 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.099
 The tip of the eisberg 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.590
 he could not remember who shoots himself here very well 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.559
 5 6 percent 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.559
 the trailer released 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.009
 he was traveling 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.009
 who does not cheat forgive 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.869
 the bee 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:17.329
 they have succeeded in punching 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.480
 that is the least but the diesel tax this 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:26.509
 Except that they are such games always within sight of the eleven-year-old 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.379
 Self-confidently, she is the first to stand 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.609
 the Stuttgarters also had very good chances but 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:40.019
 repeatedly stressed that it has in itself on seven sisters of China itself 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.409
 host 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.729
 they do so the cancellation policy 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.959
 September I mean serious 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.399
 with the 7 6 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.179
 who they are repeating the series 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:54.709
 rightly done 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.669
 Muenster 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.259
 You here 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.969
 Jaissle should also here are the first our concept of Horst Müller 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.479
 and now we will see that 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.669
 most 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.299
 with Dr October against the 1 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.299
 the games are against the Greeks 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.889
 Enemy is 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.889
 just look for them to read this 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.309
 Forecasts are 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:25.309
 and now it has stayed 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.360
 here is our movie finder minute 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.360
 Uwe Müller left was too low fastest 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.370
 so could 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.849
 the 1 15 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.539
 like in the weeks 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.539
 to have to do 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.800
 and they thought they were quite sturdy so far and therefore the Schola St 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.460
 next to the many 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.460
 I love these services in Delhi 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.620
 and strictly speaking 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.069
 Sean Kingstons just celebrating a Mass 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.580
 with Owen Wilson did not pay for us Hoffenheim and Wolfsburg 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.129
 so that too we now lay down now 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.129
 been abused 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.339
 and all this would 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:17.719
 Chairman is 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.179
 this presented the world is interesting
