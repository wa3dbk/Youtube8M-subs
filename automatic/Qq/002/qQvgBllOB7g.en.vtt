00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.509
 bad that at the beginning is super bad and 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.850
 super and treats her fatally and casually 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.500
 for reasons that nobody understands 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.240
 love and becomes super 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.049
 loving and super in payments with her

 ugly because nobody wants me not what 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.750
 I understand I do not understand 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.940
 fuck how are you day 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.150
 the farm 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.980
 the truth now is that of the typical girl 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.810
 who has very little self-esteem 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.200
 who believes that his whole life is a 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.080
 disgust and has two friends but that is 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.730
 very lonely but then it turns out that it is 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.730
 beautiful and that everyone is for her 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.860
 and 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.900
 oh my god those and nice I like 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.900
 but I do not know where 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.310
 I think I fell in love 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.780
 and this is what I have seen 300,000 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.520
 million billion times 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.140
 here is a girl who is new the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.060
 institute is walking down the hall and 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.740
 suddenly he meets the typical 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.790
 school gals collide the 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.790
 books from there and they fall in love 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.870
 honey you knew that the coordinates of the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.629
 native are in 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.239
 by the way where our escape 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:11.200
 dear and beautiful daughter of 14 years ago 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:14.590
 seven days 8 that we did not see it had not been 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.720
 gone to put her the biker soccer down gave 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.250
 nine tattoos he met in a 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.269
 disco to last week in a 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.859
 disco for teenagers 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.859
 problematic s 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:36.720
 now is when they care about an 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:41.039
 for days in a row that no longer me that 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.699
 do not know anything that goes away but that does not 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.699
 they know nothing about her 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.680
 anyone there 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.409
 the waiting faith is here right away 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.469
 I come back 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:08.379
 and nobody absolutely nobody are I going 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:10.360
 I think no one absolutely does hear 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.949
 it's something like that it gets up and says there's 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.189
 someone there I do not directly 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:18.369
 I get up, come on, I do. 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:20.259
 I stay in my bed and a bit but let's go 

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:23.550
 that I do not ask or anything seems to me 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.550
 the super your reality 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.370
 the rector I have the strange feeling of 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.350
 that someone is watching me 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.030
 when in books I was very much called 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.320
 attention when a protagonist a 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.400
 protagonist is like this and without 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.060
 suddenly says then 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.530
 I felt that someone was watching me I do not know 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.900
 How can you feel that you are watching 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.900
 I know if you feel eye to eye this past year 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.630
 Hello 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:11.310
 hello but who has been that has happened 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.490
 Hello Hello 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.020
 I do not understand do not understand anything good if 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.550
 the books can not pass because they do not 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.470
 could describe but take this one 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.170
 bunch of scary movies in which 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:27.200
 the protagonists or something like that are by 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.200
 there and suddenly the bad guy appears behind 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.620
 since many times they give us meaning 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:39.400
 what it is or nothing simply appears 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.400
 a shadow I hope you liked it 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:46.490
 that did not come to mind and it's not that 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.490
 like crime talks about a kiss 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.449
 sometimes 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:07.060
 12 had left with a boy with whom 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.060
 I had just met 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.400
 maybe disco for teenagers 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.840
 problematic 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.760
 the guy that is full of tattoos 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.760
 who smoke joints every day is 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.450
 etc 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.669
 and 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.199
 to false shots 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.030
 please 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:52.410
 and how much you love me that cool 

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:52.410
 something gives me value of it
