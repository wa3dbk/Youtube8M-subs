00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.400
 j get where 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.030
 but i'm innocent is guitar builder other side wants except to music hall 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.790
 I would like to talk about the adjustment of the guitars and their importance 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.230
 With this guitar in front of me I have the consort boxes I am going to look at 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 what happens before the guitar enters the store 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.499
 the city it starts with a look at how it looks is undamaged 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.550
 and that goes on with how playable is that goes Eucharist 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 I wanted the elephants 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.080
 when looking at that I do on the basis of the sneijder who himself judges 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.750
 and if there is an interruption exactly how gÃ¶ldi is in the middle 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.360
 and that is way too much right now you can know it but you have to wear something 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.750
 to happen 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.990
 I did not panic there 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.710
 asare are doing well 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.100
 but we are going to drive 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 it must be that hard when you play a chord 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.950
 my child is routine 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.740
 target 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.740
 the but that stands out for me 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.870
 though well that still created a bend that was too big that caused 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.870
 intonation problems and you can hear that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.270
 behind this takes place 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 sit down possibility 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.810
 built in for the main street that is a screw in so dublin the key 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 so can be added 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.070
 if you are a good move, listen to the terrible old city 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.510
 you have to take some time for it 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.760
 but if they are in a good mood then the next step is that I am going to work on the 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.170
 top anp 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.479
 or sit bogeys played guitar heavily 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.409
 be met 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.409
 so it's incredibly important 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.389
 also you can love top man is good now the capital and the good state 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.859
 then we look at the height of the bridge 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.339
 that is important predictability 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.879
 integration later too 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.790
 if it is too high, then you have to play very hard, but it is too slow 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.539
 give your guitar all kinds of lead 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.459
 who integrates the incident as well 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.319
 all that well too 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.319
 and 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.039
 I hear that I do not see well and in the world he is too high 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.479
 should be the two royal family 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.479
 I'm going to do something about it 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.549
 this is the set option 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.549
 intonation, of course, it also comes accurately 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.439
 is going in the right direction 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.629
 continue until it is completely good 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.629
 this is what i am looking for 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.279
 I have done this completely under control that happens especially with every one 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.049
 it seems that the store is coming 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.369
 nevertheless can indicate the good altitude halfway strike is good 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.279
 the plug height 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.359
 all right 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.849
 Integration is in order the height of the pick ups or the elements that it is 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.859
 good is also important for the sound 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.219
 then the guitar is optimal and then 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.219
 then it will sound like that 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.019
 the 3 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.309
 he is now sitting 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:40.650
 the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.900
 a hair after 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:46.939
