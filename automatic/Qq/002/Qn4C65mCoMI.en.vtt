00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:12.420
 to go up we aim the video and 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:14.549
 groove today 31 a box from my ex at is 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:27.349
 Why do you want to know the name of the brand? 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:31.380
 blue model t 9 and mustache 7 is great 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:36.270
 I really really liked it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.550
 only that face does not last exactly 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:46.350
 It's over full load. I used it. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:50.190
 directly to about two hours of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.090
 Sunday and gave when I entered a 55 and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.590
 40 17 45 and finished the battery 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.720
 hence the good young customer here coming from 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.140
 Coast spoke little and the website positively 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:09.140
 in good pitch 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.140
 along with the 7 comes this charger 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:22.790
 ear bracket and 1934 headset arares 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.790

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.940
 a lot of money even me 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.550
 it 's worth buying 7 good account only 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.900
 battery so give the best even in 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:49.200
 home, but it's okay to show what I know 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:54.229
 if I know it 's a joke of agreement 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.229
 the phone stays that way, cooks 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:06.460

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.230

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:21.780

 video is who you want on psn psn but no 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.019
 talk that you are enrolled now think about 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:34.269
 absurd even if you want empire 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:35.410
 with me something like that and the internet is in 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.860
 boston 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.810
 Who was there and I'm going to call here 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.989
 you see kuta on battery when you 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:48.400
 Arrive without battery is enough. 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:53.049
 blue line too that when you call 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.680
 or it would have obviously been for the 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.450
 red 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:04.280
 the goal because today I think that was it 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:09.319
 that's what you end up remembering 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:14.930
 thing is clear if this video even tries to 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.699
 I'm going to teach you how this r7 is at 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.519
 your playstation 3 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:23.120
 It's my case is the new playstation 3 does not 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.350
 another good example 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.350
 A hug and see you next
