 a recipe that is also very fast 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.510
 well then let's see what they are 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.350
 ingredients that serve for the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.260
 realization of this dish we have 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 field flowers about 600 grams breadcrumbs 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.090
 and grated parmesan or grana padano cheese 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 in short, 40 grams and 40 g in the item 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.509
 Muscat to the pleasure you can put 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.619
 salt pepper until we need it for 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.350
 go and season our cauliflower 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.140
 little salt until you use guide 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.820
 the important ingredient is then the class 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.979
 you can use both the apple town 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.859
 that there is no wine vinegar 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.689
 problem of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.079
 and of the coarse salt that we will go to instead 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.659
 put in our pot where 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.719
 we will listen to them as we do 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.539
 listen to them listen what we do 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.369
 first of all let's get inside 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.139
 water and then we add the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.509
 salt as big as if we were cooking 

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:44.249
 of pasta that we understand 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.749
 add a little apple vinegar 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.959
 this center becomes fundamental 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:52.349
 He will pull away this time 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:55.109
 re maybe a bit of cauliflower i 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:57.090
 kids don't love you because they have this 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.930
 it will be a little strong instead I go to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.090
 do so in a particular way 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.470
 they learn to betray them well then 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.240
 let's start right away what's ours 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.210
 preparation begins to put the salt 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.210
 in water and apple vinegar 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.690
 perfect 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.640
 ok 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:52.659
 great effect now when it starts again 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.390
 to boil we make it go for three 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.250
 minutes after which we spend on fire 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.159
 eros we put in the bowl 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.269
 obviously we washed and dried 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.500
 news that everything 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.909
 we are going to put together the 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.250
 ingredients then the parmesan the 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:13.540
 I recommend the nutmeg and breadcrumbs 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.060
 the priest does not even have a tip if you want 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.900
 you can also put some capers inside 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.250
 of something outside I will become today 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.709
 I'm going to add the hair also 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.269
 because it really really comes 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:35.340
 delicious then we see all the 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:35.340
 ingredients inside the nutmeg 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.170
 Well 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.050
 no 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.300
 effect 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.510
 after the towns 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.340
 capers really give it a scent 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.180
 3 minutes later the cauliflower took place 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.889
 they are made perfect since it is 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.889
 started boiling and vascular 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:47.889
 put a little oil in one 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:50.439
 plate and keep in the oven at 200 degrees 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.659
 let's start to heat it then 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.710
 we strip free and add it on 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.710
 our cauliflowers 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.940
 to 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.240
 let's add a little bit of the low 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:13.509
 breading after which we go to 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.520
 put a little oil on top then 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:19.499
 go to coat friendly with 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.499
 the other breading 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:36.870
 so let's go out to shape memory 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.870
 2 always ready 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.690
 we see 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.640
 perfect 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.860
 perfect 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.199
 ok then we invited him as you see 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:11.620
 we made half a plate because this 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.389
 it is a point to realize 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.849
 let's try each case then 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.819
 which I will put a sea bass on 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.860
 She is doing to the plate inter alia a 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.430
 of those that many think it is 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.990
 only good for making the toast is actually 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:30.960
 also perfect for cooking meat 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.960
 or fish or let's try to see 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.660
 it was a delicious mind 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.890
 very good if still back in salt 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.590
 according to your taste add a little 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:52.350
 of salt is fine for me 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:56.130

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.830
 nutmeg that really but I do n't 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:02.460
 releases for those deep flavors 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:05.250

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.430

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:25.590
