00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 dear viewer if you fall for it 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.120
 video you need a computer 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.830
 exclusively for playing in the world of tanks 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.719
 no need to try to adapt this 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 assembly for something else for this purpose 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.509
 there are other videos so the basis was 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.789
 Intel Pentium g 3258 processor taken 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.100
 sample overclocking works great 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.400
 with tanks slightly inferior overclocked 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.010
 a7 4790 kei without hyper trading for 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.720
 better performance in this regard 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 far behind such more expensive 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.100
 budget solutions like fx 8320 or again 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.710
 the entry-level version is not boxed 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.629
 we do not need a box cooler, but a higher one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.120
 a three year warranty we consider an extra 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.829
 as if the processor is working then it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 all current life works 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 fuer was chosen itself cheap from the price 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.140
 but stream heat pipes of it for 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.760
 I have two lovers overclocking should be enough 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.870
 500 zalman padded jacket was chosen because 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
 quiet and inexpensive 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.059
 and 500 watts should be enough for us 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.899
 if a stock in your store is not exactly 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.149
 such a model 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.780
 make a list of power models 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.030
 450 600 watts further starting from the cheap 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 google model and reviews and reviews 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.020
 make representations if the block 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.189
 food is quiet and no claims needed 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.750
 take the f9 280 video card now one of 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.540
 best in terms of price and quality 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 therefore, it was chosen if it is cheaper 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.970
 look towards r7 260 5 if more expensive 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.390
 r9 280x 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.579
 or 290 with nvidia video cards 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.170
 performance in tanks is slightly better 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.579
 however, precisely in terms of the ratio 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.790
 price quality 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:44.250
 maps like gtx660 760 770 780 are weak 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.960
 suitable green lovers can 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.409
 put gtx760 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 it is their right to housing aerocool v3x 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.570
 the crisis is quite relevant to itself spacious 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.000
 inexpensive blown though honestly 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.250
 we would have a pacifier pak off the market 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.340
 White durable case for 200 rubles and not 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.170
 would steal a case not a bad video card 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.590
 not slipped for all at once you can see if 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.520
 inspect 500 gigabytes of hard drive from 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.619
 western digital 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.930
 reliable brand enough 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.080
 sufficient flea speed what else 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.080
 need to 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.180
 2 strips of 4 gigabytes of the cheapest 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.040
 memory from memory price if it 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.730
 will earn immediately it will work 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.920
 over the years, otherwise you will not change the warranty 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.430
 the last and most important point system 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.610
 fee we need to chase before we 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.849
 You picked up a cheap solution on a chipset 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.680
 IL-81 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.560
 but in new bios ah, the acceleration of steel 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.540
 spend the night so alas more expensive she 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.120
 reliable and in terms of overclocking the motherboard from 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.769
 asrock 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.819
 The purpose of our assemblies is to buy everything 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.489
 earned immediately 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.150
 And so of course with cheaper IL-81 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.970
 mothers 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.819
 You can tinker to return the old bios or 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.129
 make a voltmod pencil about it 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.690
 in detail on the forum of those in the kitchen and our 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.489
 six hundred and forty 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.590
 dollars on the day of the review 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.840
 we will consider it in dollars more convenient 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.840
 assembly rule Arina all for now
