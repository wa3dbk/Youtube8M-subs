so in comparison to the Make Up For Ever
HD<00:00:43.110> looks<00:00:44.110> quite<00:00:44.920> different<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.640> packaging

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
HD looks quite different the packaging

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.110 
HD looks quite different the packaging
is<00:00:46.360> different<00:00:46.810> it<00:00:47.590> is<00:00:47.860> like<00:00:48.370> shorter<00:00:48.730> looking

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
is different it is like shorter looking

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.880 
is different it is like shorter looking
but<00:00:49.450> they<00:00:49.570> both<00:00:49.690> contain<00:00:49.960> one<00:00:50.350> fluid<00:00:50.650> ounce

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
but they both contain one fluid ounce

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.700 
but they both contain one fluid ounce
actually<00:00:51.880> the<00:00:52.570> make<00:00:52.840> up<00:00:52.960> for<00:00:52.990> ever<00:00:53.200> matte

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
actually the make up for ever matte

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
actually the make up for ever matte
velvet<00:00:54.010> contains<00:00:54.720> 1.0<00:00:55.720> 12<00:00:56.200> ounces<00:00:56.620> but<00:00:57.400> I<00:00:57.460> mean

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
velvet contains 1.0 12 ounces but I mean

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.640 
velvet contains 1.0 12 ounces but I mean
sound<00:00:57.970> like<00:00:58.090> it's<00:00:58.240> noticeable<00:00:58.840> so<00:00:59.470> the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
sound like it's noticeable so the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.710 
sound like it's noticeable so the
packaging<00:01:00.100> is<00:01:00.220> slightly<00:01:00.460> different<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:01.180> home

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720

soft the texture on the outside is

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.209

whatever you just twist it back on and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.100 
whatever you just twist it back on and
yeah<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:30.880> like<00:01:31.090> about<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.420> packaging<00:01:31.930> is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
yeah what I like about the packaging is

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.700

because i've been using a lot more

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.900 
because i've been using a lot more
recently<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.950> it's<00:01:42.130> easy<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:42.640> put<00:01:42.820> in

loving<00:02:08.920> they<00:02:09.220> make<00:02:09.369> up<00:02:09.490> forever<00:02:09.700> HD<00:02:09.960> but<00:02:10.960> I<00:02:11.200> I

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
loving they make up forever HD but I I

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.260 
loving they make up forever HD but I I
realized<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.370> can't<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.760> using<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.090> all

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
realized that I can't be using that all

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.960 
realized that I can't be using that all
the<00:02:13.360> time<00:02:13.420> especially<00:02:13.780> when<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:14.710> hotter<00:02:15.610> and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
the time especially when it's hotter and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.630 
the time especially when it's hotter and
I<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.390> need<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.840> modified<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.800> um<00:02:18.280> I

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
I really need to be modified so um I

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.880 
I really need to be modified so um I
finally<00:02:19.570> was<00:02:19.900> able<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.200> pick<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.410> up<00:02:20.560> maybe<00:02:20.770> a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
finally was able to pick this up maybe a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.580 
finally was able to pick this up maybe a
month<00:02:21.220> ago<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.790> I've<00:02:21.850> been<00:02:21.880> using<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.590> pretty

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
month ago and I've been using it pretty

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.190 
month ago and I've been using it pretty
frequently<00:02:24.430> since<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.720> have<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.959> say<00:02:26.020> that

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
frequently since and I have to say that

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.610 
frequently since and I have to say that
I<00:02:26.440> like<00:02:26.740> this<00:02:27.240> probably<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.660> much<00:02:28.840> if<00:02:29.560> not

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
I like this probably just as much if not

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.140 
I like this probably just as much if not
more<00:02:29.890> because<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.640> actually<00:02:30.790> has<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
more because it actually has the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.080 
more because it actually has the
mattifying<00:02:31.690> qualities<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:33.430> blends<00:02:33.700> ability

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
mattifying qualities the blends ability

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.660 
mattifying qualities the blends ability
is<00:02:34.209> still<00:02:34.540> pretty<00:02:35.110> remarkable<00:02:35.800> even<00:02:36.580> though

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
is still pretty remarkable even though

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.430 
is still pretty remarkable even though
it's<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.910> mattifying<00:02:37.180> foundation<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.140> blends

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
it's a mattifying foundation it blends

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.250 
it's a mattifying foundation it blends
really<00:02:38.709> well<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:40.030> has<00:02:40.209> color<00:02:40.900> matching

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
really well it has color matching

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.530 
really well it has color matching
properties<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:42.010> even<00:02:42.340> if<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:42.880> not<00:02:43.090> exactly

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
properties so even if it's not exactly

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.360 
properties so even if it's not exactly
your<00:02:43.690> color<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.200> will<00:02:44.410> oxidize<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.890> little<00:02:45.220> bit

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
your color it will oxidize a little bit

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.390 
your color it will oxidize a little bit
and<00:02:45.519> match<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.360> color<00:02:46.860> pretty<00:02:47.860> well<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
and match the color pretty well the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.590 
and match the color pretty well the
thing<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.610> didn't<00:02:51.880> like<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.269> much<00:02:52.300> about

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
thing that I didn't like so much about

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.800 
thing that I didn't like so much about
it<00:02:52.750> though<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.930> when<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.440> got<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.570> think<00:02:55.750> a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
it though is when I got it and I think a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.570 
it though is when I got it and I think a
lot<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:55.989> people<00:02:56.080> have<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.530> problem<00:02:56.860> when<00:02:57.489> you

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
lot of people have this problem when you

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.640 
lot of people have this problem when you
open<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.269> first<00:02:58.570> time<00:02:58.720> very<00:02:59.260> first<00:02:59.500> time

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
open it the first time very first time

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.870 
open it the first time very first time
after<00:02:59.800> you<00:03:00.010> get<00:03:00.130> out<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.370> box<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.790> you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
after you get out of the box and you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.600 
after you get out of the box and you
open<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.750> continuously<00:03:02.709> pours<00:03:03.220> out<00:03:03.550> I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
open it it continuously pours out I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.250 
open it it continuously pours out I
think<00:03:03.850> it's<00:03:04.090> because<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.870> way<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.140> was

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
think it's because the way it was

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.410 
think it's because the way it was
packaged<00:03:05.769> there's<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.670> pressure<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
packaged there's the pressure and the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.860 
packaged there's the pressure and the
product<00:03:08.050> is

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
product is

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.170 
product is
slept<00:03:09.049> in<00:03:09.230> there<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:09.739> when<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.069> release<00:03:10.849> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
slept in there so when you release the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.990 
slept in there so when you release the
air<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.470> make<00:03:12.860> these<00:03:13.069> splits<00:03:13.370> exposed<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:13.909> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
air and make these splits exposed to the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.140 
air and make these splits exposed to the
air<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> product<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.220> surges<00:03:16.940> out<00:03:17.060> of

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
air to the product just surges out of

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.210 
air to the product just surges out of
the<00:03:17.239> top<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.379> was<00:03:18.500> really<00:03:18.680> gross<00:03:18.920> like

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the top and it was really gross like

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.740 
the top and it was really gross like
this<00:03:19.489> probably<00:03:19.700> sounds<00:03:19.970> still<00:03:20.299> stuck<00:03:20.599> in

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
this probably sounds still stuck in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.890 
this probably sounds still stuck in
there<00:03:20.989> but<00:03:21.739> like<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.700> first<00:03:22.879> two<00:03:23.150> uses<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.629> had

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
there but like the first two uses I had

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.050 
there but like the first two uses I had
to<00:03:24.019> try<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.560> salvage<00:03:25.220> as<00:03:25.610> much<00:03:25.640> as<00:03:25.909> I<00:03:26.000> could

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
to try and salvage as much as I could

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.960 
to try and salvage as much as I could
off<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.450> what<00:03:26.810> was<00:03:27.190> stuck<00:03:28.190> around<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.760> tip

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
off of what was stuck around the tip

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.750 
off of what was stuck around the tip
yeah<00:03:29.349> I<00:03:30.349> mean<00:03:30.680> other<00:03:30.890> than<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.280> kind<00:03:31.670> of

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
yeah I mean other than that I kind of

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.220 
yeah I mean other than that I kind of
like<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.120> packaging<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.690> kind<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.930> like<00:03:33.049> the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
like the packaging I kind of like the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.839 
like the packaging I kind of like the
fact<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.500> just<00:03:33.799> squeeze<00:03:34.099> instead<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.579> pump

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
fact that just squeeze instead of a pump

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.210 
fact that just squeeze instead of a pump
it<00:03:35.480> makes<00:03:35.659> sort<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.049> easier<00:03:36.470> but<00:03:36.799> it<00:03:36.920> doesn't

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
it makes sort of easier but it doesn't

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.160 
it makes sort of easier but it doesn't
give<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.459> an<00:03:37.610> idea<00:03:37.730> how<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.480> gauge<00:03:38.810> how<00:03:39.110> much

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
give you an idea how to gauge how much

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.110 
give you an idea how to gauge how much
your<00:03:39.470> pudding<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.920> mean<00:03:40.129> you<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.370> see<00:03:40.610> but<00:03:40.970> it's

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
your pudding I mean you can see but it's

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.680 
your pudding I mean you can see but it's
not<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.540> same<00:03:41.780> as<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.230> know<00:03:42.349> one<00:03:42.859> pup<00:03:43.209> but<00:03:44.209> I

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
not the same as you know one pup but I

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.759 
not the same as you know one pup but I
mean<00:03:45.410> overall<00:03:46.129> I<00:03:46.250> really<00:03:46.489> like<00:03:46.849> it<00:03:47.590> but<00:03:48.590> yeah

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
mean overall I really like it but yeah

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.759 
mean overall I really like it but yeah
price<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.299> Make<00:03:50.480> Up<00:03:50.510> For<00:03:50.629> Ever<00:03:50.810> HD<00:03:51.079> is

but not everybody it means mattifying

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.160 
but not everybody it means mattifying
foundation<00:04:07.579> so<00:04:08.180> that's<00:04:08.329> why<00:04:08.599> they<00:04:08.840> have<00:04:08.870> the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
foundation so that's why they have the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.890

HD<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:09.859> more<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.340> rounded<00:04:10.970> one<00:04:11.180> even

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
HD it's more of the rounded one even

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.729
