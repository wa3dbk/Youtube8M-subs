this issue which we will discuss later

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.140 
this issue which we will discuss later
so<00:05:10.590> how<00:05:10.770> does<00:05:10.830> all<00:05:11.099> of<00:05:11.159> this<00:05:11.310> relate<00:05:11.819> to<00:05:12.060> how

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
so how does all of this relate to how

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.950 
so how does all of this relate to how
aperture<00:05:12.750> size<00:05:12.990> affects<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.830> depth<00:05:14.069> of<00:05:14.250> field

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
aperture size affects the depth of field

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.570 
aperture size affects the depth of field
when<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.110> diameter<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.949> aperture<00:05:17.279> is

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
when the diameter of the aperture is

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.879 
when the diameter of the aperture is
larger<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.750> light<00:05:18.960> rays<00:05:19.199> make<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.590> more

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
larger the light rays make a more

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.570 
larger the light rays make a more
drastic<00:05:20.129> change<00:05:20.699> of<00:05:20.849> direction<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.629> converge

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
drastic change of direction to converge

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.580 
drastic change of direction to converge
so<00:05:23.580> moving<00:05:23.939> our<00:05:24.060> red<00:05:24.330> dot<00:05:24.629> to<00:05:24.960> align<00:05:25.259> with<00:05:25.469> an

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
so moving our red dot to align with an

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.559 
so moving our red dot to align with an
area<00:05:25.919> of<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:26.279> cone<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.909> has<00:05:26.969> the<00:05:27.330> same

diameter<00:05:27.979> we<00:05:28.979> see<00:05:29.219> that<00:05:29.370> our<00:05:29.520> depth<00:05:29.789> of<00:05:30.000> focus

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
diameter we see that our depth of focus

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.649 
diameter we see that our depth of focus
has<00:05:30.599> become<00:05:30.990> much<00:05:31.229> shorter<00:05:32.150> since<00:05:33.150> depth<00:05:33.449> of

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
focus and depth of field are directly

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.019 
focus and depth of field are directly
related<00:05:36.419> to<00:05:36.900> each<00:05:37.050> other<00:05:37.370> this<00:05:38.370> means<00:05:38.699> that

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 
related to each other this means that

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.010 
related to each other this means that
the<00:05:39.150> depth<00:05:39.389> of<00:05:39.599> field<00:05:39.839> will<00:05:40.139> also<00:05:40.560> be<00:05:40.740> short

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
the depth of field will also be short

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.930 
the depth of field will also be short
when<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.139> aperture<00:05:43.620> is<00:05:43.740> small<00:05:44.099> the<00:05:44.729> light

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
when the aperture is small the light

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.850 
when the aperture is small the light
rays<00:05:45.210> make<00:05:45.539> a<00:05:45.569> much<00:05:45.839> slighter<00:05:46.199> change<00:05:46.650> of

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
rays make a much slighter change of

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.390 
rays make a much slighter change of
direction<00:05:47.009> to<00:05:47.580> converge<00:05:48.469> this<00:05:49.469> increases<00:05:50.250> our

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
direction to converge this increases our

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.809 
direction to converge this increases our
depth<00:05:50.669> of<00:05:50.879> focus<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.539> depth<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:52.110> field<00:05:52.409> in

depth of focus and depth of field in
this<00:05:53.819> case<00:05:53.879> there<00:05:54.509> is<00:05:54.629> much<00:05:54.839> more<00:05:55.110> room<00:05:55.379> for

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:39.870 
creates a smaller aperture opening
inside<00:06:39.300> the<00:06:39.539> lens

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
inside the lens

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.850 
inside the lens
it's<00:06:39.970> a<00:06:41.070> smaller<00:06:42.070> f-stop<00:06:42.730> such<00:06:43.270> as<00:06:43.480> f<00:06:43.860> 2.8

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
it's a smaller f-stop such as f 2.8

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.590 
it's a smaller f-stop such as f 2.8
creates<00:06:45.670> a<00:06:45.820> larger<00:06:46.270> aperture<00:06:46.630> opening<00:06:48.450> so<00:06:49.450> the

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
creates a larger aperture opening so the

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600 
creates a larger aperture opening so the

depth of field are as follows a low
f-stop<00:06:55.390> setting<00:06:55.870> creates<00:06:56.230> a<00:06:56.380> larger<00:06:56.800> diameter

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
f-stop setting creates a larger diameter

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.810 
f-stop setting creates a larger diameter
aperture<00:06:58.030> and<00:06:58.210> a<00:06:58.390> short<00:06:58.690> depth<00:06:58.990> of<00:06:59.200> field<00:06:59.440> a

aperture and a short depth of field a
high<00:07:00.820> f-stop<00:07:01.330> setting<00:07:01.810> creates<00:07:02.170> a<00:07:02.350> smaller

high f-stop setting creates a smaller

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.280 
high f-stop setting creates a smaller
