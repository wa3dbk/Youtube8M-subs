fascinated<00:01:59.040> by<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.820> whole<00:02:00.119> idea<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
fascinated by this whole idea which to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260 
fascinated by this whole idea which to
us<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.799> Indians<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.310> normal<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.909> mean<00:02:02.939> growing

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
us as Indians is normal I mean growing

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
largely I mean I'm not saying that in

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.080 
largely I mean I'm not saying that in
the<00:02:21.540> urban<00:02:21.870> culture<00:02:22.200> people<00:02:22.349> are<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.680> living

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
largely as a culture this is the setup

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.050 
largely as a culture this is the setup
we're<00:02:27.989> all<00:02:28.140> very<00:02:28.500> very<00:02:28.590> family-oriented<00:02:29.370> can

we're all very very family-oriented can

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.229 
we're all very very family-oriented can

well I don't have one eventually and and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.170 
well I don't have one eventually and and
there<00:02:37.109> is<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> lot<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.680> well<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.670> lot<00:02:38.879> of<00:02:38.909> love

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
there is a lot of well a lot of love

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.910 
there is a lot of well a lot of love
marriages<00:02:39.629> or<00:02:39.840> people<00:02:40.349> kind<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.650> getting

married by their own choices in India

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.550 
married by their own choices in India
today<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:45.180> largely<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.200> look<00:02:46.349> at<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
today but largely if you look at the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.770 
today but largely if you look at the
heart<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.950> India<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.090> population<00:02:48.659> is

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
heart of India and and the population is

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.849 
heart of India and and the population is
huge<00:02:49.409> so<00:02:50.099> largely<00:02:50.549> yes<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
huge so largely yes it is that is the

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.460 
huge so largely yes it is that is the
more<00:02:53.010> common<00:02:53.370> practice<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.780> Indians<00:02:55.170> or<00:02:55.349> as

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
more common practice as as Indians or as

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.129 
more common practice as as Indians or as
a<00:02:55.500> culture<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.129> there<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> feeling<00:02:57.329> in<00:02:57.480> India

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
a culture is there a feeling in India

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.440 
a culture is there a feeling in India
that<00:02:58.379> India<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> rising<00:02:59.730> force<00:02:59.760> on<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that India is a rising force on the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.240 
that India is a rising force on the
world<00:03:00.629> stage

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
world stage

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.949 
world stage
well<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.639> not<00:03:02.879> just<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.209> India<00:03:03.359> I<00:03:03.569> think<00:03:03.810> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
well it's not just in India I think I

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.599 
well it's not just in India I think I
think<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.290> feeling<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.889> world<00:03:05.129> over<00:03:05.489> and

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
think this feeling is world over and

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.979 
think this feeling is world over and
it's<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.790> great<00:03:05.970> feeling<00:03:06.239> it's<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.569> wonderful

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
it's a great feeling it's a wonderful

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.410 
it's a great feeling it's a wonderful
feeling<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.799> UK<00:03:08.220> time<00:03:08.700> rising<00:03:09.239> and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
feeling is the UK time rising and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.119 
feeling is the UK time rising and
established<00:03:09.930> for<00:03:10.109> other<00:03:10.290> stuff<00:03:10.560> I'd<00:03:10.889> love<00:03:11.069> to

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
established for other stuff I'd love to

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.940 
established for other stuff I'd love to
correct<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.730> correct<00:03:12.569> away<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.590> UK

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
correct that correct away is the UK

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.939 
correct that correct away is the UK
taken<00:03:14.459> seriously<00:03:14.879> in<00:03:15.150> India<00:03:15.540> yes<00:03:16.019> oh<00:03:16.500> yeah

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
taken seriously in India yes oh yeah

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.369 
taken seriously in India yes oh yeah
obviously<00:03:17.699> I<00:03:17.730> think<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.569> have<00:03:18.720> an<00:03:18.810> old<00:03:18.959> connect

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
obviously I think we have an old connect

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.930 
obviously I think we have an old connect
and<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.760> that's<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.889> steady<00:03:22.980> even<00:03:23.609> today<00:03:23.910> I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
and and that's going steady even today I

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.110 
and and that's going steady even today I
think<00:03:24.299> especially<00:03:24.599> through<00:03:25.489> multimedia<00:03:26.489> and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
think especially through multimedia and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.449 
think especially through multimedia and
and<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.470> think<00:03:28.500> Indians<00:03:28.919> are<00:03:29.040> everywhere

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
and just I think Indians are everywhere

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.629 
and just I think Indians are everywhere
we<00:03:29.699> have<00:03:29.730> such<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> strong<00:03:30.599> expect<00:03:31.609> community

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
we have such a strong expect community

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.270 
we have such a strong expect community
Indian<00:03:33.449> Asian<00:03:33.780> community<00:03:34.230> here<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.709> UK<00:03:34.980> in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
Indian Asian community here in the UK in

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.789 
Indian Asian community here in the UK in
London<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.199> think<00:03:37.409> it's<00:03:37.530> only<00:03:37.650> natural

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
London that I think it's only natural

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.129 
London that I think it's only natural
that<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.370> connect<00:03:38.669> exists<00:03:39.419> do<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.959> think

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
that the connect exists do you think

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.680 
that the connect exists do you think
there<00:03:40.260> will<00:03:40.349> always<00:03:40.620> be<00:03:40.799> severe<00:03:41.579> poverty<00:03:42.030> in

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
there will always be severe poverty in

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.839 
there will always be severe poverty in
India<00:03:42.840> not<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.919> in<00:03:44.040> India<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:44.579> I<00:03:44.639> think

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
India not just in India but I think

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.949 
India not just in India but I think
world<00:03:45.030> over<00:03:45.449> and<00:03:45.690> we<00:03:46.669> strive<00:03:47.669> as<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.569> human

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
world over and we strive as a human

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.530 
world over and we strive as a human
community<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.590> try<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.129> erase<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.329> term

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
community to try and erase the term

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.899 
community to try and erase the term
severe<00:03:52.109> if<00:03:52.349> not<00:03:52.650> erase<00:03:53.129> poverty<00:03:53.669> or<00:03:53.760> together

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
severe if not erase poverty or together
