00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
together from someone who went to the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150 
together from someone who went to the
factory<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.960> after<00:00:25.230> National<00:00:25.650> closed<00:00:25.920> and

factory right after National closed and

so knowing that there are a bunch of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
so knowing that there are a bunch of
places<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.950> go<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> find<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.670> what

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
places that you can go to find out what

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880 
places that you can go to find out what
the<00:01:09.000> fingerings<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.930> rather<00:01:10.229> than<00:01:10.439> spend<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the fingerings are rather than spend a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
the fingerings are rather than spend a
while<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> show<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> fingerings

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
while and show you the fingerings

because they're out there all over the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.710 
because they're out there all over the
places<00:01:13.799> tab<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.700> videos<00:01:15.030> I'm<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
places tab or as videos I'm going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.920 
places tab or as videos I'm going to
show<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:16.110> particular<00:01:16.590> approach<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
show you my particular approach to it

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.530 
show you my particular approach to it
which<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.290> try<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> emulate<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.549> clavinet

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
which is to try to emulate the clavinet

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
which is to try to emulate the clavinet
sound<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.170> Stevie<00:01:22.590> uses<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.280> instead<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
sound that Stevie uses on it instead of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820 
sound that Stevie uses on it instead of
doing<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> guitar<00:01:24.450> approach<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.320> there's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
doing the guitar approach and there's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830 
doing the guitar approach and there's
the<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.549> cold<00:01:26.790> shot<00:01:27.030> video<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.600> talked

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the the cold shot video that we talked

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.429 
the the cold shot video that we talked
about<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:32.479> but<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.869> order<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.259> try

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
about you can do it but in order to try

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
about you can do it but in order to try
and<00:01:34.470> emulate<00:01:34.829> Stevie's<00:01:35.460> clavinet<00:01:36.030> sound<00:01:36.360> I've

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and emulate Stevie's clavinet sound I've

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.109 
and emulate Stevie's clavinet sound I've
been<00:01:36.900> doing<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> way<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.189> get<00:01:38.700> real

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
been doing it in a way that I get real

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.830 
been doing it in a way that I get real
close<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.770> with<00:01:40.770> my<00:01:40.979> pick<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.670> feel<00:01:42.570> pretty

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
close up with my pick and feel pretty

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
close up with my pick and feel pretty
hard<00:01:43.140> I'm<00:01:43.350> almost<00:01:43.680> picking<00:01:44.130> double<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
hard I'm almost picking double the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.260 
hard I'm almost picking double the
amount<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.240> notes<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.659> you're<00:01:45.930> hearing<00:01:46.229> like

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
amount of notes that you're hearing like

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.200 
amount of notes that you're hearing like
get<00:01:48.270> real<00:01:48.509> close<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> bridge<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> doesn't

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
get real close to the bridge it doesn't

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.690 
get real close to the bridge it doesn't
connect<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.229> left<00:01:52.470> hand<00:01:52.860> I'm<00:01:53.070> kind

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
connect and with my left hand I'm kind

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
connect and with my left hand I'm kind
of<00:01:53.759> after<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> hit<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.600> notes<00:01:54.960> picking<00:01:55.740> my

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
of after I hit the notes picking my

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.459 
of after I hit the notes picking my
finger<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.329> staccato<00:01:57.990> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
finger up so it's really staccato so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.840 
finger up so it's really staccato so
it's<00:01:58.590> almost<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.070> you're<00:01:59.310> playing<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.820> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it's almost like you're playing it on a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's almost like you're playing it on a
harpsichord<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.750> something<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> result

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
harpsichord or something so the result

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:11.110 
harpsichord or something so the result
is<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.970 

so<00:02:12.120> usually<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.630> preach<00:02:12.990> economy<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.770> motion

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so usually I preach economy of motion

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.680 
so usually I preach economy of motion
and<00:02:14.370> making<00:02:14.670> sure<00:02:14.850> you're<00:02:14.970> not<00:02:15.150> doing<00:02:15.510> more

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and making sure you're not doing more

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.060 
and making sure you're not doing more
than<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.960> have<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.320> but<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.620> order<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> get
