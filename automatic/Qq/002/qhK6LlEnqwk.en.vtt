00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.030
 sometimes it just takes a little longer 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.290
 until you find your place in life 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:13.020
 has check out your babies the 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.020
 trade academy choose your life 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.150
 is a classic school chair of the 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.950
 is guilty of trying to try 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.490
 to feel comfortable here on this one 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.460
 armchair 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.360
 At that time it was also an easy chair ride 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.640
 you can still actually so 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.850
 memories could come back with the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.650
 gone to school and see the schools and 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.420
 That's why I'm so committed to 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.430
 further development of the school system or 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.290
 also the spatial structures 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.630
 because the whole important time in life 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.910
 every human is actually mine 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.180
 wanted good student 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.070
 if not the bad student 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.709
 but buy why interested but rather 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.870
 good student with a handbag the 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.030
 Matura no matter where you are five years old 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.040
 or then you just have the amigos 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.510
 a completed education and it 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.370
 was important to me because I did not 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.020
 sure what i want to study i have 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.390
 they sure can use very well because 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.680
 you would always somewhere have a job 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.950
 but the forces say make me 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.310
 self-employed and self-employed 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.390
 you only with a certain education 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.760
 either you have teacher's room and the 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.100
 hak matura helped me of course 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.870
 to carry a trade license so 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.080
 so to speak it became very important to me 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.120
 The trade academy has changed in time 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.070
 where I visited Hansa chemistry until 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.140
 up today has changed enormously 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.260
 just because such an area spoke 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.450
 goes wider education practice reference and 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.340
 I think that's just it and that 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.090
 is on and there just is not 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:55.400
 expenditure so the trade academy is 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.590
 very good basis for the future if you 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.110
 Gymnasium has matura normal motorcycle 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.240
 a broad education but if you 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.370
 trade academies has and yet only as 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.280
 Specific training also by profession 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.990
 and the belief is in connection with 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.280
 the generally let the endangered plant 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.280
 the very important story
