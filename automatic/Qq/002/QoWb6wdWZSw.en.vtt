 the object that we advertise 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.710
 so choose sanctions 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.610
 aside from being present by 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.940
 salons advertised 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940
 the object of his photographs and 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.500

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.199
 in the ad unit 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.759
 that is, it adds a forest to the ad network 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.299
 when we have a person sees that 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.189
 exactly recommended 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.650
 if the main and who is in the meeting 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.329
 experiments 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.529
 and how to determine which of these 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.659
 items 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.179
 meets the plan 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.449
 the most accurate 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.179
 and the correct perception of this 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:38.539
 advertising such an opinion it should be 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.569
 main link advertising offered 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.699
 no or not but he must carry the main 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.919
 sense grid 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.939
 load is about ad unit 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.409
 she if to speak 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.739
 in place of too, I will say that hard rules 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.039
 as there is text can be the main 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.079
 dominant element so and 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.779
 photo picture any situation can 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.569
 carry the main meaning 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.779
 also colors can be made 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.699
 ad unit 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.109
 arrange it in such a way that we have everything 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.019
 no will transmit stop emotions 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.559
 and the main such informational message 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.109
 and of course the advertised object 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.930
 that is, these elements may exist 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.170
 separately 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.050
 without presence without the presence of others 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.799
 items 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.169
 of course you can do so of course 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.900
 you can use the icon at the same time 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.089
 in many clans 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.329
 blocks 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.939
 yesterday's sport is still all individually 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.369
 regarding each advertising campaign 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:43.369
 and here to say which of these elements 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.659
 must dominate 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.210
 here's an ad unit it would be 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.709
 rather wrong 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.109
 but essentially this one for certain 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.399
 directions defined motogp 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:56.059
 vector 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.829
 advancing directions which 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.999
 always gets to a point athlete 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.010
 exclusively 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.409
 for the money and will stay yet do not know 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.229
 why didn't you say of course 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.060
 I'm talking about ideas now 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.339
 and team 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:13.769
 the idea is 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.419
 what causes your interest 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.359
 advertising is better 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.340
 always your advertisement should cause 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.410
 interest if your advertisement is not interested 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.419
 if you apply people 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.680
 Especially if the claim of your advertising 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.620
 this is unclear 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.560
 you promote and advertise then he 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.650
 worthless and such a team 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.090
 there must be an idea 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.999
 it is most important 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:42.729
 fencing 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.840
 that's because it spills over india 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 that's advertised 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.800
 BTA Bank 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.580
 a service 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.389
 that is your idea 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.800
 must be 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.090
 to advertise 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.509
