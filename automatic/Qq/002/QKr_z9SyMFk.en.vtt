00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.199 
don't know I don't know back to students
or<00:03:40.739> things<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.250> better<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.700> school<00:03:41.910> they

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
or things that better the school they

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.110 
or things that better the school they
try<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.750> give<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:42.989> away<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.140> somewhere<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:44.120> don't

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
try to give it away to somewhere I don't

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.340 
try to give it away to somewhere I don't
think<00:03:45.300> that<00:03:45.360> they're<00:03:45.720> gonna<00:03:45.780> give<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.140> away<00:03:46.230> to

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
think that they're gonna give it away to

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.470 
think that they're gonna give it away to
someone<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.370> think<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.300> the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
someone but I think that it's the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.300 
someone but I think that it's the
principle<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.110> matter<00:03:49.230> though<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.950> like

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
principle of the matter though I like

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.330 
principle of the matter though I like
the<00:03:50.459> night<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.970> it's<00:03:51.450> not<00:03:51.600> going<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.989> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
the night that it's not going to the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.830 
the night that it's not going to the
benefit<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.370> them<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:54.150> can<00:03:54.300> tell<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.630> they

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
benefit of them we can tell that they

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.600 
benefit of them we can tell that they
don't<00:03:55.019> care<00:03:55.200> about<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.380> part<00:03:55.739> no<00:03:56.280> they<00:03:56.430> don't

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
don't care about that part no they don't

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.949 
don't care about that part no they don't
give<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.940> about<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.150> students<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.780> think

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
give a about the students I think

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.660 
give a about the students I think
that's<00:03:58.140> very<00:03:58.620> clear<00:03:58.920> especially<00:03:59.190> when<00:03:59.580> it

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
that's very clear especially when it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.280 
that's very clear especially when it
comes<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.910> budget<00:04:00.120> cuts<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.019> still<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
comes to budget cuts but it's still the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.930 
comes to budget cuts but it's still the
principle<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.860> matter<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.610> have<00:04:02.730> your

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
principle of the matter to have your

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.640 
principle of the matter to have your
university<00:04:03.480> president<00:04:03.930> get<00:04:04.050> paid<00:04:04.260> nearly<00:04:04.470> a
