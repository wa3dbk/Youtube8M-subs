00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.320
 And ok, maybe I should get a real job. 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.940
 And ok, mom always tells me to be serious. 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.720
 And ok, I want to aim high to touch the sky. 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.820
 And ok, I take my parents with me from scratch. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.500
 We started from scratch, started from scratch and started from scratch (brrrah) 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.380
 we started from zè we started from zè we started from scratch, ahhhhhh 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.520

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.220
 we started from zè we started from scratch, ahhhhh 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.620
 she tells me that she loves me but nobody loves those who are on the street 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.680
 who thinks of money before life because without money life tears you apart 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.660
 and we are without faith, without heart the blockade fires with the silencer 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.780
 between leaves you on the ground but leaves no evidence 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.780
 even in the midst of thirty I miss a witness 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.400
 we dream of these euros, made by ourselves from scratch 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.400
 with some friends resting in peace 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 and a few friends who rest in the cool 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.560
 give me a reason to stay calm 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.720
 I can't even miss a g in my palm 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.380
 I'm around tired with white face 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.680
 with my partner beside him who turns her around in the meantime 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.820
 above and below the stage the same person 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.720
 if not, I slap when I get back to the area 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.900
 all my people don't dream of graduating 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.440
 he dreams of a gun, to shoot you in the throat 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.060
 we started from scratch, started from scratch and started from scratch 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.400

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.680
 I take these rappers from the feet, like the Albanian ganja plants 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.980
 let us smoke then get up, you are on the fuck is better if you avoid us 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.600
 detachment of heads with the micro, ask for sphere is always provided 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.540
 I can't stand you I'm not your friend, my boys make you the myth 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.820
 under the buildings to smoke like chimneys 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.960
 never socialized with the carabiniere 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.900
 we grew up among good people without learning good manners 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.460
 the coolest flow in the area, trap king in person, this stuff is impressive 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.340
 you stay at home you can't keep up with me 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.340
 I look away and you are no longer in the glass 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.880

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.580

 and ok, I take my frà with me we started from scratch 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.740

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.740
