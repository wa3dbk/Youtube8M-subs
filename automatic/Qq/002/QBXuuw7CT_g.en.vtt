augsburg so there you go he goes into
the<00:01:03.059> squad<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> probably

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the squad I think that you probably

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.310 
the squad I think that you probably
should<00:01:04.769> use<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> different<00:01:05.519> player<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.930> his

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
should use a different player and in his

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440 
should use a different player and in his
place<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.979> would<00:01:08.580> sort<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> walk<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> through

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
place I would sort of walk you through

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.760 
place I would sort of walk you through
who<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> should<00:01:10.200> use<00:01:10.350> instead<00:01:10.650> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
who I think you should use instead of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.140 
who I think you should use instead of
him<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> second<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
him in a second you can see that you

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
him in a second you can see that you
actually<00:01:12.270> didn't<00:01:12.570> score<00:01:12.840> any<00:01:12.869> goals<00:01:13.080> and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
actually again it says that I haven't

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.490 
actually again it says that I haven't
scored<00:02:20.120> any<00:02:20.330> goals<00:02:20.390> with<00:02:20.690> him<00:02:20.780> by<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.200> have

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
scored any goals with him by now I have

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.590 
scored any goals with him by now I have
so<00:02:22.040> there<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.370> go<00:02:22.430> he<00:02:22.730> goes<00:02:22.880> into<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.300> squad

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
so there you go he goes into the squad

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.970 
so there you go he goes into the squad
as<00:02:23.810> well<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:26.030> that's<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.510> front<00:02:26.990> for<00:02:27.290> now<00:02:27.920> we

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
as well so that's the front for now we

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.770 
as well so that's the front for now we
can<00:02:28.250> move<00:02:28.370> into<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.820> defensive<00:02:29.270> mids<00:02:29.510> now<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
can move into the defensive mids now the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.690 
can move into the defensive mids now the
defense<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.320> mids<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.650> think<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:30.950> both<00:02:31.130> or<00:02:31.670> one

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
defense of mids I think of both or one

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.160 
defense of mids I think of both or one
of<00:02:31.880> them<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.180> non<00:02:32.420> rare<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.750> first<00:02:32.960> one<00:02:33.140> is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
of them is non rare the first one is

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.640 
of them is non rare the first one is
this<00:02:33.440> guy<00:02:33.620> 74<00:02:34.190> rated<00:02:34.550> Norwegian<00:02:35.450> he<00:02:36.020> has<00:02:36.230> 72

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
this guy 74 rated Norwegian he has 72

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.380 
this guy 74 rated Norwegian he has 72
pace<00:02:37.100> but<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.640> thing<00:02:37.820> I'm<00:02:37.940> looking<00:02:37.970> at<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
pace but the thing I'm looking at the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.380 
pace but the thing I'm looking at the
most<00:02:38.570> is<00:02:38.810> 77<00:02:39.650> defending<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.190> 75<00:02:41.030> heading

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
most is 77 defending and 75 heading

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.760 
most is 77 defending and 75 heading
those<00:02:41.540> are<00:02:41.720> some<00:02:41.870> very<00:02:42.080> good<00:02:42.260> stats<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:42.710> a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
those are some very good stats for a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.520 
those are some very good stats for a
defensive<00:02:43.190> mid<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:44.060> look<00:02:44.660> first<00:02:45.200> now<00:02:45.470> the
