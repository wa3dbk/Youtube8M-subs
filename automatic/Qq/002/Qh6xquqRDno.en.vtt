processor in here which is a smart

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.950 
processor in here which is a smart
trouble<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> nice<00:00:17.359> TI<00:00:18.359> processor

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
trouble so we have a nice TI processor

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.590 
trouble so we have a nice TI processor
and<00:00:19.500> built-in<00:00:20.160> capacitive<00:00:21.119> eight-inch

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and built-in capacitive eight-inch

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
and built-in capacitive eight-inch
touchscreen<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:22.400> 423<00:00:24.890> sighs<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.550> can

see<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:28.170> actually<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> same

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
see that we have actually the same

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.849 
see that we have actually the same
resolution<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> iPad<00:00:30.689> 11<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
resolution as on the iPad 11 in the

small<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> screen<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.180> will<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
small of the screen so it will be a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.090 
small of the screen so it will be a
little<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.780> sharper<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.620> also<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:35.010> a
