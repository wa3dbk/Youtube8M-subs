00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and put the new well right there look at

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.430 
and put the new well right there look at
that

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.880 

I<00:01:15.560> had<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.310> dig<00:01:16.490> 45<00:01:17.150> feet<00:01:17.420> down<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.080> they<00:01:18.650> put

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
I had to dig 45 feet down and they put

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.360 
I had to dig 45 feet down and they put
the<00:01:19.070> pump<00:01:19.310> at<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.330> bottom<00:01:20.810> of<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.050> well<00:01:21.260> so<00:01:22.250> we

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
the pump at the bottom of the well so we

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.110 
the pump at the bottom of the well so we
can't<00:01:22.580> even<00:01:22.730> hear<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:23.120> and<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:24.700> can<00:01:25.700> see<00:01:25.910> here

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
can't even hear it and you can see here

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.790 
can't even hear it and you can see here
the<00:01:26.270> sand<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.930> lighter<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:27.410> is<00:01:27.530> what<00:01:27.680> they

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
the sand is lighter this is what they

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.000 
the sand is lighter this is what they
dug<00:01:27.980> up<00:01:28.130> from<00:01:28.340> further<00:01:28.640> down<00:01:29.260> and<00:01:30.260> all<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.860> this

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
dug up from further down and all of this

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.950 
dug up from further down and all of this
darker<00:01:31.460> stand<00:01:31.760> here<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:34.450> more<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.540> what<00:01:35.840> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
darker stand here is more of what the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.150 
darker stand here is more of what the
topsoil<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:36.680> like<00:01:36.920> here<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:38.440> I<00:01:39.440> had<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.710> cut<00:01:40.130> a

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
topsoil is like here and I had to cut a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.010 
topsoil is like here and I had to cut a
bunch<00:01:40.370> of<00:01:40.580> branches<00:01:40.820> off<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.690> can<00:01:41.810> see

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
bunch of branches off so you can see

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.660 
bunch of branches off so you can see
there<00:01:42.400> so<00:01:43.400> they<00:01:43.520> can<00:01:43.670> make<00:01:43.760> their<00:01:44.000> way<00:01:44.120> in<00:01:44.300> here

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
there so they can make their way in here

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.290 
there so they can make their way in here
and<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:47.980> guess<00:01:48.980> they<00:01:49.190> put<00:01:49.400> this<00:01:49.610> tank<00:01:50.000> down

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
and I guess they put this tank down

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.850 
and I guess they put this tank down
there<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:53.290> 22<00:01:54.290> gallon<00:01:55.450> tank<00:01:56.770> for<00:01:57.770> the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
there to the 22 gallon tank for the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.930 
there to the 22 gallon tank for the
pressure<00:01:58.100> and<00:02:00.430> let<00:02:01.430> me<00:02:01.490> give<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.790> quick

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
pressure and let me give you a quick

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:11.460 
pressure and let me give you a quick
look<00:02:02.240> at<00:02:02.390> what<00:02:02.420> they<00:02:02.660> did<00:02:04.990> back<00:02:05.990> here

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.620 

or<00:02:12.070> what<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.250> did<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:14.320> used<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:15.330> my<00:02:16.330> Batcave

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
or what I did that used to be my Batcave

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.420 
or what I did that used to be my Batcave
entrance<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.470> had<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.770> cut<00:02:17.950> all<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.100> with<00:02:18.340> a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
entrance I had to cut all that with a

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.300 
entrance I had to cut all that with a
chainsaw<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.970> few<00:02:19.240> weeks<00:02:19.420> ago<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.930> they<00:02:20.020> could

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
chainsaw a few weeks ago so they could

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.460 
chainsaw a few weeks ago so they could
get<00:02:21.310> their<00:02:21.490> machines<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.210> here<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.260> it'll

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
get their machines in here but it'll

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.840 
get their machines in here but it'll
grow<00:02:23.680> back<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:24.220> be<00:02:24.520> hidden<00:02:24.820> again<00:02:26.580> and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.700 

there's<00:02:30.850> my<00:02:31.060> garden<00:02:31.450> up<00:02:31.570> there<00:02:34.230> now<00:02:35.230> without

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
there's my garden up there now without

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.860 
there's my garden up there now without
having<00:02:36.100> water<00:02:36.340> available<00:02:36.940> all<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.480> seeds<00:02:37.720> I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
having water available all the seeds I

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.800 
having water available all the seeds I
planted<00:02:37.900> all<00:02:38.590> my<00:02:38.800> pumpkins<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.430> squash

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
planted all my pumpkins and squash

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.600 
planted all my pumpkins and squash
didn't<00:02:40.810> get<00:02:40.960> any<00:02:41.110> water<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.740> this<00:02:42.220> soil

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
didn't get any water and this soil

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.460 
didn't get any water and this soil
drains<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.210> fast<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.750> needs<00:02:43.900> water<00:02:44.110> every<00:02:44.440> day

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
drains so fast it needs water every day

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.140 
drains so fast it needs water every day
and<00:02:46.350> nothing<00:02:47.350> came<00:02:47.530> up<00:02:47.770> except<00:02:48.340> for<00:02:48.370> right

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
and nothing came up except for right

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.490 
and nothing came up except for right
here<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.390> have<00:02:49.660> some<00:02:50.730> barfi<00:02:51.730> pumpkin<00:02:52.420> these<00:02:53.350> are

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
here I have some barfi pumpkin these are

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.060 
here I have some barfi pumpkin these are
prize<00:02:53.740> winners<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.400> those<00:02:55.180> all<00:02:55.390> came<00:02:55.660> up<00:02:56.070> and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
prize winners and those all came up and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.860 
prize winners and those all came up and
I've<00:02:57.160> pretty<00:02:57.640> much<00:02:57.730> given<00:02:58.000> up<00:02:58.209> on<00:02:58.390> these<00:02:58.540> for

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
I've pretty much given up on these for

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.320 
I've pretty much given up on these for
the<00:02:58.959> year<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.380> I'm<00:03:00.310> going<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.459> space<00:03:00.790> these<00:03:01.060> out

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the year so I'm going to space these out

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.590 
the year so I'm going to space these out
a<00:03:01.360> bit<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.550> another<00:03:03.550> thing<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:06.480> planted<00:03:07.480> at

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
a bit and another thing I planted at

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.310 
a bit and another thing I planted at
about<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.490> hundred<00:03:09.810> cucumber<00:03:10.810> plants<00:03:11.170> right

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
about a hundred cucumber plants right

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.400 
about a hundred cucumber plants right
here<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:12.510> there's<00:03:13.510> only<00:03:13.600> about<00:03:13.780> five<00:03:14.080> left

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
here and there's only about five left

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.990 
here and there's only about five left
i'm<00:03:14.620> thinking<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.070> dear<00:03:15.310> god<00:03:15.519> I'm<00:03:15.700> because

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
i'm thinking the dear god I'm because

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.380 
i'm thinking the dear god I'm because
the<00:03:16.120> string<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.450> broken<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.519> i'm<00:03:19.180> going<00:03:19.300> to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
the string is broken so i'm going to

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.240 
the string is broken so i'm going to
have<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.540> put<00:03:19.989> some<00:03:20.200> stakes<00:03:20.470> around<00:03:20.830> these<00:03:21.010> or

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
have to put some stakes around these or

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.360 
have to put some stakes around these or
something<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:22.470> get<00:03:23.470> them<00:03:23.620> going<00:03:23.800> more<00:03:24.220> and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
something to get them going more and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.620 
something to get them going more and
fertilize<00:03:25.209> them<00:03:26.970> when<00:03:27.970> i<00:03:28.000> was<00:03:28.209> here<00:03:28.360> three

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
fertilize them when i was here three

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.560 
fertilize them when i was here three
weeks<00:03:28.660> ago<00:03:29.019> i<00:03:29.320> put<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.739> in<00:03:29.860> 1808<00:03:30.580> tomato<00:03:31.000> plants

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
weeks ago i put it in 1808 tomato plants

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.440 
weeks ago i put it in 1808 tomato plants
and<00:03:31.739> now<00:03:32.739> i<00:03:32.769> have<00:03:32.920> four<00:03:33.370> left<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.970> i'm

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
and now i have four left and i'm

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.150 
and now i have four left and i'm
guessing<00:03:34.630> it's<00:03:34.930> because<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.530> deer<00:03:35.739> came<00:03:36.010> in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
guessing it's because the deer came in

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.699 
guessing it's because the deer came in
here<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.459> ate<00:03:36.970> them<00:03:37.330> because<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.959> few<00:03:38.290> are<00:03:38.470> just

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
here and ate them because a few are just

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.310 
here and ate them because a few are just
stems<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.550> few<00:03:39.670> are<00:03:39.700> just<00:03:40.330> gone<00:03:40.540> period<00:03:41.140> and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
stems and a few are just gone period and

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.610 
stems and a few are just gone period and
they<00:03:42.250> really<00:03:42.489> didn't<00:03:42.730> grow<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.090> much<00:03:43.620> i'm

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
they really didn't grow that much i'm

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.009 
they really didn't grow that much i'm
guessing<00:03:45.070> because<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.850> soil<00:03:46.090> drains<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.720> fast

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
guessing because the soil drains so fast

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.650 
guessing because the soil drains so fast
and<00:03:47.350> there<00:03:47.620> was<00:03:47.709> no<00:03:47.890> water<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.489> this<00:03:49.480> really

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
and there was no water and this really

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.600 
and there was no water and this really
heats<00:03:49.959> up<00:03:50.170> in<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.440> sun<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.709> dries<00:03:51.040> out<00:03:51.250> fast

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
heats up in the sun and dries out fast

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.460 
heats up in the sun and dries out fast
so<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.000> needs<00:03:52.150> water<00:03:52.360> every<00:03:52.690> day<00:03:52.720> here's<00:03:53.230> one

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
so it needs water every day here's one

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.340 
so it needs water every day here's one
right<00:03:53.620> here<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:57.519> ones<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:57.790> are<00:03:57.940> left

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
right here and the ones that are left

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.190 
right here and the ones that are left
i'm<00:03:59.350> going<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.680> transport<00:04:00.280> them<00:04:00.400> from<00:04:01.200> where

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
i'm going to transport them from where

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.350 
i'm going to transport them from where
they<00:04:02.260> are<00:04:02.410> bitten<00:04:03.160> various<00:04:03.519> spots<00:04:03.760> over<00:04:04.150> here

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
they are bitten various spots over here

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.600 
they are bitten various spots over here
and<00:04:04.510> dig<00:04:05.049> them<00:04:05.170> up<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.470> put<00:04:05.650> them<00:04:05.680> all<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.580> one

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
and dig them up and put them all in one

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.410 
and dig them up and put them all in one
area<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.680> then<00:04:08.680> take<00:04:09.430> some<00:04:09.610> of<00:04:09.730> these<00:04:09.820> extra

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
area and then take some of these extra

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.530 
area and then take some of these extra
stakes<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.459> put<00:04:12.459> it<00:04:12.549> around<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:13.000> area<00:04:13.330> and

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
stakes and put it around the area and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.060 
stakes and put it around the area and
then<00:04:13.720> put<00:04:13.989> string<00:04:14.290> around<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.920> deer

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
then put string around it so the deer

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.280 
then put string around it so the deer
can't<00:04:15.370> get<00:04:15.549> at<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:15.760> if<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.419> stops<00:04:16.690> them<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.019> don't

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
can't get at it if it stops them I don't

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.670 
can't get at it if it stops them I don't
know<00:04:17.380> it's<00:04:18.250> worth<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.580> try<00:04:18.609> though

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
know it's worth a try though

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.020 
know it's worth a try though
nice<00:04:21.680> breezy<00:04:22.070> day<00:04:22.340> in<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.580> sleet<00:04:22.820> stack

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
humid at all and i'm just going to

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.040 
humid at all and i'm just going to

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
out in a daylight what I've done here is

move all the tomatoes close to each

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.870 
move all the tomatoes close to each
other<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.810> took<00:04:48.710> all<00:04:48.890> my<00:04:49.070> extra<00:04:49.490> tomato

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
other and took all my extra tomato

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.580 
other and took all my extra tomato
stakes<00:04:50.270> then<00:04:50.990> I'm<00:04:51.110> not<00:04:51.200> going<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:51.470> be<00:04:51.560> needing

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
stakes then I'm not going to be needing

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.020 
stakes then I'm not going to be needing
because<00:04:52.040> I<00:04:52.070> don't<00:04:52.220> have<00:04:52.250> any<00:04:52.430> more<00:04:52.550> tomatoes

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
because I don't have any more tomatoes

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.670 
because I don't have any more tomatoes
and<00:04:53.920> put<00:04:54.920> them<00:04:55.070> in<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.280> circle<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:55.940> put<00:04:56.210> string

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
and put them in a circle and put string

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.980 
and put them in a circle and put string
all<00:04:57.680> around<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:58.520> maybe<00:04:59.180> it'll<00:04:59.420> keep<00:04:59.600> out<00:04:59.810> the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
all around and maybe it'll keep out the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.980 
all around and maybe it'll keep out the
deer<00:05:00.230> I<00:05:00.470> doubt<00:05:01.400> it<00:05:01.430> because<00:05:01.760> they<00:05:02.510> are<00:05:02.690> pretty

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
deer I doubt it because they are pretty

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.190 
deer I doubt it because they are pretty
persistent<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:05.030> anyway<00:05:05.630> you<00:05:05.720> could<00:05:05.840> see<00:05:06.050> the

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
persistent so anyway you could see the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.260 
persistent so anyway you could see the
tomatoes<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.830> there<00:05:08.680> just<00:05:09.680> four<00:05:09.950> of<00:05:09.980> them<00:05:10.280> and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
tomatoes in there just four of them and

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.440 
tomatoes in there just four of them and
I<00:05:11.930> put<00:05:12.110> some<00:05:12.460> string<00:05:13.460> around<00:05:13.640> my<00:05:13.760> cucumbers

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
I put some string around my cucumbers

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.870 
I put some string around my cucumbers
the<00:05:14.780> few<00:05:15.140> that<00:05:15.260> have<00:05:15.500> left<00:05:15.710> so<00:05:16.070> nobody<00:05:16.580> steps

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
the few that have left so nobody steps

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.380 
the few that have left so nobody steps
on<00:05:17.090> them<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:18.010> have<00:05:19.010> my<00:05:19.160> sprinkler<00:05:19.700> set<00:05:19.970> up<00:05:20.120> and

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
I don't need it on a post because I have

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.670 
I don't need it on a post because I have
really<00:05:23.270> high<00:05:23.390> water<00:05:23.630> pressure<00:05:23.870> now<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.380> covers

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
really high water pressure now it covers

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.980 
really high water pressure now it covers

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
extra room now fed nothing really took

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.840 
extra room now fed nothing really took
off<00:05:55.190> because<00:05:55.460> of<00:05:55.640> the<00:05:55.790> water<00:05:56.750> situation<00:05:57.850> even

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
off because of the water situation even

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.610

back<00:05:59.210> of<00:05:59.390> the<00:05:59.450> tomatoes<00:05:59.840> there's<00:06:00.110> even<00:06:00.410> more

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
back of the tomatoes there's even more

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.860 
back of the tomatoes there's even more
room<00:06:01.100> so<00:06:02.650> I'll<00:06:03.650> plant<00:06:04.040> some<00:06:04.370> beans<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:05.090> maybe

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
room so I'll plant some beans and maybe

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.240 
room so I'll plant some beans and maybe
some<00:06:06.110> other<00:06:06.200> things<00:06:06.590> i<00:06:08.560> have<00:06:09.560> my<00:06:09.710> sprinkler

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
some other things i have my sprinkler

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.330 
some other things i have my sprinkler
hooked<00:06:10.490> up<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:11.350> it<00:06:12.350> goes<00:06:12.500> to<00:06:12.860> this<00:06:12.980> bucket

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
hooked up and it goes to this bucket

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.020 
hooked up and it goes to this bucket
here<00:06:13.370> and<00:06:13.820> that's<00:06:14.540> where<00:06:14.690> I<00:06:14.750> keep<00:06:14.900> my<00:06:14.960> timer

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
here and that's where I keep my timer

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.420 
here and that's where I keep my timer
and<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:18.380> reason<00:06:18.620> I<00:06:18.680> keep<00:06:18.800> it<00:06:18.950> under<00:06:19.160> a<00:06:19.190> bucket

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
and the reason I keep it under a bucket

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.080 
and the reason I keep it under a bucket
is<00:06:19.850> because<00:06:20.180> it<00:06:20.330> has<00:06:20.450> that<00:06:21.160> LCD<00:06:22.160> screen<00:06:22.700> and<00:06:22.970> if

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
is because it has that LCD screen and if

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.760 
is because it has that LCD screen and if
you<00:06:23.180> leave<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.540> in<00:06:23.630> the<00:06:23.720> Sun<00:06:23.960> it'll<00:06:24.290> cook<00:06:24.590> it

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
you leave that in the Sun it'll cook it

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.280 
you leave that in the Sun it'll cook it
and<00:06:24.919> it'll<00:06:25.730> never<00:06:25.910> come<00:06:26.180> back<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.540> life<00:06:26.720> I've

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
and it'll never come back to life I've

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.890 
and it'll never come back to life I've
done<00:06:27.530> it<00:06:27.760> so<00:06:28.760> yeah<00:06:29.000> keep<00:06:29.210> it<00:06:29.330> in<00:06:29.390> the<00:06:29.450> shade<00:06:29.690> and

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900
