00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello everyone I am max is the time today I am 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.799
 here to present the latest news from 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.799
 without camera and intercom together 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.119
 let's discover the latter together 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.380
 novelty that is truly incredible 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.970
 on stage the 10 we go to see in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.970
 detail the contents of the package 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.020
 we immediately notice our foreground 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.600
 camera and intercom because you can 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.070
 define both ways and time 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.170
 let's see what those are 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 accessories 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:54.239
 here we have a helmet microphone 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.010
 very compact wheel 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.820
 tiny you won't even notice 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.820
 inside the helmet 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.780
 the earphone set to mount 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.970
 inside we see here too 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.900
 ultracompact, even their audio quality 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.900
 really good 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.009
 the second of the microphones to be mounted in the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:24.530
 jet or modular helmet case with 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:28.970
 the rigid rod is here 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.580
 and instead we find our support from 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.909
 attach to the helmet as you can 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.759
 see and also fully adjustable 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.950
 in the inclination so you can 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.770
 set what is the best shot 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.520
 to be carried out in this case here 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.290
 we have a bracket that allows us to 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.350
 attach support to the helmet via 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.090
 a mah clamp supplied in the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:59.330
 box we also find a support 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 double-sided adhesive to always mount the outside 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.690
 of the helmet so as to succeed in 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.929
 any helmet version ad 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.540
 install it in more we find usual bel 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.610
 spare hair and microphone headsets 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.690
 so as to go and reduce those that 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.690
 are the background noises 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:29.230
 a guide completes the whole course 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:29.230
 quick a micro usb cable 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.200
 and a series of pads to be installed on the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.770
 back of our earphones to go there 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.630
 to bring the ears closer if they are 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.320
 too far away and the sound quality either 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.320
 the one we want 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.960
 let's find out in detail what those 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.200
 the features are a little bit 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.980
 main of this new of this 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.510
 new system 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.050
 as we have already said it can be defined 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.940
 both intercom and camera equipped with 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.300
 a sensor capable of recording yes and 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.800
 1080p at 30 frames per second then full 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.380
 hd or even in hd ready then 720p 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.990
 at 60 frames per second then a shot 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.030
 definitely very fluid in this case 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.470
 let's see our goal on the front 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.660
 distinguished by a red cleat 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.300
 which indicates the level of inclination 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.550
 adjustable up to 30 degrees of ours 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.940
 goal so as to always keep in 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.800
 plan and our shooting that is 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.660
 obviously completely waterproof 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.450
 equipped with a multi-function joypad 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.489
 different keys to select the various 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.290
 commands and as we have already said below 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.019
 the only input that will be used 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.060
 during movement and then entry 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.090
 where to go then to connect ours 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.200
 Internal audio kits below also come there 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.459
 provided a direct hdmi output for 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.810
 being able to connect it directly to the 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.180
 television 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.100
 the slot of the micro sd remember that 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.300
 supports up to 1 32 gigabytes which 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.360
 obviously it is not included in the 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.050
 pack more we find the Cravetto 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.330

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.620
 our device and to go to 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.070
 example to make settings 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.100
 directly via PC and as I told you 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.770
 at camera level it's definitely a lot 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.290
 functional there is also an application from 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.720
