00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
to get these things off of here but I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.240 
to get these things off of here but I
mean<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.100> little

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
mean I just think it's just a little

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
mean I just think it's just a little
added<00:01:26.460> protection<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.840> something<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
added protection so just something I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.380 
added protection so just something I
thought<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:28.380> pretty<00:01:28.560> cool<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
thought was pretty cool so I think it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
thought was pretty cool so I think it
was<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.600> nine<00:01:30.840> dollars<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> set<00:01:31.850> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
was like nine dollars for the set and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
was like nine dollars for the set and
like<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.060> said<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.329> comes<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.630> four<00:01:33.840> screws<00:01:34.170> so

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
like I said it comes with four screws so

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.539 
like I said it comes with four screws so
two<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.850> front<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:36.900> back<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:38.310> comes

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
two for front two for back and it comes

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.569 
two for front two for back and it comes
with<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:38.930> key<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
with a little key for it so that was the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.109 
with a little key for it so that was the
first<00:01:41.820> step<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> black<00:01:42.450> tabs<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:44.119> I

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
first step with the black tabs and I

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.130 
first step with the black tabs and I
ordered<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.500> get<00:01:46.680> some<00:01:46.890> extra<00:01:47.040> caps
