00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.529
 hello everybody, these made the g1 show you 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.530
 the classic control stopped of nintendo wii 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.379
 that control 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.379
 in attack two is the control of playstation 2 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.140
 these whole higuita then make lucileide by other cure rates 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.590
 after working with her control here for those who do not have it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 to know better how it is and how it works 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.029
 why is it so using the concept of playstation 2 not the prison 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.070
 closed the doors I think that this control the doj to q2 is more like 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.180
 have to run with the koprol 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.570
 I get it 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.850
 and also that I think everyone already had one that are two act today played 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.480
 The repair of the day knows how is the control of playstation 2 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.500
 are going to use it here 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.310
 the comtrans of 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.610
 run back with the program answered and it will stay like this our hand 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.550
 not 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.870
 you can see 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.080
 so what have 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.070
 this is the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 in second instance 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.230
 this here he 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.620
 ah he is so bright beginner though matte 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.340
 this team 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.010
 it is not easy to compete in black matte but also would not have gone much 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.210
 billions of tarp 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.500
 It's good that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.560
 guess you had 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.180
 on the website are together here already had separate action 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.740
 Analog Left Analog Right 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 in concessionaires the right to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.560
 in my opinion 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 these guys who are softer 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.650
 light start 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.500
 sadat city has no way 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 because 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 those who appreciate 1 2 billion are impressive 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.870
 on this issue 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.640
 a tennis line 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.039
 dialoguing check out 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.039
 a big difference is that for example here 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.349
 is the stylist 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.019
 this is the air 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.089
 the pallium days 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.089
 they're basically like it's the same thing 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.139
 because 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.349
 the says is the most important button is today so mutant 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.569
 but has function 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.529
 or persists 1 2 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.999
 and the air is the same 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:40.179
 efe in el ayun is concentrating select things then they are engines 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.339
 very important 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.969
 and who to play what played very playstation 2 or 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.160
 begins to settle also in the attack 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.909
 playstation 3 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.560
 you will not get used to it 8 when you start playing with more control because the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.349
 the button is that the contract had 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.959
 but it's alright 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.409
 here's a buy-in 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.950
 we are with our eyes 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.529
 In my dream 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.949
 I was not concerned about who else has it, I do not have sarney 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.949
 You do not have to understand yourself. 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.019
 allen 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.699
 r 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.870
 very soft from sr series 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.319
 allen 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.029
 they both 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.019
 cairo 22 in my opinion 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.019
 those buttons and kila behind them 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.459
 are more decisive 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.439
 so the case of the proder I understand that of Haiti owners q2 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.179
 and that there is nothing like that carmona 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.179
 teams that everything today q2 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:48.919
 the cable of the two gets over it comes evidence and covert 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.129
 dulko control 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.499
 and the cable 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.499
 pain 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.239
 the doctor q2 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.239
 it is too long 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.849
 it's much longer 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.849
 your car 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.869
 the joint peace agreement in Berlin 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:15.529
 this because 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:18.729
 I think this team is going to mine the storyline. 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.729
 this will consolidate the gesture that had to be more 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.039
 best attack 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.529
 Never mind. 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.430
 could not be 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.560
 one w can drop 5% to so small with esc 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:36.770
 makes sense 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.979
 in which scale 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.669
 this entry to vote 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.370
 in control 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.370
 this one here in the ufmt 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.090
 This is what I wanted to show you, a little bit more. 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.800
 on controls 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800
 that they sign up for the rabbit for those who want to follow 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.159
 and see you next time
