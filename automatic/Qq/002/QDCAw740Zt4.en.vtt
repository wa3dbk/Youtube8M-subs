played a little bit with it today to try
to<00:00:44.610> test<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:45.000> different<00:00:45.030> scenarios<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to test out different scenarios that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.000 
to test out different scenarios that
would<00:00:45.930> work<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.890> see

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
would work with it and if you can see

would work with it and if you can see
this<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.250> hole<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:47.879> home<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.390> you

this little hole in my home it's you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.479 
this little hole in my home it's you
know<00:00:48.960> innocent<00:00:49.410> looking<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.190> I've<00:00:50.309> set<00:00:50.460> up

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
know innocent looking but I've set up

know innocent looking but I've set up
sky<00:00:50.789> bikes<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:51.449> ladder<00:00:51.780> scenario<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:53.219> only

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
sky bikes water ladder scenario the only

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.020 
sky bikes water ladder scenario the only
difference<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.030> instead<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:55.789> signs<00:00:56.789> I'm

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
difference is that instead of signs I'm

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
difference is that instead of signs I'm
using<00:00:57.329> ladders<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:58.109> he<00:00:58.739> said<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.280> originally

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
using ladders now he said and originally

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.209 
using ladders now he said and originally
that<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.750> he<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.649> thought<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:01.980> using

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
that that he was thought about using

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.219 
that that he was thought about using
ladders<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.670> he<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:02.910> worried<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:04.110> would

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
ladders but he was worried that it would

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
ladders but he was worried that it would
take<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.559> too<00:01:04.710> much<00:01:04.739> room<00:01:04.920> I'm<00:01:05.729> sorry<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.689> uh

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
take up too much room I'm sorry that uh

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.929 
take up too much room I'm sorry that uh
that<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> would<00:01:07.350> slow<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.619> down<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.760> went

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that it would slow you down as you went

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.280 
that it would slow you down as you went
up<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> normal<00:01:10.140> ladder

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
up you know as you go up a normal ladder

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.450 
up you know as you go up a normal ladder
you<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.010> slow<00:01:12.890> but<00:01:13.890> uh<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.350 
go up water ladder as he showed you go
up<00:01:17.009> super<00:01:17.310> fast<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.030> you'll<00:01:18.180> notice

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
up super fast but as you'll notice

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.730 
up super fast but as you'll notice
having<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> ladders<00:01:19.049> next<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> doesn't

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
having the ladders next to it doesn't

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.340 
having the ladders next to it doesn't
slow<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.950> down<00:01:20.130> whatsoever<00:01:20.750> in<00:01:21.750> fact<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> can

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
slow you down whatsoever in fact you can

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.710 
slow you down whatsoever in fact you can
just<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.950> run<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.250> run<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.820> ladders

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
just you know run up run up them ladders

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
just you know run up run up them ladders
have<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> number<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> other<00:01:25.380> awesome<00:01:25.650> benefits

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
have a number of other awesome benefits

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
have a number of other awesome benefits
for<00:01:26.790> example<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.560> let<00:01:28.710> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
for example you know they they let you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.890 
for example you know they they let you
descend<00:01:29.220> slowly<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.570> floors

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
descend slowly so if you have floors

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.679 
descend slowly so if you have floors
like<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.490> stop<00:01:32.939> off<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> floor

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
like I do you can stop off in a floor

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.370 
like I do you can stop off in a floor
you<00:01:33.869> want<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:36.060> great<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:37.229> had

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you want and and that's great they had

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.569 
you want and and that's great they had
another<00:01:37.530> great<00:01:37.710> benefit<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> they're

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
another great benefit and that they're

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.219 
another great benefit and that they're
awfully<00:01:39.119> efficient<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.170> are

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
awfully efficient you know there are

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.429 
awfully efficient you know there are
only<00:01:40.290> three-and-a-half<00:01:41.420> wood<00:01:42.420> planks<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.170> use

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
only three-and-a-half wood planks to use

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.550 
only three-and-a-half wood planks to use
whereas<00:01:44.100> signs<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.970> six<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> half

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
whereas signs are six and a half

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.190

the trick itself my sky bike in fact I

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.830 
the trick itself my sky bike in fact I
was<00:02:43.690> inspired<00:02:44.140> by<00:02:44.500> his<00:02:44.770> trick<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.420> create

what<00:02:47.170> I'm<00:02:47.350> calling<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.890> water<00:02:48.220> stairs<00:02:48.870> now

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
what I'm calling a water stairs now

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.990 
what I'm calling a water stairs now
these<00:02:50.080> aren't<00:02:50.410> particularly<00:02:51.040> particularly

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
these aren't particularly particularly

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.420 
these aren't particularly particularly
efficient<00:02:52.480> or<00:02:52.690> practical<00:02:53.320> at<00:02:53.440> all<00:02:53.530> but<00:02:54.340> they

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
efficient or practical at all but they

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.280 
efficient or practical at all but they
look<00:02:54.580> really<00:02:54.880> nice<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> wanted<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.140> show

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
look really nice and so I wanted to show

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.170 
look really nice and so I wanted to show
them<00:02:56.470> off<00:02:56.590> here<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.460> idea<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.820> we're<00:02:58.030> using

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
them off here the idea is we're using

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.810 
them off here the idea is we're using
also<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.320> know<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.680> Western<00:03:00.040> Western

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
also the you know the Western Western

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.030 
also the you know the Western Western
facing<00:03:01.060> water<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:03.310> allow<00:03:03.760> ladder-like

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
facing water to allow ladder-like

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.680 
facing water to allow ladder-like
behavior<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:07.030> we're<00:03:07.120> using<00:03:07.270> these<00:03:07.480> little

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
behavior but we're using these little

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.350 
behavior but we're using these little
half<00:03:07.840> steps<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.530> make<00:03:08.709> steps<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:10.330> can

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
half steps to make steps so you you can

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.170 
half steps to make steps so you you can
use<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.290> little<00:03:11.530> water<00:03:11.739> piece<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.820> walk<00:03:13.000> up

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
use the little water piece to to walk up

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.930 
use the little water piece to to walk up
the<00:03:13.270> steps<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.720> if<00:03:13.840> there<00:03:13.989> were<00:03:14.110> steps<00:03:14.940> and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the steps as if there were steps and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.250 
the steps as if there were steps and
they<00:03:16.030> look<00:03:16.180> nice<00:03:16.390> because<00:03:16.570> they're<00:03:16.959> partially

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
they look nice because they're partially

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.740 
they look nice because they're partially
made<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.680> water<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.450> there<00:03:19.450> are<00:03:19.540> particularly

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
made of water so there are particularly

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.110 
made of water so there are particularly
fast<00:03:20.050> or<00:03:20.290> anything<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.739> if<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:20.890> like<00:03:21.250> you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
fast or anything but if you like you

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.790 
fast or anything but if you like you
know<00:03:22.150> form<00:03:23.140> over<00:03:23.530> function<00:03:23.560> or<00:03:24.420> beauty<00:03:25.420> over

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
know form over function or beauty over

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.910 
know form over function or beauty over
practicality

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
practicality

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.979 
practicality
then<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.459> might<00:03:27.610> like<00:03:27.790> these<00:03:27.910> stairs<00:03:28.150> anyway

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
then you might like these stairs anyway

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.800 
then you might like these stairs anyway
I<00:03:29.470> wanted<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.040> show<00:03:30.130> these<00:03:30.610> off<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.120> see<00:03:31.720> if

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
I wanted to show these off and see if

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.720 
I wanted to show these off and see if
they<00:03:31.959> were<00:03:32.020> useful<00:03:32.290> for<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.920> thank<00:03:33.700> you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
they were useful for you and thank you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.030 
they were useful for you and thank you
very<00:03:33.790> much
