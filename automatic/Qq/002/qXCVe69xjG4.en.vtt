00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.769
 hello how are you let's talk today about the 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.750
 trichotillomania trichotillomania is one 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.750
 of the so-called control disorders 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.300
 of the impulses that is to say the person 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.960
 needs to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:27.530
 impulsively irresistibly and 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.690
 also unconsciously in the sense 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.640
 that he is not aware that he is 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:38.660
 getting your hair cut off 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.380
 bite him eat his nails his nails 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.620
 the feet 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.700
 and they can be of the arms also 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:53.120
 of the legs pubis that is to say is the 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.989
 need to start up jealousy and 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.530
 and the serious thing for the person is when 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.210
 begins to tear off parts that 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.659
 begin to be noticeable you notice the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.720
 haloes and many people who suffer 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.119
 the whip and the mania even reach 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.750
 tear the hair off the whole head of 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.030
 important head surface 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.840
 when I get to this point the person already 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.280
 has the habit installed and is very 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.020
 difficult by itself 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.229
 and I would say that impossible in 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.560
 most of the cases without a 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.770
 adequate therapeutic assistance stop 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.479
 do what 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.630
 generally the person or adults 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.299
 what do adults do I mean in the sense 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.880
 that parents already look at the 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.819
 parents is not the one who performs the function 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.399
 of control in the sense of saying you 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.439
 I'll help or do you demand or to 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.390
 devotion the adult person are going to 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.450
 talk about the child talking to the person 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.689
 adult when it reaches this point sometimes 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.970
 it says no I 'm going to overcome it I know that 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.700
 I can believe that sometimes he can 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.450
 sometimes not and you find that 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.069
 periodically according to moments 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.590
 certain circumstances of life 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.040
 which goes through what he thought 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.880
 that he had voluntarily overcome 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.310
 it really appears 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.060
 again he resists coming the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.450
 cycles and it becomes even stronger the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.440
 momentum and systematic starts 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.260
 heads then all treatment that is 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.890
 does on the person what to what 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.720
 point is to reverse this to that the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.870
 person first of all take conscience 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.280
 but they are psychotherapeutic techniques that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.900
 lead them to modify that impulse that 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.790
 tension and that irresistible need 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.610
 imperious and unconscious that brings them to 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.590
 pluck not only at least that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.349
 way work then it's not true 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.530
 then that the person stops feeling 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.950
 this is a psychotherapeutic work that 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.870
 is applied to the person who 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:23.530
 arrives at the person to cut to dig 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.280
 with this drama with which he lives his life 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.170
 which is to tear the hair 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.970
 then it responds to certain 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.360
 life situations problems 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.730
 conflicts and installs in stages 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.989
 early life sometimes starts in 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:45.190
 the childhood with the fright the terror of the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.620
 parents to see that this little boy of hair 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.720
 and hair usually the therapists 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.940
 we guide the then that mirror 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.319
 usually many are left to do 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.550
 children do it 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.830
 stop doing 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.270
 in most cases it does not come back to 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.500
 appear this problematic when 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.180
 appears because the person already has 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.989
 certain characteristics in your 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.889
 personality that lead them to 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:19.440
 relax or the need to 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:22.660
 channel tension your anxiety in the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.500
 extreme in this way 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.090
 the hair the impulse ends of this 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.210
 way then 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.669
 what the person should do 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.430
 treat it is very difficult that if you do not 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.979
 It deals can revert can change can 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.419
 find a healthy way of life that does not 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.970
 to channel this imperative need 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:50.240
 unconscious and impulsive to pluck 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.389
 the hair and do it without help and 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.250
 only demanding at his will 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.620
 because usually the person does not take 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.560
 consciousness that is doing it when 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.490
 he does it and if there is and if he becomes aware 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.490
 forever 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.180
 also with a great suffering to know 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.220
 and realize that you can not stop 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.980
 do what 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.569
 the impotence the frustration of knowing 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:21.509
 can not stop doing so 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:24.389
 if it happens to you if it happens to you if 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:28.759
 Have a family member what to do 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:32.159
 seek help there are methods and techniques that 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:36.029
 they allow the person to stop doing it 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:38.339
 it reverses this process and learns and 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:41.550
 manages to live a full healthy life 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:44.909
 quiet in harmony with all your 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.179
 emotions and their way of life if this 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:51.330
 aesthetic issue so painful for the 

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:56.279
 tricot and the maniac or the or the 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:06:00.300
 trichotillomania here that does not have that 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:03.440
 part of his hair from his head 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.440
 thank you very much
