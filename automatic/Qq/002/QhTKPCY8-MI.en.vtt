00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.210
 anime there are two dimensions one 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.310
 call to her and the other one 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.850
 the first is where they live 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.100
 humans and the other that is inhabited by 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.140
 which they like from time to time 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.930
 go for a spin in our 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.940
 dimension possessing someone or some 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.790
 with which they come to cause 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.640
 disasters in our world and so that 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:06.350
 do so much of esmadrid for it there 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.590
 and no way you know how typical a group of 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.450
 elite called the exorcists themselves all 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.920
 focuses on the young ring okumura 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.750
 a teenager who is worth sovereign 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.220
 peanut school and that for some 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.769
 strange reason possesses a strength and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.510
 unique strength and that was raised together 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.239
 with his younger twin brother called 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.450
 yukio in a monastery by father ciro 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.340
 and engine turns out that yukio was accepted 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.250
 in the prestigious school called true 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.080
 cross and like good bum rim leaves his 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.390
 studies and decides better to get yourself a 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.610
 work but for a strange event ring 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.349
 discovers that both he and his brother 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.650
 they are the biological sons of the devil more 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.700
 strong henna called genius or better 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.700
 known as dad 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.770
 which kills his adoptive father and makes 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.200
 that ring decides at all costs to become 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.590
 in an exorcist to go to kick the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.650
 back to his father the difference between 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.110
 the anime and the manga is basically in the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.200
 frame as though the series 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.989
 lasted 25 chapters you see that the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.640
 producers wanted to finish it fast 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.610
 altering even one of the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.730
 characters thus changing the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.510
 story in the middle of the anime this aspect 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.459
 It is very bad because we wonder how 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.370
 will solve this problem to give you 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.920
 continuation in a next season already 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.800
 that manga does not cover this problem and 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.140
 it is very different from its version 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.489
 animated in the graphical section they are 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.400
 thanks that the design of the characters 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.739
 were the same as he has in the manga 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.050
 even the faces look very good 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.840
 light effects explosions and shadows 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.360
 they are not the great thing but they give with their 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.709
 committed to bring your attention as soon as 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.360
 to the stamps that participated did not 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.950
 we can complain they are very good and 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.140
 professionals to whom we can 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.030
 highlight the voice of ring okumura and its 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.170
 good seal okamoto musician who has 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.600
 participated in these roles 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.960
 protagonists as king or code 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.570
 common direct breaker and suzuki 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.040
 but we can also highlight the great 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.590
 work of yum 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.570
 fukuyama who lent him the voice for the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.970
 younger twin brother of rim 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.190
 iuc and okumura that we feel you learned 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.310
 the lesson and it came down to his performance 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.970
 over exaggerated that he did like Kate here 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.520
 particular gap and we also highlight its 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.370
 role of freedom in the series the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.050
 history of the arcane family as soon as 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.030
 to music we can not complain about 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.130
 all instrumental some with songs 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.960
 Gregorian joyful and sad of a whole 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.090
 little is a three are quite recommended 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.980
 since it was composed by hiroyuki sawano 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.750
 who has been responsible for another 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.470
 anime soundtrack as sengoku basara 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.710
 and they criticized the opening and the link are 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.990
 chingÃ³n is good only the first one in is 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.360
 disappointment since the opening were 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.230
 interpreted by the grouping over 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.640
 word and rockies is punk and the endings by 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:07.030
 the South Korean boy band chupi in and the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.860
 Japanese singer Misaki and the reason why 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.780
 which we did not like very much the first 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.050
 ending is that we are not 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.870
 so fans of the boys band and less 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.880
 Koreans is perhaps one thing that reaches 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.310
 break somehow the charm of the 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.919
 series and that is in a battle that 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.980
 pound full of shots but explosions 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.250
 and in that you find yourself albino 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.040
 sofa so excited to see so much action 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.530
 there comes a melancholy moment 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.690
 so he sends the trash all the 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.750
 emotion of battle fortunately not 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.870
 it happens a lot but when it happens there are children 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.350
 of your 'rating' and today as it breaks the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:50.169
 charm not yet exorcist is a good 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.200
 encouragement despite the small details can 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.300
 be very entertaining very funny either you 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.230
 can get a tear or two 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.210
 despite the fact that the plot was modified and 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.760
 we wait for a second season to see 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.460
 how do you solve this and we recommend you 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.070
 check your sleeve because there if there is not 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.750
 you lose this series now you can 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.240
 find in several livestream by 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.560
 internet and has one going that does not 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.390
 has nothing to do with the plot 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.530
 principal and can become very 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.530
 emotional for the fans 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.380
 and if you already saw her and want to see more 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.810
 we recommend the movie with which you 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.300
 It will be great if you are looking for something to 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:33.310
 entertain you do not hesitate not yet 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.310
 Exorcists has everything to entertain you 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.870
 but
