00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.139
 Welcome to Frankfurt we were at 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.879
 the world premiere of the hyundai tucson 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.920
 while we are on the Geneva 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.330
 car salon looked closer today 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.330
 Let's find out how he drives 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.930
 under his old name and with a new one 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.110
 face is the hyundai tucson now 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.910
 finally back on the road traveling 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.090
 by a full seven inches longer than 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.070
 his predecessor ix35 and built on 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.040
 a completely new platform advertises 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.559
 the new tucson fresh and sporty he 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.350
 presents itself clearly from the front as 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.050
 a modern hyundai next to the now 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.060
 available led headlamps the deep 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.430
 falling into the fenders 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.000
 Immediately the big hexagonal grill into 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.670
 eye 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.560
 this hexagonal air intake is that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.170
 probably the most obvious identifier 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.449
 all new hyundai models of the article 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.570
 very dominant and that's what we are 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.030
 Wanted a long bonnet from here 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.340
 until here to convey the feeling of 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.030
 dare against very powerful that he 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.830
 a big machine would be at the side 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.820
 of the vehicle is this window 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.440
 important ingredient 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.120
 the relationship between the window and 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.950
 the door is very important to us designer 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.610
 always want a as sleek as possible 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.280
 very sporty profile and that gets 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.470
 one if one reduces this and around it 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.170
 There is this disguise to compensate 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.330
 here is how the car works in the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.750
 side view very streamlined and 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.470
 appealing this part here always cares 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.479
 for fighting with the engineers 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.390
 Starting the aerodynamics you want it 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.070
 always very upright 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.200
 But what we want is exactly that 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.600
 opposite 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.460
 We would like a roof that quickly 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.570
 below shows the athletic aspects 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.179
 to accentuate the vehicle 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.470
 Hyundai uses a lot in the design 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.570
 pronounced formal language therefore exists 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.750
 on the side a very nice game with 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.590
 shadow and light especially in this 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.540
 part here about the cycles and the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.790
 Heck has this extreme section the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.890
 both very strong and sensual 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.890
 design elements includes sense of 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.890
 design 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.459
 The inner values ​​of the tucson show that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.170
 hyundai's ideas and 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.390
 wish european folklore hyundai 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.930
 the interior with high quality softtouch 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.000
 material success is total 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.120
 The passenger compartment is modern and clear 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.980
 more valuable than the predecessor of the cockpit 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.660
 is cleaned up and also on the steering wheel 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.959
 you only find what you need to drive 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.910
 and use the infotainment needs 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.650
 unit of the tucson offers among other things 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.660
 digital radio reception and that 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.250
 navigation system includes seven 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.989
 years of free tomtom live services 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.840
 the seats of the tucson are comfortable and 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.730
 provide sufficient support they can 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.340
 Desired both heated and ventilated 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.640
 are also at radstand and 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.440
 headroom has the compact suv 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.970
 evolved that does not just come 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.069
 pass by too good 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.799
 For example, the trunk space grows 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.560
 to 513 liters and outperformed it 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.540
 even the bestseller vw tiguan clearly 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.220
 for the hyundai tucson it becomes the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.230
 Market launch five different engines 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.750
 two petrol and three diesel the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.680
 Gasoline engines are 16 liter machines 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.760
 with either 132 or 177 ps at the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.579
 we have the choice between 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.319
 a 17 liter engine with 116 ps or 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.709
 two larger diesel engines respectively 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:01.690
 two liters with 136 or 185 ps 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.579
 The chassis of the Tucson is comfortable 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.530
 and yet tight enough and bigger 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.510
 stifle movements 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.459
 Here, the hyundai gives a very 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.459
 safe and active impression 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.859
 even if a suv not necessarily for 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.650
 rough terrain is made evident 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.739
 the tucson thanks to all-wheel drive 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.079
 differential lock and 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.780
 downhill assistant little impressed 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.550
 from the off-road course to the use 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.870
 However, you should be in difficult terrain 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.389
 better abstain 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.800
 even with the assistance systems 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.199
 Hyundai refilled 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.229
 so the new tucson now has 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.160
 about an autonomous emergency 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.139
 one of the brake assistants 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.050
 lanekeeper with steering intervention 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.910
 a blind spot warning with cross traffic 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.180
 warning in the back as well as over one 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.270
 Camera-based traffic sign recognition 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.419
 the 132 ps gasoline is available as well 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.870
 the two smaller 1.7 or 2 liters 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.750
 diesel with 132 and 115 ps only with 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.460
 Front drive and interface for the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.860
 more powerful engines are available 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.010
 both all-wheel and automatic on the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.840
 Equipment list of the tucson is a 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.190
 important vehicle for july he should be the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.320
 perception of the brand positive 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.850
 particularly stand out 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.440
 the exterior because there is design here 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.450
 features you can not do with others anymore 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.620
 find a little tip from me who is for 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.060
 a tucson should be interested 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.130
 necessarily the big diesel with the 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.599
 drive automatic transmission there are indeed 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.070
 not with dual-clutch transmission but 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.070
 the automatic does a great job
