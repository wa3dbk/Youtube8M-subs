 right there it goes on 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.700
 darling clipper day and I believe that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.950
 are meant by the bello and there 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.270
 I have only one thing is rosbergs 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.980
 That's why I'll take that right away 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.430

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.540
 often used because yes I got it on 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.540
 not used so often in any case 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.130
 after that favorite hair product and there 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:38.209
 I have two pieces so once a pub 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.020
 and that's from everywhere he tramples yes 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.670
 which I then also a 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.190
 dry shampoo and that's mine 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:51.340
 favorite hair product with another 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:54.260
 share the space and that with 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.050
 Cherry blossom is the two mine 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.580
 favorite and yes I like the two 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.640
 All in all, therefore, all of these hook this 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.300
 are only two favorite products 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.620
 I can harm my favorite song now 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.590
 Do not really say that because I do not have one 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.360
 strong used yes but I have now 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.790

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.709
 and 20 bands or sorry and that 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.780
 try with gold in the gold goes 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.450
 always fast afterwards I do not think so 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.370

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.290

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.910

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.230
 Darling shampoo and I have it there now 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.250

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.100
 because I do not know even if I am very 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.730

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.230
