00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello and welcome to hartz iv in 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.890
 this video the update is 1300 euro 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.460
 gaming computers may 2015 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.410
 as a processor the Intel Core i7 4790 came 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.650
 with 4 x 4 gigahertz 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.439
 he has a turbo of 4 4 gigahertz 88 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 watt tdp an integrated graphics unit 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.680
 has a name of one kilometer what's his name 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 free multiplier so free 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.670
 overclock and hyperthreading that there 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.830
 each chamber has two squares as one 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.660
 theoretical 8 kernel it is currently 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 one of the best processors to gamble on 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.930
 and live game will be the next 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.579
 three to five years loose enough 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.340
 if you get too weak you can do it yes 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.340
 overclock as cpu cooler be quite 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.350
 drop 3 it is a big and strong cpu 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 cooler and with him is quiet operate 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.039
 or overclocking was possible and as a man 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.100
 the msz 97g 43 with the intel z 97 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.850
 chipset it has usb 3 s ata three four 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 ddr3 ram banks pci express 3.0 a 10.1 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.930
 a chip and on the panel 122 x usb2 vga dvi 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.240
 and hdmi led integrated 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.320
 graphics unit of processor four times usb 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.780
 3.0 socket and 6 3 5 mm latches for the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.770
 sound chip as memory 16 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.600
 gigabyte crucial ballistix board ddr3 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.310
 1600 and 10 19 it's pretty fast 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.650
 clearly something is not called a dual 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 channel mode and are 16gb 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.280
 for the next few years first 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.100
 enough and as ssd the 240 gb cz org 100 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.110
 it's a very fast ssd and 240 gb 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.509
 space for the operating system all 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.299
 programs and a few games then as 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.500
 hdd is a terabyte of toshiba it is 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.600
 an above-average speed 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.790
 hard disk and a terabyte on for the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.290
 Most of you will easily suffice 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.509
 as graphics card the 4 gb 4 nr 9 290 x3 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.960
 xo she became this video card 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.280
 overclocked anyway is the 4r 9 290 iks 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.420
 relatively quiet and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.189
 consumes less electricity 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 if you are as good as you should be with her then 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.119
 all current games to the highest 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.729
 Settings can play fluently and 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.459
 as a power supply the 550 watt to techno 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.280
 power classic it has 80 plus gold what 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.690
 the energy saving is and 550 was 10 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.790
 for the pc more 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.660
 enough then a dvd burner of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.910
 samsung and as housing the tractor 2300 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.410
 It has two pre-installed fans and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.030
 has plenty of room for components though 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.670
 Of course you should decide for yourself 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.620
 which yes would take optional 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.660
 pc does not want to assemble itself 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 can also use it for 26 euro 90 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.080
 let me thank you then 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.040
