00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.170 
true very very true indeed so you can
see<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> design<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.850> looks<00:01:51.000> almost

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
see the design here it looks almost

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.399 
see the design here it looks almost
identical<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> exception<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
identical with the exception of the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
identical with the exception of the
capacitive<00:01:52.979> buttons<00:01:53.250> down<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.460> very

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
capacitive buttons down here very

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.999 
capacitive buttons down here very
similar<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> International<00:01:55.890> Version

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
similar to the International Version

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
similar to the International Version
doesn't<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.610> AT&amp;T<00:01:57.030> logo<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> back

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
doesn't have an AT&amp;T logo on the back

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.060 
doesn't have an AT&amp;T logo on the back
which<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.020> particularly<00:01:58.409> interesting<00:01:58.920> but

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
which is particularly interesting but

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.459 
which is particularly interesting but
just<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.369> galaxy<00:01:59.790> s2<00:02:00.290> branding<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.380> they

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
just that galaxy s2 branding so they

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.200 
just that galaxy s2 branding so they
opted<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> keep<00:02:02.009> galaxy<00:02:02.399> s2<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> title

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
opted to keep galaxy s2 in the title

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.060 
opted to keep galaxy s2 in the title
instead<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> custom<00:02:04.290> name<00:02:04.469> like

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
instead of going with a custom name like

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
instead of going with a custom name like
the<00:02:05.219> Epic<00:02:05.490> 4G<00:02:05.520> Touch<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.420> again<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.140> see

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the Epic 4G Touch and again you can see

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.290 
the Epic 4G Touch and again you can see
the<00:02:07.380> camera<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:07.829> similar<00:02:08.310> here<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the camera is very similar here on the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.219 
the camera is very similar here on the
back<00:02:09.450> now<00:02:09.629> I've<00:02:09.690> got<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:09.929> look<00:02:10.080> at<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
back now I've got to go look at the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.720 
back now I've got to go look at the
dimensions<00:02:10.649> when<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.860> turn<00:02:11.099> off<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> video<00:02:11.489> but

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
dimensions when I turn off the video but

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.890 
dimensions when I turn off the video but
it<00:02:11.790> looks<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.450> bit<00:02:12.569> thicker

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it looks like it's a little bit thicker

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.610 
it looks like it's a little bit thicker
than<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
than the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.130 
than the
Epic<00:02:13.860> 4G<00:02:13.890> Touch<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.480> interesting<00:02:15.720> kind<00:02:16.080> of

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
Epic 4G Touch so the interesting kind of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.479 
Epic 4G Touch so the interesting kind of
compare<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.530> two<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:17.129> gonna<00:02:17.280> reach

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
compare the two actually I'm gonna reach

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.130 
compare the two actually I'm gonna reach
back<00:02:17.730> here<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.120> will<00:02:18.390> give<00:02:18.540> me<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.690> second

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
I carried International Version for a

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.619 
I carried International Version for a
while<00:02:41.730> when<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:41.970> were<00:02:42.120> doing<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.420> review

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
while when we were doing the review

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.050 
while when we were doing the review
coverage<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.980> got<00:02:44.010> used<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.549> 4.3

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
coverage of it and I got used to the 4.3

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.180 
coverage of it and I got used to the 4.3
inch<00:02:45.180> display<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.470> think<00:02:46.680> that's<00:02:46.799> four<00:02:47.069> to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
inch display and I think that's four to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.259 
inch display and I think that's four to
four<00:02:47.340> point<00:02:47.519> three<00:02:47.549> is<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> pretty<00:02:47.940> good<00:02:48.090> sweet

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
four point three is a pretty good sweet

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.660 
four point three is a pretty good sweet
spot<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:49.140> starting<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.470> turned<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.739> okay<00:02:50.010> but

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
spot I'm starting to turned on okay but

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.369 
spot I'm starting to turned on okay but
after<00:02:51.299> being<00:02:51.629> you<00:02:51.870> know<00:02:51.959> working<00:02:52.140> with<00:02:52.260> the

after being you know working with the

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.630 
after being you know working with the
four<00:02:52.560> point<00:02:52.739> five<00:02:52.859> two<00:02:53.040> inch<00:02:53.190> display<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.549> does

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
four point five two inch display it does

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.610 
four point five two inch display it does
feel<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> little<00:02:53.910> bit<00:02:54.090> different<00:02:54.599> in<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.379> hand
