yeah<00:04:56.470> that's<00:04:56.889> pretty<00:04:57.130> much<00:04:57.250> how<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.430> do<00:04:57.610> it

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
yeah that's pretty much how you do it

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.040 
yeah that's pretty much how you do it
that's<00:04:57.849> how<00:04:57.910> you<00:04:58.030> will<00:04:58.240> customize<00:04:58.660> all<00:04:58.930> of

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
that's how you will customize all of

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.110 
that's how you will customize all of
them<00:04:59.199> it's<00:04:59.410> really<00:04:59.530> really<00:05:00.070> simple<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.970> takes

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
them it's really really simple it takes

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.129 
them it's really really simple it takes
a<00:05:01.270> little<00:05:01.389> time<00:05:01.570> because<00:05:01.690> you<00:05:01.840> have<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:01.990> like

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
a little time because you have to like

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.689 
a little time because you have to like
sort<00:05:02.380> through<00:05:02.650> all<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.830> them<00:05:03.070> and<00:05:03.220> choose<00:05:03.430> like

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
sort through all of them and choose like

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.460 
sort through all of them and choose like
what<00:05:03.940> icon<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:04.599> want<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:04.990> everything<00:05:05.260> like

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
what icon you want and everything like

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.379 
what icon you want and everything like
that<00:05:05.530> but<00:05:06.280> um<00:05:06.490> after<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:06.910> get<00:05:07.030> over<00:05:07.060> that

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
that but um after you get over that

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.270 
that but um after you get over that
process<00:05:07.630> it's<00:05:08.020> pretty<00:05:08.229> easy<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:09.070> you<00:05:09.130> also

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
process it's pretty easy and you also

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.620 
process it's pretty easy and you also
can't<00:05:09.550> customize<00:05:09.729> like<00:05:10.030> every<00:05:10.240> single<00:05:10.419> one

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
can't customize like every single one

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.730 
can't customize like every single one
like<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:10.870> see<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.110> calculator<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.650> the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
like you see the calculator is the

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.050 
like you see the calculator is the
normal<00:05:12.039> calculator<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.699> weather<00:05:12.849> is<00:05:13.000> the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
normal calculator the weather is the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.570 
normal calculator the weather is the
normal<00:05:13.449> weather<00:05:13.599> app<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:14.080> context<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.830> camera

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
normal weather app in context and camera

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.370 
normal weather app in context and camera
just<00:05:16.330> because<00:05:16.449> they<00:05:16.750> don't<00:05:16.840> have<00:05:17.020> an<00:05:17.169> option

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
just because they don't have an option

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
just because they don't have an option
for<00:05:18.190> cocoapod<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:19.530> customize<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:21.159> that's

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
for cocoapod to customize it and that's

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.649 
for cocoapod to customize it and that's
why<00:05:21.550> it's<00:05:21.789> not<00:05:21.880> all<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.210> them<00:05:22.300> have<00:05:22.449> to<00:05:22.599> be

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
why it's not all of them have to be

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.839 
why it's not all of them have to be
customized<00:05:23.139> or<00:05:23.380> anything<00:05:23.560> I'm<00:05:24.370> fine<00:05:24.669> with

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
customized or anything I'm fine with

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.610 
customized or anything I'm fine with
just<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.150> few<00:05:25.419> and<00:05:25.690> it's<00:05:26.139> still<00:05:26.320> like<00:05:26.440> makes

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620
