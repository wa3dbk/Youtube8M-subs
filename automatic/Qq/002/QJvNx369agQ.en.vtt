00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.620
 No good morning starts with a healthy breakfast 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.290
 that this is not a good idea this one can really do nothing wrong 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.049
 make or 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.139
 the danger lurks maybe standing in the bun 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.139
 and maybe not just one 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.159
 Researchers at the University of Paderborn have shares in Brussels and Green 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:25.640
 mature plants 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.970
 Traces of antibiotics detected 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.060
 even in cooking cereals they came across residues of the drug 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.690
 and therefore knowing is a key part of Gretchen 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.090
 yes the surprise stands for self-confounding factors 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.120
 In many places, winter wheat is not really available 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.970
 Traces of antibiotics 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.290
 we have found 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.980
 but we were afraid that we would not be sure 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.780
 and thick afterwards harvesting in 2005 and 2006 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.690
 Cock in some cases 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 positive results brought that means we have in winter wheat 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.390
 Antibiotics can show traces 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.050
 but that could be the antibiotics in the drinks income 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.090
 that has something to do with the mast's attitude 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.800
 In the EU, thousands of tonnes of antibiotics are livestock-fed every year 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.870
 feed them and protect them against infections or cure them from illnesses 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.680
 but the supplied antibiotic stride the animals to 90 percent again 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.330
 out 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.290
 The collected loud and urine of the animals in turn gets as a stage for cooling 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.690
 on the fields 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.860
 The Greens also provide the good antibiotics they contain 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.420
 During the growth phase, the plant takes the remainder of the drug 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.850
 on 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 if only in slight traces 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.640
 but even these small traces cause concern for the scientists 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 is a real danger in our crops 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.260
 an acute hazard is not a very likely one 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.060
 but maybe a creeping endangerment over the year 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.580
 and we need it 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.840
 further investigations to determine 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.820
 is the grain loaded and how is the vegetables loaded because that would be 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.159
 a very direct route to food 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.689
 and for this reason, more research must be done to really get the results 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.989
 To be able to assess the danger safely 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.480
 the danger for humans could lie therein 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.419
 that the antibiotics always have effect to get full 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.809
 In the body, they can then do nothing against pathogenic bacteria 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:30.779
 align 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.039
 the hottest weapon of medicine 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.039
 there stops 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.389
 the reason for this is the increasing resistance of the bacteria 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.749
 They are true survivors who are very fast against active viruses 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.119
 and develop resistance 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.779
 Constancy the faster because the careless with antibiotics or constantly 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.749
 small amounts of it, for example, unconsciously through the food 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.229
 It would not be more appropriate to completely rely on antibiotics in agriculture too 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.269
 renounce 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.739
 yes, every human being also holds on to it rides long series of effects 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.139
 she is practicing her liberation celebrating the animals get well 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.840
 Those who get a fever and treat the sick will treat their sufferers 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:23.929
 as well as 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:28.089
 because the affected as well as a person is not in the infectious disease 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:32.719
 without self-interest Dr-ing Amerell "although I write off my animals without 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.989
 Tool 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.659
 one of the most common illnesses concerns him 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.510
 and here another danger threatens because sick animals divide the length 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.510
 at the same time but also against it 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.569
 antibiotic 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.039
 a fatal combination and that comes out on the field 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:55.520
 whose managed an international research group had made the attempt 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.100
 Salmonella can also attack plants via a Demong sting 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:01.509
 so far you have once accepted 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.759
 he does not do that anyway because it gets drained 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.409
 and the plants of anyway will not be infested by the communities 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.749
 But what will have to prove first we have actually notice 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.709
 that the sammer can bring in very efficient plants 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.840
 and Beiersdorf can multiply there 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.439
 and again a risky cocktail from his ranks and antibiotics the 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.930
 enjoy 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.539
 only Philipp LÃ¤mmermann needs cockpit 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.749
 This also increases the selection for resistant strains 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.649
 antibiotics resistant strains thus have the comets on the field 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:41.270
 although the plants infect 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.280
 and about the stupid it comes, for example, even the antibiotic 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.229
 after 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.870
 and this combination 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.480
 So in the end, you can use Keck as a turn on the plate 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.360
 Andy worthy resistant died 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.460
 confused by the finish Kurt takes it the antibiotic 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.339
 but usually the strain is already resistant and comes with it 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.279
 he drops his 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.279
 alone a pretty dangerous effect 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.189
 A vicious circle 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.749
 it is a bacterium and an ineffective antibiotic 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.319
 alone on its next few days around 40 people every year in Germany 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.370
 It is a fatal development due to the mass use of 

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:24.150
 Antibiotics in agriculture is triggered 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.190
 because no one should be his beloved breakfast sandwich 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.190
 critically check 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.800
 in the US, it made sense that tomatoes were infected with salmonella 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.349
 maybe still a matter of time until the first case with us also Strauss the 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.449
 So instead of low-cost airlines on the sales still on the former
