00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.400
 gift is the perfect mix between RPG and 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.110
 point and click 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.790
 it can carry very 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.100
 characteristic of the two being 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.199
 basically a classic rpg per turn 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.880

 enj reviving strongly all the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.619
 classic rpg boards are crazy 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.599
 because of that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.040
 the truth is we still have games 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.469
 very good so few people know 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 which is the case of blur which is a study 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.870

 character can even hit the arrow on the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 Mouse 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.579
 only you can walk as if 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.730
 pass out of the world with tim cook 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 he has some small weights that are 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.520
 very characteristic of the source itself 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.890
 clicks such as you get a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.570
 item and based on something 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.059
 writing on the screen you know where to use 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.469
 this item and soon in the top ten 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 minutes of play you can feel 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.340
 all this bridge reference click and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.110
 very clever use in circles to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420
 you make a good butt play is done 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.400
 for one guy only one of them is on strike at 9 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.130
 The group encompasses nine he has very 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.159
 good then beyond the free game link 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.439

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.520

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.140
 bruno is a pirate theme then 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 favorite classic anti hero and all that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 Very interesting bakery concept 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.049
 he remembered quite a few games made a 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 rap the maker if she can bring a 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.920
 very interesting innovation for those who 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.780
 like classic rpg security back without 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.340
 to look like a bad thing in mgm either 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.930
 dunga is a mandatory recommendation 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.729
 for everyone who likes to lose 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.180
