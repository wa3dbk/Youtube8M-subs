00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 I get to see the videos and Spain is 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.080
 a place which I would like to visit 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.540
 large there are many Chinese parts in one hundred 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.060
 if it is a country which I would like 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.520
 to visit 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.060

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.470
 I would like 200 older brothers good my 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.029

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.739

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.720
 Spain go to Barcelona's stadium and it was 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.000
 the state of madrid I told you that 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.910

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.379
 football game like the other day by 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.800
 there they told me that they lost the eagles 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.900
 50 believe me I do not have time that I do not 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.940
 I do not know anything about football news that does not 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.949
 I start watching a game I know there's 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.809
 people who are very aware of that but 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.579
 I'm not going to America because it's 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.610
 family tradition not know if you will 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.019
 go to the team let's say to the chivas 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.000
 team that they go to because then my 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.369
 dad of goes in my brothers I raise 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.960
 They will raise the chivas, not me, I will

 the america but simply by 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.800
 tradition and I do not know the best picture that 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.380
 It made me fucking was when I was 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.149
 the modem or when the louse was 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.130

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.229

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.090

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.610
 they called that whenever he entered he was goal 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.200
 that was the pictures I remember 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.119
 more chingones of the america but as you 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.460

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.049
 a football game but good for not 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.850
 We are here to talk about football or 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.039
 family traditions as they are 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.140
 I hope they walk well that I walk very 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.329

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.159
 'chrono' c's we will send message saying 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.600
 I have guests that open, I was 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.220
 inviting to play is that then there's 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.289
 people invite talk I invite them and they 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.500
 they put the john good faith 3 they put him award 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.929
 white second agreement well a double 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.080
 drops uruguay that's how good it is 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.700
 the tactical command but as I tell you this 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.860
 is the video of capture the flag that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.289
 I had already commented on the good more 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.240
 well in the past video gang and if I know 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.149
 that I had never uploaded anything on my channel 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.549
 that it was not domination what was not 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.870
 attend to me that rare time the demolition in 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.090
 black caption was not where I got to 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.650
 know demolition did not play demolition 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.780
 take with that they will be put that 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.269
 true here is also much that of 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.160
 will put them the other day I got to play 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.870
 demolition on this very good map was 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.940
 a game started 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.739
 they let us move was very crazy so if 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.980
 they want war demolition to do 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.159
 let's say when the goal is put in 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.209
 blame and do not get into it just because I 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.970
 I've been when about the latter 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.500
 times if they have won me I lost my 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.110
 team gets to keep my injury and 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.090
 it seems that he is playing in dead me 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.099
 they play another type of game and 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.690
 they seem to give when they tend to the month in 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.790
 all the game mold points so 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.709
 well or rather if they want to kill anything 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.200
 more then football is the game 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.209
 It is not the aim of the game is but good 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.209
 for day as I say capture the flag 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.690
 this was a good time I do not play 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.280
 much capture the flag rather in everything 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.160
 the time I've been playing call of duty 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.650
 from the call of duty 5 the hardware 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.659
 It can be very rare when I get to 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.250
 play flag recapture not even 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.650
 black ops or not already see that in black ops 1 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.120
 to get what the marathon was but 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.859
 had to play recapture of fly and 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.019
 capture the flag 15 months or so 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.310
 because there was a trick this will remember 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.470
 that there was a trick with which he could 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.390
 unlock all the tracks then 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.459
 that trick me of the gentleman with pe and as it is 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.620
 called the truth I do not remember how it 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.599
 he called I do not know yes 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.310
 I still have it on my list but if 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.900
 you are eager my lives a greeting for the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.959
 he taught me this trick and that's how I 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.489
 that immediately wake up fly tour but 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.970
 the times I played was also 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.310
 morÃ³n efe 3 in schools that are like 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.159
 competitive rules something like that simply 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.959
 in that type on this kind of occasions what 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.540
 played with the clan so we're going to 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.459
 when screen yes it goes to the position 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.319
 I like best in the world so 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.739
 competitive could be called the player 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.310
 I'm not so host to that dog with two 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.230
 heads as I tell you I 'm not so I'm not 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.329
 so pro in capture deflactor that no 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.980
 I usually do a lot but the position 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.359
 I like to go protecting something that 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.340
 take the flag not to carry the flag 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.079
 because many government pressures do not 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.280
 they're going to come from behind then I got pinched 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.169
 team instead of covering me 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.760
 it goes away it goes on the other hand it seems 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.250
 general beliefs of the flag only 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.370
 that he can not so better that's why 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.990
 I prefer to go I prefer to cover the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.120
 the flag makes me that much better 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.460
 position I fell in love 93 when wes scripts 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.440
 that is the position that I liked 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.690
 here I played it because in the mode 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.840
 of league they put most types of 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.840
 games that you play are game modes 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.060
 with cash as a harmony as a tour of 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.950
 flanders nation of the cobem and rare the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.750
 they dress of month but 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.170
 I was made a good example because I achieved 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.900
 remove the dogs I managed to get the living 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.990
 because in a flag field is very rare to 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.090
 less in my opinion and good only 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.800
 upload the first part because all the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.990
 other bones as you will see there they left 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.120
 three axes so that I raise the other apart 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.380
 it was a little bit boring and like 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.150
 always for me I hope that the 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.250
 gameplay has been to your liking that yes what 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.440
 they knew you can leave a like 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.510
 go through facebook twitter share 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.430
 the video leave some comment some 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.020
 question they have and why we are 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.009
 watching yourself take care of yourself wherever you want 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.289
 walk, I say goodbye 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.289
 a hug and have a good time
