now<00:00:00.870> we're<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.260> review<00:00:01.650> installation

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
now we're going to review installation

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.410 
now we're going to review installation
of<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.030> toe<00:00:03.419> daddy<00:00:03.689> plug<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:04.470> toe<00:00:05.420> wiring

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
of the toe daddy plug in toe wiring

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
of the toe daddy plug in toe wiring
harness<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:07.259> those<00:00:08.040> kits<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.440> OEM

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
harness for those kits that have the OEM

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.990 
harness for those kits that have the OEM
plugs<00:00:11.269> so<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.300> think<00:00:12.630> it's<00:00:12.920> helpful<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.340> look<00:00:14.880> at

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
plugs so I think it's helpful to look at

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.189 
plugs so I think it's helpful to look at
what<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.420> essence<00:00:15.750> we're<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.109> be

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
what in essence we're going to be

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.210 
what in essence we're going to be
achieving<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.810> 30<00:00:18.810> seconds<00:00:19.410> here's<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
achieving in 30 seconds here's a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.380 
achieving in 30 seconds here's a
conventional<00:00:21.090> diode<00:00:21.779> wiring<00:00:22.050> kit<00:00:23.180> that<00:00:24.180> we're

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
conventional diode wiring kit that we're

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
conventional diode wiring kit that we're
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.779> replacing<00:00:25.410> our<00:00:25.560> unit<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:28.939> all

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
going to be replacing our unit with all

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.760 
going to be replacing our unit with all
one<00:00:30.359> does<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.990> go<00:00:31.349> back<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> taillight<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
one does is go back to the taillight and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.709 
one does is go back to the taillight and
remove<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.040> connector<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.940> attaches<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
remove the connector that attaches to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.580 
remove the connector that attaches to
the<00:00:36.840> taillight<00:00:39.530> take<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.950> toe<00:00:41.760> daddy<00:00:42.590> two

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the taillight take the toe daddy two

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.869 
the taillight take the toe daddy two
connectors<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.539> put<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> appropriate<00:00:46.260> one

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
connectors and put the appropriate one

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.060 
connectors and put the appropriate one
replace<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> end<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.039> tail<00:00:50.039> light

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
replace it on the end of the tail light

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.290 
replace it on the end of the tail light
and<00:00:50.870> then<00:00:51.870> take<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> other<00:00:52.379> end<00:00:54.680> wallah<00:00:56.300> here

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and then take the other end wallah here

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.950 
and then take the other end wallah here
you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.140> both<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.829> tail<00:00:59.190> light<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
you can see that both the tail light and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.229 
you can see that both the tail light and
the<00:01:00.960> turn<00:01:01.530> light<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:02.039> working<00:01:02.430> properly<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the turn light are working properly and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.350 
the turn light are working properly and
if<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.320> looks<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> control<00:01:05.280> module<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
if one looks on the control module you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.670 
if one looks on the control module you
can<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.490> both<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> amber<00:01:09.900> turn

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
can see that the both the amber turn

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.039 
can see that the both the amber turn
signal<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.880> red<00:01:12.090> tail<00:01:12.479> light<00:01:12.750> are

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
signal and the red tail light are

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.890 
signal and the red tail light are
working<00:01:13.619> properly<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> confirms<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
working properly so that confirms that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.660 
working properly so that confirms that
we<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.110> proper<00:01:16.500> installation<00:01:19.670> this

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
we have proper installation this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
we have proper installation this
procedure<00:01:21.180> needs<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.900> repeated<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
procedure needs to be repeated on the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.690 
procedure needs to be repeated on the
other<00:01:23.250> side<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.180> an<00:01:24.420> identical<00:01:24.810> fashion
