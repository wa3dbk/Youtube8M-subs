00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.890
 for people who were recently 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.950
 making the bank's website 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.180
 central of my country chile and I realized 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.799
 of something very curious 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.719
 the least valuable coins in my country 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.209
 which are respectively one's currency 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.970
 and five pesos have some properties 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.439
 very interesting coin one is a 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.210
 ninety-something percent made of 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.980
 aluminum and the five coin in a 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.570
 ninety-something percent made of 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.089
 copper 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.829
 if you saw my other videos you 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.320
 account account that with this we can do 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.350
 an electric battery the problem is that 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.470
 we need some acid medium we could 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.770
 use vinegar lemon juice or even 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.230
 cocacola but they are all very expensive 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.140
 so today we're going to use something a lot 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.140
 cheaper 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 pizzi 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.620
 two 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.039
 to the spot 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.039
 already 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.830
 and you have to take out a little bit of the excess bichi 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.010
 rich 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.610
 we are going 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.850
 then you give yourself a life process 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.850
 of Spanish goal pitching 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.670
 but yesterday trichet 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.520
 let's proceed with the following the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.909
 coins 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.400
 that our half empty 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.180
 this is copper 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.180
 this is aluminum 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.750
 and next to see strongly 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.620
 but a touch 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.420
 salt rock oxidation occurs 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.750
 Now let's measure how much voltage we 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 delivery 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.500
 almost half a goal in a one peso way 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.140
 about 5 and a piece of babel with pizzi 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.870
 0.5 times that is to say gathering three of 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.410
 these in series can achieve a stack of 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.570
 1.5 volts the same voltage as in the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.000
 standard batteries do not expect this 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.730
 impressive way but I had to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.130
 share it with you more than bad is 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.530
 a battery that will only come out 18 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.700
 pesos in coins because the role is 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.520
 can find in any crap 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.040
 of garbage I will use a your ticket and the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.970
 urine is free in order for more data 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.970
 curious as this one 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.480
 see you 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.790
 figure 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.340
 also go ahead here seeing what 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.550
 I was doing 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.550
 this
