00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.470 
computer that I had got and as the
Alienware<00:00:12.840> x51<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.920> i<00:00:14.700> did<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> video<00:00:15.089> about

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
Alienware x51 and i did a video about

really<00:00:20.279> good<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.850> kind<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.180> computer

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
really good for that kind of computer

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.210 
really good for that kind of computer
because<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.350> doesn't<00:00:22.619> really<00:00:22.710> take<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> much

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
because it doesn't really take that much

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.420 
because it doesn't really take that much
power<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.550> run<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> decided<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.830> take

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
power to run it so I decided to take

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.189 
power to run it so I decided to take
participation<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> battlefield<00:00:27.810> 4<00:00:28.019> beta

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
really choppy where I couldn't really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.419 
really choppy where I couldn't really
move<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.110> much<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:44.039> it's<00:01:44.190> doing<00:01:44.399> pretty

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
move that much but it's doing pretty

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:51.490 
move that much but it's doing pretty
good<00:01:44.759> right<00:01:45.000> now

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.750 

see<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.660> even<00:04:07.930> on<00:04:08.080> high<00:04:08.430> graphics<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.580> game

still<00:04:10.030> looks<00:04:10.300> beautiful<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:10.989> mean<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.800> doesn't

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
still looks beautiful I mean it doesn't

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.770 
still looks beautiful I mean it doesn't
even<00:04:12.190> look<00:04:12.340> like<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.760> changed<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.239> at<00:04:13.360> all<00:04:13.450> but<00:04:13.720> I

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
even look like I changed it at all but I

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.810 
even look like I changed it at all but I
guess<00:04:13.989> that's<00:04:14.230> for<00:04:15.030> other<00:04:16.030> stuff<00:04:17.579> yeah<00:04:18.579> like

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
guess that's for other stuff yeah like

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.970 
guess that's for other stuff yeah like
when<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.120> gets<00:04:19.269> really<00:04:19.540> laggy<00:04:19.870> on<00:04:20.230> ultra

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980
