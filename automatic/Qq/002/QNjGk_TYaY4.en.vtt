00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.520 
entertaining video for me I like it to
be<00:02:03.990> fast<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> think<00:02:05.399> after<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.700> edited<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
be fast so I think after I edited this

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.529 
be fast so I think after I edited this
it<00:02:06.740> was<00:02:06.890> probably<00:02:07.220> at<00:02:07.909> around<00:02:08.119> two<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.450> half

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
it was probably at around two and a half

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.900 
it was probably at around two and a half
minutes<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.080> who's<00:02:09.830> extremely<00:02:10.100> fast<00:02:10.610> if<00:02:10.789> I

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
minutes so who's extremely fast if I

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.520 
minutes so who's extremely fast if I
actually<00:02:11.060> would<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.330> edited<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.410> I

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
actually would have edited it like I

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.170 
actually would have edited it like I
normally<00:02:12.590> do<00:02:13.190> where<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.459> kind<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.730> cut<00:02:13.910> out<00:02:14.000> some

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
normally do where I kind of cut out some

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.309 
normally do where I kind of cut out some
transitions<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.900> would<00:02:14.990> have<00:02:15.080> been<00:02:15.140> even

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
transitions it would have been even

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.199 
transitions it would have been even
shorter<00:02:15.709> but<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.040> wouldn't<00:02:16.400> have<00:02:16.520> room<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.819> talk

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209
