00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.740 

didn't<00:00:05.940> even<00:00:06.060> have<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.450> read<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
didn't even have to read the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.720 
didn't even have to read the
instructions<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.799> just<00:00:08.010> played<00:00:08.250> around<00:00:08.460> with<00:00:08.550> a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
instructions I just played around with a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.879 
instructions I just played around with a
little<00:00:08.970> bit<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:10.139> was<00:00:10.320> real<00:00:10.559> easy<00:00:10.800> to

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
little bit and it was real easy to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.009 
little bit and it was real easy to
figure<00:00:11.160> out<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.670> could<00:00:11.880> use<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.240> as<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> plumb

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
figure out you could use this as a plumb

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.720 
figure out you could use this as a plumb
bob<00:00:13.049> if<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.950> needed<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.309> transfer

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
bob if you needed to transfer

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.189

measurement<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> bottom<00:00:15.750> hey<00:00:16.020> what's

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
measurement to the bottom hey what's

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.630 
measurement to the bottom hey what's
going<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.440> Barnaby<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:17.039> remember<00:00:17.460> when<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
going on Barnaby here remember when a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
going on Barnaby here remember when a
level<00:00:17.970> was<00:00:18.119> just<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.420> couple<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.810> bubbles<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
level was just a couple of bubbles in a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.340 
level was just a couple of bubbles in a
bar<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.119> was<00:00:21.330> now<00:00:21.960> they've

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
bar and that's all it was now they've

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.900 
bar and that's all it was now they've
gone<00:00:22.500> digital<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.189> high-tech<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.760> that's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
gone digital and high-tech and that's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.279 
gone digital and high-tech and that's
we're<00:00:24.029> gonna<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.269> talking<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
we're gonna be talking about is a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.349 
we're gonna be talking about is a
digital<00:00:25.980> level<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.580> by<00:00:26.699> Empire<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.269> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
digital level this one by Empire it's a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.900 
digital level this one by Empire it's a
four-foot<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.349> got<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> dot<00:00:28.769> laser<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
four-foot it's got a dot laser on the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.759 
four-foot it's got a dot laser on the
end<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.420> has<00:00:30.660> an<00:00:30.840> audible<00:00:31.230> alarm<00:00:31.500> when

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
end of it it has an audible alarm when

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.430 
end of it it has an audible alarm when
you<00:00:31.859> reach<00:00:32.099> level<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.420> also<00:00:33.570> has<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.140> ten

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
you reach level and it also has a ten

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200 
you reach level and it also has a ten
memory<00:00:35.010> function<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.700> what<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> do

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
memory function and what we like to do

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.580 
memory function and what we like to do
with<00:00:36.360> tools<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.200> put<00:00:37.380> them<00:00:37.469> into

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
with tools like this is put them into

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.229 
with tools like this is put them into
the<00:00:37.680> hands<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.950> guys<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.280> Mark<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:39.120> you

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the hands of guys like Mark have you

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
the hands of guys like Mark have you
take<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> job<00:00:40.079> site<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.410> put<00:00:40.770> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
take it out to the job site and put it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.400 
take it out to the job site and put it
through<00:00:41.070> its<00:00:41.340> paces<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.260> we're

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
through its paces and then what we're

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.400 
through its paces and then what we're
really<00:00:43.620> interested<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.870> perception

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
really interested in is your perception

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.889 
really interested in is your perception
of<00:00:46.469> performance<00:00:47.039> design<00:00:47.460> quality<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> value

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
of performance design quality and value

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
of performance design quality and value
of<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:49.829> first<00:00:49.950> let's<00:00:50.250> talk<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.550> you

of this but first let's talk about you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
of this but first let's talk about you

mm-hmm<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.250> right<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.550> level<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.690> key<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
mm-hmm all right so level is key and so

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
mm-hmm all right so level is key and so
slope<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:59.370> yes<00:00:59.910> yeah<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.539> let's<00:01:00.690> talk<00:01:00.899> about

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
slope right yes yeah so let's talk about

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.319 
slope right yes yeah so let's talk about
this<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.920> did<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.070> use<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.460> well<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this what did you use it for well what I

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
this what did you use it for well what I
actually<00:01:03.600> use<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.890> frame

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
actually use this for was to frame

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.330 
actually use this for was to frame
basement<00:01:06.270> walls<00:01:06.450> mm-hmm<00:01:07.020> okay<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.189> how

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
basement walls mm-hmm okay and so how

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.770 
basement walls mm-hmm okay and so how
did<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> work<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> versus<00:01:09.270> other<00:01:09.510> levels

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
did it work for you versus other levels

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.300 
did it work for you versus other levels
you've<00:01:09.930> used<00:01:10.170> well<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> lot<00:01:11.130> more

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you've used well this is a lot more

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.350 
you've used well this is a lot more
accurate<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.450> standard<00:01:12.900> bubble<00:01:13.470> type<00:01:13.710> level

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
accurate the standard bubble type level

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.850 
accurate the standard bubble type level
basically<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.750> close<00:01:15.990> enough<00:01:16.020> right

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
basically is just close enough right

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.969 
basically is just close enough right
this<00:01:17.280> gets<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> plumb<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this gets you get you a plumb it you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.310 
this gets you get you a plumb it you
wouldn't<00:01:20.400> worried<00:01:20.640> zero<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.299> ninety<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.200> know

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
wouldn't worried zero or ninety you know

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.929 
wouldn't worried zero or ninety you know
you're<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:22.860> perfect<00:01:23.400> you're<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.729> on

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you're you're perfect you're right on

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
you're you're perfect you're right on
there's<00:01:24.360> some<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.630> peace<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.990> mind<00:01:25.170> with

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
there's some good peace of mind with

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
there's some good peace of mind with
that<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.799> mean<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.159> always<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.670> just

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that because I mean I always I just

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.190 
that because I mean I always I just
remodeled<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.360> bathroom<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
remodeled a bathroom and it's like you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.899 
remodeled a bathroom and it's like you
know<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.710> bubbles<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.130> peak<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.549> pass<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
know that bubbles just peak and pass the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.179 
know that bubbles just peak and pass the
line<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> go<00:01:30.299> yeah<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:31.140> close<00:01:31.409> enough<00:01:31.470> yeah

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
line to go yeah it's close enough yeah

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:32.990 
line to go yeah it's close enough yeah
exactly

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
exactly

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
exactly
okay<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.290> easy<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.829> use<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.310> guess

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
okay so was it easy to use I guess

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
okay so was it easy to use I guess
that's<00:01:35.670> part<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> performance<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.869> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that's part of the performance was it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.609 
that's part of the performance was it
hard<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.619> learn<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.490> honest<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.939> actually

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
hard to learn to be honest I actually

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.420 
hard to learn to be honest I actually
didn't<00:01:40.619> even<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.159> read<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
didn't even have to read the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
didn't even have to read the
instructions<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.720> played<00:01:42.930> around<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
instructions I just played around with a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.590 
instructions I just played around with a
little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.000> real<00:01:45.270> easy<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
little bit and then it was real easy to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.780 
little bit and then it was real easy to
figure<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.079> okay<00:01:46.890> well<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> guess<00:01:47.399> let's<00:01:47.640> get

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
figure out okay well I guess let's get

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.819 
figure out okay well I guess let's get
into<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> design<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.380> talk<00:01:49.530> about<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
into the design of it and talk about the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.020 
into the design of it and talk about the
various<00:01:50.100> features<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.909> also

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
various features and then we can also

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
various features and then we can also
kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.390> overlay<00:01:51.720> how<00:01:51.899> those<00:01:52.110> worked<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.649> you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
kind of overlay how those worked for you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
kind of overlay how those worked for you
as<00:01:52.890> well<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.340> sure<00:01:53.549> take<00:01:54.149> me<00:01:54.270> through<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.479> well

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
as well so sure take me through it well

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
as well so sure take me through it well

so take me through the buttons what sort
of<00:02:15.870> things<00:02:16.050> does<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.349> do<00:02:16.440> well<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.370> zero

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
of things does it do well you can zero

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.479 
of things does it do well you can zero
it<00:02:17.849> out<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.209> you're<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.659> on<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.830> slope<00:02:20.220> or

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
it out if you're on a on one slope or

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.430 
it out if you're on a on one slope or
one<00:02:20.640> plane<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.390> transfer<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:21.900> that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
one plane you can transfer that that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.619 
one plane you can transfer that that
over<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.099> another<00:02:23.400> area<00:02:23.519> that's<00:02:24.360> gonna<00:02:24.510> be

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
over to another area that's gonna be

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.479 
over to another area that's gonna be
naeun<00:02:24.810> yes<00:02:25.200> yes<00:02:25.739> if<00:02:25.920> you're<00:02:26.040> doing<00:02:26.280> especially

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
naeun yes yes if you're doing especially

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.369 
naeun yes yes if you're doing especially
for<00:02:26.940> landscaping<00:02:27.599> or<00:02:27.720> something<00:02:28.049> like<00:02:28.200> that

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
for landscaping or something like that

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.839 
for landscaping or something like that
that<00:02:28.530> would<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.739> very<00:02:28.890> useful

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
that would be very useful

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.910 
that would be very useful
you<00:02:30.299> got<00:02:30.450> your<00:02:30.629> units<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.080> measure<00:02:31.319> you've<00:02:31.680> got

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
you got your units of measure you've got

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.009 
you got your units of measure you've got
inches<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.760> feet<00:02:33.030> mm-hmm

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
inches and feet mm-hmm

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.160 
inches and feet mm-hmm
you've<00:02:34.230> got<00:02:34.500> percent<00:02:35.459> for<00:02:36.180> grade<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.989> then

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
you've got percent for grade and then

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.350 
you've got percent for grade and then
you've<00:02:37.290> got<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:37.620> degrees<00:02:38.040> okay<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
you've got your degrees okay and the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.589 
you've got your degrees okay and the
audio<00:02:39.660> alarm<00:02:39.989> audio<00:02:40.739> alarm<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.760> turn<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.150> if

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
audio alarm audio alarm you turn on if

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.960 
audio alarm audio alarm you turn on if
you're<00:02:43.560> having<00:02:43.860> trouble<00:02:44.250> seeing<00:02:44.430> your<00:02:44.640> screen

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
you're having trouble seeing your screen

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.650 
you're having trouble seeing your screen
mm-hmm

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
mm-hmm

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.199 
mm-hmm
it<00:02:45.980> starts<00:02:46.980> chirping<00:02:47.489> when<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> get<00:02:47.940> close<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
it starts chirping when you get close to

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.789 
it starts chirping when you get close to
zero<00:02:48.660> it'll<00:02:49.470> do<00:02:49.709> progressively<00:02:50.660> closer<00:02:51.799> chirp

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
zero it'll do progressively closer chirp

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.130 
zero it'll do progressively closer chirp
okay<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.549> then<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.849> about<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.780> numbers<00:02:55.079> I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
okay and then what about the numbers I

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.330 
okay and then what about the numbers I
mean<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.530> know<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> lot<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:55.859> times<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.220> get

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
mean you know a lot of times you get

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.099 
mean you know a lot of times you get
into<00:02:56.489> positions<00:02:56.910> where<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.510> know<00:02:57.900> it's

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
into positions where you know it's

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.900 
into positions where you know it's
upside<00:02:58.440> down<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.160> then<00:02:59.280> yeah<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.459> got<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> flip

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
upside down and then yeah I got to flip

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.180 
upside down and then yeah I got to flip
it<00:03:00.030> back<00:03:00.060> over<00:03:00.200> well<00:03:01.200> yeah<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.620> sometimes<00:03:01.859> if

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it back over well yeah and sometimes if

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.099 
it back over well yeah and sometimes if
you're<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.609> little<00:03:02.879> dyslexic<00:03:03.420> or<00:03:03.569> not<00:03:03.690> thinking

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
you're a little dyslexic or not thinking

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.539 
you're a little dyslexic or not thinking
you<00:03:04.230> could<00:03:04.410> transfer<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.859> wrong<00:03:05.010> number<00:03:05.370> this

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
you could transfer the wrong number this

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.940 
you could transfer the wrong number this
level<00:03:05.910> actually<00:03:06.090> flips<00:03:06.720> flips<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.650> numbers

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
level actually flips flips the numbers

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.380 
level actually flips flips the numbers
over<00:03:08.220> for<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.609> oh<00:03:08.700> really<00:03:08.879> so<00:03:09.120> when<00:03:09.239> it's

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
over for you oh really so when it's

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.849 
over for you oh really so when it's
overhead<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.870> whatever<00:03:10.019> it's<00:03:10.319> just<00:03:10.410> it'll

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
overhead and whatever it's just it'll

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.890 
overhead and whatever it's just it'll
always<00:03:10.950> give<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.489> nice<00:03:12.480> vertically

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
always give you the nice vertically

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.809 
always give you the nice vertically
oriented<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.739> can<00:03:13.859> read<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.129> yes<00:03:14.549> just

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
oriented so you can read it yes just

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.099 
oriented so you can read it yes just
just<00:03:15.390> like<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.569> smart<00:03:15.870> phone

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
just like a smart phone

plumb<00:03:37.590> yup<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.340> could<00:03:38.549> use<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:38.910> as<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.269> plumb

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
plumb yup you could use this as a plumb

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.420 
plumb yup you could use this as a plumb
bob<00:03:39.720> if<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.650> needed<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.980> transfer<00:03:41.400> a

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
bob if you needed to transfer a

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.309 
bob if you needed to transfer a
measurement<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.060> bottom<00:03:42.419> those<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
measurement to the bottom those of the

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.500 
measurement to the bottom those of the
offset<00:03:43.769> right<00:03:43.950> here<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.400> one<00:03:44.970> point<00:03:45.239> three

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510

seven<00:03:45.750> five<00:03:46.139> okay<00:03:46.829> what<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.190> thought<00:03:47.549> this

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
seven five okay what I thought this

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.610 
seven five okay what I thought this
would<00:03:47.880> really<00:03:48.060> be<00:03:48.180> handy<00:03:48.630> for<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:49.049> projecting

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
would really be handy for is projecting

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.890 
would really be handy for is projecting
a<00:03:49.739> slope<00:03:50.069> if<00:03:50.819> you're<00:03:51.000> doing<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.329> landscape<00:03:51.630> you

a slope if you're doing a landscape you

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.319 
a slope if you're doing a landscape you
know<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.440> maybe<00:03:52.829> you're<00:03:53.190> on<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.970> hill<00:03:54.299> or

know and maybe you're on a hill or

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.940 
know and maybe you're on a hill or
something<00:03:54.690> building<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.230> deck<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.470> can<00:03:55.799> use

something building a deck you can use

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.099 
something building a deck you can use
this<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.310> transfer<00:03:56.760> your<00:03:56.910> slope<00:03:57.239> yeah<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.049> you

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
what you drop a level and you're

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.759 
what you drop a level and you're
thinking<00:04:06.510> oh<00:04:06.810> my<00:04:06.989> gosh<00:04:07.169> are<00:04:07.349> those<00:04:07.470> bubbles

this one's electronic do you think it's

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.589 
this one's electronic do you think it's
going<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:11.010> hold<00:04:11.190> up<00:04:11.310> on<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.489> job<00:04:11.669> site<00:04:11.940> yeah

going to hold up on the job site yeah

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.689 
going to hold up on the job site yeah
this<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:13.199> thing<00:04:13.410> right<00:04:13.590> here<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:14.489> actually

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
this this thing right here it actually

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.390 
this this thing right here it actually
you<00:04:15.030> can<00:04:15.209> recalibrate<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:16.079> mm-hmm<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:17.220> has<00:04:17.370> a

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
you can recalibrate it mm-hmm it has a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.430 
you can recalibrate it mm-hmm it has a
function<00:04:17.729> to<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.109> could<00:04:19.289> do<00:04:19.410> that

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
function to it and you could do that

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.409 
function to it and you could do that
with<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.859> zero<00:04:20.099> button<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.609> get<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.180> known

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
with the zero button to get a known

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.810 
with the zero button to get a known
plane<00:04:22.260> known<00:04:22.620> level<00:04:23.039> you<00:04:23.190> know<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.669> read

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
plane known level you know you can read

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.409 
plane known level you know you can read
zero<00:04:24.060> it

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
zero it

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.780

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
shock pads on the end that's nice if you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.620 
shock pads on the end that's nice if you
do<00:04:30.200> drop<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.910> hopefully<00:04:31.910> you<00:04:32.180> don't<00:04:32.270> have<00:04:32.390> to

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
do drop it hopefully you don't have to

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.630 
do drop it hopefully you don't have to
replace<00:04:32.990> its<00:04:33.620> aircraft<00:04:34.010> aluminum<00:04:34.280> what

lot lighter this is I've got a wooden

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.090 
lot lighter this is I've got a wooden
carpenter's<00:04:40.580> level<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:41.440> this<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.500> probably

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
carpenter's level and this is probably

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.250 
carpenter's level and this is probably
an<00:04:43.310> it's<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.520> four<00:04:43.730> footer<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.360> probably<00:04:44.840> a

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
an it's a four footer this is probably a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.200 
an it's a four footer this is probably a
little<00:04:45.740> bit<00:04:45.890> lighter<00:04:46.220> than<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.520> one<00:04:46.880> okay

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
little bit lighter than that one okay

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.810 
little bit lighter than that one okay
yeah<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:48.040> hold<00:04:49.040> up<00:04:49.220> over<00:04:49.370> your<00:04:49.460> head<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.640> move

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
yeah you hold up over your head and move

it's<00:05:07.430> intended<00:05:07.730> for<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:08.270> think<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:08.900> is<00:05:09.050> more

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
it's intended for I think this is more

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.590 
it's intended for I think this is more
for<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.530> pro<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:10.310> average<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.150> homeowner

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
for the pro the average a homeowner

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.030 
for the pro the average a homeowner
probably<00:05:12.200> isn't<00:05:12.440> going<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.650> need<00:05:12.770> something

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
probably isn't going to need something

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.540 
probably isn't going to need something
this<00:05:13.340> accurate<00:05:14.590> but<00:05:15.590> if<00:05:15.680> they<00:05:15.860> did<00:05:16.040> have<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.460> I

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
this accurate but if they did have it I

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.760 
this accurate but if they did have it I
mean<00:05:16.730> they'd<00:05:16.880> make<00:05:17.060> their<00:05:17.180> life<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.510> lot<00:05:17.630> easier

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
mean they'd make their life a lot easier

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.880 
mean they'd make their life a lot easier
okay

okay

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.930
