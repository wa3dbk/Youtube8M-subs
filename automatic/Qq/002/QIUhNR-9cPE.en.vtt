00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.729 
the n1 I love the Canon end series
cameras<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.239> look<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.809> slick

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
cameras because they look really slick

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.110 
cameras because they look really slick
currently<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.520> favorite<00:00:53.789> vlogging

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
currently this is my favorite vlogging

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
currently this is my favorite vlogging
camera<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> N<00:00:54.840> 100<00:00:55.410> which<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.649> don't

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
camera this is the N 100 which I don't

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.290 
camera this is the N 100 which I don't
think<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.129> ever<00:00:56.430> did<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> review<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.059> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
think I actually ever did a review on it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.029 
think I actually ever did a review on it
or<00:00:57.539> did<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.320> these<00:00:58.440> also<00:00:58.620> come<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.010> black

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
or did I all of these also come in black

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.500 
or did I all of these also come in black
so<00:00:59.430> that's<00:00:59.579> an<00:00:59.670> option<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.059> case<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.329> want

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
so that's an option in case you want

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.490 
so that's an option in case you want
another<00:01:00.660> color<00:01:00.870> doing<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> side-by-side

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
another color doing a side-by-side

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.250 
another color doing a side-by-side
comparison<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.609> n2<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> n1<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
comparison of the n2 and the n1 the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.840 
comparison of the n2 and the n1 the
first<00:01:04.409> thing<00:01:04.530> you're<00:01:04.650> gonna<00:01:04.739> notice<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.309> they

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
first thing you're gonna notice is they

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
first thing you're gonna notice is they
made<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> lens<00:01:06.540> black<00:01:06.960> which<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.290> feel<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.500> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
made the lens black which I feel like is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190 
made the lens black which I feel like is
kind<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> distracting<00:01:09.689> because

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
kind of it's kind of distracting because

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.690 
kind of it's kind of distracting because
this<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.799> silver<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.549> just

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this one was silver and I think it just

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
this one was silver and I think it just
kind<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.330> matched<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:12.960> better<00:01:13.080> they

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
kind of matched a little bit better they

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.560 
kind of matched a little bit better they
also<00:01:13.530> made<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.460> white<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.119> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.479> an

criticism<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.869> people<00:01:31.350> who<00:01:31.439> probably<00:01:31.829> broke

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
criticism of people who probably broke

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.890 
criticism of people who probably broke
their<00:01:32.520> cameras<00:01:33.180> because<00:01:33.420> i<00:01:33.509> tried<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> flip

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
their cameras because i tried to flip

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.050 
their cameras because i tried to flip
them<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.530> flips<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:36.030> i

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
them up this one flips up and what i

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.819 
them up this one flips up and what i
like<00:01:36.240> about<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.320> weird

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
like about this is it's kind of weird

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.260 
like about this is it's kind of weird
because<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.490> i'm<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.729> filming<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
because when i'm out filming and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.880 
because when i'm out filming and
vlogging<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.750> there's<00:01:39.900> wind<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.439> actually

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
vlogging and there's wind this actually

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.530 
vlogging and there's wind this actually
protects<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> wind<00:01:41.820> from<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> microphone

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
protects the wind from the microphone

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.819 
protects the wind from the microphone
because<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.930> microphone<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:43.799> on

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
because the microphone is right here on

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.469 
because the microphone is right here on
top<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.490> only<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.000> act<00:01:45.240> as

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
top so not only will this act as

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.359 
top so not only will this act as
something<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.320> you'll<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.530> able<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.799> frame

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
something that you'll be able to frame

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
something that you'll be able to frame
your<00:01:47.729> shot<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> also<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> wind

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
your shot but it also is a wind

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.880 
your shot but it also is a wind
protector<00:01:50.509> magic<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.869> first<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.860> i

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.940 
unbox the end i was like so excited and
I<00:01:55.860> went<00:01:56.180> I<00:01:57.180> flipped<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.560> tried<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I went I flipped this up and I tried to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
I went I flipped this up and I tried to
flip<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.579> way<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.090> almost<00:02:00.420> broke

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
flip it up all the way and almost broke

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.870 
flip it up all the way and almost broke

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
here's the top you can see the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.680 
here's the top you can see the
microphone<00:04:14.770> has<00:04:15.370> now<00:04:15.520> been<00:04:15.760> moved<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.600> the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
microphone has now been moved to the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.330 
microphone has now been moved to the
middle<00:04:16.960> I<00:04:17.109> like<00:04:17.350> if<00:04:17.440> we<00:04:17.500> move<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.799> strap<00:04:18.100> up

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
middle I like if we move the strap up

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.070 
middle I like if we move the strap up
here<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.850> top<00:04:19.060> because<00:04:19.480> sometimes<00:04:19.900> this

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
here to the top because sometimes this

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.719 
here to the top because sometimes this
would<00:04:20.230> rattle<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.799> hit<00:04:21.160> against<00:04:21.460> there<00:04:21.640> and

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
would rattle and hit against there and

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.219 
would rattle and hit against there and
then<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.910> microphone<00:04:22.180> would<00:04:22.660> pick<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:22.930> up<00:04:23.020> so

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
then the microphone would pick it up so

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.330 
then the microphone would pick it up so
my<00:04:23.320> first<00:04:23.560> reaction<00:04:23.740> is
