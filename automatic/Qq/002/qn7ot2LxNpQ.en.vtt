really proud I'm happy with and it's got

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.849 
really proud I'm happy with and it's got
the<00:02:45.760> rain<00:02:45.909> geometry<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:47.530> know<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.739> man

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
the rain geometry the you know the man

shipping the specification the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.080 
shipping the specification the
components<00:02:50.290> everything<00:02:50.709> em<00:02:50.889> has<00:02:51.519> been<00:02:51.939> my

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
components everything em has been my

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.789 
components everything em has been my
selections<00:02:52.659> so<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:52.959> been<00:02:53.139> obviously<00:02:53.620> had

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
selections so it's been obviously had

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.410 
selections so it's been obviously had
some<00:02:53.950> great<00:02:54.189> support<00:02:54.609> and<00:02:54.670> some<00:02:54.879> guidance<00:02:55.269> but

some great support and some guidance but
really<00:02:55.689> it's<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.840> paper<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.889> played<00:02:57.189> off<00:02:57.370> and

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
really it's a paper and played off and

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.420 
really it's a paper and played off and
that<00:02:57.909> I'm<00:02:58.209> really<00:02:58.599> happy<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.019> right<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.430> from

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
that I'm really happy to right and from

know understated images you know its

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.460 
know understated images you know its
distinctive<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:34.329> bikes<00:03:34.569> are<00:03:34.720> solid

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
distinctive and the bikes are solid

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.869 
distinctive and the bikes are solid
they're<00:03:35.500> stiff<00:03:35.889> they're<00:03:36.190> actually<00:03:36.639> you<00:03:36.760> know

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
they're stiff they're actually you know

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.599 
they're stiff they're actually you know
it<00:03:37.389> can<00:03:37.569> take<00:03:37.780> my<00:03:38.049> abuse<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.129> but<00:03:39.519> they

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
it can take my abuse and but they

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.280 
it can take my abuse and but they
actually<00:03:39.699> reverse<00:03:40.180> still<00:03:40.359> lightweight<00:03:40.930> and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
actually reverse still lightweight and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.110 
actually reverse still lightweight and
we<00:03:41.379> still<00:03:41.590> handle<00:03:41.919> very<00:03:42.099> well<00:03:42.159> and<00:03:42.519> responsive

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
we still handle very well and responsive

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.670 
we still handle very well and responsive
and<00:03:43.269> just<00:03:43.720> all<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.959> lot<00:03:44.109> of<00:03:44.169> things<00:03:44.379> that<00:03:44.620> I

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
and just all the lot of things that I
