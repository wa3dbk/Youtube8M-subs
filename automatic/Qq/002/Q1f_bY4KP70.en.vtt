you know you made you can take it
somewhere<00:00:23.019> and<00:00:23.199> because<00:00:23.470> dance<00:00:23.710> is<00:00:23.890> just

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
somewhere and because dance is just

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.329 
somewhere and because dance is just
blowing<00:00:24.189> up<00:00:24.400> now<00:00:24.550> just<00:00:25.329> a<00:00:25.419> bit<00:00:25.539> huge<00:00:25.839> I<00:00:26.019> mean
