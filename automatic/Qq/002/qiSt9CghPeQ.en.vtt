we're<00:01:19.329> gonna<00:01:19.479> do<00:01:19.569> it<00:01:19.659> anyways<00:01:19.960> right<00:01:20.140> we've

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
we're gonna do it anyways right we've

been doing this for hundreds of years
growing<00:01:23.289> crops<00:01:23.740> we<00:01:24.340> grow<00:01:24.369> this<00:01:24.759> crop<00:01:24.939> every

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
growing crops we grow this crop every

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.910 
growing crops we grow this crop every
year<00:01:25.299> so<00:01:25.659> this<00:01:25.780> Stover<00:01:26.109> is<00:01:26.170> going<00:01:26.289> to<00:01:26.350> be<00:01:26.469> here

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
year so this Stover is going to be here

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.279 
year so this Stover is going to be here
so<00:01:27.670> we<00:01:28.000> Laswell<00:01:28.359> process<00:01:28.869> it<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.170> make

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
so we Laswell process it and make

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.449 
so we Laswell process it and make
something<00:01:29.530> even<00:01:30.219> more<00:01:30.369> useful<00:01:30.549> out<00:01:30.789> of<00:01:30.819> it

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
something even more useful out of it

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.410 
something even more useful out of it
when<00:01:33.459> you<00:01:33.520> think<00:01:33.640> about<00:01:33.729> ethanol<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.240> think

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
when you think about ethanol you think

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.300 
when you think about ethanol you think
about<00:01:34.599> ethanol<00:01:35.349> from<00:01:35.469> corn<00:01:35.560> that's<00:01:36.219> the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
about ethanol from corn that's the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.219 
about ethanol from corn that's the
primary<00:01:36.549> crop<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.060> we<00:01:37.149> use<00:01:37.359> here<00:01:37.569> so<00:01:37.750> you'll

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
primary crop that we use here so you'll

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.529

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
powered wind guard so this is the part

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.000 
powered wind guard so this is the part
that<00:02:46.580> I<00:02:46.670> invented<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.420> have<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> patent<00:02:48.650> on

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
that I invented and have a patent on

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.380 
that I invented and have a patent on
so<00:02:49.550> these<00:02:49.790> impeller<00:02:50.720> blades<00:02:51.340> spin<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.610> help

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
so these impeller blades spin and help

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.480 
so these impeller blades spin and help
drive<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.050> top<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.620> windrow<00:02:54.920> into<00:02:55.400> the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
drive the top of the windrow into the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.240 
drive the top of the windrow into the
baler<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:57.050> helps<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.500> farmer<00:02:57.830> get<00:02:58.010> more

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
baler so it helps the farmer get more

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.340 
baler so it helps the farmer get more
yield<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.030> helps<00:02:59.300> him<00:02:59.450> harvest<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.140> yield

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
yield and it helps him harvest the yield

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.320 
yield and it helps him harvest the yield
faster<00:03:00.950> we're<00:03:01.580> going<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.820> use<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.030> lot<00:03:02.300> less

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
faster we're going to use a lot less

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.760 
faster we're going to use a lot less
fuel<00:03:02.750> because<00:03:03.200> we'll<00:03:03.320> be<00:03:03.350> able<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.560> harvest

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
fuel because we'll be able to harvest

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.810 
fuel because we'll be able to harvest
more<00:03:04.160> tons<00:03:04.459> in<00:03:04.790> less<00:03:05.060> time<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:06.550> then<00:03:07.550> we're

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
more tons in less time so then we're

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.390 
more tons in less time so then we're
using<00:03:08.020> less<00:03:09.020> diesel<00:03:09.770> fuel<00:03:10.040> through<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
using less diesel fuel through the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.979 
using less diesel fuel through the
tractor<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.240> reduces<00:03:11.810> our<00:03:11.930> carbon

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
tractor so that reduces our carbon

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.770 
tractor so that reduces our carbon
footprint

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
footprint

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.260 
footprint
this<00:03:15.380> method<00:03:15.800> of<00:03:15.860> harvesting<00:03:16.400> really<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:17.000> key

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
this method of harvesting really is key

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.910 
this method of harvesting really is key
to<00:03:17.390> sustainability<00:03:18.050> because<00:03:18.470> if<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.709> look

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
to sustainability because if you look

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.190 
to sustainability because if you look
out<00:03:19.069> across<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.520> field<00:03:19.819> there's<00:03:20.780> still<00:03:21.170> a

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
out across this field there's still a

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.920 
out across this field there's still a
lot<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.680> residue<00:03:22.040> out<00:03:22.069> here<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.270> as<00:03:23.480> far<00:03:23.720> as

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
lot of residue out here so as far as

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.340 
lot of residue out here so as far as
wind<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.800> water<00:03:25.010> erosion<00:03:25.250> that's<00:03:26.180> not<00:03:27.140> going

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
wind and water erosion that's not going

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.620 
wind and water erosion that's not going
to<00:03:27.410> be<00:03:27.530> an<00:03:27.620> issue<00:03:27.800> here<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:28.520> we're<00:03:29.480> really

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
to be an issue here so we're really

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.229 
to be an issue here so we're really
particular<00:03:30.380> on<00:03:30.440> how<00:03:30.890> we<00:03:31.370> harvest<00:03:31.819> so<00:03:32.090> that

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
particular on how we harvest so that

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.690 
particular on how we harvest so that
we're<00:03:32.420> not<00:03:32.569> going<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.780> have<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.700> devastating

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
we're not going to have a devastating

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.820 
we're not going to have a devastating
effect<00:03:35.360> on<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> soil<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.380> was<00:03:36.500> really<00:03:36.800> a

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
effect on the soil it was really a

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.590 
effect on the soil it was really a
snowball<00:03:37.580> effect<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.060> whole<00:03:38.270> thing<00:03:38.300> I
