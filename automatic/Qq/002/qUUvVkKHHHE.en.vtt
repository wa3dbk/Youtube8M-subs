00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the map is in my opinion this map isn't

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
the map is in my opinion this map isn't
as<00:01:19.049> good<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.320> Piazza<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.130> decent<00:01:20.670> it's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
as good as Piazza but it's decent it's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.690 
as good as Piazza but it's decent it's
an<00:01:20.970> average<00:01:21.600> map<00:01:21.869> um<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:23.009> has<00:01:23.280> its<00:01:23.490> pros<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
an average map um it has its pros and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.460 
an average map um it has its pros and
cons<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.720> big<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> lot<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
cons it's really big so you get a lot of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.990 
cons it's really big so you get a lot of
time<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> run<00:01:25.979> around<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> problem<00:01:26.909> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
time to run around but the problem is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
time to run around but the problem is
you<00:01:27.180> might<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> hard<00:01:28.020> time<00:01:28.229> finding
