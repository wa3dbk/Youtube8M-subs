00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Well, to this day, Microsoft has 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.250
 made available to the public 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.780
 the latest windows update 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.480
 8.1 for all those people who 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.960
 they currently have either windows 8 or the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.359
 version 8.1 not yet updated you can 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520
 go to windows update or within 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.140
 your control panel to the search section 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.699
 updates because it's already 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.670
 available so that the download is the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 today which includes new 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.969
 functionality and also improvements as 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.430
 to the performance of what is windows 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.350
 let's see what is the newest 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 Well, something of the newest thing that I notice 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.629
 in this new operating system is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.129
 when you come directly to the start or the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.899
 home where you have all your 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 applications here on the top 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.640
 previously nothing else we saw our 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.219
 icon with some functions just like 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 you see it here they just put on this side 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.390
 the possibility that you can sleep 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 turn off your computer or restart the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.129
 from this same section as well as 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.220
 They put a new search within 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.450
 this section this search engine regularly 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.310
 you found it 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.079
 in this other section where you have all 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.750
 your applications here in the part of 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.490
 up but I think that by placing it 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.219
 this good side will allow us 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.869
 access in a much more comfortable way to 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.450
 all those applications that 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.060
 we often use within this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.250
 section I do not see much difference here 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.500
 we already had the possibility of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.719
 raffle the applications by means of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.880
 these options but something that did call me 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.069
 a lot of attention in terms of change is 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 that we previously to do 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.450
 some modification at the beginning with 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.610
 regarding these applications we had 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.590
 that give right button anywhere 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.049
 so that we could open some controls 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.209
 down here and up I do not know if you in 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.770
 this moment you have the version of 8.1 or 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.950
 for those who remember it 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.179
 currently that has already been modified now 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.099
 what you have to do is nothing more 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.110
 give right button to any of the 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.000
 applications and here they will appear 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.880
 your options individually to me 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.929
 point of view this improvement is much more 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.119
 comfortable 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.250
 because you have more ease of 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.259
 control from this point the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.090
 applications that you want 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.700
 first of all you could remove it 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.920
 perhaps of what is this same section or 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.870
 place it in your taskbar this 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.930
 side you can control the size you can 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.600
 put from a tiny size up 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.670
 Other measures as medium 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.730
 you can also place what is the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.160
 wide size and what is the size much 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.410
 bigger all this we could do 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.780
 although otherwise a little 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.760
 different I want to mention you also that 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.280
 from any section including what 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.840
 which is the start or the start or even 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.690
 when you have an open application 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.000
 if you take down from this side you go to 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.300
 to be able to access what is your bar 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.400
 tasks much more conveniently you 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.650
 I repeat you can do it from this same 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.810
 section or even with some application 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.720
 open I want to mention that also 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.900
 They placed on the taskbar icon 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.220
 from the microsoft store where you 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.930
 you can access it in a way 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.160
 much more comfortable 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.110
 I want to mention that also to 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.990
 any of the applications that you 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.580
 you will also access this menu 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.640
 at the top where you can 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.800
 minimize and you can also close the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.840
 application completely now in 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.550
 any application open from the side 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.160
 left also gives you another small 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.230
 menu where you can divide the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.360
 screen with this application already open 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.069
 either to the right or to the left to 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.409
 that you can obviously 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.510
 to any other application in a way 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.269
 easier I repeat to you on this side could 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.400
 close it and return to where you 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.409
 you initially found this 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.659
 functionality of the corner stays 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.670
 exactly as we had it before 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.980
 where you can open some 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.469
 application and in the same way you can 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.810
 drag to maybe have these two 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.030
 applications together you previously had 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.609
 a little hand when you put the mouse here 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.169
 up but right now I'll turn you to 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.599
 mention that they have placed these 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:07.139
 controls so you can close 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.659
 these applications much easier other 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.030
 change that I also notice is that they changed 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.879
 the name of skydrive many of you 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.160
 you know that this service is coming 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.989
 integrated in this version of windows and 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.079
 Well now it does not appear as skydrive 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.610
 but as one drive though one of the 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.590
 folders keep appearing with me 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.930
 same name on this side after the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.250
 update was changed so 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.289
 automatic 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.449
 now if you come to the properties of 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.979
 the taskbar on this side here 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.020
 we will find in this section of 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.190
 touch bar or task bar the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.950
 possibility of doing 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.870
 but to pay for what we can see here in 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.360
 the same taskbar any of 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.740
 the applications that we have open if 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.540
 you were an observer a moment ago 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.570
 when I had several open 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.240
 applications on this side I was shown the 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.100
 possibility to see those icons so that 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.410
 I can obviously open them from a 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.000
 way much easier everything you control 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.010
 on this side if you do not want that 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.500
 happen that way you can turn it off 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.870
 here or leave it on as more 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.390
 agree from here you can also 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.030
 give you right button and you can remove 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.950
 maybe what is this store icon 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.080
 in the case that you do not like it and with 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.480
 any other application open either 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.790
 place it on the taskbar or 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.740
 same way remove it by returning us to 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.420
 the same configurations on this side 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.430
 here in the navigation 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.810
 let's see some options that in 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.670
 they do not really change much 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.940
 it's almost what we had previously 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.160
 but you can place on this side that 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.320
 When you enter your account or close 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.720
 all those applications that go 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.240
 directly to the desk instead of the 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.130
 home or being in this case what 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.670
 I have lit in the same way you can 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.760
 colo 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.190
 to the photograph you have in the background for 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.470
 that appears directly at the start or 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.810
 in the start are still this I'm going to 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.660
 I applied and I come to start looking at what 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.640
 it happens automatically I can see that 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.780
 I had a picture and then it looks a little 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.970
 different than what we were 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.710
 used and well, this is something 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.750
 of the newest in terms of 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.640
 windows 8.1 update I want 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.800
 mention you also stability 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.200
 the operating system was improved in this 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.840
 moment feels much faster 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.370
 compared to the previous version and I hope 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.350
 really that it will work well 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.300
 between the updates I also gave 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.940
 account that there was an update for 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.280
 internet explorer for the most version 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.430
 recent I want to assume that obviously 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.170
 they have taken all the advice of 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.660
 public to do it a little bit more than 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.180
 improvements and then we do not have more than 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.100
 try it tell me what do you think about this new 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.590
 update what do you think 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.930
 do you think microsoft is improving its 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.330
 new system or should ya flat 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.550
 take out version 9 and on the other hand 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.410
 I would also like to ask you if you 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.150
 would like to go there or would you like 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.330
 create a tutorial 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.130
 to use windows 8.1 I would like to know 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.750
 before doing something, leave me your 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.820

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.530
