gas look at that and the minerals there

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
gas look at that and the minerals there
you've<00:00:23.760> got<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.029> other<00:00:24.150> little<00:00:24.330> gap<00:00:24.600> and

you've got that other little gap and
kind<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.920> unbuildable<00:00:26.609> surface<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.150> see

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
kind of this unbuildable surface you see

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.609 
kind of this unbuildable surface you see
a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.510> siege<00:00:27.720> tanks<00:00:28.050> kind<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> gather<00:00:28.470> up

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
a lot of siege tanks kind of gather up

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.370 
a lot of siege tanks kind of gather up
right<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:28.949> she'll<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> secondary

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
right here and she'll the secondary

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.810 
right here and she'll the secondary
unfortunately<00:00:31.380> kind<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> disadvantageous

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
unfortunately kind of a disadvantageous

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.580 
unfortunately kind of a disadvantageous
for<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.149> lot<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.450> Protoss<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> taryn<00:00:34.380> players

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
for a lot of Protoss and taryn players

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
for a lot of Protoss and taryn players
because<00:00:34.860> Zerg<00:00:35.579> players<00:00:35.850> because<00:00:36.059> Earthlings

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
because Zerg players because Earthlings

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.090 
because Zerg players because Earthlings
and<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.870> guess<00:00:37.230> medic<00:00:37.500> Marines<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.890> float

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and I guess medic Marines can float

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
and I guess medic Marines can float
through<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.969> most<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> troops<00:00:39.540> kind

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
through here but most of the troops kind

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.000 
through here but most of the troops kind
of<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.140> rallied<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> general

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of have to be rallied to this general

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.500 
of have to be rallied to this general
area<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.460> before<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.210> move<00:00:42.239> out

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
area up here before they can move out

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.580 
area up here before they can move out
they<00:00:42.629> kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> follow<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> can

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
they kind of have to follow if you can

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.660 
they kind of have to follow if you can
follow<00:00:43.710> my<00:00:43.860> arrow<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> kind<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> troop

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
follow my arrow that kind of troop

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.459 
follow my arrow that kind of troop
movement<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.170> there's<00:00:46.379> an

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
movement so out that way there's an

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
movement so out that way there's an
expansion<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> upper<00:00:47.160> left-hand<00:00:47.370> corner

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
expansion in the upper left-hand corner

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.860 
expansion in the upper left-hand corner
there's<00:00:47.850> expansion<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.480> told<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> clock

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
there's expansion that told the clock

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
there's expansion that told the clock
location<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:50.129> gas<00:00:50.340> kind<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.760> looking<00:00:51.000> over

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
location with gas kind of looking over

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.060 
location with gas kind of looking over
the<00:00:51.360> cliff<00:00:51.570> side<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> main<00:00:52.170> base<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the cliff side of the main base of the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
the cliff side of the main base of the
opposite<00:00:53.430> opponent<00:00:53.820> six<00:00:54.570> o'clock<00:00:54.690> location

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
opposite opponent six o'clock location

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.220 
opposite opponent six o'clock location
kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> gap<00:00:55.829> right<00:00:56.219> across<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> middle

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
kind of a gap right across the middle

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.779 
kind of a gap right across the middle
all<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.469> well<00:00:58.500> also<00:00:59.039> an<00:00:59.129> expansion<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> bottom

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
all is well also an expansion the bottom

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.939 
all is well also an expansion the bottom
right<00:00:59.910> corner<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.390> yeah<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> mineral<00:01:01.649> only

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
right corner and yeah the mineral only

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.319 
right corner and yeah the mineral only
at<00:01:02.070> both<00:01:02.280> locations<00:01:02.460> kind<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.059> mirrored

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
at both locations kind of mirrored

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.140 
at both locations kind of mirrored
across<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.100> covers<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
across so and I think that covers it so

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.039 
across so and I think that covers it so
stall<00:01:06.390> life<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> upper<00:01:06.960> right

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
stall life here in the upper right

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.560 
stall life here in the upper right
corner<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> ace<00:01:07.920> match<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.570> because

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
corner this is the ace match so because

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
corner this is the ace match so because
of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> forfeit<00:01:10.170> basically<00:01:10.590> OD<00:01:10.860> will<00:01:11.100> ended

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
of the forfeit basically OD will ended

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.910 
of the forfeit basically OD will ended
up<00:01:11.460> winning<00:01:11.610> last<00:01:11.729> match<00:01:12.170> g35<00:01:13.170> doing<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
because really I thought the first

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.050 
because really I thought the first
commentary<00:01:20.130> did<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.460> excellent<00:01:20.820> looks<00:01:20.939> like

here as best he can injure let's see if

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.600 
here as best he can injure let's see if
he<00:03:34.810> runs<00:03:34.959> away<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.860> can<00:03:36.100> make<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.340> run<00:03:36.459> away

still that probe still running around
the<00:03:37.989> base<00:03:38.110> I'm<00:03:38.260> surprised<00:03:38.560> by<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.270> evading

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
the base I'm surprised by that evading

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.020 
the base I'm surprised by that evading
that<00:03:40.420> marine<00:03:40.750> fairly<00:03:41.200> well<00:03:41.350> actually<00:03:42.030> another

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
that marine fairly well actually another

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.460 
that marine fairly well actually another
marine<00:03:43.300> being<00:03:43.540> produced<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.140> meantime

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
marine being produced the meantime

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.990 
marine being produced the meantime
machine<00:03:44.739> shop<00:03:44.920> isn't<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.370> going<00:03:45.520> down<00:03:45.790> and

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
machine shop isn't that going down and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.940 
machine shop isn't that going down and
really<00:03:46.510> what<00:03:46.660> this<00:03:46.750> kind<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:47.020> gives<00:03:47.230> the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
really what this kind of gives the

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.100 
really what this kind of gives the
information<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.550> think<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.820> kind<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.000> gives<00:03:49.150> 22

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
information I think it kind of gives 22

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.500 
information I think it kind of gives 22
to<00:03:50.890> stall<00:03:51.280> life<00:03:51.430> meantime<00:03:51.820> as<00:03:51.940> is<00:03:52.090> yeah<00:03:52.239> I<00:03:52.270> see

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
to stall life meantime as is yeah I see

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.729 
to stall life meantime as is yeah I see
that<00:03:52.660> machine<00:03:52.900> shop<00:03:53.110> coming<00:03:53.350> down<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.650> don't

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
that machine shop coming down and don't

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.440 
that machine shop coming down and don't
see<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:53.980> second<00:03:54.340> factory<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.209> i<00:03:55.239> can<00:03:55.420> assume

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
see a second factory so i can assume

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.150 
see a second factory so i can assume
that<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.930> second<00:03:56.290> expansion<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.770> going<00:03:56.980> down

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
that that second expansion is going down

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.920 
that that second expansion is going down
so<00:03:57.640> we'll<00:03:57.730> see<00:03:57.850> how<00:03:57.970> he<00:03:58.000> reacts<00:03:58.510> he's<00:03:58.690> going<00:03:58.870> to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
so we'll see how he reacts he's going to

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.420 
so we'll see how he reacts he's going to
set<00:03:59.050> he<00:03:59.200> managed<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.709> kill<00:03:59.830> that<00:03:59.950> probe<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.370> the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
set he managed to kill that probe in the

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.220 
set he managed to kill that probe in the
meantime<00:04:00.630> putting<00:04:01.630> down<00:04:01.720> robotics<00:04:02.140> facility

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
meantime putting down robotics facility

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.979 
meantime putting down robotics facility
so<00:04:02.650> going<00:04:02.860> very<00:04:03.040> fast<00:04:03.310> tech<00:04:03.670> in<00:04:04.390> response<00:04:04.840> to

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
so going very fast tech in response to

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.330 
so going very fast tech in response to
that<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.709> could<00:04:05.860> be<00:04:05.890> very<00:04:06.130> effective

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
that and that could be very effective

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.440 
that and that could be very effective
because<00:04:06.580> there's<00:04:06.790> not<00:04:06.880> going<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.060> be<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.209> lot<00:04:07.420> of

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
because there's not going to be a lot of

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.630 
because there's not going to be a lot of
troops<00:04:07.720> out<00:04:07.920> with<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.070> fast<00:04:09.280> expansion

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
troops out with that fast expansion

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.890 
troops out with that fast expansion
really<00:04:09.940> defend<00:04:10.180> against<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.480> tank<00:04:10.720> being

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
really defend against the tank being

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.020 
really defend against the tank being
produced<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:11.650> basically<00:04:11.920> if<00:04:12.760> he<00:04:12.880> goes

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
produced so basically if he goes

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.220 
produced so basically if he goes
immediately<00:04:13.239> turn<00:04:13.630> into<00:04:13.750> robotics<00:04:13.989> facility

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
immediately turn into robotics facility

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.449 
immediately turn into robotics facility
he<00:04:14.650> could<00:04:14.769> be<00:04:14.859> this<00:04:15.100> could<00:04:15.160> be<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.400> very

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
he could be this could be a very

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.920 
he could be this could be a very
effective<00:04:15.700> drop<00:04:16.090> because<00:04:16.299> right<00:04:16.690> as<00:04:16.810> that

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
effective drop because right as that

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.270 
effective drop because right as that
secondary<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:17.410> going<00:04:17.620> down

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
secondary is going down

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.539 
secondary is going down
with<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.480> don't<00:04:19.750> know<00:04:19.810> Weaver<00:04:20.139> so<00:04:20.320> anyway<00:04:21.010> my

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
with I don't know Weaver so anyway my

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.430 
with I don't know Weaver so anyway my
guess<00:04:21.700> is<00:04:21.880> just<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.330> timing<00:04:22.570> of<00:04:22.750> this<00:04:22.900> he'll

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
guess is just the timing of this he'll

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.660 
guess is just the timing of this he'll
be<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.590> little<00:04:23.770> bit<00:04:23.950> ahead<00:04:24.040> as<00:04:24.310> far<00:04:24.340> as<00:04:24.580> the

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
be a little bit ahead as far as the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.250 
be a little bit ahead as far as the
engineering<00:04:25.030> base<00:04:25.180> because<00:04:25.450> it's<00:04:25.780> just<00:04:25.870> you

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
engineering base because it's just you

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.020 
engineering base because it's just you
know<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.410> little<00:04:26.560> bit<00:04:26.710> faster<00:04:27.100> than<00:04:27.130> usual<00:04:27.340> in

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
know a little bit faster than usual in

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.120 
know a little bit faster than usual in
my<00:04:28.210> opinion<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:28.990> stall<00:04:29.200> life<00:04:29.350> getting<00:04:30.010> their

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
my opinion so stall life getting their

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.200 
my opinion so stall life getting their
range<00:04:30.280> upgrade<00:04:30.580> only<00:04:30.760> producing<00:04:31.120> two

dragoons and being very aggressive
pushing<00:04:33.070> down<00:04:33.190> those<00:04:33.400> two<00:04:33.550> dragoons<00:04:33.790> command

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
pushing down those two dragoons command

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.610 
pushing down those two dragoons command

tech is actually quite a bit quite a

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.670 
tech is actually quite a bit quite a
ways<00:05:05.890> off<00:05:05.919> actually<00:05:07.410> surprisingly<00:05:08.410> and<00:05:08.590> it

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
ways off actually surprisingly and it

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.650 
ways off actually surprisingly and it
looks<00:05:08.800> like<00:05:08.919> those<00:05:09.100> zealot<00:05:09.790> those<00:05:10.300> dragons

a lot of harassment their engineering
been<00:05:51.430> going<00:05:51.700> down<00:05:51.850> in<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.000> meantime<00:05:52.150> but<00:05:52.450> i

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
been going down in the meantime but i

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.600 
been going down in the meantime but i
think<00:05:52.780> it<00:05:53.650> looks<00:05:53.860> like<00:05:53.979> yeah<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.280> dropship

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
think it looks like yeah the dropship

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.010 
think it looks like yeah the dropship
already<00:05:54.940> being<00:05:55.060> produced<00:05:55.390> will<00:05:55.690> see<00:05:55.810> and

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
already being produced will see and

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.540 
already being produced will see and
actually<00:05:56.350> went<00:05:56.530> forth<00:05:56.710> an<00:05:56.830> observatory<00:05:57.220> and

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
actually went forth an observatory and

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.279 
actually went forth an observatory and
said<00:05:57.669> the<00:05:57.729> robotics<00:05:58.120> was<00:05:58.270> support<00:05:58.900> bay<00:05:59.020> first

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
said the robotics was support bay first

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.950 
said the robotics was support bay first
i'm<00:05:59.650> surprised<00:06:00.250> by<00:06:00.400> that<00:06:00.580> i<00:06:00.820> think<00:06:01.600> if<00:06:01.690> he<00:06:01.810> went

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
i'm surprised by that i think if he went

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.740 
i'm surprised by that i think if he went
that<00:06:02.080> robots<00:06:02.400> support<00:06:03.400> bay<00:06:03.520> first<00:06:03.760> we<00:06:04.000> this

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
that robots support bay first we this

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.490 
that robots support bay first we this
drop<00:06:04.990> would<00:06:05.110> have<00:06:05.200> been<00:06:05.289> a<00:06:05.320> lot<00:06:05.440> more

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
drop would have been a lot more

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.890 
drop would have been a lot more
effective<00:06:05.979> but<00:06:06.180> instead<00:06:07.180> it<00:06:07.450> looks<00:06:07.630> like<00:06:07.750> he's

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
effective but instead it looks like he's

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.090 
effective but instead it looks like he's
still<00:06:08.050> got<00:06:08.200> those<00:06:08.289> true<00:06:08.500> vegan<00:06:08.710> and<00:06:08.830> still<00:06:08.979> has

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
still got those true vegan and still has

still got those true vegan and still has
that<00:06:09.220> cell<00:06:09.400> looks<00:06:09.550> like<00:06:09.640> it's<00:06:09.760> going<00:06:09.850> to<00:06:09.940> block

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
that cell looks like it's going to block

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.020 
that cell looks like it's going to block
off<00:06:10.240> the<00:06:10.360> ramp<00:06:11.100> only<00:06:12.100> it<00:06:12.310> looks<00:06:12.789> like<00:06:12.910> he's

I'm<00:06:30.280> going<00:06:30.400> to<00:06:30.460> find<00:06:30.699> that<00:06:30.759> zealot<00:06:31.150> they're

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300
