00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 to this video indicates today I show 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.500
 you the shaders of the gtx 370 run 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.500
 after the intro you will 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.930
 so I have a chat 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:34.320
 stiletto though the sv 10 ultra stock exchange 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:39.360
 best this format gives and I dazzle 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.650
 congratulates ps i live will be 60 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.590
 actually supplies pens 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.910
 not more than 60 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.670
 or because that's how it looks 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.500
 very fluid the water looks nice 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.280
 and you also have those clouds there 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:01.320
 argument there is something wrong that must 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.460
 of course from where is that so now 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.199
 we have no clouds and now they are 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 those clouds in front of the shader 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.070
 practically themselves come to move 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 also looks and I do not want 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.720
 talk it runs smoothly one sees is 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.180
 it comes back sorry I have now 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.280
 Real camp just tried on the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.130
 I have 90 fps so it's really perfect 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.240
 actually the one disadvantage of this map 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.570
 I wanted to still play the rudow shader 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.310
 the but if you look at the now everyone 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.620
 Look at this small picture maybe the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.450
 her the idea for which extra for the 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.670
 then lack theaters portrayed that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 but there too I found and kicked 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.930
 clean draws the water from the preview 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.360
 the preview is that I do not as 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.930
 motto the preview the ultra motion blur 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.840
 1 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 and then you have that error me that 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.540
 even they thought that meant 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.620
 practically always only a few 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.020
 words scheder 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.590
 also, of course, but again 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 find the stop because but I like these 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.580
 breads like it 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.260
 that's why i do not care yeah i want 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.450
 give you a few impressions 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.989
 the shader and then to the next 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.989
 Video
