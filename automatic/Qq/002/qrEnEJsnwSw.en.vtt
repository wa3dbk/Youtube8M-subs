00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.030
 an example of solving a problem with complex 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.540
 numbers on the site control rabota.ru 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.990
 consider some examples first 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.400
 consider examples of finding a forum 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.789
 complex numbers then consider 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.560
 in detail the solution of the problem of division 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.189
 complex numbers 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 u simple examples with multiplication by addition 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.309
 something not them complex numbers we 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.350
 erection of finding roots 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.969
 we will also look at the geometric 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.969
 interpretation of a complex number 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.140
 First, consider simple examples. 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.510
 finding trigonometric and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.700
 exponential form of a complex number 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.789
 consider a simple complex example 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.750
 unit where we look 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.350
 trigonometric exponential form 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.350
 complex number 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.229
 prague metric form this number is 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.170
 cos pi for 2 plus 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.540
 and multiplied by sine pi by 2 and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.689
 exponential form of a complex number 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.140
 this is an exhibitor of cinema 2 is it possible more 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.140
 complex example 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.010
 wasp 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.660
 trigonometric form of the competition interferes 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.660
 then the shape and leg is painted as 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:40.000
 are integers such forms can also be 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.010
 see what you can find the module 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.470
 complex number and argument now 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.760
 Consider the delayed pressure example. 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:58.530
 complex hours of foot look at such 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:05.729
 -2 can and do not like to marry or bottom 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:09.369
 street plus 3 million in three cars and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:17.790
 fake such a computer with seconds 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:22.469
 him numbers ermakom calculate 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.620
 consultant here painted from 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:28.519
 complex number and written as 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.519
 produced captivity 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:41.040
 he is learning and getting a flower is also possible 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:47.959
 see and complex conjugate number 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:51.510
 for the result can be multiplied 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.750
 complex numbers using this 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.750
 calculator 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:03.049
 how can I get a folding leg number 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.550
 to read 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:27.569
 but even more complex photo examples 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.569
 raise for example those seven 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:49.140
 top again you can narrow root horse can 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.140
 write as or a and grief 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.110
 similarly you can cube root of 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:08.230
 what the walls mean and blows the court 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:13.690
 inside and so forth the fifth root 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:17.019
 degrees along a given path here we are 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:22.500
 Consider the Diet Coke Complex 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.500
 of our example of such a complex number 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.789
 this is essentially a point with coordinates 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.240
 by y3 that is this is the imaginary part 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:42.569
 complex face number 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.210
 Cinnamon is a complex discipline. 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.210
 numbers all thanks for attention
