00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
and then inventing his Polish victory

lap

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.260 

it<00:02:30.290> was<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.710> me<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.860> ultimate<00:02:31.580> championship

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
it was to me that ultimate championship

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.270 
it was to me that ultimate championship
of<00:02:32.930> all<00:02:33.140> time<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.400> day<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.120> many

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
of all time is just a day of so many

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.710 
of all time is just a day of so many
entangled<00:02:37.280> storylines<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.390> guess<00:02:38.569> that's

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
entangled storylines and I guess that's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.120 
entangled storylines and I guess that's
what<00:02:38.959> makes<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.319> one<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.590> greatest<00:02:39.830> days

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
what makes it one of the greatest days

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.850 
what makes it one of the greatest days
ever<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.670> NASCAR
