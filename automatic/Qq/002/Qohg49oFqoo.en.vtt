00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
actually sprout them first but one thing

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.929 
actually sprout them first but one thing
is<00:00:21.090> they<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:21.869> produce<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.789> potato<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
is they do actually produce a potato a

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
is they do actually produce a potato a
little<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.269> quicker<00:00:24.510> if<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.619> cheat

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
little bit quicker if you if you cheat

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
little bit quicker if you if you cheat
them<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.789> another<00:00:26.970> thing<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.539> get

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
them but another thing is if you get

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.939 
them but another thing is if you get
your<00:00:27.720> seed<00:00:27.900> potatoes<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.769> at<00:00:28.859> this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
your seed potatoes like I do at this

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
your seed potatoes like I do at this
time<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.279> year<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:30.119> you're<00:00:30.269> only<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> be

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
time of year and you're only going to be

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
time of year and you're only going to be
planting<00:00:30.960> them<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.410> say<00:00:31.859> August<00:00:32.130> not

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
planting them out in say August not

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.389 
planting them out in say August not
August<00:00:32.880> April<00:00:33.480> time<00:00:33.950> then<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> only

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
August April time then it's the only

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.680 
August April time then it's the only
it's<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.700> good<00:00:35.850> way<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> preserving<00:00:36.390> them

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
it's a good way of preserving them

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.209 
it's a good way of preserving them
really<00:00:36.989> because<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.890> were<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> leave

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
really because if you were to leave

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.670 
really because if you were to leave
these<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> bag<00:00:39.180> somewhere<00:00:39.540> dark<00:00:39.870> come

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
these in the bag somewhere dark come

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770 
these in the bag somewhere dark come
April<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.250> there<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.579> big<00:00:41.850> long<00:00:42.270> spindly

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
April time there are big long spindly

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.389 
April time there are big long spindly
shoes<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.710> they'd<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.920> searching<00:00:44.280> for

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
shoes because they'd be searching for

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.310 
shoes because they'd be searching for
the<00:00:44.460> light<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> sprout<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:46.170> are

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the light with the sprout which are

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.170 
the light with the sprout which are
absolutely<00:00:46.649> no<00:00:46.860> use<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.399> too<00:00:47.579> brittle<00:00:47.879> even

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
absolutely no use the too brittle even

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.100 
absolutely no use the too brittle even
knocking<00:00:48.360> them<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> potato

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
knocking them off and the potato

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.510 
knocking them off and the potato
wouldn't<00:00:49.379> grow<00:00:49.500> properly<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.129> apart<00:00:50.399> from

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
wouldn't grow properly so apart from

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.010 
wouldn't grow properly so apart from
getting<00:00:50.640> them<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.180> bit<00:00:51.329> quicker<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.899> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
getting them going a bit quicker it's a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.380 
getting them going a bit quicker it's a
way<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.399> preserving<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> potato<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.270> this

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
way of preserving the potato at this

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.930 
way of preserving the potato at this
time<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.750> year

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
time of year

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.599 
time of year
so<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.090> I'll<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.190> use<00:00:59.399> things

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
so what I'll do is you can use things

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.099 
so what I'll do is you can use things
like<00:00:59.820> egg<00:00:59.969> boxes<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.510> don't<00:01:00.690> buy<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> like

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
end that the potato is attached to the
plant<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.720> sometimes<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
plant you can just sometimes see a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.280 
plant you can just sometimes see a
little<00:01:25.680> tiny<00:01:25.950> scar<00:01:26.600> where<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> potato<00:01:28.049> was

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
little tiny scar where the potato was

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
little tiny scar where the potato was
growing<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.280> parent<00:01:29.670> plant<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
growing off the parent plant and that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
growing off the parent plant and that
usually<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.869> other<00:01:31.020> end<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.470> always

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
usually the other end would not always

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.830 
usually the other end would not always
is<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> eyes<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.720> you

in the dark the tubers will sprouts will

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.660 
in the dark the tubers will sprouts will
just<00:02:53.390> start<00:02:53.720> searching<00:02:54.200> for<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.410> light<00:02:54.670> like

you're out you're aiming for basically
sprouts<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.040> be<00:03:04.190> about<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.760> would<00:03:05.090> say<00:03:05.560> half<00:03:06.560> an

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
sprouts to be about I would say half an

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.590 
sprouts to be about I would say half an
inch<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.220> three<00:03:07.730> quarters<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:08.090> an<00:03:08.180> inch<00:03:08.269> and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
inch to three quarters of an inch and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.390 
inch to three quarters of an inch and
they'll<00:03:08.690> be<00:03:08.750> dark<00:03:09.049> green<00:03:09.470> shoots<00:03:09.890> none<00:03:10.280> of

they'll be dark green shoots none of

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.690 
they'll be dark green shoots none of
this<00:03:10.540> like<00:03:11.540> see-through<00:03:12.470> white<00:03:12.769> spindly<00:03:13.519> ones

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
this like see-through white spindly ones

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.009 
this like see-through white spindly ones
that's<00:03:13.940> what<00:03:14.060> you're<00:03:14.180> aiming<00:03:14.209> for<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.870> then

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
that's what you're aiming for and then

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.900 
that's what you're aiming for and then
they'll<00:03:15.140> be<00:03:15.200> ready<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.440> plant<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.220> lot<00:03:16.850> of

they'll be ready to plant in a lot of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.470 
they'll be ready to plant in a lot of
April<00:03:17.239> time<00:03:17.420> onwards<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.060> couldn't<00:03:20.359> be

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
April time onwards so I couldn't be

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.270 
April time onwards so I couldn't be
easier<00:03:20.810> Leigh<00:03:21.170> but<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:21.560> just<00:03:21.799> you<00:03:22.070> know<00:03:22.160> he's

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
easier Leigh but it's just you know he's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.160 
easier Leigh but it's just you know he's
got<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.489> do<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:23.180> see<00:03:23.209> poke<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.810> time<00:03:24.049> in

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
got to do it you see poke this time in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.920 
got to do it you see poke this time in
here<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:25.910> another<00:03:26.060> variety<00:03:26.239> I'm<00:03:26.690> trying

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
here this is another variety I'm trying

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.220 
here this is another variety I'm trying
for<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.109> first<00:03:27.140> time<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:27.890> told<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.489> Mia<00:03:29.269> if<00:03:30.109> you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
for the first time is told a Mia if you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.660 
for the first time is told a Mia if you
can<00:03:30.320> see<00:03:30.470> these<00:03:30.650> have<00:03:30.769> actually<00:03:30.859> started<00:03:31.340> to

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
can see these have actually started to

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.220 
can see these have actually started to
sprout<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.510> these<00:03:32.630> must<00:03:32.870> have<00:03:32.930> been<00:03:33.019> in<00:03:33.140> the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
sprout so these must have been in the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.610 
sprout so these must have been in the
dark<00:03:33.410> in<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.739> warmth<00:03:34.070> in<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.549> garden<00:03:34.970> center

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
that's how we do it that's why I do it

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.070 
that's how we do it that's why I do it
and<00:06:58.310> that's<00:06:58.940> how<00:06:59.000> easy<00:06:59.240> it<00:06:59.360> is<00:06:59.389> to<00:06:59.540> do<00:06:59.690> so<00:06:59.930> these

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
and that's how easy it is to do so these

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.450 
and that's how easy it is to do so these
are<00:07:00.229> like<00:07:00.350> I<00:07:00.410> said<00:07:00.620> it'll<00:07:00.800> go<00:07:00.950> into<00:07:01.070> the<00:07:01.160> porch

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
are like I said it'll go into the porch

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.129 
are like I said it'll go into the porch
on<00:07:01.669> the<00:07:01.700> windowsill<00:07:02.180> where<00:07:02.450> it's<00:07:02.570> cool<00:07:02.840> but

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:03.139 
on the windowsill where it's cool but

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:05.320 
on the windowsill where it's cool but
not<00:07:03.260> never<00:07:04.040> get<00:07:04.190> to<00:07:04.280> frost<00:07:04.580> and<00:07:04.880> it's<00:07:05.060> bright

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
not never get to frost and it's bright

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330 
not never get to frost and it's bright
so<00:07:05.690> the<00:07:05.810> ship<00:07:06.080> of<00:07:06.229> sprouts<00:07:06.560> should<00:07:06.889> be<00:07:07.010> really

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
so the ship of sprouts should be really

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.040 
so the ship of sprouts should be really
stumpy<00:07:07.790> and<00:07:07.970> dark<00:07:08.180> green<00:07:08.419> and<00:07:08.660> the<00:07:08.750> perfect

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
stumpy and dark green and the perfect

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.520 
stumpy and dark green and the perfect
planting<00:07:10.060> come<00:07:11.060> April<00:07:11.210> time<00:07:11.600> so<00:07:12.260> that's<00:07:12.410> about

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
planting come April time so that's about

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.640 
planting come April time so that's about
it<00:07:12.650> folks<00:07:12.950> chicken<00:07:13.789> potatoes<00:07:14.240> again<00:07:14.590> it's<00:07:15.590> a

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
it folks chicken potatoes again it's a

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.950 
it folks chicken potatoes again it's a
deal<00:07:15.770> later
