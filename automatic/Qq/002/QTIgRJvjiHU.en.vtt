00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.260 
alright guys so we're just working our

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.720 
alright guys so we're just working our
way<00:00:07.290> around<00:00:07.410> hanging<00:00:07.860> the<00:00:08.040> balusters<00:00:08.520> right

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
way around hanging the balusters right

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.570 
way around hanging the balusters right
now<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.030> i<00:00:09.090> want<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.240> show<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:09.570> i<00:00:09.600> do<00:00:09.750> that

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
now and i want to show you how i do that

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.800 
now and i want to show you how i do that
first<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.700> all<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.850> need<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.060> make<00:00:12.180> the<00:00:12.660> proper

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:12.810 
first of all you need to make the proper

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.060 
first of all you need to make the proper
measurements<00:00:13.440> some<00:00:14.430> people<00:00:14.690> use<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:16.040> piece<00:00:17.040> of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
measurements some people use a piece of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519 
measurements some people use a piece of
2x4<00:00:17.720> so<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.810> gives<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> three<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> half

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
2x4 so it gives you a three and a half

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.790 
2x4 so it gives you a three and a half
inch<00:00:19.770> gap<00:00:20.040> and<00:00:20.570> while<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.810> may<00:00:22.230> work<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.680> this

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
inch gap and while that may work in this

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.330 
inch gap and while that may work in this
instance<00:00:23.270> calculating<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.419> edges<00:00:25.160> okay<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
instance calculating the edges okay and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.620 
instance calculating the edges okay and
how<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.669> works<00:00:26.970> out

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
how that works out

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.290 
how that works out
you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.989> do<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.230> math<00:00:28.410> longhand<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:30.149> can

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
you can do the math longhand or you can

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.569 
you can do the math longhand or you can
use<00:00:30.509> a<00:00:30.779> link<00:00:31.710> I'll<00:00:31.860> put<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.430> description

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
use a link I'll put in the description

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.670 
use a link I'll put in the description
below<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:34.790> it's<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.780> nice<00:00:36.989> calculator

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
below but it's a really nice calculator

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.099 
below but it's a really nice calculator
that<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.280> input<00:00:38.460> your<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:39.449> spindle<00:00:39.930> or

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
that you input your your spindle or

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.529 
that you input your your spindle or
balusters<00:00:42.769> diameter<00:00:44.359> and/or

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
balusters diameter and/or

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.919 
balusters diameter and/or
width<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.730> then<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.879> give<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.059> your<00:00:48.329> full<00:00:48.390> run

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
width and then you give it your full run

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.209 
width and then you give it your full run
and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.589> space<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.920> want<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.129> between

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and then the space you want in between

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
and then the space you want in between
it<00:00:50.579> does<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> calculation<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.050> graph<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it does a calculation and a graph and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110 
it does a calculation and a graph and
shows<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> should<00:00:53.550> look<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.730> where

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
shows you what it should look like where

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
shows you what it should look like where
your<00:00:54.210> first<00:00:54.359> one<00:00:54.600> goes<00:00:54.839> on<00:00:55.050> Center<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.589> then

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
your first one goes on Center and then

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.759 
your first one goes on Center and then
the<00:00:56.879> spacing<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:58.019> Center<00:00:58.679> between<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.690> I

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
the spacing on Center between them and I

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.280 
the spacing on Center between them and I
went<00:01:01.769> ahead<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.429> ran<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.210> calculation<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
went ahead and ran that calculation just

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.030 
went ahead and ran that calculation just
so<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.159> put<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> notch<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.680> okay<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> notch

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
so you see I put a notch in okay I notch

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.030 
so you see I put a notch in okay I notch
the<00:01:08.310> post<00:01:08.550> in<00:01:09.470> diagonally<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.620> it<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:10.800> shed

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the post in diagonally so it will shed

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
the post in diagonally so it will shed
water<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.390> if<00:01:12.480> any<00:01:12.630> water<00:01:12.780> gets<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.320> here

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
water so if any water gets down in here

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
water so if any water gets down in here
it'll<00:01:13.620> shed<00:01:13.860> I'll<00:01:14.700> seal<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.210> real<00:01:15.510> good

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it'll shed I'll seal that up real good

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
it'll shed I'll seal that up real good
and<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.980> sits<00:01:17.160> flush<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.760> front<00:01:18.030> here

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and then it sits flush on the front here

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.730 
and then it sits flush on the front here
so<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.480> can<00:01:18.660> put<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:18.900> bolt<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.380> front<00:01:19.620> if<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
so we can put a bolt on the front if you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
so we can put a bolt on the front if you
want<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:21.060> than<00:01:21.150> likely<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:21.510> a<00:01:21.570> lock<00:01:21.750> on

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
want to a more than likely put a lock on

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.540 
want to a more than likely put a lock on
the<00:01:21.930> outside<00:01:22.050> versus<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> inside<00:01:23.160> just<00:01:23.190> for

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
the outside versus the inside just for

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.510 
the outside versus the inside just for
ease<00:01:23.730> of<00:01:23.760> unlocking<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.130> locks<00:01:26.340> behind

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
ease of unlocking so that locks behind

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.640 
ease of unlocking so that locks behind
you

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
you

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.560 
you
okay<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.890> working<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.490> well<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.390> see

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
okay that's working really well you see

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.670 
okay that's working really well you see
I've<00:01:30.660> got<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.840> measurements<00:01:31.080> down<00:01:31.440> here

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
I've got all my measurements down here

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.490 
I've got all my measurements down here
on<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.860> scrap<00:01:32.160> box<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:35.390> yeah<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.780> anyways<00:01:37.320> when

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
on a scrap box and yeah so anyways when

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.150 
on a scrap box and yeah so anyways when
you<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> hang<00:01:37.890> your<00:01:38.010> balusters<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
you go to hang your balusters I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.040 
you go to hang your balusters I
obviously<00:01:41.160> cut<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.460> my<00:01:41.490> ends<00:01:41.850> first<00:01:42.060> okay<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
obviously cut all my ends first okay and

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.900 
obviously cut all my ends first okay and
then<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.740> came<00:01:43.800> back<00:01:43.950> through<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.400> sanded<00:01:44.820> them

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
then I came back through and sanded them

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.300 
then I came back through and sanded them
and<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.690> obviously<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.440> pre-drilled<00:01:47.040> them<00:01:47.190> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and then obviously I pre-drilled them so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.980 
and then obviously I pre-drilled them so
I<00:01:47.370> came<00:01:47.430> back<00:01:47.700> through<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.150> pre<00:01:48.450> screw<00:01:48.810> them

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
I came back through and pre screw them

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.140 
I came back through and pre screw them
as<00:01:49.140> well<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.220> when<00:01:50.370> I<00:01:50.400> go<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.550> hang<00:01:50.820> these<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
as well so now when I go to hang these I

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.230 
as well so now when I go to hang these I
can<00:01:51.300> hang<00:01:51.480> up<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> outside<00:01:53.240> hanging

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
can hang up from the outside hanging

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.940 
can hang up from the outside hanging
down<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.660> all<00:01:54.960> I'm<00:01:55.020> worried<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.260> is<00:01:55.440> my<00:01:55.710> top

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
down and all I'm worried about is my top

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.650 
down and all I'm worried about is my top
measures<00:01:56.370> so<00:01:57.120> you<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> got<00:01:57.570> my

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
measures so you see I got my

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.350 
measures so you see I got my

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
one string so I'll do this string here

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.180 
one string so I'll do this string here
as<00:02:09.330> well<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.410> we'll<00:02:10.560> come<00:02:10.739> back<00:02:10.920> through

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
those plumb and then as their plumb I'll

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.920 
those plumb and then as their plumb I'll
screw<00:02:24.210> in<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.390> bottom<00:02:24.510> screw<00:02:25.220> real<00:02:26.220> easy<00:02:26.430> and
