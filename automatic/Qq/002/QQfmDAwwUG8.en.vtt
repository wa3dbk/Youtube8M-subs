anyway not to stroke myself that's not

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.819 
anyway not to stroke myself that's not
the<00:01:28.130> point<00:01:28.310> this<00:01:28.759> thing<00:01:28.969> is<00:01:29.060> decently<00:01:29.509> fast

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
the point this thing is decently fast

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.709 
the point this thing is decently fast
but<00:01:30.829> speed<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:31.250> not<00:01:31.490> really<00:01:32.000> why<00:01:32.149> I<00:01:32.180> recommend

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
but speed is not really why I recommend

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.420 
but speed is not really why I recommend
it<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.840> beginners<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.439> holds<00:01:33.859> a<00:01:34.009> decent<00:01:34.369> amount

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
it to beginners it holds a decent amount

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.420 
it to beginners it holds a decent amount
of<00:01:34.609> angle<00:01:34.909> without<00:01:35.000> spinning<00:01:35.710> it's<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:37.009> you

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
of angle without spinning it's it you

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.060 
of angle without spinning it's it you
don't<00:01:37.700> need<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.909> set<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.329> up<00:01:38.420> at<00:01:38.570> all<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.950> know

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
don't need to set it up at all you know

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.440 
don't need to set it up at all you know
some<00:01:40.340> cars<00:01:40.549> kind<00:01:40.789> of<00:01:40.850> need<00:01:40.939> some<00:01:41.090> tweaking<00:01:41.270> and

I like this car is it's so versatile and

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.410 
I like this car is it's so versatile and
it's<00:02:23.859> such<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> good<00:02:24.219> platform<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:25.030> get<00:02:25.269> you

it's such a good platform to get you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.140 
it's such a good platform to get you
people<00:02:25.450> into<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.170> game<00:02:26.319> started<00:02:26.939> it's<00:02:27.939> very

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
people into the game started it's very

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.240 
people into the game started it's very
light<00:02:28.480> unlike<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:28.959> 240<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.799> lighter<00:02:30.159> it's

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
light unlike the 240 it's lighter it's

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.569 
light unlike the 240 it's lighter it's
book<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.849> think<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.390> 220<00:02:32.109> on<00:02:33.010> race<00:02:33.340> weight

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
book I think this is 220 on race weight

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.089 
book I think this is 220 on race weight
and<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:34.420> think<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:34.750> 240<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.349> more<00:02:35.560> close<00:02:36.069> to

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
and I think the 240 is more close to

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.940 
and I think the 240 is more close to
2,500<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:36.939> it's<00:02:37.060> much<00:02:37.269> lighter<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.439> so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
2,500 so it's much lighter and it's so

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.420 
2,500 so it's much lighter and it's so
stable<00:02:39.310> like<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:39.870> unbelievably<00:02:40.870> stable

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
stable like it's unbelievably stable

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.759 
stable like it's unbelievably stable
there's<00:02:42.430> never<00:02:42.969> it's<00:02:43.510> never<00:02:43.719> twitchy<00:02:44.260> it's

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
there's never it's never twitchy it's

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.910 
there's never it's never twitchy it's
never<00:02:45.629> feel<00:02:46.629> it<00:02:46.840> never<00:02:47.019> feels<00:02:47.200> uncomfortable

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
never feel it never feels uncomfortable

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.440 
never feel it never feels uncomfortable
on<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.700> whole<00:02:48.819> reason<00:02:49.030> I'm<00:02:49.120> running<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.359> race

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
on the whole reason I'm running the race

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.429 
on the whole reason I'm running the race
and<00:02:49.599> lots<00:02:49.750> because<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.019> was<00:02:50.109> racing<00:02:50.230> at

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
and lots because I was racing at

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.039 
and lots because I was racing at
Nurburgring<00:02:50.889> earlier<00:02:51.159> I<00:02:52.060> don't<00:02:52.930> remember

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
Nurburgring earlier I don't remember

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.629 
Nurburgring earlier I don't remember
when<00:02:53.379> I<00:02:53.409> was<00:02:53.709> racing<00:02:53.859> at<00:02:54.040> Nurburgring<00:02:54.459> but

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
when I was racing at Nurburgring but

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.920 
when I was racing at Nurburgring but
that's<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.939> only<00:02:55.090> reason<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.329> run<00:02:55.480> racing<00:02:55.780> live

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
that's the only reason I run racing live

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.420 
that's the only reason I run racing live
so<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.379> don't<00:02:56.590> kill<00:02:56.769> myself<00:02:57.510> um<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:59.560> it's<00:02:59.739> just

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
so I don't kill myself um but it's just

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.839 
so I don't kill myself um but it's just
honestly<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.150> most<00:03:01.530> okay<00:03:02.530> if<00:03:02.709> cars<00:03:03.340> drift

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
honestly the most okay if cars drift

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.970
