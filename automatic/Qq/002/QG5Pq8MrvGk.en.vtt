00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.859 
come a point where there's a moment of
truth<00:00:26.310> where<00:00:26.609> you're<00:00:26.760> sparring<00:00:27.119> guys<00:00:27.449> who

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
truth where you're sparring guys who

you out but they're trying to beat me
like<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> flight<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.250> other<00:00:32.340> words<00:00:32.579> you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
like it's a flight so in other words you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
like it's a flight so in other words you
will<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.780> flight<00:00:34.140> sparring<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.550> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
will have to have flight sparring but in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.729 
will have to have flight sparring but in
the<00:00:35.910> beginning<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.540> get<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:36.960> season<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> get

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the beginning to get some season to get

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.380 
the beginning to get some season to get
them<00:00:37.920> used<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.250> seeing<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> punches<00:00:39.030> come<00:00:39.270> in

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
them used to seeing the punches come in

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
them used to seeing the punches come in
without<00:00:39.510> really<00:00:39.840> teeing<00:00:40.200> off<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.620> them

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
without really teeing off on them

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.240 
without really teeing off on them
I<00:00:41.460> believe<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.300> developmental<00:00:42.870> spine<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:44.010> sort

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
I believe in developmental spine to sort

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.580 
I believe in developmental spine to sort
of<00:00:44.309> fix<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> openings<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> tighten<00:00:46.530> up

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
of fix all the openings and tighten up

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.209 
of fix all the openings and tighten up
their<00:00:46.739> game<00:00:47.180> just<00:00:48.180> before<00:00:48.890> they<00:00:49.890> would<00:00:50.039> really

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
their game just before they would really

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.060 
their game just before they would really
get<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.510> make<00:00:51.660> no<00:00:51.750> mistake<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.890> you're

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
