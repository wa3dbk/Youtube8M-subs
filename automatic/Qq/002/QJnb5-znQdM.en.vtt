we're<00:00:06.660> looking<00:00:06.930> at<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.109> temporary<00:00:07.440> steel

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
we're looking at the temporary steel

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.790 
we're looking at the temporary steel
supports<00:00:08.429> erected<00:00:09.389> out<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> bay<00:00:10.170> which

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
supports erected out in the bay which

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.680 
supports erected out in the bay which
are<00:00:10.950> an<00:00:11.070> essential<00:00:11.370> part<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.910> building<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
are an essential part of building the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
self anchored suspension bridge what

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.170 
self anchored suspension bridge what
we're<00:00:19.590> really<00:00:19.710> doing<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.460> building<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
we're really doing here is building a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.450 
we're really doing here is building a
bridge<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.630> build<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> bridge<00:00:24.830> when<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.980> build<00:00:26.250> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
bridge to build a bridge when we build a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
bridge to build a bridge when we build a
self<00:00:26.730> anchored<00:00:27.119> suspension<00:00:27.689> bridge<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.470> do

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
self anchored suspension bridge we do

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
self anchored suspension bridge we do
that<00:00:28.800> completely<00:00:29.220> opposite<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.420> how<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that completely opposite of how you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.299 
that completely opposite of how you
would<00:00:30.900> build<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.320> traditional<00:00:31.470> suspension

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
would build a traditional suspension

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.430 
would build a traditional suspension
bridge<00:00:32.489> such<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> Golden<00:00:33.600> Gate<00:00:33.719> Bridge<00:00:33.780> or

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
bridge such as the Golden Gate Bridge or

when building this kind of traditional

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.380 
when building this kind of traditional
suspension<00:00:41.070> bridge<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.790> construct<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
suspension bridge we construct the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
suspension bridge we construct the
Anchorage's<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> towers<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.670> we

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
Anchorage's and towers first then we

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
Anchorage's and towers first then we
attach<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> cable<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.379> build<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
attach the cable and then we build the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.150 
attach the cable and then we build the
road<00:00:46.980> decks<00:00:48.230> what<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.410> doing<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.920> turning
