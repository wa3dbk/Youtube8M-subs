 meatballs 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840

 dehydrated that rehydrate with water and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.180
 It begins then as if it returns to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.550
 his ford half of carnitas is a 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.790
 wonder if beheaded decapitated

 while I -he said- pe or onion and 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.280
 the fears capi overcomes the onions to 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.890
 all of attacking onions look girls 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.340
 the wonder of whim is itchy 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.440
 dies writing all the ingredients 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.280
 that you need in the common kitchen 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.000
 you are quickly viewing safe easy 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.130
 and not be an expert in the kitchen for 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.899
 to be able to use the capitol and something very 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.000
 my dear important dor 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.190
 it's very safe you have children 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.170
 little ones or even though they are not small 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.020
 Suddenly you are cutting yourself but 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.850
 this professional commodores then one of 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.890
 suddenly walks and cutting his fingers 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 sliced ​​of the nails leaves the cut 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.720
 higher 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 apart but with the rapid shop does not happen 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.619
 that is totally safe and it is 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.679
 wonderful to use it because it looks from 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.630
 so quickly you will surely be able to 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.090
 chop everything you need at the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.250
 kitchen and simply and simply has to 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.500
 regulate your fingers that's great 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.659
 because you see what onion is like 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.230
 the garlic how it leaves you all your fingers 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.640
 turning terrible and they last you 2 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:03.180
 hijole if it is not that we are going to put a 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.400
 little bit of oil let's start 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.890
 to brown the onion since it is practiced 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.400
 look, look at the table because it's great 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.260
 very fast easy and to the grain and 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.180
 something exactly and above all that the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.050
 can unfold because sometimes I come 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.050
 those that are made of wood 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.910
 especially with super easy because of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.260
 the wooden boards you see that you do not 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.930
 you can fold them then you are 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.180
 throwing the food around I'm in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.319
 the truth that if this is this table is 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.989
 very good because apart 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.459
 how fast the quick lava uses it 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.409
 everything is now applying the forum che 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.989
 that the poor guy is a little more fibrous but 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.909
 same is removed super well in my breasts 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.609
 that's certainly true, but because we are 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.889
 talking about this flexible table because 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.659
 there is surprise with the flexible table as well 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.819
 what but now we are seeing what 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.489
 So easy way so fast so sure 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.189
 the parliament is biting poor and 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.900
 everything goes very fast then one 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.760
 part the forum is more fibrous huh 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.459
 but this way he has to clarify with all 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.090
 ingredients that again feel itchy 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.090
 pica grinds crushes even you know that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.560
 it's on ice 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.680
 clear if you want to make your daisies 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.650
 or his is a frappe what do I know 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.140
 Well, until the ice does not itch and it's

 super easy to use to have it in the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.170
 Kitchen does not occupy space or be safe 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.769
