00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.990
 Hello, how are you? I am erika and today I am going to 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.780
 teach them how I prepare the cakes 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.560
 of potatoes 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.490
 here I have 5 potatoes that are being more 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.240
 or less than half a kilo are already cooked 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.520
 here I have 100 grams of ham here 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.130
 I have another 100 grams of cheese and a 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.430
 little bit of grated cheese 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.329
 the flour enough for us to go 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.129
 needing 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:43.070
 an egg and oil is necessary and this is 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.629
 what if we are going to peel what are the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 already peeled potatoes we're going to crush them and 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.600
 is going to add what is ham on 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.690
 cheese and egg and also salt 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.180
 so let's do that here I already have 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 everything and also since the potatoes already 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.489
 I put the ham I put the cheese and put it 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.909
 the egg and salt tantita so that it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.950
 Season then what we are going to do 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.810
 first we also have to have 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.210
 our oil is already heating up and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.939
 immediately we do then let's do it one 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.539
 spoon or so and we started doing 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.539
 the pancakes 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.240
 yes 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.840
 It depends on the size you require 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.840
 and we're going 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.370
 to put 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 what is the flour all 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.270
 We're going to do it like that so it's removed 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.770
 it is removed side 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.770
 the excess of urine 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.380
 I get this 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.250
 but let me see if it is also said 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.110
 is 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.280
 so 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.210
 we put it here 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.400
 we offer another 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.400
 so that the hours go by 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.300
 you have to have the fire a little 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.270
 medium 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.180
 but that reach 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.140
 when cooked and the temperature is not lowered 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.430
 so 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.430
 you are the other 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.180
 we put the flour 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.420
 we take away the excess 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.500
 and we're going to put it in the oil 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.900
 then let me wash my hands to 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.990
 follow them taught here are the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.800
 pancakes takes a little light off the a 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.360
 camera so that they reach to appreciate 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.910
 we wait for them to be golden by the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.720
 two sides 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.780
 and you see how the fire is 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.450
 so good fire for them to cook 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.480
 quick the springs that I'm leaving 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.370
 to show how you want to be here 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.430
 were the pancakes if they are fixed 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.350
 have a nice golden brown color , the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.380
 I put in a paper of those that give sometimes 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.950
 in the tortillerÃ­a since they join 6 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.569
 cover and I'll show you how the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.689
 let's serve 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.909
 Here is the finished dish and we 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:41.379
 we serve salad contractor that comes 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:46.540
 being lettuce and I split cucumbers like that 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:51.459
 of this size and with some tomatoes and 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.319
 with a red arrocito then this is the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.019
 This is how I prepared the 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.030
