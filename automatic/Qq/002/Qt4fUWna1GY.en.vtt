00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello dear friends of curiosity at the moment 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.580
 is so a bit of the flu around 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.360
 and I already have such a light thing 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.610
 scratch the neck so what's the best way to help 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.799
 vitamins and we sincerely one 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.799
 I'll show you the role now 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.090
 then at the beginning usually one sees 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 yes an orange no easy here 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.929
 pult and then piece by piece the pieces 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.840
 But that's always the case 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.809
 relatively annoying because just the little ones 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.329
 times break off and you get 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.550
 not really the piece from piece 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.320
 Now I'll be a smart one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.320
 as show rather the best way 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.230
 gets her you see already times a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.789
 few lines on the orange 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.219
 we will take advantage now 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.129
 as we push in easily here 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.820
 so easy with the finger 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.820
 fingernail purely 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.590
 so what we do is the once in the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.060
 to break in the middle 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.420
 That's the way we do the same 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.030
 Again we are here again 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.780
 the fingernail a map in and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.890
 break again to the course and that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.890
 same here too 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.130
 yes now that that is actually quite 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.130
 supersede 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.640
 and the good is you too 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.520
 almost the bowl as a base 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.170
 and can be used as a small plate 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.970
 use 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.619
 yes that was it already and now 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.619
 you can eat that wonderfully 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.770
 if you liked the little trick 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.420
 my thumbs up and if you like more 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.380
 wanted to see such videos subscribed 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.450

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.890
 So I'm looking forward to the next time 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.890
 Bye your schlaumacher
