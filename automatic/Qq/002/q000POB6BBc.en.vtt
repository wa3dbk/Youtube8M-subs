I said it doesn't bend or flex that

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.449 
I said it doesn't bend or flex that
easily<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.269> quite<00:02:26.659> sturdy<00:02:27.310> coming<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
easily it is quite sturdy coming to the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.520 
easily it is quite sturdy coming to the
inside<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.909> have<00:02:28.939> your<00:02:29.360> micro<00:02:29.840> SIM<00:02:30.019> card<00:02:30.260> slot

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
inside you have your micro SIM card slot

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.789 
inside you have your micro SIM card slot
so<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.680> can<00:02:30.769> expand<00:02:31.250> storage<00:02:31.760> up<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:33.230> 32<00:02:33.590> gigs

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
so you can expand storage up to 32 gigs

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.220 
so you can expand storage up to 32 gigs
of<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> micro<00:02:34.310> SD<00:02:34.640> card<00:02:34.909> both<00:02:35.390> SIM<00:02:35.599> cards<00:02:35.930> can
