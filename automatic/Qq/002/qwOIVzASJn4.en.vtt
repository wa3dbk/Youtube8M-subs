00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.450
 hello together i am at the of the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.600
 new band from south tyrol main or berger 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.900
 we were looking for a name of 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 Cores should sound the course, of course 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 and say where we come from and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.460
 which musical direction we go 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.500
 What is behind the term hit 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.980
 actually quite simple 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.829
 schlager mixed with rock'n roll to 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.980
 Just be honest cloud content made 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.980
 his 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760
 more 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.810
 are all songs that life writes 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 songs that come from the heart of the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.740
 describe everyday life 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.860
 our goal was from the beginning the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.009
 snake and lederhosen romance 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.610
 excluded 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.060
 how the water finds its way 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.240
 We too have tried with our way 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.720
 with our music the way to you 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.880
 and that's why we are 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.780
 have tried the songs that live 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.380
 just write on these symbols to 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.150
 bake and that one or mountains 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.470
 feeling of life in this album 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.470
 to burn a thousand fires 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.080
 how so 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.540

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.540
 one belongs 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.150
 So then listen to our music let us 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.879

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.209
 until then your to the men of the 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.209

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.440
