my highlight now this will help with the
blending<00:04:45.350> so<00:04:46.070> just<00:04:46.280> go<00:04:46.400> ahead<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.730> just<00:04:46.970> take

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
blending so just go ahead and just take

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.730 
blending so just go ahead and just take
your<00:04:47.210> time<00:04:47.540> with<00:04:47.660> blending<00:04:48.200> this<00:04:48.380> will<00:04:48.590> also

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
your time with blending this will also

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.190 
your time with blending this will also
help<00:04:48.920> diminish<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:50.180> intensity<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.170> the

help diminish the intensity of the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.770 
help diminish the intensity of the
eyeshadows<00:04:51.980> use<00:04:52.670> your<00:04:52.850> fingers<00:04:53.210> if<00:04:53.390> you<00:04:53.540> want

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.020 
eyeshadows use your fingers if you want
to<00:04:54.020> also<00:04:54.170> blend<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:54.920> find<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.640> method

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
to also blend I find that that method

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.000 
to also blend I find that that method
works<00:04:56.240> great<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:57.170> just<00:04:57.410> continue<00:04:57.620> and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
works great so just continue and

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.800 
works great so just continue and
blending<00:04:58.370> with<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.520> tip<00:04:58.850> of<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.180> brush<00:04:59.330> as
