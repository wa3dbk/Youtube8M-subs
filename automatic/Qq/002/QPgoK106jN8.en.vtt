00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
which is really not that big of a deal

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.580 
which is really not that big of a deal
but<00:02:21.860> for<00:02:22.040> my<00:02:22.099> for<00:02:22.459> my<00:02:22.580> costume<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.900> kind<00:02:24.379> of<00:02:24.440> is

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
tank top now which is yet which is fine

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.550

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
customization and it seems like they

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.680 
customization and it seems like they
