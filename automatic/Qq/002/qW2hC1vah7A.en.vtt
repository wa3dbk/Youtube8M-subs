00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
of our machines that we offer and here

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.360 
of our machines that we offer and here
we<00:01:54.700> go

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.980 

it<00:02:00.090> runs<00:02:00.330> nice<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.900> smooth

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.380 

in<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.860> as<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.400> see<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.760> does<00:02:07.940> just<00:02:08.209> fine

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
in it as you can see it does just fine

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.170 
in it as you can see it does just fine
on<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.690> tabletop<00:02:11.890> now<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.190> has<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.730> short

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
on the tabletop now it has a short

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.540 
on the tabletop now it has a short
square<00:02:14.780> bed<00:02:15.020> not<00:02:15.319> like<00:02:15.470> your<00:02:15.650> typical<00:02:15.830> Kenmore

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
square bed not like your typical Kenmore

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.580 
square bed not like your typical Kenmore
so<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.540> going<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.720> be<00:02:17.810> kind<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.110> hard<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.410> find

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
so it's going to be kind of hard to find
