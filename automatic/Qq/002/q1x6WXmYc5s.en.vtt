 listen to music on one of these equipment 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.900
 at high volumes can cause the 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.859
 same damage as being beached at 20 meters from 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.859
 a plane ready 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.550
 there is pot the apple was sanctioned in paris 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.310
 because its portable players 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.410
 condition the release exceeded 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.830
 long as permissible for health

 World Health Organization 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.430
 expose us to sounds above the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.370
 70 decibels can cause damage as 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.920
 permanent humming dizziness alterations 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.110
 of character or even heart disease a 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.649
 average music player reaches the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.690
 85 decibels this is 15 more points of the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.080
 Recommended volume 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.990
 according to experts its continuous use causes a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.000
 irreversible damage to the inner ear because 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.040
 the patient is exposed to two or three 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.369
 hours or maybe less is enough to 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.180
 that a very 30-40 percentage occurs 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.180
 of still 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.299
 the hearing was lost before these 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.369
 severe objective problems is realized 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.860
 were lost at age 50 now 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.770
 they encounter severe acoustic problems 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.200
 leave 25 22 years 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.090
 studies done in europe confirm that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.579
 will use the music player for more than 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.979
 one hour a day on a daily basis and the 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.560
 volumes that exceed 85 decibels 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.789
 can cause permanent deafness in 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.100
 about 5 years but how to know how close 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.479
 we are to remain deaf how 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.219
 learn to use our player 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.219
 musical to minimize the damage 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.830
 place the handset on the tip of your 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.570
 fingers with the stretched hand now put 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.940
 the usual volume with which he listens 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.830
 music if the volume you put is more than 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.850
 half the maximum range that your 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.649
 team this problem what is recommended is 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.020
 that one put on the headset when 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.600
 the music that comes out of it from just a 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.610
 humming chased and those who are at your 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.620
 around do not listen to your music 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.110
 besides the specialists recommend 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.090
 avoid pushbuttons since at 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.970
 enter the ear directly into 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.070
 impact is much stronger is 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.230
 It is preferable to use equipment that covers all 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.360
 the ear will thus be isolated from noise 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.550
 outside without having to climb the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.590
 volume to listen better for another 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.050
 side while more volume levels 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.240
 can graduate on your team will be more 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.240
 easy to exceed my hearing limits 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.500
 the concerts also become 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.080
 an enemy to the ears 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.770
 the majority exceeds 95 decibels 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.800
 when the maximum advisable is 70 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.170
 by the way the 360 tour of the band 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.150
 Irish u2 was characterized by over the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.570
 noisiest concert of all 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.570
 time 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.200
 the rock band led by bonus was 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.330
 fined in 2010 in Turin for exceeding 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.220
 the maximum level of leaders allowed 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.320
 so you're about to attend some 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.870
 online concert is better to take 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.930
 note of these indications so close 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.330
 to the speakers or the sound sources of 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.710
 greater intensity and in some cases and 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.900
 the festivals are going to be with the 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.260
 concerts are going to be extensive overcoming 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.260
 2 hours use protective plugs 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.670
 just to give you an idea so that your 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.640
 ear recovers from two hours of noise 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.340
 intense of the concert you need 16 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.530
 hours of rest on average 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.780
 if you want to know how it goes from hearing 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.430
 so much sound exposure experts 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.129
 advise up is a test of 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.730
 audiometry every six months sometime 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.730
 he did it
