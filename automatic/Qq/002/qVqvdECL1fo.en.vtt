hello<00:00:01.410> everybody<00:00:01.920> my<00:00:02.190> name<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.399> Molly<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.090> I'm

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hello everybody my name is Molly and I'm

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.260 
hello everybody my name is Molly and I'm
Ariel<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.230> today<00:00:04.290> we<00:00:04.770> will<00:00:04.920> be<00:00:05.069> discussing

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
Ariel and today we will be discussing

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.390 
Ariel and today we will be discussing
hard<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:07.790> so<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.780> first<00:00:09.960> time<00:00:10.139> maybe<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.040> type

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
hard I so the first time maybe the type

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.879 
hard I so the first time maybe the type
is<00:00:11.610> called<00:00:12.000> conjugative<00:00:12.780> which<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.110> basically

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
is called conjugative which is basically

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.650 
is called conjugative which is basically
called<00:00:14.400> sex<00:00:14.730> pilots<00:00:15.210> okay

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
called sex pilots okay

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.630 
called sex pilots okay
and<00:00:18.590> yes<00:00:19.590> let's<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:21.619> okay<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.890> in

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and yes let's do that okay so in

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.839 
and yes let's do that okay so in
comparison<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.570> say<00:00:24.960> real<00:00:25.529> world<00:00:25.890> feel<00:00:26.699> that

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
comparison to say real world feel that

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.929 
comparison to say real world feel that
would<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.900> annoying<00:00:28.800> friend<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.730> have

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
would be that annoying friend you have

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.170 
would be that annoying friend you have
that<00:00:30.570> looks<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.219> random<00:00:32.669> chick<00:00:32.940> at

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
that looks you and this random chick at

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
that looks you and this random chick at
the<00:00:33.239> closet<00:00:33.780> during<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.170> party<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> forces<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the closet during a party and forces you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
the closet during a party and forces you
to<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.360> seven<00:00:37.050> minutes<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.469> heaven

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to have seven minutes in heaven

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:49.610 
to have seven minutes in heaven
even<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.360> matchmaker<00:00:48.660> part

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
even if really are the matchmaker part

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.900 
even if really are the matchmaker part
of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> bacteria

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
of the bacteria

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.660 
of the bacteria
alright<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> biological<00:00:52.649> terms<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
alright so like in biological terms it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.459 
alright so like in biological terms it
initiates<00:00:54.329> what's<00:00:54.510> called<00:00:54.719> bacterial

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
initiates what's called bacterial

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.180 
initiates what's called bacterial
conjugation

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
conjugation

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.349 
conjugation
so<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:57.329> pylus<00:00:57.899> thing<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.980> outside<00:00:59.730> it's

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
so this pylus thing that is outside it's

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.060 
so this pylus thing that is outside it's
like<00:01:00.539> branching<00:01:00.989> off<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.500> bacteria

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
like branching off of one bacteria

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.149 
like branching off of one bacteria
called<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> donor<00:01:02.699> bacteria<00:01:03.710> latches<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
called the donor bacteria latches on to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.570 
called the donor bacteria latches on to
the<00:01:05.580> receptor<00:01:06.240> bacteria<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.380> initiates<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the receptor bacteria and initiates the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060 
the receptor bacteria and initiates the
bridge<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.750> needed<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.110> transfer<00:01:10.710> DNA

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
bridge that is needed to transfer DNA

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.820 
bridge that is needed to transfer DNA
from<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> other<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.299> while<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.350> DNA

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
from one to the other and while this DNA

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.219 
from one to the other and while this DNA
does<00:01:14.159> actually<00:01:14.670> include<00:01:15.060> some<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
does actually include some of the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.219 
does actually include some of the
genetic<00:01:16.560> from<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.460> other<00:01:17.580> bacteria<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.540> lot<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
genetic from the other bacteria a lot of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.060 
genetic from the other bacteria a lot of
this<00:01:19.409> genetic<00:01:20.220> code<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.409> genetic<00:01:22.830> code

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
this genetic code is the genetic code

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.200 
this genetic code is the genetic code
for<00:01:24.500> highlight<00:01:25.500> itself<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.030> way

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
for highlight itself so that way

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.249 
for highlight itself so that way
whenever<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.900> gene<00:01:28.560> doning<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> complete

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.980 

bacteria<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.030> not<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.600> sexual

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
bacteria and it's not actually a sexual

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.980 
bacteria and it's not actually a sexual
reproduction<00:01:37.439> isn't<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.299> is<00:01:39.530> asexual<00:01:40.530> because

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
reproduction isn't it is asexual because

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
reproduction isn't it is asexual because
you're<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.159> don't<00:01:44.340> have

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you're not actually like you don't have

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.210 
you're not actually like you don't have
some<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:45.060> both<00:01:45.270> creating<00:01:45.869> another<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.979> is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
some from both creating another it is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:58.010 
some from both creating another it is
not<00:01:47.490> vertical<00:01:51.500> horizontal<00:01:56.329> but<00:01:57.329> basically<00:01:57.719> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
not vertical horizontal but basically it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350 
not vertical horizontal but basically it
may<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.189> causes<00:01:59.399> mutations<00:01:59.700> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
may it's what causes mutations and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.030 
may it's what causes mutations and
that's<00:02:01.079> how<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:01.439> into<00:02:01.619> biotic

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that's how you get into biotic

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
that's how you get into biotic
resistance<00:02:02.460> along<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> whole<00:02:03.030> entire<00:02:03.180> colony

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
resistance along the whole entire colony

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.910 
resistance along the whole entire colony
of<00:02:03.719> bacteria<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.170> not<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.770> that's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
of bacteria it's not just one that's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.910 
of bacteria it's not just one that's
resistant<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.049> it's<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.290> thing<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:07.649> like

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
resistant and it's the thing that's like

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.369 
resistant and it's the thing that's like
closest<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.610> sexual<00:02:08.910> reproduction<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.780> short

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
closest to sexual reproduction in short

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.350 
closest to sexual reproduction in short
is<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.979> thing<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.220> causes<00:02:11.580> super<00:02:12.150> about

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
is the thing that causes super about

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.790 
is the thing that causes super about
since<00:02:12.840> bacteria

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
since bacteria

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.010 
since bacteria
yay<00:02:14.160> alright<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> second<00:02:15.420> thing<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.630> is

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
yay alright so the second thing that is

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.910 
yay alright so the second thing that is
debatably<00:02:17.010> part<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.610> pi<00:02:18.240> lie<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.990> called

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
debatably part of pi lie is called

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.030 
debatably part of pi lie is called
fimbria<00:02:20.400> okay<00:02:21.350> it's<00:02:22.350> basically<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
fimbria okay it's basically like the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.430 
fimbria okay it's basically like the
mobility<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.060> there's<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.660> whole<00:02:24.930> bunch<00:02:25.290> of

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
mobility and there's a whole bunch of

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.120 
mobility and there's a whole bunch of
these<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.400> single<00:02:27.300> cell<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.920> first

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
these on one single cell so the first

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.510 
these on one single cell so the first
type<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.400> umbria<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:30.000> type<00:02:30.450> 4<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:31.800> small<00:02:32.370> with

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
type of umbria is type 4 it's small with

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.730 
type of umbria is type 4 it's small with
Roman<00:02:32.760> numerals<00:02:33.110> it's<00:02:34.110> basically<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
Roman numerals it's basically the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.670 
Roman numerals it's basically the
mobility<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.910> bacterium<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.020> it's<00:02:37.470> not

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
mobility for the bacterium and it's not

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.320 
mobility for the bacterium and it's not
like<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.890> flagella<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.490> basically<00:02:39.210> a

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
like a flagella it's basically a

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.920 
like a flagella it's basically a
grappling<00:02:39.990> hook<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:41.310> latches<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.450> part

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
grappling hook that latches on to a part

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.850 
grappling hook that latches on to a part
space<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.680> kind<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.980> brings<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.630> spot

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
space and kind of brings it to that spot

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.880 
space and kind of brings it to that spot
it's<00:02:47.190> called<00:02:47.370> twitching<00:02:47.820> mobility<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:49.050> it's

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
it's called twitching mobility and it's

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.560 
it's called twitching mobility and it's
definitely<00:02:50.460> not<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.000> jello<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.510> a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
definitely not like a jello like a

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.110 
definitely not like a jello like a
flagella<00:02:51.960> looks<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.760> balloon

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
flagella looks all like like a balloon

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.930 
flagella looks all like like a balloon
and<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.410> definitely<00:02:55.860> not<00:02:56.340> smooth<00:02:56.700> it's

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
and this is definitely not smooth it's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.420 
and this is definitely not smooth it's
super<00:02:57.450> tricky<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.080> official<00:02:58.530> embryo<00:02:59.130> though

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
super tricky the official embryo though

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.270 
super tricky the official embryo though
is<00:03:00.050> what<00:03:01.050> helps<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.440> stick<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.890> background

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
is what helps it stick to the background

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.620 
is what helps it stick to the background
right<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:04.100> am<00:03:05.100> giving<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> current<00:03:06.060> example

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
right I am giving the current example

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.870 
right I am giving the current example
because<00:03:06.990> we<00:03:07.440> have<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:08.040> within<00:03:08.220> Ariel's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
because we have to be within Ariel's

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.330 
because we have to be within Ariel's
house<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.170> were<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.380> take<00:03:10.710> anything<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
house so if I were to take anything a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.450 
house so if I were to take anything a
gigantic<00:03:12.110> blob<00:03:13.110> though<00:03:13.770> I<00:03:13.800> would<00:03:14.040> be<00:03:14.190> able<00:03:14.310> to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
gigantic blob though I would be able to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.410 
gigantic blob though I would be able to
get<00:03:15.560> debris<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.590> unless<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.060> actually

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
get debris I unless you can actually

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.449 
get debris I unless you can actually
have<00:03:20.239> if<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.900> could<00:03:22.170> somehow<00:03:22.440> magically<00:03:22.770> manage

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
have if I could somehow magically manage

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.400 
have if I could somehow magically manage
to<00:03:23.610> take<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.970> glob<00:03:25.610> fimbriae<00:03:26.610> less<00:03:27.410> bacteria

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
to take a glob fimbriae less bacteria

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.720 
to take a glob fimbriae less bacteria
and<00:03:29.270> Bobbitt<00:03:30.270> at<00:03:30.510> Ariel's<00:03:31.170> wall<00:03:31.410> nice<00:03:32.250> white

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
and Bobbitt at Ariel's wall nice white

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.240 
and Bobbitt at Ariel's wall nice white
pretty<00:03:33.120> walls<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:34.200> would<00:03:34.470> all<00:03:34.680> fall<00:03:34.890> down<00:03:35.100> to

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
pretty walls it would all fall down to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.880 
pretty walls it would all fall down to
the<00:03:35.280> ground<00:03:35.400> because<00:03:35.910> without<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:37.350> fimbria

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
the ground because without the fimbria

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.070 
the ground because without the fimbria
a<00:03:39.020> bacteria<00:03:40.020> cannot<00:03:40.380> stick<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.040> anything

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
a bacteria cannot stick to anything

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.750 
a bacteria cannot stick to anything
which<00:03:43.080> means<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.560> can't<00:03:43.739> infect<00:03:44.160> anything

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
which means it can't infect anything

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.240 
which means it can't infect anything
which<00:03:45.420> means<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.959> five-second<00:03:46.620> rule<00:03:46.650> applies

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
which means the five-second rule applies

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.300 
which means the five-second rule applies
in<00:03:47.670> fact<00:03:47.989> it's<00:03:48.989> more<00:03:49.410> than<00:03:49.590> five<00:03:49.860> seconds

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
in fact it's more than five seconds

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.280 
in fact it's more than five seconds
because<00:03:50.550> until<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.120> gets<00:03:51.330> some<00:03:51.600> it's<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:52.170> to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
because until it gets some it's going to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.210 
because until it gets some it's going to
not<00:03:52.470> stick<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:54.080> yeah<00:03:55.080> so<00:03:55.380> there's<00:03:55.980> multiple

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
not stick to it yeah so there's multiple

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.030 
not stick to it yeah so there's multiple
of<00:03:56.820> each<00:03:57.450> kind<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.870> Pylos<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.350> one<00:03:58.530> bacteria

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
of each kind of Pylos on one bacteria

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.360 
of each kind of Pylos on one bacteria
and<00:03:59.310> sometimes<00:04:00.300> there's<00:04:00.600> no<00:04:01.260> kind<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.860> pilots

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
and sometimes there's no kind of pilots

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.810 
and sometimes there's no kind of pilots
of<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.580> certain<00:04:02.940> certain<00:04:03.900> type<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:05.250> type<00:04:05.670> of

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
of a certain certain type on a type of

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.910 
of a certain certain type on a type of
bacteria<00:04:06.360> like<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:07.260> might<00:04:07.470> have

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
bacteria like you might have

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.680 
bacteria like you might have
you<00:04:09.460> might<00:04:09.610> have<00:04:09.760> donors<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:12.180> sequal<00:04:13.180> bacteria

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
you might have donors a sequal bacteria

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.770 
you might have donors a sequal bacteria
but<00:04:13.900> no<00:04:14.020> receivers<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:16.180> basically

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
but no receivers and you basically

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.479 
but no receivers and you basically
that's<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.049> entire<00:04:17.380> function<00:04:17.860> of<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:18.040> donor<00:04:18.220> is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
that's the entire function of a donor is

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.710 
that's the entire function of a donor is
to<00:04:18.670> go<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.180> give<00:04:19.510> donor<00:04:19.959> genetics<00:04:20.590> to

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
to go and give donor genetics to

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100 
to go and give donor genetics to
bacteria<00:04:22.720> without<00:04:24.240> donating<00:04:25.240> material<00:04:25.930> and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
bacteria without donating material and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.760 
bacteria without donating material and
only<00:04:26.320> having<00:04:26.710> receiving<00:04:27.310> material<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.770> and

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
only having receiving material and and

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.460 
only having receiving material and and
so<00:04:30.340> basically<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.300> is<00:04:31.480> everything<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.080> did

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
so basically that is everything you did

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.550 
so basically that is everything you did
or<00:04:32.680> did<00:04:32.830> not<00:04:32.860> want<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.370> know
