all<00:00:01.350> right<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:02.070> Frick<00:00:02.610> frack<00:00:02.850> from<00:00:03.300> Z

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
all right this is Frick frack from Z

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.010 
all right this is Frick frack from Z
driver<00:00:04.560> or<00:00:04.890> Z<00:00:05.790> driver<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.270> guess<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.690> some<00:00:06.899> of

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
driver or Z driver I guess to some of

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.980 
driver or Z driver I guess to some of
you<00:00:08.000> this<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.719> first<00:00:09.960> mega<00:00:10.889> squirt

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
you this is the first mega squirt

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.560 
you this is the first mega squirt
introduction<00:00:12.990> here<00:00:13.519> finally<00:00:14.519> getting<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
introduction here finally getting the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.429 
introduction here finally getting the
test<00:00:15.839> mule<00:00:16.109> up<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.560> running<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> let's<00:00:19.170> get<00:00:19.289> on

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
test mule up and running so let's get on

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.090 
test mule up and running so let's get on
with<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.650> show

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
with the show

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.279 
with the show
so<00:00:20.910> right<00:00:21.270> now<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.689> kind<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.020> Mickey<00:00:22.260> Mouse

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
so right now just kind of Mickey Mouse

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.670 
so right now just kind of Mickey Mouse
tin<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:24.230> wiring<00:00:25.230> harness<00:00:25.529> adapter

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
tin here with the wiring harness adapter

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.990 
tin here with the wiring harness adapter
with<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.640> relay<00:00:27.119> -<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.760> fuel<00:00:29.760> pump

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
with the relay - you get the fuel pump

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.130 
with the relay - you get the fuel pump
going<00:00:30.330> there<00:00:30.590> I'm<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.859> gonna<00:00:32.989> turn<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
going there I'm just gonna turn the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.340 
going there I'm just gonna turn the
ignition<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.719> here<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> fuel<00:00:37.110> pump

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
ignition on and here the fuel pump

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.650 
ignition on and here the fuel pump
coming<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.860> that's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.370> good<00:00:38.489> sign

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.119 

and<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:45.020> think<00:00:46.020> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> looks<00:00:46.530> normal<00:00:46.950> their

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and I think kind of looks normal their

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.880 
and I think kind of looks normal their
air<00:00:47.550> temperatures<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.450> 26<00:00:51.469> just<00:00:52.469> gonna<00:00:52.680> go

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
air temperatures at 26 just gonna go

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.200 
air temperatures at 26 just gonna go
ahead<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.550> run<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.270> output<00:00:55.100> test<00:00:56.100> mode<00:00:59.210> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
ahead and run the output test mode that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.830 
ahead and run the output test mode that
will<00:01:00.390> let<00:01:00.570> us<00:01:01.550> test<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> spark<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.449> before

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
will let us test the spark here before

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.649 
will let us test the spark here before
we<00:01:03.930> fire<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.700> two<00:01:05.820> three<00:01:05.850> four<00:01:06.390> five

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
we fire it up so one two three four five

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.800 
we fire it up so one two three four five
is<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.340> code<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.640> into<00:01:11.850> test<00:01:12.330> mode<00:01:12.420> four

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is the code to get into test mode four

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.770 
is the code to get into test mode four
mega<00:01:12.960> squirt<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:14.280> ahead<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.580> burn<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:17.780> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
mega squirt go ahead and burn that you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.850 
mega squirt go ahead and burn that you
can<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.170> over<00:01:19.320> here

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.050 

yeah<00:01:24.550> it's<00:01:24.700> Park<00:01:25.060> that's<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.570> good<00:01:25.720> sign<00:01:26.940> now<00:01:27.940> we

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
yeah it's Park that's a good sign now we

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.940 
yeah it's Park that's a good sign now we
need<00:01:28.240> fuel<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.810> air<00:01:28.960> we<00:01:29.350> should<00:01:29.590> be<00:01:29.680> good<00:01:29.800> to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
need fuel and air we should be good to

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:48.950 
need fuel and air we should be good to
go<00:01:30.480> so<00:01:32.370> just<00:01:33.370> gonna<00:01:34.140> shut<00:01:35.140> this<00:01:35.260> off

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.370 

and<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:50.490> order<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.760> reset<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.260> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and in order to reset that you have to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.800 
and in order to reset that you have to
turn<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.040> mega<00:01:53.610> squirt<00:01:53.940> ECU<00:01:54.330> off<00:01:54.480> so<00:01:54.690> we're

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
turn the mega squirt ECU off so we're

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.910 
turn the mega squirt ECU off so we're
just<00:01:54.840> gonna<00:01:55.020> turn<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.410> ignition<00:01:55.470> off<00:02:00.920> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
just gonna turn the ignition off you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:18.059 
just gonna turn the ignition off you
just<00:02:02.490> connect<00:02:02.910> our<00:02:04.370> old<00:02:05.370> test<00:02:05.760> mode<00:02:05.970> there

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:30.009 

all<00:02:19.069> right<00:02:27.969> let's<00:02:28.969> bring<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:29.629> here<00:02:29.840> with

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
all right let's bring this in here with

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.920 
all right let's bring this in here with
us

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
us

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:46.360 
us
all<00:02:32.930> right<00:02:42.609> so<00:02:44.019> got<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.170> data<00:02:45.379> logging<00:02:45.709> on<00:02:46.040> for

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
all right so got the data logging on for

00:02:46.370 --> 00:03:00.320 
all right so got the data logging on for
the<00:02:46.459> first<00:02:46.700> startup<00:02:47.599> here

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:13.179 

almost

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:44.230 

the<00:03:14.189> close<00:03:15.439> wants<00:03:16.439> to<00:03:16.560> start

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.740 

there<00:03:44.870> she<00:03:45.170> is

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
there she is

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.650 
there she is
we're<00:03:47.140> all<00:03:47.440> rich

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
we're all rich

00:03:49.660 --> 00:04:28.370 

but<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.770> running<00:03:51.540> all<00:03:52.540> right

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.160 

well<00:04:28.980> it's<00:04:29.430> running<00:04:29.670> it's<00:04:30.330> not<00:04:30.540> running<00:04:30.810> right

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
well it's running it's not running right

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.630 
well it's running it's not running right
but<00:04:31.820> it's<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.030> first<00:04:33.300> step
