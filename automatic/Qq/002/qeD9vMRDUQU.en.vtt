00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
one and in this update I will preview

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.230 
one and in this update I will preview
pretty<00:00:15.920> much<00:00:16.099> what<00:00:16.490> would<00:00:16.640> hit<00:00:16.849> power<00:00:17.090> alpha

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
pretty much what would hit power alpha

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.990 
pretty much what would hit power alpha
and<00:00:17.689> alpha<00:00:18.259> is<00:00:18.890> due<00:00:19.220> to<00:00:19.430> which<00:00:19.640> is<00:00:19.820> low

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
and alpha is due to which is low

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.290 
and alpha is due to which is low
replacement<00:00:20.919> okay<00:00:21.919> the<00:00:22.699> first<00:00:22.939> thing<00:00:23.119> we

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
replacement okay the first thing we

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.179 
replacement okay the first thing we
change<00:00:23.599> from<00:00:23.840> we<00:00:23.930> got<00:00:24.110> straight<00:00:24.500> off<00:00:24.740> was<00:00:25.039> the

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
change from we got straight off was the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.009 
change from we got straight off was the
cell<00:00:25.429> shading<00:00:25.820> of<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:25.939> character<00:00:26.480> its<00:00:26.720> its

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
cell shading of the character its its

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.220 
cell shading of the character its its
target<00:00:27.589> so<00:00:27.939> it's<00:00:28.939> almost<00:00:29.390> like<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:29.960> coming

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
target so it's almost like it's coming

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.220 
target so it's almost like it's coming
from<00:00:30.259> one<00:00:30.500> light<00:00:30.679> source<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.989> barabar<00:00:32.989> this

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
from one light source and barabar this

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.200 
from one light source and barabar this
is<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.410> double<00:00:33.710> character<00:00:34.339> this<00:00:34.550> actually

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
is a double character this actually

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.780 
is a double character this actually
isn't<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:36.710> character<00:00:37.250> we're<00:00:37.400> going<00:00:37.519> to<00:00:37.579> have

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
isn't the character we're going to have

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.130 
isn't the character we're going to have
fully<00:00:38.360> but<00:00:38.890> right<00:00:39.890> now<00:00:40.239> character<00:00:41.239> isn't

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
fully but right now character isn't

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.430 
fully but right now character isn't
really<00:00:42.589> worth<00:00:42.739> much<00:00:43.150> at<00:00:44.150> this<00:00:44.629> stage<00:00:44.930> at<00:00:45.199> least

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
really worth much at this stage at least

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.500 
really worth much at this stage at least
so<00:00:45.949> we'll<00:00:46.280> get<00:00:46.460> on<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:46.820> later<00:00:47.030> or<00:00:47.269> build

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
so we'll get on to that later or build

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.399 
so we'll get on to that later or build
things<00:00:47.720> first<00:00:48.250> anyway<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.280> log<00:00:49.519> replacement

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
things first anyway a log replacement

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.929 
things first anyway a log replacement
I'll<00:00:51.409> show<00:00:51.799> you<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.040> basics<00:00:52.519> and<00:00:52.610> how<00:00:52.820> it

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:52.939 
I'll show you the basics and how it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:56.560 
I'll show you the basics and how it
works<00:00:53.089> so<00:00:53.680> say<00:00:54.680> for<00:00:54.710> example<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.790> want<00:00:56.510> an

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
works so say for example you want an

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.259 
works so say for example you want an
ambush<00:00:56.900> London<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:58.460> we'll<00:00:58.580> jump<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.879> this<00:00:59.000> tree

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
ambush London so we'll jump in this tree

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.049 
ambush London so we'll jump in this tree
I<00:00:59.949> have<00:01:00.949> no<00:01:01.100> idea<00:01:01.129> why<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:01.670> can<00:01:01.939> actually

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
I have no idea why you can actually

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.859 
I have no idea why you can actually
collide<00:01:02.540> with<00:01:02.750> this<00:01:02.930> it's<00:01:03.470> just<00:01:04.369> pretty<00:01:04.580> cool

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
collide with this it's just pretty cool

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.840 
collide with this it's just pretty cool
anyway<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.680> safe<00:01:06.920> work<00:01:07.130> here<00:01:07.369> we<00:01:07.610> want<00:01:07.790> to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850
