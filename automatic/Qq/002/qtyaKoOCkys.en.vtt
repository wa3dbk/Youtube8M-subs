here looks on the fret board I think

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
that's pretty cool and it does break so
you<00:01:35.070> can't<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.090> meant<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> break

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you can't have that it's meant to break

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the color choices over here and this

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.290 
the color choices over here and this
thing<00:02:13.380> does<00:02:13.830> kind<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.160> come<00:02:14.310> off<00:02:14.459> easy<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.090> it

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
thing does kind of come off easy but it

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.940 
thing does kind of come off easy but it
does<00:02:15.600> stay<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.470> really<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.770> how<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
does stay but I really like how the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.590 
does stay but I really like how the
mohawk<00:02:17.340> looks<00:02:17.790> though<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.330> how<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.570> has

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
mohawk looks though I like how it has

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.150 
mohawk looks though I like how it has
some<00:02:18.900> yellow<00:02:19.170> highlights<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.800> there

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160

day it's a real bummer for me is that

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.449 
day it's a real bummer for me is that
his<00:02:48.690> left<00:02:49.110> hand<00:02:49.350> over<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.950> popped<00:02:50.190> off

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
his left hand over here just popped off

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.190 
his left hand over here just popped off
and<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:51.090> wasn't<00:02:51.330> supposed<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.810> happen<00:02:51.900> like

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
and it wasn't supposed to happen like

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.199 
and it wasn't supposed to happen like
that<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> break<00:02:53.430> yeah<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.060> see

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that that is a break yeah so you can see

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.910 
that that is a break yeah so you can see
it's<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.900> white<00:02:55.080> plastic<00:02:55.590> right<00:02:55.709> there

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
it's like the white plastic right there

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.259 
it's like the white plastic right there
usually<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:56.370> there's<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.610> break<00:02:56.790> there's

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
usually when there's a break there's

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.490 
usually when there's a break there's
some<00:02:57.420> friction<00:02:57.630> or<00:02:57.900> anything<00:02:58.049> but<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.320> just

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
some friction or anything but I just

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.259 
some friction or anything but I just
tapped<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.010> hand<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.549> fell<00:02:59.760> off<00:02:59.940> but

now<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.900> hand<00:03:31.140> isn't<00:03:31.290> supposed<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.739> be

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
now the hand isn't supposed to be

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.039 
now the hand isn't supposed to be
detachable<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:33.060> part<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.630> forearm

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
detachable but this part of the forearm

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.420 
detachable but this part of the forearm
is<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.380> that's<00:03:34.470> supposed<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.829> pop<00:03:35.040> off<00:03:35.250> right

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
is so that's supposed to pop off right

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.590 
is so that's supposed to pop off right
over<00:03:35.459> there<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:35.910> see<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> little<00:03:36.209> piece<00:03:36.420> of

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
over there you can see a little piece of

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.940 
over there you can see a little piece of
bone<00:03:36.750> sticking<00:03:37.110> out<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.470> then<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.739> whole

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
bone sticking out and then this whole

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.170 
bone sticking out and then this whole
arm<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.430> supposed<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.640> come<00:03:38.820> off<00:03:38.940> right<00:03:39.120> over

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
arm is supposed to come off right over

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.759 
arm is supposed to come off right over
here<00:03:39.540> now<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.750> articulation<00:03:40.350> on<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.560> figure

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
here now the articulation on this figure

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.830 
here now the articulation on this figure
isn't<00:03:40.950> great<00:03:41.430> it's<00:03:41.670> not<00:03:41.880> too<00:03:42.150> bad<00:03:42.360> though<00:03:42.660> his

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
isn't great it's not too bad though his

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.600 
isn't great it's not too bad though his
head<00:03:42.989> can<00:03:43.170> move<00:03:43.320> up<00:03:43.530> quite<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> bit<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.430> think

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
head can move up quite a bit I think

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.610 
head can move up quite a bit I think
that's<00:03:44.940> pretty<00:03:45.180> cool<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:46.110> look<00:03:46.350> down

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
that's pretty cool and it can look down

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.280 
that's pretty cool and it can look down
only<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.670> little<00:03:48.150> bit<00:03:48.299> his<00:03:48.510> head<00:03:48.660> rotates<00:03:48.810> side

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
only a little bit his head rotates side

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.470 
only a little bit his head rotates side
to<00:03:49.440> side<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.400> do<00:03:50.579> get<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.880> little<00:03:51.150> bit<00:03:51.269> make

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
to side and you do get a little bit make

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.030 
to side and you do get a little bit make
neck<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:52.079> it<00:03:52.200> actually<00:03:52.320> that's<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.680> lot<00:03:52.920> of

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
neck that it actually that's a lot of

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.470 
neck that it actually that's a lot of
neck<00:03:53.190> pivot<00:03:53.489> that's<00:03:53.640> pretty<00:03:53.880> cool<00:03:54.030> his

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
neck pivot that's pretty cool his

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.030 
neck pivot that's pretty cool his
shoulders<00:03:54.840> move<00:03:55.049> outward<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.860> can

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
shoulders move outward and you can

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.470 
shoulders move outward and you can
rotate<00:03:56.220> them<00:03:56.459> forward<00:03:56.820> or<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.090> his<00:03:57.209> left

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
rotate them forward or just his left

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.600 
rotate them forward or just his left
shoulder<00:03:57.720> anyway<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.530> then<00:03:58.980> due<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.430> this

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
shoulder anyway and then due to this

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.309 
shoulder anyway and then due to this
removable<00:03:59.910> arm<00:04:00.510> over<00:04:00.750> here<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.050> get<00:04:01.140> some

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
removable arm over here you get some

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.020 
removable arm over here you get some
rotation<00:04:01.890> right<00:04:01.980> there<00:04:02.190> at<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.400> elbow<00:04:02.730> and

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
rotation right there at the elbow and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.790 
rotation right there at the elbow and
then<00:04:03.209> this<00:04:03.450> left<00:04:03.720> hand<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.110> broke<00:04:04.349> off<00:04:04.560> this

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
then this left hand that broke off this

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.040 
then this left hand that broke off this
is

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
is

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.930 
is
opposed<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.470> rotate<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.310> know<00:04:06.430> just<00:04:06.760> get<00:04:06.910> a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
opposed to rotate you know just get a

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.970 
opposed to rotate you know just get a
swivel<00:04:07.330> side-to-side<00:04:07.660> now<00:04:08.320> on<00:04:08.440> this<00:04:08.560> arm<00:04:08.770> over

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
swivel side-to-side now on this arm over

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.220 
swivel side-to-side now on this arm over
here<00:04:09.160> this<00:04:09.610> detaches<00:04:10.300> but<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.600> is<00:04:10.900> still

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
here this detaches but it is still

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.410 
here this detaches but it is still
articulated<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:12.160> you<00:04:12.250> can<00:04:12.490> rotate<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:13.120> forward

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
articulated so you can rotate it forward

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.030 
articulated so you can rotate it forward
and<00:04:13.720> can't<00:04:13.930> really<00:04:14.050> move<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.410> outward<00:04:14.770> too

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
and can't really move it outward too

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.400 
and can't really move it outward too
much<00:04:15.250> only<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.850> little<00:04:16.269> bit<00:04:16.450> like<00:04:16.660> that<00:04:16.900> then

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
much only a little bit like that then

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.560 
much only a little bit like that then
the<00:04:17.590> elbow<00:04:17.890> actually<00:04:18.340> does<00:04:18.549> Bend<00:04:18.820> 90<00:04:19.120> degrees

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
the elbow actually does Bend 90 degrees

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.870 
the elbow actually does Bend 90 degrees
and<00:04:19.840> then<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.049> wrist<00:04:20.290> moves<00:04:20.650> side<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.310> side<00:04:21.580> he

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
and then the wrist moves side to side he

does rotate over there you have some

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.410 
does rotate over there you have some
legs<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.220> move<00:04:30.400> outward<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.850> little<00:04:31.060> bit<00:04:31.180> you

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
legs that move outward a little bit you

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.900 
legs that move outward a little bit you
can<00:04:31.660> move<00:04:31.870> them<00:04:32.050> forward<00:04:32.500> only<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.160> little<00:04:33.730> bit
