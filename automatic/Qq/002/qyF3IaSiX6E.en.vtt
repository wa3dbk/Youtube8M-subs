four thirteen seconds in the microwave

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.219 
four thirteen seconds in the microwave
mostly<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> liquefy<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.470> food<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.960> we<00:01:18.960> try<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
mostly to liquefy the food and we try to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:28.190 
mostly to liquefy the food and we try to
get<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.530> much<00:01:20.159> into<00:01:20.549> this

let's<00:01:31.030> press<00:01:31.299> out<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.659> air<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.780> have<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:34.990> tube

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
let's press out the air we have a tube

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.469 
let's press out the air we have a tube
the<00:01:36.280> tube<00:01:36.310> fits<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:37.030> over<00:01:37.390> top<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.840> syringe

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the tube fits in over top of the syringe

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.200 
the tube fits in over top of the syringe
you<00:01:40.479> run<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.310> food<00:01:42.580> down<00:01:42.970> through<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.930> tube

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you run the food down through the tube

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.130 
you run the food down through the tube
we<00:01:46.210> then<00:01:46.420> lubricate<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.810> syringe<00:01:50.490> by<00:01:52.140> dipping

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
we then lubricate the syringe by dipping

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.859 
we then lubricate the syringe by dipping
it<00:01:53.320> back<00:01:53.500> into<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.920> food<00:01:54.159> this<00:01:55.030> can<00:01:55.330> be<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.600> very

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
it back into the food this can be a very

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.880 
it back into the food this can be a very
messy<00:01:56.229> process<00:01:57.220> if<00:01:57.909> you're<00:01:58.180> you're<00:01:58.890> really

practice where we care for people's pets
we<00:02:28.480> also<00:02:28.630> use<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.140> as<00:02:29.290> an<00:02:29.410> educational

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
we also use that as an educational

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.680 
we also use that as an educational
process<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.549> what<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.790> are<00:02:30.910> doing<00:02:30.940> today<00:02:31.299> is<00:02:31.540> an

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
process so what we are doing today is an

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.740 
process so what we are doing today is an
educational<00:02:32.320> demonstration<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:34.720> a

Jennifer and Michelle if you can step
forward<00:02:48.459> just<00:02:49.090> all<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.690> middle<00:02:54.840> right<00:02:55.840> there

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
forward just all the middle right there

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.670 
forward just all the middle right there
and<00:02:58.180> we're<00:02:58.329> trying<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.630> keep<00:02:58.780> him<00:02:59.019> straight<00:02:59.440> as

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
and we're trying to keep him straight as

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.590 
and we're trying to keep him straight as
possible<00:02:59.739> we're<00:03:00.280> going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.459> take<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.790> two<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
possible we're going to take the two the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.180 
possible we're going to take the two the
big<00:03:01.750> deal<00:03:02.019> about<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.440> tube<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.829> we<00:03:02.980> don't<00:03:03.100> want

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
big deal about the tube is we don't want

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.289 
big deal about the tube is we don't want
to<00:03:03.370> go<00:03:03.430> down<00:03:03.579> the<00:03:03.760> breathing<00:03:04.269> tube<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:06.299> have

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
to go down the breathing tube so we have

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.569 
to go down the breathing tube so we have
to<00:03:07.420> make<00:03:07.570> sure<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.079> pass<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:09.190> breathing

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
to make sure that we pass the breathing

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.430 
to make sure that we pass the breathing
tube<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:10.150> go<00:03:10.390> right<00:03:10.780> straight<00:03:11.049> down<00:03:11.320> the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
tube and go right straight down the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.970 
tube and go right straight down the
esophagus<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:16.000> slide<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.989> right

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
esophagus and we slide that to right

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.400 
esophagus and we slide that to right
down<00:03:18.280> his<00:03:18.609> esophagus<00:03:18.989> we<00:03:19.989> keep<00:03:20.230> that

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
down his esophagus we keep that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.069 
down his esophagus we keep that
esophagus<00:03:21.100> as<00:03:21.370> straight<00:03:22.209> as<00:03:22.450> we<00:03:22.630> can<00:03:25.079> and

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
esophagus as straight as we can and

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.930 
esophagus as straight as we can and
we're<00:03:26.200> gonna<00:03:26.290> push<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:26.829> tube<00:03:27.190> all<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.609> way

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
we're gonna push this tube all the way

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.670 
we're gonna push this tube all the way
into<00:03:28.359> his<00:03:28.390> stomach

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.920 

it's<00:03:32.680> interesting<00:03:32.890> that<00:03:33.280> esophagus<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.270> folds

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
it's interesting that esophagus in folds

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.320 
it's interesting that esophagus in folds
on<00:03:35.080> itself<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.310> it's<00:03:36.460> sort<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.790> shaped<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.300> it

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
on itself so it's sort of shaped like it

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.960 
on itself so it's sort of shaped like it
you<00:03:37.750> until<00:03:38.710> we<00:03:38.830> push<00:03:39.100> something<00:03:39.400> down<00:03:39.760> the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
you until we push something down the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.300 
you until we push something down the
inside<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.890> esophagus<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:41.920> then<00:03:42.130> it

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
inside of the esophagus and then it

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.690 
inside of the esophagus and then it
expands<00:03:42.910> out<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:43.690> very<00:03:43.930> elastic<00:03:44.230> tissue<00:03:44.770> the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
expands out it's very elastic tissue the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.610 
expands out it's very elastic tissue the
enfold<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:49.480> vena<00:03:49.660> cava<00:03:49.930> which<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:50.410> one<00:03:50.590> of

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
enfold is the vena cava which is one of

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.040 
enfold is the vena cava which is one of
the<00:03:50.770> largest<00:03:51.040> vessels<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.060> body<00:03:52.210> now<00:03:52.990> we

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
the largest vessels in the body now we

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.440 
the largest vessels in the body now we
have<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.590> tube<00:03:53.800> in<00:03:54.070> we're<00:03:54.850> now<00:03:54.970> going<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.180> push

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
have the tube in we're now going to push

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.530 
have the tube in we're now going to push
the<00:03:55.840> syringe<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.770> you<00:03:56.850> may<00:03:57.850> actually<00:03:58.060> feel

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
the syringe and you may actually feel

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.980 
the syringe and you may actually feel
the<00:03:58.780> food<00:03:59.050> rolling<00:04:00.010> underneath<00:04:00.280> your<00:04:00.610> fingers

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.390 

you<00:04:04.990> slowly<00:04:05.320> give<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.740> food<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:08.050> then<00:04:08.400> gently

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
you slowly give the food and then gently

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.180 
you slowly give the food and then gently
pull<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:11.010> tube<00:04:12.010> out<00:04:13.440> sometimes<00:04:14.440> will<00:04:14.680> snag<00:04:14.980> on

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
pull the tube out sometimes will snag on

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.650 
pull the tube out sometimes will snag on
the<00:04:15.310> teeth<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.820> have<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.090> go<00:04:16.209> gently
