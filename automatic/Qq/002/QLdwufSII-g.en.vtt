00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.890
 s 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.690
 you would not believe me if I tell you today 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.690
 the young man who breaks the teleseries 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.120
 party very, very out below as 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.590
 It was not always the star that I am 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.750
 mine pursued an opportunity in 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.029
 television and especially in the tables 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.980
 the world of acting was always his 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.509
 dream but clear as a good artist 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.509
 He started from scratch 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.489
 i 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.980
 at about 14 when you and I 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.170
 we only think about playing the sun and for 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.910
 party looking for some opportunity 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.860
 they say he was walking around as much as casting 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.239
 or saw and that he did not make him quite a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.519
 any job even if it was a 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.519
 little related to his beloved theater 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.020
 and always said to know what girl they are going to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.809
 call of the dramatic 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.820
 in a TV series almost always he 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.820
 he said that and he's doing it 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.010
 and little by little it was getting into this 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.720
 would you believe me if I tell you that 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.240
 his first hit on television was in 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.280
 passions out there for the year 2008 clear 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.960
 his first steps he gave them and although not 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.420
 it would be but until the next year that 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.190
 street 7 recruits him and little by little 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.600
 begins to become the most beloved 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.600
 of the youth program 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.490
 this was the second season to me 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.470
 saved the public and therefore it touched me 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.870
 compete with the best that was the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.550
 in the competition then we 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.010
 before we had an agreement of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.630
 say and you have to win the same but 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.610
 we share the primitive agreement of 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.200
 Chaco that we went through the same castle 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.710
 like 40 and suddenly about 300 later 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.710
 friends 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.820
 'el chapo' 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.789
 the guy is so noble that a lettuce 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.490
 owner of the 17 would be that he had a lot 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.840
 talent in acting apart was very 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.480
 persevering I believe that all those 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.410
 things make a person succeed like 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.490
 they are doing them 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.340
 always me 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.980
 as a platform to be able to do the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 things and his always-known dreams 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.000
 were his romances first with 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.110
 valentina roth duran caleta and me 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.700
 they lived together and there one met a 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.410
 valentina roth totally different 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.630
 when was the relationship with the guy 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.490
 it was a good look you could call it a 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.760
 mine of house a mine on quiet 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.640
 a mine 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.790
 the valentina is different 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.650
 known now cachay 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.390
 with that 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.519
 and they say he followed the unr and what 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.530
 they even lived together and it was in that 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.900
 time that valentina disappeared from the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.640
 scandals faranduleros after and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.159
 our romance with kata vallejos and 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.260
 for several months there was talk of one of 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.170
 the most stable relationships of our 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.480
 screen today the radio announcer remembers 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.980
 these moments says not to be surprised the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.980
 success of his ex-lover 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.640
 I'm going to talk more about that, it 's very nice 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.620
 relationship with him I really wish him what 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.150
 better because I know that a great man and he 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.800
 It deserves everything that is happening I think 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.870
 that he is such a person is very 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.340
 Endeavored also very good person 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.340
 he deserves everything that is happening to him 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.920
 his friends define him as a man 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.990
 ultra- hard-working person and was surprised 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.060
 when maria eugenia rencoret recruited him 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.760
 to join the dramatic area of 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.410
 tvn and from there plugged oxen would start 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.410
 quickly his career in the big 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.010
 leagues leaving behind this boy profile 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.010
 almost 7 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.340
 new attractions those prejudices I think 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.220
 me that they go a little in retreats the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.740
 person is rigorous discipline but that 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.870
 all that 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.760
 go to the background if finally a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.050
 good professional I think the actor the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.300
 true that is done in the office of 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.860
 actor or is done working is a 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.470
 experience and that's something that I'm going 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.150
 acquiring and nothing to read the actor tuto 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.150
 he called me like all the rest of the area 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.610
 poor rich iceberg and we are the carmona 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.950
 but the teleseries that made the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.990
 people will change the switch and assimilate to 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.450
 Francisco Cop is like the new actor of 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.430
 this dramatic area then the change came 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.930
 of channel and with it the success of stratus 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.930
 it would rise like foam 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.510
 the people who are persevering always 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.689
 He ends up doing what he loves and is 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.580
 the happiest people 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.529
 there may be bad moments 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.899
 good I think he so 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.459
 I 've always heard from him is that for 

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:50.079
 he all the moments have been super 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:53.289
 important in your life as it has grown 

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:55.389
 very mateo arrives with her scene very 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.089
 learned always proposing something that 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.610
 add to the scene and also like everyone 

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:03.869
 we also have fun times and 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.619
 what do I know and we joke and what do I know but 

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:07.619
 always walks in a very good mood 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.100
 They say that Matteo Matteo always arrives 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.900
 with fingers read and learned to bs 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.510
 but good only sometimes a little 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.390
 Revolting playful and very good companion 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.590
 the being some earned the love of 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.190
 your peers 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.560
 actually the general group of the 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.460
 gallant family 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.100
 we also messy 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.009
 but it also does not help because the scenes 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.310
 they have a more spontaneous little thing more 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.310
 delicious 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.080
 but I also tell you that they have several 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.729
 hobbies the western track and every time 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.860
 can the fifth region be started for 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.749
 take a dip today is in pairs 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.240

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:54.950
 Garcia and they say that they are seen 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.130
 the most in love 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.790
 both are at home or dominated then 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.910
 clear for girls field I think that it 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.180
 It is very well and it shows because 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.610
 the guy is very happy he is very happy and 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.140
 Note also noticeable in the television series 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.380
 the things that is doing apart the 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.500
 teleserie he has no luck 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.569

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.639
 people news 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.469
 what you see is what there is not going to 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.710
 sell something you do not show or even 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.710
 in a way 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.439
 here we see that quickly francisco 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.930
 He escaped because he has won the heart of 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:40.000
 the people a story of effort and pure 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.490
 aesthetic talent that left its past 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.009
 farandulero to be fully integrated into 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.169
 world of acting this is the 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:51.240
 history of puelés tapo and its way to 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.240
 the big leagues on our television
