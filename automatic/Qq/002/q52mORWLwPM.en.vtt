00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.010
 northwest part of the continent they value 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.660
 and is currently positioned as a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.270
 of the cities technologically more 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.600
 advanced this is usually your main 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.150
 advantage over your enemies but now 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.320
 it's slowly ruining the city 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.790
 some residents of shawn have 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.760
 obsessed so much by the industry 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.620
 chemistry and even magic the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.540
 countless factories constantly 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.309
 they throw their dangerous waste and all 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.040
 class of toxic waste in the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.290
 environment that have slowly been filling 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.300
 the sewers of the city 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.220
 the city is often covered by 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.520
 a thick layer of smog that even 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.560
 blocks the sunlight the gray are like 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.730
 they usually call that fog it's said that 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.770
 is covered with cosmic alterations 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.510
 the city government and the council of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.580
 they seem to not care about these 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.040
 problems since they do not act aggressively 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.590
 to punish the factories and really 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.660
 it prohibits something to its citizens this 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
 of course he has brought many 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.730
 consequences including those that do not 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.350
 They are very nice but the city does not 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.270
 they import the needs of their people already 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.330
 that they should be able to take care of themselves 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.520
 yes alone the people of shawn are known 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.140
 for his egocentricity but despite this 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 they are very proud of their city and of 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.580
 your nation consider it as the city 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.590
 less controlled and more liberal of the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.990
 land since citizens can 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.910
 do what they please because of this 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.340
 the streets are constantly 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.710
 overpopulated something similar like a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.280
 anthill but if you know what to ask 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 you can find everything you need 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.670
 people are like way of 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.110
 entertainment often meet to 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.510
 witness the battles of the league 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.060
 supporting their champions they represent 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.860
 to the city although the most viewed fights 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 they are against their eternal rival ion and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.520
 called derisively as pacifists 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.500
 because people are 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.170
 the inhabitants of this city have their 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.820
 own way to resolve their conflicts 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.950
 corporate sabotage and espionage 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.340
 are considered common and 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.260
 completely legal 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.790
 many citizens have been caught 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.650
 using a corrosive substance 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.830
 called shine that became very popular 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.239
 due to its explosive properties a 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.989
 once it spreads through the skin of the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.459
 person 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.410
 this reaction intensifying their 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.030
 emotions and changing the color of your 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.709
 skin to a variety of shades 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.500
 corresponding to the feelings of 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.360
 the person at the moment is dangerous 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.950
 but there were rumors that the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.410
 extraordinary shine granted 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.240
 skills and so he quickly increased his 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.370
 demand 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.860
 the city shares a friendly relationship 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.860
 with oxxos which often asks for help 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.240
 of area in the fields of justice 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.920
 both sides get what they want from 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.570
 this agreement so neither is 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.460
 willing to step aside and reject 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.320
 the cooperation of the other 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.000
 Knox gains the military power he needs 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.150
 and he only has the perfect opportunity 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.010
 to see his inventions in action 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.260
 the most famous researches led 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.790
 out by the sun people include the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.069
 deadly toxins developed by 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.689
 sinchi the crazy chemist who were 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.000
 capable of annihilating entire cities 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.900
 no problem mixing mix 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.120
 spin mix georg grosz and laura víctor 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.430
 the mechanical herald worked on improving 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.409
 his own body replacing parts with 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.409
 sixth technology destroy 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.890
 the first intelligent being activated with 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.880
 steam beats grand the big blow of steam 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.440
 in metal is more than meat and 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.750
 reconstruction and resurrection of 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.170
 soldier fallen burgos the pride of 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.170
 executioner 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.790
 the research to create the perfect 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.830
 but scientifically improved was 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.440
 carried out by the doctor world the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.560
 crazy are they world too strong to 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.840
 you in the eagerness to grant powers to 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.540
 the people without skills the doctor 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.640
 Javier Draft awarded him a twist of fate 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.040
 the master of the letters the ability to 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.950
 Teleportation picks a letter 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.510
 all or nothing as a product of a 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.480
 experiment to create a super soldier 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.160
 was born pulls out the secret weapon combining 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.520
 brute force and with extreme flexibility 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.400
 is a versatile giant put if others 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.110
 They do not know when to retire they are also 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.080
 the birthplace of a champion more 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.070
 from the league twitch the mutant rat

 of shawn along with thousands of his kind 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.400
 but because of complete coincidence and 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.710
 thanks to the combination of the waste 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.629
 toxic from some experiments and to the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.330
 pollution of the city began to 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:04.389
 evolve quickly became 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.159
 smart but at the same time what came 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.539
 on their own the facilities 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.419
 of the league to represent this 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.699
 species as the only one of its kind since 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.800
 then said attracted the attention of

 one of the most active champions in the 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.099
 fields of justice trichet has also 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.210
 said that his main mind is to recreate 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.370
 the process that caused him the 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.439
 transformation so that we can help 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.539
 his brothers while some what 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:33.399
 they consider their success impossible 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:37.259
 it would mean a breakthrough in the field 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:37.259
 of science for an entire earth 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.370
 good people that was all for this
