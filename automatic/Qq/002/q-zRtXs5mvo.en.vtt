00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
this is the hinge that's gonna sit up

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.200 
this is the hinge that's gonna sit up
here<00:00:06.950> work<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.429> can<00:00:08.610> see<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.970> gives<00:00:09.090> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
an idea of what the hinge looks what the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.220 
an idea of what the hinge looks what the
hinge<00:00:11.550> looks<00:00:11.760> like<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.180> can<00:00:12.510> see<00:00:12.750> that's

hinge looks like so you can see that's

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.220 
hinge looks like so you can see that's
it<00:00:13.440> closed<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.370> that's<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.910> open<00:00:15.300> one<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
it closed and that's it open one of the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.019 
it closed and that's it open one of the
reasons<00:00:16.529> I've<00:00:16.650> bought<00:00:16.859> these<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.519> hinge<00:00:17.820> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
reasons I've bought these this hinge is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.349 
reasons I've bought these this hinge is
because<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:19.289> surface<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:20.189> which<00:00:20.999> is<00:00:21.210> going

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
because this surface here which is going

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.409 
because this surface here which is going
to<00:00:21.419> be<00:00:21.539> outside<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.230> top<00:00:22.739> here<00:00:23.099> is<00:00:23.640> completely

orientation that's the rear so this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.330 
orientation that's the rear so this
section<00:01:13.520> here<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:13.970> going<00:01:14.180> daddy<00:01:14.510> hatch<00:01:14.840> itself

section here is going daddy hatch itself

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.539 
section here is going daddy hatch itself
here<00:01:16.340> is<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.229> hinge<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:19.040> what<00:01:19.220> I've<00:01:19.310> had<00:01:19.520> to

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
here is the hinge and what I've had to

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.840 
here is the hinge and what I've had to
do<00:01:19.909> in<00:01:20.240> order<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:21.200> down<00:01:21.890> here<00:01:22.430> this

do in order that this down here this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.130 
do in order that this down here this
edge<00:01:23.180> here<00:01:23.210> matches<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:25.330> had<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.479> raise<00:01:26.750> this

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
edge here matches I had to raise this

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.670 
edge here matches I had to raise this
six<00:01:27.860> months<00:01:28.659> so<00:01:29.659> what's<00:01:29.869> happened<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.649> that

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
six months so what's happened is is that

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.370 
six months so what's happened is is that
I<00:01:30.830> put<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.159> piece<00:01:31.460> in<00:01:31.520> here<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.240> when<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.420> fit<00:01:33.170> the

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
I put a piece in here and when I fit the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.830 
I put a piece in here and when I fit the
roof<00:01:33.590> I'm<00:01:34.340> gonna<00:01:34.490> need<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.820> put<00:01:35.180> some<00:01:35.360> silicon

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
roof I'm gonna need to put some silicon

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.680 
roof I'm gonna need to put some silicon
or<00:01:35.990> some<00:01:36.200> sealant<00:01:36.799> in<00:01:37.310> here<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.450> any

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
or some sealant in here so that any

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.070 
or some sealant in here so that any
water<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.110> runs<00:01:39.409> down<00:01:39.619> doesn't<00:01:40.250> go<00:01:40.369> in<00:01:40.550> and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
water that runs down doesn't go in and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:51.940 
water that runs down doesn't go in and
defeat<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.229> object<00:01:42.289> of<00:01:42.679> this<00:01:42.860> lovely<00:01:43.280> seal

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.100 

okay<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:52.640> we're<00:01:52.880> looking<00:01:52.909> down<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.690> hinge<00:01:53.900> you

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
okay so we're looking down the hinge you

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.050 
okay so we're looking down the hinge you
can<00:01:54.290> see<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.680> there's<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.979> six<00:01:55.340> more<00:01:55.550> gap<00:01:55.790> for

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
can see that there's a six more gap for

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.440 
can see that there's a six more gap for
the<00:01:56.150> roof<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:57.080> go<00:01:57.229> in<00:01:57.409> there<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.970> I've<00:01:59.150> cut

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
the roof to go in there and I've cut

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.870 
the roof to go in there and I've cut
this<00:01:59.690> shape<00:02:00.350> out<00:02:00.590> in<00:02:00.920> order<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.610> can't

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
this shape out in order that that can't

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.420 
this shape out in order that that can't
go<00:02:02.420> down<00:02:02.630> too<00:02:02.900> close<00:02:03.170> so<00:02:03.470> I'm<00:02:03.830> gonna<00:02:03.950> try<00:02:04.310> and

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
go down too close so I'm gonna try and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.160 
go down too close so I'm gonna try and
do<00:02:04.550> this<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:04.940> hand<00:02:05.210> that's<00:02:07.959> that's<00:02:08.959> the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
do this one hand that's that's the

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.290 
do this one hand that's that's the
timber<00:02:09.590> falling<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.550> then<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.789> can<00:02:10.940> just<00:02:11.120> see

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
timber falling and then you can just see

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:20.920 
timber falling and then you can just see
that<00:02:11.450> closed<00:02:11.870> up<00:02:18.430> close<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.600> then

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
that closed up close like that and then

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.130 
that closed up close like that and then
what's<00:02:21.110> gonna<00:02:21.230> happen<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:21.800> on<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.040> outside

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
what's gonna happen is on the outside

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.760 
what's gonna happen is on the outside
I've<00:02:24.140> got<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:26.020> external<00:02:27.020> skin<00:02:27.290> running

external skin but hey that's what these

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.400 
external skin but hey that's what these
challenges<00:02:39.920> are<00:02:40.340> for<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.630> girly<00:02:44.870> hatch<00:02:45.200> I

challenges are for so the girly hatch I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.390 
challenges are for so the girly hatch I
haven't<00:02:45.709> shown<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.239> how<00:02:47.239> it's<00:02:47.420> been<00:02:47.600> fixed<00:02:48.400> to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
haven't shown you how it's been fixed to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.509 
haven't shown you how it's been fixed to
the<00:02:49.519> galley<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.300> there's<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.959> original<00:02:51.320> spa<00:02:52.130> I

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
the galley so there's the original spa I

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.940 
the galley so there's the original spa I
ran<00:02:53.030> left<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.510> right<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.470> all<00:02:54.620> I've<00:02:54.769> done<00:02:54.890> is

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
ran left to right and all I've done is

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.370 
ran left to right and all I've done is
put<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.550> screw<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.390> about<00:02:56.690> every<00:02:56.989> six<00:02:57.230> inches

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
put a screw in of about every six inches

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.990 
put a screw in of about every six inches
or<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.480> then<00:02:59.480> above<00:02:59.900> that<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.410> can<00:03:00.440> see

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
or so and then above that you can see

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.850 
or so and then above that you can see
here<00:03:02.000> I've<00:03:02.299> added<00:03:02.780> those<00:03:03.110> just<00:03:03.410> recently

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
here I've added those just recently

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.000 
here I've added those just recently
because<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.370> needed<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.670> reduce<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.870> depth<00:03:06.739> of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
because I needed to reduce the depth of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.479 
because I needed to reduce the depth of
the<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.850> ribs<00:03:08.510> by<00:03:08.810> 15<00:03:09.320> miles<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:10.430> know

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
the the ribs by 15 miles you know

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.100 
the the ribs by 15 miles you know
because<00:03:10.820> that's<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.120> thickness<00:03:11.299> that<00:03:11.840> that's

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
because that's the thickness that that's

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.780 
because that's the thickness that that's
the<00:03:12.260> thickness<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:13.010> hinge<00:03:13.459> when<00:03:13.670> it's

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the thickness of the hinge when it's

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.840 
the thickness of the hinge when it's
closed<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:15.140> added<00:03:15.440> though<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:16.549> bit<00:03:16.730> of

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
closed so I added though that bit of

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.140 
closed so I added though that bit of
timber<00:03:17.030> which<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.890> punch<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.430> hinge<00:03:19.820> here

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
timber which the punch this hinge here

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.750 
timber which the punch this hinge here
screwed<00:03:20.660> into<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.350> timber<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:21.980> then

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
screwed into this timber and then

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.479 
screwed into this timber and then
obviously<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.450> screws<00:03:24.019> into<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:25.010> spar

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
obviously that screws into that spar

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.949 
obviously that screws into that spar
that<00:03:25.519> runs<00:03:25.910> left<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.329> right<00:03:28.420> so<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.750> see

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
that runs left to right so you can see

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.210 
that runs left to right so you can see
the<00:03:31.299> this<00:03:32.299> is<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.660> seal<00:03:32.930> I've<00:03:33.470> had<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.010> raise

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
the this is the seal I've had to raise

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.729 
the this is the seal I've had to raise
it<00:03:34.400> up<00:03:34.489> six<00:03:34.820> months<00:03:35.030> because<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.140> was<00:03:36.260> catching

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
it up six months because it was catching

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.720 
it up six months because it was catching
at<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.040> point<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.549> was<00:03:37.640> too<00:03:37.970> low<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.790> then

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
at this point it was too low and then

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.160 
at this point it was too low and then
you<00:03:43.730> can<00:03:44.150> see<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:44.900> pretty

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
you can see that it's pretty

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.770 
you can see that it's pretty
straightforward<00:03:45.530> putting<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.519> together

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
straightforward putting it together

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.180 
straightforward putting it together
wasn't<00:03:47.780> as<00:03:47.870> difficult<00:03:48.350> as<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.620> thought

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.210 

immanuel<00:03:52.190> gas<00:03:52.459> lever<00:03:52.790> yeah<00:03:54.010> one<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.040> the

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
immanuel gas lever yeah one of the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.059 
immanuel gas lever yeah one of the
things<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.579> this<00:03:55.760> is

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.339 

from<00:03:59.760> this<00:03:59.909> this<00:04:00.450> point<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.840> view<00:04:00.989> it's<00:04:01.230> not

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
from this this point of view it's not

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.119 
from this this point of view it's not
it's<00:04:02.310> not<00:04:02.489> rigid<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:04.200> -<00:04:04.260> it's<00:04:04.650> taken<00:04:05.010> me<00:04:05.099> three

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
it's not rigid so - it's taken me three

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.030 
it's not rigid so - it's taken me three
attempts<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.390> get<00:04:06.599> this<00:04:07.040> positioned

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
attempts to get this positioned

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.640 
attempts to get this positioned
correctly<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.719> final<00:04:10.170> attempt<00:04:10.500> which

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
correctly and the final attempt which

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.309 
correctly and the final attempt which
actually<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.189> where<00:04:11.579> we<00:04:11.670> are<00:04:11.790> now<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.359> put<00:04:13.049> the

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
actually is where we are now I put the

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.509 
actually is where we are now I put the
the<00:04:13.640> hinge<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:14.969> onto<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.079> galley

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
the hinge on onto the galley

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.330 
the hinge on onto the galley
fitted<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.699> galley<00:04:17.940> into<00:04:18.900> position<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.709> then

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
fitted the galley into position and then

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.860 
fitted the galley into position and then
marked<00:04:20.699> where<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> hinge<00:04:21.180> was<00:04:21.389> going<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
marked where the hinge was going and

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.749 
marked where the hinge was going and
then<00:04:22.079> lifted<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:22.979> up<00:04:23.130> like<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.550> then

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
then lifted it up like this and then

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.360 
then lifted it up like this and then
screwed<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.150> into<00:04:24.419> position<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.919> meant

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
screwed it into position and that meant

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.659 
screwed it into position and that meant
that<00:04:26.639> when<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:26.940> closed<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:28.680> actually<00:04:28.949> fits

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
that when I closed it it actually fits

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.370 
that when I closed it it actually fits
into<00:04:29.970> position<00:04:30.389> whereas<00:04:30.930> when<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.080> did<00:04:31.349> it

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
into position whereas when I did it

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.990 
into position whereas when I did it
before<00:04:31.860> where<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.099> was<00:04:32.250> just<00:04:32.370> using<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.759> hinge

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
before where I was just using the hinge

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.999 
before where I was just using the hinge
lining<00:04:33.389> this<00:04:33.479> up<00:04:33.690> what<00:04:34.020> was<00:04:34.169> happening<00:04:34.620> was<00:04:34.770> I

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
lining this up what was happening was I

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.370 
lining this up what was happening was I
needed<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.490> twist<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.060> lid<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.840> make<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:37.139> fit

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
needed to twist the lid to make it fit

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.810 
needed to twist the lid to make it fit
so<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.729> mrs.<00:04:40.160> Munez<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.400> can<00:04:41.550> see<00:04:41.729> it

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
so this is mrs. Munez and you can see it

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.540 
so this is mrs. Munez and you can see it
fits<00:04:42.030> down<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:43.139> this<00:04:43.530> edge<00:04:43.830> here<00:04:43.889> which<00:04:44.400> you

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
fits down that this edge here which you

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.439 
fits down that this edge here which you
can<00:04:44.699> see<00:04:44.729> this<00:04:45.270> edge<00:04:45.509> here<00:04:45.590> looks<00:04:46.590> quite<00:04:46.860> neat

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
can see this edge here looks quite neat

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.060 
can see this edge here looks quite neat
so<00:04:48.449> what's<00:04:48.630> gonna<00:04:48.810> happen<00:04:49.229> is<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.889> little

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
so what's gonna happen is that little

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.589 
so what's gonna happen is that little
piece<00:04:50.310> are<00:04:50.490> gonna<00:04:50.669> stick<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.150> edge<00:04:51.270> there

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
piece are gonna stick on the edge there
