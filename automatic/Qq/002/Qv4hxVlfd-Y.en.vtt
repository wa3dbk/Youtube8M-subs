00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.300 
game I could not believe how close of an
arcade<00:04:15.630> port<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.140> was<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.859> levels<00:04:17.190> in

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
animation matched the arcade very

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.740 
animation matched the arcade very

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
closely and it made me realize the power

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.909 
closely and it made me realize the power
of<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.080> Super<00:04:22.349> Nintendo

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
rather than pick a straight path through

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.249 
rather than pick a straight path through
the<00:04:33.330> game<00:04:33.479> so<00:04:33.659> that<00:04:33.689> was<00:04:33.960> really<00:04:34.169> interesting

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
the game so that was really interesting

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:36.749 
so you could go do some levels and earn

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.869 
so you could go do some levels and earn
money<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.259> buy<00:04:37.409> better<00:04:37.830> chests<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.460> know<00:04:38.580> to
