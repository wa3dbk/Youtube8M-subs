00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
no I can get adequate protein and I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.700 
no I can get adequate protein and I
decided<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> pick<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:55.980> these<00:00:56.160> smart<00:00:56.520> ones<00:00:56.910> and

$4<00:01:56.069> so<00:01:57.289> it's<00:01:58.289> there<00:01:58.920> they're<00:01:59.689> basically

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
$4 so it's there they're basically

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.429

the<00:02:04.439> tenders<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.890> 12<00:02:05.189> grams<00:02:05.459> protein<00:02:05.640> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the tenders have 12 grams protein I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.300 
the tenders have 12 grams protein I
think<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> breast<00:02:07.259> has<00:02:07.469> 15<00:02:07.950> grams<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.250> protein

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
think the breast has 15 grams of protein

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.479 
think the breast has 15 grams of protein
and<00:02:08.910> they're<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.890> retained<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.160> kosher

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and they're just retained with kosher

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.309 
and they're just retained with kosher
salt<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.540> they're<00:02:12.840> Harley<00:02:13.349> process<00:02:14.040> at<00:02:14.579> all

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
salt so they're Harley process at all

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.119 
salt so they're Harley process at all
and<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.410> keep<00:02:16.650> these<00:02:16.799> pairs<00:02:17.329> because<00:02:18.890> they<00:02:19.890> have

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
and I keep these pairs because they have

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.390 
and I keep these pairs because they have
4<00:02:20.489> grams<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.239> fiber<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.870> them<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:23.160> they're

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
4 grams of fiber in them and they're

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.920 
4 grams of fiber in them and they're
kind<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.640> sweet

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
trouble and they have some fiber if you

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.289 
trouble and they have some fiber if you
don't<00:02:31.799> supplement<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.459> like<00:02:32.609> been<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> fiber

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
don't supplement with like been a fiber

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.590 
don't supplement with like been a fiber
or<00:02:33.510> something<00:02:34.139> like<00:02:34.319> that<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.889> a<00:02:35.480> lot<00:02:36.480> of

for the can is two servings and 24 grams
of<00:03:31.310> protein<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:31.730> if<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.180> have<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.690> serving<00:03:33.140> it

of protein so if you have the serving it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.970 
of protein so if you have the serving it
is<00:03:34.310> 12<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.840> think<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.140> cans<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:36.709> 4

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980

used to get the big bags and sounds like
they're<00:04:17.479> coming<00:04:17.690> like<00:04:18.049> two<00:04:18.380> pounds<00:04:18.889> um<00:04:19.699> banks

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.839 
they're coming like two pounds um banks
but<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.680> wasn't<00:04:22.009> why<00:04:22.190> more<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.699> they<00:04:22.820> had<00:04:23.090> um

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
grams of protein I think each piece is 4

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.230 
grams of protein I think each piece is 4
ounces<00:04:32.449> and<00:04:32.990> it's<00:04:33.199> seasoned<00:04:33.680> really<00:04:33.949> good<00:04:34.849> my
