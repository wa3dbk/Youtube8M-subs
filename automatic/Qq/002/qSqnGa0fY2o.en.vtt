play those strings open that's a strain

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
play those strings open that's a strain
and<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.160> did<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.300> common

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and what you did is a very common

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680 
and what you did is a very common
mistake<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.800> Oh<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.270> did<00:00:48.480> was<00:00:48.660> you

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
mistake actually Oh what you did was you

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.000 
mistake actually Oh what you did was you
played<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.289> g5<00:00:50.219> chord<00:00:50.850> which<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:52.559> another

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
played a g5 chord which it's another

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
played a g5 chord which it's another
variation<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> gee<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.360> almost<00:00:54.600> more

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
variation of a gee it's almost more

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.270 
variation of a gee it's almost more
common<00:00:55.379> than<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> g<00:00:55.710> because<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.920> has<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> kind

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
common than the g because it has a kind

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
common than the g because it has a kind
of<00:00:56.430> cooler<00:00:56.670> sound<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.629> there<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.140> your

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of cooler sound see there we go your

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
of cooler sound see there we go your
visit<00:00:59.219> G<00:00:59.370> major<00:00:59.629> classically<00:01:00.629> you're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
visit G major classically you're

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.860 
visit G major classically you're
supposed<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.859> play<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> note<00:01:03.449> it's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
supposed to not play that note it's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
supposed to not play that note it's
actually<00:01:03.960> easier<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> play<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.100> note<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
actually easier to play with that note I

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.570 
actually easier to play with that note I
think<00:01:05.519> yeah<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.290> play<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
think yeah you can play it like that the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.539 
think yeah you can play it like that the
you<00:01:09.180> know<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> open<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:09.960> standard<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> g5

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you know the open way standard or the g5

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.030 
you know the open way standard or the g5
way<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.540> nice<00:01:12.720> little<00:01:13.110> variation<00:01:13.680> gives<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
way the nice little variation gives it a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.859 
way the nice little variation gives it a
slight<00:01:14.310> different<00:01:14.729> sound<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.600> not

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
slight different sound there you go not

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.600 
slight different sound there you go not
a<00:01:15.900> big<00:01:16.110> deal<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.320> there's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> whole<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:17.280> way

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
a big deal but there's a whole other way

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
a big deal but there's a whole other way
to<00:01:17.670> play<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> G<00:01:18.240> major<00:01:18.450> chord<00:01:18.630> which<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.140> the
