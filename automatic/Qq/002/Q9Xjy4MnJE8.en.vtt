00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
hey youtube this is my automatic egg

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey youtube this is my automatic egg
turner<00:00:04.770> turning<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.879> eggs<00:00:06.060> now<00:00:06.569> at<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
turner turning the eggs now at the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.230 
turner turning the eggs now at the
moment<00:00:07.319> when<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.309> red<00:00:08.490> light<00:00:08.700> comes<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.179> it

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
moment when the red light comes on it

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
moment when the red light comes on it
means<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.719> turning<00:00:12.980> can't<00:00:13.980> hardly<00:00:14.280> see<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
means it's turning can't hardly see it

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.290 
means it's turning can't hardly see it
though<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:18.770> it<00:00:19.770> takes<00:00:20.070> twenty<00:00:20.609> minutes<00:00:20.880> for<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
though so it takes twenty minutes for it

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:35.209 
though so it takes twenty minutes for it
to<00:00:23.390> do<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> half<00:00:25.019> turn<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.490> motor<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:34.219> here

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
to do a half turn of the motor and here

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.130 
to do a half turn of the motor and here
is<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.090> where<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> motor<00:00:36.899> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
is what here is where the motor is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.760 
is what here is where the motor is
turning

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.860 

okay<00:00:48.040> you<00:00:49.040> know<00:00:49.130> that<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.850> engine<00:00:50.660> motor

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
okay you know that the engine motor

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.730 
okay you know that the engine motor
comes<00:00:51.170> through<00:00:51.470> here<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.940> just<00:00:53.930> forces<00:00:54.500> this

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 
comes through here and just forces this

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.700 
comes through here and just forces this
rack<00:00:55.130> wracking<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:55.960> either<00:00:56.960> move<00:00:57.230> up<00:00:57.440> or<00:00:57.650> down

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
rack wracking to either move up or down

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.250 
rack wracking to either move up or down
now<00:00:58.100> it's<00:00:58.280> at<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.000> moment<00:00:59.330> it's<00:00:59.420> going<00:00:59.630> down

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
now it's at the moment it's going down

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.100 
now it's at the moment it's going down
that<00:01:00.500> way<00:01:02.260> but<00:01:03.640> then<00:01:04.640> does<00:01:05.120> it<00:01:05.239> force<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:05.900> does

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
that way but then does it force it does

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.380 
that way but then does it force it does
a<00:01:06.140> half<00:01:06.470> cycle<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:07.460> when<00:01:07.610> it<00:01:07.729> does<00:01:08.150> the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
a half cycle and then when it does the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.840 
a half cycle and then when it does the
next<00:01:08.570> cycle<00:01:08.840> it'll<00:01:09.140> start<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.620> push<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.220> back

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
next cycle it'll start to push this back

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.810 
next cycle it'll start to push this back
up<00:01:11.090> again<00:01:11.619> so<00:01:12.619> it'll<00:01:12.770> turn<00:01:12.979> that<00:01:13.190> way<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:13.729> at

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
up again so it'll turn that way so at

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.090 
up again so it'll turn that way so at
the<00:01:13.910> moment<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.050> eggs<00:01:15.170> are<00:01:15.290> going<00:01:15.619> gonna

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
the moment and the eggs are going gonna

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:29.940 
the moment and the eggs are going gonna
be<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:16.460> way<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:25.220> rotisserie<00:01:25.880> mode<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:28.240> 2.5

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
be that way the rotisserie mode is a 2.5

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.780 
be that way the rotisserie mode is a 2.5
rpm<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:32.210> that's<00:01:32.390> two-and-a-half<00:01:33.790> revolutions

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
rpm so that's two-and-a-half revolutions

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.900 
rpm so that's two-and-a-half revolutions
per<00:01:34.940> minute<00:01:36.130> but<00:01:37.130> you'd<00:01:37.520> be<00:01:37.640> better<00:01:37.820> off

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
per minute but you'd be better off

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.910 
per minute but you'd be better off
getting<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.830> getting<00:01:39.830> one<00:01:40.100> off<00:01:41.470> ebay<00:01:42.470> that's

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
getting a getting one off ebay that's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.420 
getting a getting one off ebay that's
about<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.340> don't<00:01:43.670> know<00:01:43.820> maybe<00:01:44.530> fifteen<00:01:45.530> rpm<00:01:46.160> and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
about I don't know maybe fifteen rpm and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.230 
about I don't know maybe fifteen rpm and
then<00:01:46.640> using<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.180> with<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.509> windscreen<00:01:48.440> wiper

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
then using it with the windscreen wiper

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.800 
then using it with the windscreen wiper
motor<00:01:50.240> gearbox<00:01:53.200> what<00:01:54.200> else<00:01:54.350> can<00:01:54.649> i<00:01:54.819> but<00:01:55.819> with

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
motor gearbox what else can i but with

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.550 
motor gearbox what else can i but with
the<00:01:57.069> wiring<00:01:58.069> that<00:01:58.220> I've<00:01:58.369> done<00:01:58.550> on<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.149> I

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
the wiring that I've done on this so I

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.430 
the wiring that I've done on this so I
pulled<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.729> 12<00:02:01.729> volt<00:02:02.000> adapter<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.660> power<00:02:02.959> you

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
pulled the 12 volt adapter a power you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.279 
pulled the 12 volt adapter a power you
can<00:02:03.590> see<00:02:03.770> I've<00:02:03.890> hot<00:02:04.069> glued<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.429> back<00:02:04.459> together

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
can see I've hot glued it back together

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.480 
can see I've hot glued it back together
pulled<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.410> apart<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:07.899> wired<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.979> he

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
pulled it apart and wired it so he

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.449 
pulled it apart and wired it so he
didn't<00:02:10.789> have<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.030> two<00:02:11.209> pins<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.280> need

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
didn't have the two pins that you need

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.250 
didn't have the two pins that you need
to<00:02:13.550> plug<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.880> wall<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.420> knock<00:02:14.930> them<00:02:15.140> out

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
to plug in the wall and knock them out

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.730 
to plug in the wall and knock them out
with<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.500> hammer<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:16.580> hardwired<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.959> the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
with a hammer and hardwired it to the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.070 
with a hammer and hardwired it to the
main<00:02:19.099> power<00:02:19.430> here<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:21.380> I've<00:02:21.530> also<00:02:21.709> wired<00:02:23.080> it

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
main power here and I've also wired it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.880 
main power here and I've also wired it
to<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.890> light<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:27.380> this<00:02:27.560> motor

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
to the light and to this to this motor

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.150 
to the light and to this to this motor
which<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.690> 240<00:02:29.690> volt<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.880> also<00:02:32.660> into<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.160> so

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
which is 240 volt and also into this so

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
which is 240 volt and also into this so
getting<00:02:34.940> rid<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.209> all<00:02:35.360> those<00:02:35.540> power<00:02:36.260> cords<00:02:37.180> it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
getting rid of all those power cords it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.680 
getting rid of all those power cords it
sort<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.450> makes<00:02:38.660> things<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.349> bit<00:02:39.380> more<00:02:39.709> simple

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.200 

this<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.440> an<00:02:43.590> added<00:02:44.060> temperature<00:02:45.060> gauge

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
this is just an added temperature gauge

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.450 
this is just an added temperature gauge
it<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.600> putting<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.260> check<00:02:46.590> temperatures

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
it up putting just to check temperatures

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.960 
it up putting just to check temperatures
around<00:02:51.080> these<00:02:52.080> racks<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.710> hold<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.850> hundred

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
around these racks to hold a hundred

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.220 
around these racks to hold a hundred
eggs<00:02:54.300> each<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:59.400> there's<00:02:59.760> three<00:03:00.210> three<00:03:00.960> racks

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
eggs each and there's three three racks

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.110 
eggs each and there's three three racks
so<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.770> made<00:03:01.950> these<00:03:02.130> racks<00:03:02.490> out<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:03.290> that

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
so just made these racks out of that

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.770 
so just made these racks out of that
steel<00:03:06.120> wire<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:08.010> get<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.780> then

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
steel wire that you can get and then

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.020 
steel wire that you can get and then
made<00:03:10.290> all<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.470> these<00:03:10.800> selling<00:03:11.340> mininum<00:03:11.640> frames

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
made all of these selling mininum frames

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.810 
made all of these selling mininum frames
so<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:13.680> can<00:03:13.830> see<00:03:14.010> how<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.340> works<00:03:14.580> anyways<00:03:15.090> just

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820
