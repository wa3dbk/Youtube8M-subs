00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 hey wyckoff 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.180
 what happens seniors who call me and 360 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.509
 nothing like a lot more is being 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.310
 asking around for the comments 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.220
 and other colleagues my opinion on the 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.140
 famous ballad destination for day 7 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.009
 has not decided to upload in this video to 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.970
 aspire a little more 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.989
 Above all, we apologize because 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.989
 I have breathed 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.040
 I wanted because a truth 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 good a radio user watching all 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.110
 the discontents that are generating 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.480
 destination and offering next dlc the 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.300
 unfortunate comments from his 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.100
 creative director and so on 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.449
 network user implant a bit the idea 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.180
 to make a good time next 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.129
 day 7 with which to protest not when 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.510
 this one not connecting me any moves 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.300
 it would be to neighbors 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.190
 because day 7 has been a good day 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:15.280
 Many believe that it is a day of peace 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:18.010
 77 is bullying in the 7 17 2007 bulli 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.320
 celebrate that day will have like 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.060
 rewarding its users to their 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.800
 players as a reward 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.979
 specials would be the game with some 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.320
 special game modes and others in the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.369
 what teams like me and playable by 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.369
 example 3 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 7 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.450
 the specials and others 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.320
 to see 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.479
 and nothing waiting for this above all 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.460
 because he gave many comments about 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.110
 all where more is just a group of 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.090
 terror 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.159
 it's a facebook group that we have to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.520
 count and most 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.729
 to stay or talk about 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.890
 destination there are many people who will suffer 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.959
 a lot of what processes them little is 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.420
 put the photo that one day 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.120
 since not like that but gave away a 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.560
 nice high emblem on it as is and 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.180
 good and start the comments of 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.069
 what guti gave away made for 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.859
 to buy them and that we want the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.049
 good visual strike that really this 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.879
 it's just the opposite to the 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.129
 strike is done that day because it's in 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.810
 the day of bungie day is the day that has 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.900
 gathered to do things and that the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.510
 that we are afraid of why that decision 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.890
 and now we go I wanted to explain that the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.950
 points a bit why I went to the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.569
 strike and because I knew the 17 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.600
 when it is already going to happen and look for what 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.420
 it would be me 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.550
 because it would be very good is a big dilemma 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.830
 this about the strike I agree with 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.060
 reason for the strike but I 'm not so 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.810
 agreement with the impact that could 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.420
 have to do the law has been erased 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.920
 apart that there are many comments because 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.990
 is not reading many comments are 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.850
 looking in ways by to see the subject 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.270
 the return as they were repeating if the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.900
 people talked a lot about it 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.750
 and really practically the community 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.400
 Hispanic Bungie are the only ones 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.220
 they are talking about the roe to make 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.230
 back and more 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.150
 I say unfocused unfortunately 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.560
 for bungie and for a lot of games the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.020
 Hispanic community we are making a 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.690
 reason has nothing to them in 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.670
 account for very little procedural 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.530
 but now and we are and there is the vote 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.600
 plus another tasks point 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.550
 tell them that to carlos for very 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.310
 well one day we do not have to not connect 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.770
 neither will it affect you much 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.600
 that act for those I'm going to burn 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.370
 nobody does not connect you in a day and 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.680
 probably on day 8 if this one 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.120
 transferred by workers after knowing 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.450
 of base many people who do not connect 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.130
 but hey I think is not about 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.069
 all seeing people as read a 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.810
 comment that for example legit 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.790
 support homework take the emblem and not 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.760
 come the players want to see and it's done 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.310
 the strike on the 7th is so that nobody 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.480
 between 200 welcomes your little gifts of fear 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.850
 Well, here you go, you're thinking 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.470
 that the cmt is ethical in your home, not what 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.390
 you put in all day doing good 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.460
 as I am saying I surely the 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.020
 second strike to spend the day 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.240
 probably killing zombies in each 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.370
 side playing the Smurfs whatever 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.380
 ok I do not see it useful but I'm going to 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.340
 I can hardly do anything because if you have 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.900
 stayed although people are not going to 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.729
 connect because I second more than not 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.020
 sure will be that day we have many 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.020
 games that neither 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.419
 specific 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.229
 is that more premiums counted 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.370
 leave everything to the opinion 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.330
 for me what would be a 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.890
 it would really be a good stretch of 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.750
 repercussion does not call it by a form 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.170
 he agreed 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.670
 It's very hard for me to strike 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.070
 crushed resolution since a large 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.260
 thing or a great big part of the 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.660
 community agreed not to 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.160
 buy the df for example specials that 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.810
 tell us what to put with xtrader 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.480
 italics in most of the community 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.250
 Do not buy an LG or we do not buy 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.540
 selling live on the whole pack 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.060
 special melt but if you 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.390
 We used to buy them a couple of 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.430
 twenty euros that is in use in the 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.470
 respect for that of something if people 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.970
 they buy by subjugating cheap ones like 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:48.430
 depending on being afraid to have you 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.870
 they will sell low at 30 euros for the 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.350
 desperate people who do not have it 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.120
 because there where there is a strike d 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.550
 and I think that is where it would reverberate 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.080
 quite because regulation because they 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.680
 we touch a weak point your point more 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.880
 important money 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:10.820
 if everyone will not buy the pound this 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.330
 it's money that the stimulus that bungie does not 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.490
 he pockets his state in his fight is a 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.840
 vital sign for the problem that I am 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.340
 very difficult is very useful and that all the 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.260
 community agrees and that what 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.820
 do above all a little bit talking about 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.110
 video game in this case a video game 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.030
 that although it does not take care of multi search 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.280
 in many ways I'm not hooked 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.950
 with all the weights we do not like 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.780
 many aspects that you do not have now 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.790
 so what happens that people who have 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.250
 money and is have work with the neighborhood 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.750
 of the populo and another pacta I buy it in 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.680
 that is very hooked to the very much 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.680
 hooked will do everything possible 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.660
 for doing it 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.639
 total that in the end we will be a few hundred 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.250
 that the first day what we will do this is 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.949
 the day that ended line will not have affected 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.199
 for me about my opinion what to do 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.840
 a good and hurt me skill not 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:57.860
 I want to buy what I do not buy 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.270
 complete against zero 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.270
 As I tell you, it is very complicated 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.979
 and nothing said, I'm an angle with the 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:10.009
 reason is based on the guard does not play 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:12.199
 line 7 usually make them a direct 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:16.360
 would be for the way to kill two 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:22.069
 million gallucci we will be seeing there 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:24.400
 commenting like when he's talking to us 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:24.400
 of it 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.090
 and nothing according to what leaves many points 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.600
 that did not explain two things something that 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:36.470
 it's important then I wanted to give my 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:41.690
 I like to make mussels 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:43.370
 likes but more or less my concept 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.710
 on the board that you liked if not 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.210
 You liked it as in my opinion 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.360
 and nothing the video I hope that I have 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.290
 liked an excessive and you know 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.020
 share them and you are not subscribed to me 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.430
 channel will be a look and subscribe and 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.650
 nothing new what added video using 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.650
 360 doctor and goodbye
