00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 as affected by the changes that 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.100
 there was with the choreography that you had 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.259
 worked then for greater then 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
 we want some english how do you 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.809
 you felt that it happened good if the Saturday 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.580
 it was a very complicated day first that 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.190
 the two sentenced couples were mines 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.190
 and had feelings between cut 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.390
 but it was a very complicated job but 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.020
 when he left very sad he was 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.090
 happy to come has been saved 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:37.040
 I was very upset because the uni and mayra 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.140
 they changed my choreography I had already had 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.870
 before you start is even greater talked about 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.550
 with me Uruguay down and I think you're more 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.740
 responsible for everything and had to have 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.010
 talked to me and did not do it then 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.660
 I was very mortified and I still think 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.900
 what 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.250
 If I had said it before the program 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.840
 I could have had a penalty 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.360
 but with time it could not and nothing 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.400
 today I have not rehearsed with them 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.200
 why 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.690
 I do not know if I will continue to be his 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.100
 choreographer told me to think about it 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.240
 talk to the production and tomorrow to 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.579
 first hour 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.770
 what will happen and I will give an answer 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.330
 let's say you 're going to take today 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.550
 so we can 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.850
 decide if he is going back to work as 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.530
 if I'm really going to take the day 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.619
 today to think things through 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.830
 because sometimes one with the hassle or the 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.990
 hot head does not think well about that 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.840
 I hope it happens today and tomorrow 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.250
 Tuesday we will know better all the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.229
 public will know if I will continue with them 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.149
 well now another point that also good 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.759
 it moved you in some way the same because 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.680
 mayra is if he was visibly seen 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.500
 affected and cried before camera because 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.229
 then of this somehow 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.920
 dt moved what feeling of work the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.100
 it's true that I 'm a bit hard for 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.100
 this 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:07.000
 but the point of view I have clear 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.520
 the technician and my work then I do not 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.190
 take a lot of importance however yes I 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.080
 worries that the artist is right or wrong 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.480
 because that my vision as a choreographer is not 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.330
 only choreography but it keeps 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.570
 keep the artist maintain a peace 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.910
 and emotional and physical before each 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.780
 presentation and then then the hair 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.490
 I do worry afterwards but nothing 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.420
 but when it was annoying as I say 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.610
 the mixed feelings did not have 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.709
 an exact decision or know what 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.220
 do yes is already in sentence a 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.470
 Again, I find it unfair because 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.880
 good because it is a woman who is dedicated 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.220
 to 100% 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.610
 good more than his choreographer lyon de 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.240
 botero so we're not going to see anything 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.710
 what happens but I have a lot of faith that goes 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.930
 to get out of this 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.150
 you really do not know everything that happens and 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.380
 of entering dis present there are many 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.840
 attention to let's say that you are 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.090
 when one of your guys is 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.440
 sentence if really good with so many 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.260
 years of experience and I know what 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.560
 complicated that it is but there is a job 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.040
 behind 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.750
 there is a very strong tension that the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.750
 recurred does not reach Brno 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.150
 in addition also another important thing 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.519
 to mention is that nobody comes to your 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.159
 next sentence with a sentence and 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.230
 the bulletproof perdÃ©s being me 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.840
 I think he will get there 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.890
 and I think it can surprise us and the 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.890
 take out that cup like ayala
