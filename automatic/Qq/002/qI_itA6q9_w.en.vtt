a really cool thing if you didn't know

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
a really cool thing if you didn't know
is<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:58.890> plays<00:00:59.370> fifty

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
thousand objects in the game but you can

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.369 
thousand objects in the game but you can
actually<00:01:02.489> claim<00:01:02.910> over<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.080> still

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
actually claim over but to them is still

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
actually claim over but to them is still
felt<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.129> wasn't<00:01:05.369> enough<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
felt like it wasn't enough so if I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
felt like it wasn't enough so if I
realized<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.380> they'll<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.920> find<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
realized that they'll have to find a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
realized that they'll have to find a
different<00:01:08.490> solution<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.810> analyzed<00:01:10.290> natural

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
different solution and analyzed natural

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
different solution and analyzed natural
movement<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.280> actually<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:12.119> impressive

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
movement is actually really impressive

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.120 
movement is actually really impressive
as<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.020> guys<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> tell<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> gameplay

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
as you guys can tell in the gameplay

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.789 
as you guys can tell in the gameplay
videos<00:01:14.460> trailers<00:01:15.000> etc<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.960> pretty<00:01:16.470> much<00:01:16.619> does

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
videos trailers etc it pretty much does

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.499 
videos trailers etc it pretty much does
allow<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> climb<00:01:17.549> almost<00:01:17.820> everything

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
allow you to climb almost everything

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.940 
allow you to climb almost everything
that<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.470> game<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that you see in the game and the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
that you see in the game and the
animations<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.210> smooth<00:01:21.540> as

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
animations are really really smooth as

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.690 
animations are really really smooth as
well<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.229> guess<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> compare<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
well I guess you can kind of compare it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.609 
well I guess you can kind of compare it
to<00:01:23.850> Mirror's<00:01:24.210> Edge<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.630> even<00:01:24.990> Assassin's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to Mirror's Edge and even Assassin's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.399 
to Mirror's Edge and even Assassin's
Creed<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.420> take<00:01:27.420> their<00:01:27.659> beliefs<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.259> it's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
Creed and take their beliefs but it's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.230 
Creed and take their beliefs but it's
natural<00:01:28.890> movement<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> significant

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
natural movement is a significant

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
natural movement is a significant
evolution<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.020> first-person<00:01:31.350> games<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
evolution in first-person games and the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.490 
evolution in first-person games and the
game<00:01:32.549> programmer<00:01:33.240> said<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:34.079> take<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
game programmer said they might take you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.859 
game programmer said they might take you
five<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.920> six<00:01:35.100> hours<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.670> master<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.689> once

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
five or six hours to master it but once

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.890 
five or six hours to master it but once
you<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.560> will<00:01:37.710> feel<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.159> second<00:01:38.640> nature

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
you do it will feel like second nature

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.210 
you do it will feel like second nature
now<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.079> didn't<00:01:40.350> know<00:01:40.439> dying<00:01:40.770> light<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
now if you didn't know dying light is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520
