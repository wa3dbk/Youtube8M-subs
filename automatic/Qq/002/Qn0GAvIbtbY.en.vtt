 Hi friends, she talks to you reading the blog 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.990
 super cheap or free and in this 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.450
 opportunity I want to teach you how 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.780
 collect all the credits that 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 you receive in the use of the programs of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.560
 reward like bing swat packs and others 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.840
 for example, by being subscribed to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.750
 program rewards this well and for my 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.110
 points that you have accumulated I was able to redeem 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.330
 5 dollars gift card from amazon 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.030
 usually when they exchange bing 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.700
 You can receive the email at 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.340
 next day with the code that you 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.870
 offers the five dollars of the card 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.150
 Gift 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.820
 that is the code that you have to copy to 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.940
 your Amazon account if you asked is the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.020
 amazon solar beam gift card 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.780
 click and copy the code now only 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.870
 I have five dollars that then, no 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.510
 it means that I have to buy it now 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.150
 in amazon I have to use it in amazon 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.490
 I can not keep accumulating all my 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.430
 Gift cards you receive from others 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.430
 programs for example now I'm going to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.790
 redeem another one in swap acz and I'll get 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 another $ 5 gift card and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.430
 so little by little go accumulating all 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.190
 these credits in my amazon account 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.320
 to then be able to buy something 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.020
 significant 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.350
 then only copies of the code 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.920
 then you go to your Amazon account that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.810
 we are here now the amazon account is 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.479
 totally free and you do not have to pay 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.970
 absolutely nothing here in your account 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.600
 Amazon peace where it says for example I already 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.900

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.600
 gift card section you can see how much 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.090

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.800

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.300

 You can see all the cards that 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.620
 I collected using the programs 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.650
 rewards and I've already used them in 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.150

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.610
 attention to goes I mentioned you 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.320

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.750
 you have to spend when you get 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.480
 only five hours save them in your 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.540
 account does not expire and when you already have 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.230
