00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.060 

I<00:01:13.439> forgot<00:01:14.219> another<00:01:14.490> jumper

I forgot another jumper

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.030 
I forgot another jumper
yeah<00:01:17.000> basically<00:01:17.780> what<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:18.350> want<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.620> do<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:18.860> just

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
yeah basically what I want to do is just

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.740 
yeah basically what I want to do is just
supply<00:01:19.370> power<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.180> we<00:01:20.300> can<00:01:20.450> pop<00:01:20.600> the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
supply power to it so we can pop the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.200 
supply power to it so we can pop the
trunk<00:01:21.010> no<00:01:22.010> I<00:01:22.310> think<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:22.610> can<00:01:22.700> jump<00:01:22.940> it<00:01:23.060> from

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
trunk no I think you can jump it from

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.270 
trunk no I think you can jump it from
here

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
here

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.770 
here
it's<00:01:25.280> actually<00:01:25.880> better<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:26.270> get<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.540> from<00:01:26.660> the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it's actually better to get it from the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.110 
it's actually better to get it from the
back<00:01:26.960> okay<00:01:29.860> but<00:01:30.860> we<00:01:31.250> could<00:01:31.370> probably<00:01:31.520> jump<00:01:31.910> you

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
back okay but we could probably jump you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.510 
back okay but we could probably jump you
know<00:01:32.300> it<00:01:32.690> doesn't<00:01:32.960> matter<00:01:33.230> yeah<00:01:33.830> as<00:01:34.130> long<00:01:34.340> as

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
know it doesn't matter yeah as long as

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.160 
know it doesn't matter yeah as long as
this<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:34.760> apply<00:01:34.970> power<00:01:35.270> basically<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.020> way<00:01:36.140> I

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170
