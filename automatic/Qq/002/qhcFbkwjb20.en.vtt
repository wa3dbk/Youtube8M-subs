okay<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.400> think<00:01:25.550> this<00:01:25.789> is<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.149> one<00:01:26.300> that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
okay I think this is just the one that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.910 
okay I think this is just the one that
shows<00:01:26.630> random<00:01:27.080> scenes<00:01:27.320> from<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.710> game<00:01:27.890> so

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
shows random scenes from the game so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.190 
shows random scenes from the game so
that's<00:01:28.490> probably<00:01:34.750> okra<00:01:35.750> debts<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.050> then<00:01:36.140> a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
that's probably okra debts and then a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.950 
that's probably okra debts and then a
time<00:01:36.560> warp<00:01:36.890> that's<00:01:37.100> weird

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
time warp that's weird

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:46.870
