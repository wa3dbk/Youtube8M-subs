00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.250
 today we make a very quick recipe 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.559
 but very tasty we have tails of 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.700
 prawns already shelled and you have to 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:21.439
 zucchini we start from the sugars are 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.869
 already washed we remove the tip here 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:30.130
 let's say we cut a couple for now 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:34.930
 then in the case of a mandolin we slice 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.930
 see slices of this size 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:50.480
 Here we take the skewers e 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.480
 we begin to put the courgette first 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.360
 then the shrimp 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:11.940
 but mazzancolla we take another 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:17.300
 courgette so beautiful gusts this beautiful 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.300
 great perfect 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 let's ask 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.220
 with the courgette we made ours 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.580
 four skewers we take it 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.580
 juicer 23 line 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.780
 here we have finished squeezing i 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.700
 our live 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.280
 now we take a tray we put i 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.560
 our shippers try to keep them one 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.079
 closer so that the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.880
 marinade can get better and there 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.799
 put on the lines 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.860
 we turn immediately the first part stays 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:18.360
 so perfect breath then we add a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.780
 some oil just a little salt 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:29.350
 not so much so it is a bit of 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:32.790
 this chili pepper 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:39.330
 quite hot chilli 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.860
 chili powder and now let's leave 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.050
 marinate for about half an hour 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.990
 trying to report them often enough 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.520
 here our shoppers have marinated 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.090
 see how it changed the color 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.850
 we are practically almost cooked we take 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.320
 some more chili powder 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.500
 still above 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:10.230
 so I do muscle slightly and 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 let's put it on the nice warm grill 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.980
 so we also take online 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.780
 we also take some lemon 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.720
 here is considered that the cooking of 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:44.500
 this mail is very fast because 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:44.500
 now baked in marine ta turn 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.170
 how truly fabulous here it is 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.070
 if you want you can reinforce a little 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:12.650
 red pepper and add a little of the part 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:12.650
 where we hadn't put that beauty 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:26.099
 we put compensatory memory a 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:32.580
 piece of rhyme here and now a little 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:34.229
 of salt without overdoing it anyway 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.360
 we also put it in the marina ta 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.520
 let's put these flakes of salt 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.759
 this would be maldon than really 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.639
 fabulous our shrimp skewer 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.639
