cleaver all the things you need and we

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.080 
cleaver all the things you need and we
took<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:58.010> recipe<00:02:58.459> in<00:02:58.549> here<00:02:58.730> which<00:02:58.879> I<00:02:59.060> think

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
took this recipe in here which I think

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.940 
took this recipe in here which I think
only<00:02:59.389> calls<00:02:59.659> for<00:02:59.750> two<00:02:59.989> or<00:03:00.109> three<00:03:00.260> birds<00:03:00.500> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
only calls for two or three birds and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.910 
only calls for two or three birds and
decided<00:03:01.519> we<00:03:01.670> weren't<00:03:01.849> going<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.389> just

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
decided we weren't going to do it just

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.920 
decided we weren't going to do it just

your kitchen into a cat food prep
service<00:03:08.629> is<00:03:11.799> cats<00:03:12.799> eat<00:03:13.129> raw<00:03:13.459> food<00:03:13.790> yes<00:03:14.090> the

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
service is cats eat raw food yes the

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.559 
service is cats eat raw food yes the
point<00:03:14.629> of<00:03:14.750> this<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.109> to<00:03:15.139> replicate<00:03:15.799> what<00:03:16.569> our

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
point of this is to replicate what our

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.930 
point of this is to replicate what our
two<00:03:17.810> kittens<00:03:18.049> shadow<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.620> Clementine<00:03:19.129> would

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
two kittens shadow and Clementine would

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.539 
two kittens shadow and Clementine would
eat<00:03:20.239> is<00:03:20.449> they<00:03:20.780> were<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.680> last<00:03:21.889> because

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
eat is they were in the last because

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.189 
eat is they were in the last because
obviously<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.329> try<00:03:23.569> to<00:03:23.629> give<00:03:23.840> an<00:03:24.049> animal

obviously you try to give an animal

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.869 
obviously you try to give an animal
instead<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.829> diet<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.250> what<00:03:25.459> they<00:03:25.609> would<00:03:25.730> eat

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
instead of diet and what they would eat

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.729 
instead of diet and what they would eat
is<00:03:26.090> small<00:03:26.989> birds<00:03:27.230> bird<00:03:28.190> feeders<00:03:28.609> mice<00:03:29.739> those

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
is small birds bird feeders mice those

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.980 
is small birds bird feeders mice those
sorts<00:03:31.069> of<00:03:31.129> things<00:03:31.370> rabbits

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
sorts of things rabbits

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.550 
sorts of things rabbits
so<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.690> recipe<00:03:36.020> that's<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.320> here<00:03:36.440> that

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
so this the recipe that's in here that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.050 
so this the recipe that's in here that
were<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.680> follow<00:03:36.740> today<00:03:37.280> attempts<00:03:37.940> to

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
were to follow today attempts to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.200 
were to follow today attempts to
replicate<00:03:38.270> what<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.410> small<00:03:39.740> bird<00:03:40.460> in<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.790> wild

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
replicate what a small bird in the wild

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.850 
replicate what a small bird in the wild
would<00:03:41.480> be<00:03:41.720> with<00:03:42.110> all<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.470> various

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
would be with all the various

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.230 
would be with all the various
supplements<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.490> minerals<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:44.000> part<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
supplements and minerals and part of the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.690 
supplements and minerals and part of the
reason<00:03:44.480> be<00:03:44.540> growing<00:03:44.780> tall<00:03:45.050> chickens<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:46.220> that

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
reason be growing tall chickens is that

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.130 
reason be growing tall chickens is that
when<00:03:46.880> cats<00:03:47.680> eat<00:03:48.680> bird<00:03:49.370> outside<00:03:49.910> they<00:03:50.810> don't

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
when cats eat bird outside they don't

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:59.740 
when cats eat bird outside they don't
leave<00:03:51.740> the<00:03:51.950> most<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.760> on<00:03:59.000> average<00:03:59.240> they're

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
leave the most and on average they're

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.690 
leave the most and on average they're
about<00:03:59.960> two<00:04:00.200> point<00:04:00.470> seven<00:04:00.800> pounds<00:04:01.100> apiece<00:04:01.340> and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
about two point seven pounds apiece and

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.750 
about two point seven pounds apiece and
so<00:04:02.350> eighteen<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:03.500> them<00:04:03.650> will<00:04:04.010> make<00:04:04.040> right

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
so eighteen of them will make right

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.030 
so eighteen of them will make right
around<00:04:05.120> 50<00:04:05.570> pounds<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:05.960> cat<00:04:06.170> food<00:04:06.380> yeah<00:04:06.740> so<00:04:06.920> we

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
around 50 pounds of cat food yeah so we

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.460 
around 50 pounds of cat food yeah so we
know<00:04:07.160> this<00:04:10.240> bread<00:04:11.240> she<00:04:11.420> died<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.050> will<00:04:12.260> try

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
know this bread she died and I will try

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.110 
know this bread she died and I will try
to<00:04:12.500> make<00:04:12.710> this<00:04:12.830> available<00:04:13.070> for<00:04:13.400> download<00:04:13.940> on

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
to make this available for download on

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.150 
to make this available for download on
the<00:04:14.240> website<00:04:14.620> hopefully<00:04:15.620> somewhere

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.340 

yeah<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.269> tell<00:04:21.419> us<00:04:21.479> what<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.780> did

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
yeah so tell us what you did

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.529 
yeah so tell us what you did
well<00:04:22.979> basically<00:04:23.190> we<00:04:23.910> are<00:04:23.940> going<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.330> do<00:04:24.419> this

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
well basically we are going to do this

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.050 
well basically we are going to do this
three<00:04:24.750> or<00:04:24.780> four<00:04:24.960> times<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.229> year<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:26.430> we

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
three or four times a year and so we

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.080 
three or four times a year and so we
extrapolated<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.930> recipe<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.620> be<00:04:28.830> roughly<00:04:29.639> 18

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
extrapolated the recipe to be roughly 18

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.420 
extrapolated the recipe to be roughly 18
birds<00:04:30.330> which<00:04:30.660> we<00:04:30.870> have<00:04:31.080> found<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:32.009> last<00:04:32.190> time

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
birds which we have found the last time

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.700 
birds which we have found the last time
we<00:04:32.550> did<00:04:32.669> this<00:04:32.819> was<00:04:33.120> after<00:04:33.930> Labor<00:04:34.259> Day<00:04:34.470> and

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
we did this was after Labor Day and

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.950 
we did this was after Labor Day and
currently<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.849> is<00:04:35.910> one<00:04:36.569> month

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
currently it is one month

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.629 
currently it is one month
it<00:04:37.199> wasn't<00:04:37.530> around<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.009> currently<00:04:38.370> it's<00:04:38.490> week

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
it wasn't around and currently it's week

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.969 
it wasn't around and currently it's week
before<00:04:38.940> Christmas<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:39.810> three<00:04:40.560> months<00:04:40.800> worth

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
before Christmas so three months worth
