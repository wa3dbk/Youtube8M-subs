00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.770
 hello good to all guys and girls 

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:05.870
 welcome to a new video in this 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.900
 If you bring a box and mysterious 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.090
 this movie ego envelope and nothing 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.360
 guys let's see what we 've got 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.360
 we'll see 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.540
 I already showed you in the first video the 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.830
 brochure so this time we did not skip it 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.830
 and we are going to see what has touched us 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.560
 good guys let's start with the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.180
 torso and this is how you do not notice that it is 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.630
 I think it's a woman in color 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.350
 yellow 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.450
 but what strikes me is that the hands are 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.940
 in gray color the same because it carries water 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.610
 before we go to look from behind does not have 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.320
 nothing and we will continue riding because 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.870
 guys I do not know what I've been serious 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.900
 break with the idea of ​​putting her face 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.750
 oysters 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.830
 it's like the robot is totally a face 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.300
 of robot and if indeed in the envelope in 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.450
 the envelopes of the movies logo there are three 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 robots I want to remember and we like 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.620
 a robot receptionist 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 your face is very cool as you can see 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.280
 it's very good you can see it's a robot 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.229
 by mouth and so on and the metallic color 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.920
 and we are going to continue riding the 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.920
 put on pants 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.540
 and if he has robotic details down there 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.790
 as in the knees 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.850
 and it's pretty cool I like this 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.470
 figure and it comes with a hair that I think that 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.210
 it goes like this 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.060
 that the detail of the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.030
 But I like it 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.579
 and nothing guys this is all nothing comes 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.579
 more like that I was already doing well 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.649
 this is like a kind of folder 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.649
 of secretary or receptionist 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.820

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.410
 for cars from there 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.240
