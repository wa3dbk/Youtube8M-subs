00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello this video is prepared by 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.060
 cycling site request cycle track . 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 link below if you purchased 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.920
 the bike is cool but this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.550
 not enough to go to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.949
 the trip there is a huge number 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.190
 make your skating more enjoyable and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.820
 more convenient and safer 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.579
 it is loyalty 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.010
 as I said a lot of them therefore in 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.470
 At the beginning I will call the required devices. 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.440
 who are needed on a trip to anyone 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.750
 cyclist 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.000
 don't start with the bathroom 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.140
 I think one way or another everyone turns out 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.390
 dark time then we use flashlight 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.920
 first of all the task of the flashlight is to do it 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.530
 you visible to all participants 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.870
 pedestrian traffic 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.400
 depending on where you are 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.170
 and only then 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.270
 and this is especially true in some 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.800
 dark alleys where even a man with 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.260
 excellent vision can be anything 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.000
 fight 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.520
 models of front and rear lights a lot 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.150
 they can be bought both individually and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.170
 the envelope 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.450
 my headlamp is installed 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.810
 him behind one and fasten on the seatpost 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.820
 pin including it on the go when 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.230
 it's necessary 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.090
 further court case 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.100
 leaving your house is a must 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.750
 there will be things that need to be somewhere 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.000
 put 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.550
 mobil keys money and when you on 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 it is convenient to use a bicycle 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.720
 special bicycle bags 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 bags are completely different in shape 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.800
 they are mounted on the steering wheel on the frame 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.290
 models can be attached to the seatpost 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.790
 pin 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.950
 my bike bag is very me 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.290
 like she is comfortable in size 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.480
 capacity she has a stylish look 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.150
 during normal city trips to me 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.190
 fits all the most necessary when 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.940
 food for the far distance of course I take with 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.230
 a backpack bag is mounted on the frame and 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.840
 opening it on the go 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.750
 wings or shields wet and rainy 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.390
 weather during the trip from under the wheels 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.360
 the bike is flying a spray of mud water all 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.780
 it hits you on the back flaps backpack 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.490
 I will be saved by the truth. 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.100
 because I try not to 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.980
 rain and I think they spoil a little 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.220
 the appearance of my bike but akira more than once 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.130
 suffered from their absence 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.450
 Now let's talk about bicycle locks 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.240
 if you need to leave your bike 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.370
 for a while unattended you 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.000
 help sleep 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.000
 viewing 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.190
 Now in our city everywhere 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.520
 are set 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.890
 in the parking lot with a cable to must 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.470
 simultaneously cover the frame and the wheel 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.520
 as the wheels are removed in a few 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.100
 seconds regret bike lock this protection 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.680
 from honest people and a thief can hide 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.080
 almost any lock so how 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.770
 you can rarely leave your bike without 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.000
 sand something 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.270
 sound signals 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.760
 these are various Dudkin calls used 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.280
 to attract the attention of pedestrians 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.320
 and from my own experience I will say that to use 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.920
 they have much more often than you 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.980
 think 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.170
 especially in the central streets of the city 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.810
 setting 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.830
 when big how much 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.450
 I also invented another function 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.640
 thanks to him i signal my 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.040
 friends for example if i need 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:51.239
 stop during the trip and to not 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.239
 scream and wait i just use and 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.340
 the last in my opinion is an important accessory 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.000
 it is a flask for water and hold back as 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.190
 because you want to always and everywhere 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.330
 have rain and such a flask is 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.540
 what does it get right on my 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.130
 there is no such flask because on 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.050
 my handbag frame I just have nowhere 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.700
 and usually during the trip with me 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.310
 always a man with some water 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.770
 the video has come to an end if you 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.300

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.099

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.870

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.770
 additional useful 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.069
