are<00:00:01.890> we<00:00:01.949> talking<00:00:02.220> about<00:00:02.250> seven<00:00:02.700> things<00:00:02.850> that

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
are we talking about seven things that

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.180 
are we talking about seven things that
Apple<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:03.689> wash<00:00:03.929> need<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.259> accomplish<00:00:04.560> to

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
Apple and I wash need to accomplish to

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:18.900 
Apple and I wash need to accomplish to
be<00:00:05.310> immediately<00:00:05.759> relevant

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.190 

the<00:00:19.910> first<00:00:20.150> off<00:00:20.330> number<00:00:20.630> one<00:00:20.810> is<00:00:20.960> that<00:00:21.080> the

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
the first off number one is that the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.320 
the first off number one is that the
iWatch<00:00:21.530> needs<00:00:21.830> to<00:00:21.920> be<00:00:22.040> a<00:00:22.070> watch<00:00:22.430> first<00:00:22.880> and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
iWatch needs to be a watch first and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.790 
iWatch needs to be a watch first and
what<00:00:23.450> I<00:00:23.480> mean<00:00:23.689> by<00:00:23.750> this<00:00:23.930> is<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:24.350> can<00:00:24.439> have<00:00:24.590> a<00:00:24.619> lot

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
what I mean by this is it can have a lot

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.560 
what I mean by this is it can have a lot
of<00:00:24.830> things<00:00:25.040> going<00:00:25.369> on<00:00:25.430> at<00:00:25.610> once<00:00:25.640> but<00:00:26.270> it<00:00:26.390> needs

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
of things going on at once but it needs

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.839 
of things going on at once but it needs
to<00:00:26.779> tell<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.170> time<00:00:27.349> first<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:28.279> iWatch<00:00:28.580> needs

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
to tell the time first the iWatch needs

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.370 
to tell the time first the iWatch needs
to<00:00:28.910> be<00:00:29.000> able<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.210> handle<00:00:29.360> a<00:00:29.570> splash<00:00:29.900> now<00:00:30.170> and

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
to be able to handle a splash now and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.570 
to be able to handle a splash now and
then<00:00:30.500> it<00:00:30.680> needs<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:30.950> have<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.099> distinctive

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
then it needs to have a distinctive

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.950 
then it needs to have a distinctive
display<00:00:31.939> that's<00:00:32.119> going<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.300> concur<00:00:32.629> with<00:00:32.809> the

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
display that's going to concur with the

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.780 
display that's going to concur with the
brightness<00:00:33.170> outside<00:00:33.739> now<00:00:34.040> rarely<00:00:34.309> do<00:00:34.520> I<00:00:34.550> say

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
brightness outside now rarely do I say

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.100 
brightness outside now rarely do I say
that<00:00:34.970> I<00:00:35.000> think<00:00:35.059> Apple<00:00:35.540> should<00:00:35.690> be<00:00:35.809> taking

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
that I think Apple should be taking

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.900 
that I think Apple should be taking
notes<00:00:36.140> from<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.620> different<00:00:37.010> company<00:00:37.129> but<00:00:37.850> I

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
notes from a different company but I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.100 
notes from a different company but I
definitely<00:00:38.239> think<00:00:38.510> that<00:00:38.600> Apple<00:00:38.930> needs<00:00:39.019> to

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
definitely think that Apple needs to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.259 
definitely think that Apple needs to
take<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> closer<00:00:39.620> look<00:00:39.769> and<00:00:40.340> how<00:00:40.460> Motorola<00:00:41.000> is

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
take a closer look and how Motorola is

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.540 
take a closer look and how Motorola is
designing<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.900> Moto<00:00:42.110> 360<00:00:42.650> nice<00:00:43.100> number<00:00:43.400> two

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
designing the Moto 360 nice number two

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.890 
designing the Moto 360 nice number two
is<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.790> iWatch<00:00:44.090> needs<00:00:44.360> to<00:00:44.420> be<00:00:44.510> completely

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
is the iWatch needs to be completely

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.780 
is the iWatch needs to be completely
customizable<00:00:45.769> now<00:00:46.190> in<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.370> first<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.699> admit

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
customizable now in the first to admit

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.520 
customizable now in the first to admit
that<00:00:47.090> I'm<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.239> huge<00:00:47.480> fan<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.809> Android<00:00:48.320> wear

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
that I'm a huge fan of Android wear

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.320 
that I'm a huge fan of Android wear
however<00:00:49.040> there's<00:00:49.220> been<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.370> huge<00:00:49.580> inability<00:00:50.239> to

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
however there's been a huge inability to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.479 
however there's been a huge inability to
let<00:00:50.480> developers<00:00:50.750> create<00:00:51.379> watch<00:00:51.589> faces<00:00:52.070> Apple

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
let developers create watch faces Apple

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.829 
let developers create watch faces Apple
needs<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.790> know<00:00:52.909> that<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:53.150> is<00:00:53.299> not<00:00:53.479> just<00:00:53.510> a

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
needs to know that this is not just a

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.420 
needs to know that this is not just a
watch<00:00:54.049> but<00:00:54.290> it's<00:00:54.440> also<00:00:54.589> a<00:00:54.739> fashion<00:00:55.220> statement

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
watch but it's also a fashion statement

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.100 
watch but it's also a fashion statement
it's<00:00:56.000> basically<00:00:56.360> inevitable<00:00:56.930> that

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
it's basically inevitable that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.329 
it's basically inevitable that
everybody's<00:00:57.470> going<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.650> want<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.860> customize

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
everybody's going to want to customize

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.430 
everybody's going to want to customize
their<00:00:58.519> own<00:00:58.640> i<00:00:58.850> watch<00:00:59.089> in<00:00:59.299> a<00:00:59.360> different<00:00:59.690> way<00:00:59.809> so

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
their own i watch in a different way so

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.960 
their own i watch in a different way so
when<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.680> apple<00:01:00.949> iwatch<00:01:01.220> launches<00:01:01.729> if<00:01:01.850> I

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
when the apple iwatch launches if I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.250 
when the apple iwatch launches if I
can't<00:01:02.180> go<00:01:02.299> to<00:01:02.330> the<00:01:02.449> apple<00:01:02.750> app<00:01:02.870> store<00:01:02.930> and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
can't go to the apple app store and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.020 
can't go to the apple app store and
download<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.619> watch<00:01:03.860> face<00:01:04.159> then<00:01:04.760> I<00:01:04.820> think

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
download a watch face then I think

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.640 
download a watch face then I think
apples<00:01:05.420> already<00:01:05.690> blew<00:01:05.930> it<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:06.500> I<00:01:06.530> think

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
apples already blew it so I think

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.980 
apples already blew it so I think
personalization<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.790> customization<00:01:07.990> is

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
personalization and customization is

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.050 
personalization and customization is
going<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.260> be<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> huge<00:01:09.710> factor<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.159> feature<00:01:10.490> to

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
going to be a huge factor in feature to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.820 
going to be a huge factor in feature to
consumers<00:01:11.600> now<00:01:11.869> Apple<00:01:12.020> also<00:01:12.440> needs<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.710> go<00:01:12.799> a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
consumers now Apple also needs to go a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.649 
consumers now Apple also needs to go a
step<00:01:13.070> above<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:13.640> because<00:01:14.000> personalization

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
step above this because personalization

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.080 
step above this because personalization
is<00:01:14.960> not<00:01:15.170> just<00:01:15.530> software<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:16.580> also<00:01:16.729> hard

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
is not just software but it's also hard

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.700 
is not just software but it's also hard
work<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:17.600> Apple<00:01:17.990> definitely<00:01:18.380> needs<00:01:18.590> to

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
work so Apple definitely needs to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.890 
work so Apple definitely needs to
include<00:01:18.920> swappable<00:01:19.430> wristbands<00:01:20.030> an<00:01:20.270> apple

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
include swappable wristbands an apple

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.300 
include swappable wristbands an apple
can<00:01:21.020> even<00:01:21.229> go<00:01:21.320> as<00:01:21.439> far<00:01:21.470> as<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.799> offer<00:01:22.070> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
can even go as far as to offer the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.950 
can even go as far as to offer the
iWatch<00:01:22.610> in<00:01:22.820> two<00:01:22.970> different<00:01:23.120> sizes<00:01:23.420> which

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
iWatch in two different sizes which

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.360 
iWatch in two different sizes which
they'll<00:01:24.110> probably<00:01:24.290> due<00:01:24.620> to<00:01:24.650> accommodate<00:01:25.190> both

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
they'll probably due to accommodate both

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.190 
they'll probably due to accommodate both
genders<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:26.180> when<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.390> comes<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.690> watches<00:01:27.080> in

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200

months out of a fully functioning
SmartWatch<00:04:51.350> however<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:52.220> think<00:04:52.310> Apple<00:04:52.790> can't

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.190 
SmartWatch however I think Apple can't
introduce<00:04:53.240> something<00:04:53.660> that's<00:04:53.870> going<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.050> last

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
introduce something that's going to last

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.900 
introduce something that's going to last
anywhere<00:04:54.620> from<00:04:54.680> three<00:04:55.040> to<00:04:55.070> four<00:04:55.310> days<00:04:55.340> and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
anywhere from three to four days and

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.310 
anywhere from three to four days and
last<00:04:56.120> thing<00:04:56.300> number<00:04:56.420> seven<00:04:56.810> is<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.050> device

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
last thing number seven is the device

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.660 
last thing number seven is the device
needs<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.680> feel<00:04:57.860> like<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:58.160> isn't<00:04:58.370> even<00:04:58.430> there

so in reality we all want our SmartWatch

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.660 
so in reality we all want our SmartWatch
to<00:05:00.470> be<00:05:00.560> right<00:05:00.740> in<00:05:00.890> our<00:05:00.950> face<00:05:01.130> when<00:05:01.340> we<00:05:01.460> need<00:05:01.640> it

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
to be right in our face when we need it

to be right in our face when we need it
for<00:05:02.300> notifications<00:05:03.050> as<00:05:03.230> well<00:05:03.380> as<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.620> stirring

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
for notifications as well as a stirring

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.680 
for notifications as well as a stirring
or<00:05:04.010> rejecting<00:05:04.400> phone<00:05:04.610> calls<00:05:04.850> however<00:05:05.480> we<00:05:05.630> also

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
or rejecting phone calls however we also

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.780 
or rejecting phone calls however we also
want<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.200> directly<00:05:06.530> out<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:06.770> our<00:05:07.010> way<00:05:07.160> whenever

want it directly out of our way whenever
we<00:05:07.910> don't<00:05:08.120> need<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.420> I<00:05:08.540> think<00:05:08.870> this<00:05:08.930> is<00:05:08.990> going

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
we don't need it I think this is going

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.570 
we don't need it I think this is going
to<00:05:09.260> be<00:05:09.380> an<00:05:09.470> extremely<00:05:09.830> important<00:05:10.370> feature
