00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi are you watching video lesson number 56 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.540
 watercolor 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.670
 in this lesson I will show and tell you how 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.769
 make a loop on the bauble straight 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.199
 weaving 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.779
 you can watch my lesson number 16 and 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.440
 learn how to make a loop on a bauble 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:18.349
 oblique weaving 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.320
 and also having watched lesson 45 learn three 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.689
 kinds of eyelet there are two options 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.329
 eyelets on the corolla straight weave 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.649
 let's sort the first option for such 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.899
 the way you need a circuit 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.610
 whose upright extreme 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.219
 row on the left or extreme row on the right 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.370
 completely has a background color that is on 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.930
 these rows are not we weaving the warp 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.060
 same amount of warp should 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.000
 to be odd I chose this scheme 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.950
 there are 15 warp threads in it and extreme rows not 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.010
 have words in the warp 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.630
 so this circuit will suit me 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.670
 the only one I would change the colors of the thread 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.760
 the basics of me will be yellow athos 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.270
 black and so the scheme I have 15 threads 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.360
 the basics 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.500
 subtract one thread later you will understand why 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.830
 14 warp threads are the 14 threads 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.840
 are yellow I take the thread 7 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.240
 there is 2 times less than the required scheme 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.490
 number of warp but twice 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.760
 longer that is one thread the base should 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 be equal to 70 centimeters 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.880
 then I take each elongated 140 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.820
 centimeters and so in the end I cut 7 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.250
 140 centimeter yarn each 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.640
 then I take the lead thread wound on 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.140
 bobbin measuring 70 centimeters of this not those 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.140
 i.e. length 1 warp thread 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.409
 as you already understood 15 warp threads will 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.990
 made from lead thread 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.340
 fix the length of the reel take 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.220
 folded 7 warp threads 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.380
 add the leading thread to them 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.010
 I do it the way I do 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.010
 showing 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.360
 but 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.360
 I take one long thread from his bundle 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.970
 to make the loop itself 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.310
 it will be a working thread and and folding 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.490
 Now we are passing the working thread in half 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.230
 loop formed by the warp threads then 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.260
 edges working thread and thread through the loop 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.850
 formed by her and tighten it seems 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.850
 on the mount keychain on the phone 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.910
 mark up the zenith so working 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.460
 thread and share 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.620
 now take 1 end of the working thread and 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.620
 we begin to weave wedding 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.790
 we put the thread on all the threads of the warp and 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 we pass it in the formed loop 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.000
 down up 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 delaying 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.040
 Now we put a working thread under all 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.260
 warp threads and thread it in 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.609
 the resulting song from top to bottom and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.859
 tighten the first knot again 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.540
 such nodes end of the working thread of all 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.540
 need to do about 7 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.480
 seven knots ready now we turn over 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.910
 threads to make the second edge of the working thread 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.210
 so that they can weave 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.280
 but then in the same way we make seven 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.280
 knots by the second end of the working thread 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.849
 here the loop is ready 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.420
 now take a few unnecessary threads 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.830
 cross them with a loop and so 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.489
 attach to the working 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.890
 surface 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.540
 this is done so that the loop is not 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.540
 slipped out of reinforcements 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.030
 as you can see in our left strand 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.249
 there is a black thread which basis 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.530
 was made from leading of right 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.159
 it turned out the leading thread can begin 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.810
 weaving 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.169
 now I will talk about the second method 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.699
 loops on a straight weaving bauble 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.800
 This method is suitable for those baubles 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.150
 scheme which have in the ranks of the extreme you 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.699
 came on and the warp threads 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.069
 an example of such schemes you see on the screen 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.770
 it is also important that the number of warp threads 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:46.199
 according to the scheme should be even and so 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.050
 cut the warp thread just like in the first 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.139
 There are two times fewer in number 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.919
 twice the length, fold all 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.919
 these threads in half 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.440
 now take one of the warp threads and 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.000
 This thread also make a loop again 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.000
 as shown in the first method 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.189
 loop ready 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.200
 Now attach the loop to the working 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.200
 surface 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:45.919
 take a skein of lead thread attach 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.919
 its end is near the beginning of the bauble 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.040
 Well, now begin to weave you need 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.870
 following the pattern 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.760
 i start my bauble way 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.550
 bauble extensions right off the weave 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.310
 number 1 video lesson number 21 you can 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.560
 learn more about this method after 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.110
 after you passed some part of the bauble 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.840
 you need to secure the end of the lead 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.750
 threads for this cut a little this 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.540
 end 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.950
 and glue super glue it wrong 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.950
 side baubles 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.949
