those specific materials and my overall

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.850 
those specific materials and my overall
gold<00:05:57.120> I<00:05:57.479> got<00:05:58.020> 1.3<00:05:58.890> k<00:05:59.150> before<00:06:00.200> selling<00:06:01.200> the<00:06:01.590> job

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
gold I got 1.3 k before selling the job

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.740 
gold I got 1.3 k before selling the job
so<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.160> got<00:06:02.520> 1.3<00:06:03.419> k<00:06:03.630> on<00:06:03.930> solely<00:06:04.919> gold<00:06:05.669> drops<00:06:06.240> so

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
so I got 1.3 k on solely gold drops so

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.980 
so I got 1.3 k on solely gold drops so
I'd<00:06:07.500> say<00:06:07.770> this<00:06:07.919> area<00:06:08.340> has<00:06:08.700> a<00:06:08.729> high<00:06:09.120> rate<00:06:09.960> of

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
I'd say this area has a high rate of

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.430 
I'd say this area has a high rate of
dropping<00:06:10.680> gold<00:06:11.070> like<00:06:11.940> hundreds<00:06:12.419> of<00:06:12.510> coins<00:06:12.810> per

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
dropping gold like hundreds of coins per

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.250 
dropping gold like hundreds of coins per
run<00:06:13.680> so<00:06:14.280> I<00:06:14.580> guess<00:06:14.910> that's<00:06:15.240> good<00:06:15.510> but<00:06:16.080> then

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
run so I guess that's good but then

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.020 
run so I guess that's good but then
after<00:06:16.590> selling<00:06:17.220> all<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:17.490> items<00:06:17.850> that

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
after selling all the items that

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.270 
after selling all the items that
includes<00:06:18.510> the<00:06:18.690> gold<00:06:18.900> items<00:06:19.229> and<00:06:19.560> my<00:06:20.160> other

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
includes the gold items and my other

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.410 
includes the gold items and my other
drops<00:06:20.940> I<00:06:21.240> only<00:06:21.660> got<00:06:21.840> 3.8<00:06:22.680> k

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
drops I only got 3.8 k

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.770 
drops I only got 3.8 k
which<00:06:24.110> is<00:06:24.410> very<00:06:24.920> disappointing<00:06:25.370> because<00:06:26.060> you

that q9 the Gothic defender suffered a

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.440 
that q9 the Gothic defender suffered a
