rolls-royce and i'm here today to talk
to<00:00:11.549> you<00:00:11.730> primarily<00:00:12.410> about<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.770> fuel<00:00:14.039> in<00:00:14.340> terms

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
to you primarily about the fuel in terms

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.980 
to you primarily about the fuel in terms
of<00:00:15.029> its<00:00:15.209> use<00:00:15.959> today<00:00:17.300> rolls-royce<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.600> part<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
of its use today rolls-royce is part of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.330 
of its use today rolls-royce is part of
this<00:00:19.080> process<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.740> i<00:00:19.830> want<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> talk<00:00:20.279> about

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
this process that i want to talk about

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.239 
this process that i want to talk about
is<00:00:20.880> how<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.810> got<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> point<00:00:22.800> where<00:00:23.070> we

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:23.249 
is how we got to the point where we

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.880 
is how we got to the point where we
proved<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.119> fuel<00:00:24.329> for<00:00:24.570> today's<00:00:24.839> flight<00:00:25.259> but

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
proved the fuel for today's flight but

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.679 
proved the fuel for today's flight but
before<00:00:26.159> i<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.429> that<00:00:26.460> i'd<00:00:27.060> like<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.419> give<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
before i do that i'd like to give you a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.470 
before i do that i'd like to give you a
bit<00:00:27.839> of<00:00:27.869> background<00:00:28.140> about<00:00:28.679> fuel

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
bit of background about fuel

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
bit of background about fuel
specifications<00:00:30.499> and<00:00:31.499> the<00:00:31.800> properties<00:00:32.250> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
specifications and the properties that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.100 
specifications and the properties that
we<00:00:32.550> require<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.660> builds<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.079> what

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
we require and it builds on what

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.290 
we require and it builds on what
Jennifer<00:00:35.010> said<00:00:35.220> about<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.670> need<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.090> drop

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
Jennifer said about the need for a drop

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.570 
Jennifer said about the need for a drop
in<00:00:36.480> fuel<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:36.930> meets<00:00:37.140> today's<00:00:37.580> fuel

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
in fuel that meets today's fuel

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.650 
in fuel that meets today's fuel
performance<00:00:39.120> requirements<00:00:41.270> energy<00:00:42.270> storage

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
performance requirements energy storage

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.060 
performance requirements energy storage
in<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> aircraft<00:00:43.080> this<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:43.650> first<00:00:43.890> one

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
in the aircraft this is the first one

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.350 
in the aircraft this is the first one
and<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.310> seems<00:00:44.490> pretty<00:00:44.670> obvious<00:00:44.790> that<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and it seems pretty obvious that the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.120 
and it seems pretty obvious that the
feels<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.810> energy<00:00:46.110> storage<00:00:46.530> medium<00:00:46.950> what

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
feels the energy storage medium what

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.440 
feels the energy storage medium what
isn't<00:00:47.460> perhaps<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.850> obvious<00:00:48.240> is<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
isn't perhaps so obvious is that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.350 
isn't perhaps so obvious is that
kerosene<00:00:49.080> is<00:00:49.260> an<00:00:49.410> excellent<00:00:49.880> energy<00:00:50.880> storage

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
kerosene is an excellent energy storage

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.530 
kerosene is an excellent energy storage
from<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> density<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:53.040> both<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.760> density<00:00:54.360> per

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
from a density from both a density per

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.080 
from a density from both a density per
unit<00:00:54.900> mass<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.980> density<00:00:56.490> per<00:00:56.640> unit<00:00:56.940> volume

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.480 
unit mass and a density per unit volume
and<00:00:57.540> it's<00:00:58.110> very<00:00:58.410> difficult<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.130> all<00:00:59.400> the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
and it's very difficult for all the

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.180 
and it's very difficult for all the
fuels<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.880> compete<00:01:00.360> with<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.770> not<00:01:01.770> only<00:01:01.950> does

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
fuels to compete with that not only does

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.910 
fuels to compete with that not only does
it<00:01:02.340> affect<00:01:02.670> range<00:01:03.450> in<00:01:03.750> payload<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.890> course

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it affect range in payload but of course

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770 
it affect range in payload but of course
if<00:01:05.250> you've<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.610> sort<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.150> some<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> first

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
if you've got sort of some of the first

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
if you've got sort of some of the first
generation<00:01:06.920> biofuels<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.369> oxygen

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
generation biofuels that have got oxygen

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670 
generation biofuels that have got oxygen
in<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.690> in<00:01:09.840> effect<00:01:09.960> dead<00:01:10.409> weight

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
in there that is in effect dead weight

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.550 
in there that is in effect dead weight
so<00:01:11.370> you're<00:01:11.550> carrying<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.090> weight<00:01:12.150> round<00:01:12.690> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so you're carrying that weight round and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.420 
so you're carrying that weight round and
you<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:13.920> increase<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.520> carbon<00:01:14.820> dioxide

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
you would increase your carbon dioxide

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
you would increase your carbon dioxide
emissions<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:19.140> know

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
emissions because of that you know

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.830 
emissions because of that you know
carrying<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> weight<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.360> getting<00:01:21.720> any

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
carrying the weight and not getting any

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.520 
carrying the weight and not getting any
benefit<00:01:22.290> from<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.479> second<00:01:24.840> point<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
benefit from it the second point is is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.830 
benefit from it the second point is is
the<00:01:25.830> fuel<00:01:26.070> has<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.760> operate<00:01:26.850> over<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.690> wide

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the fuel has to operate over a very wide

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.260 
the fuel has to operate over a very wide
temperature<00:01:28.380> range<00:01:28.710> has<00:01:29.610> already<00:01:29.790> said

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
temperature range has already said

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.390 
temperature range has already said
there's<00:01:30.510> fries<00:01:30.870> point<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.290> minus<00:01:31.650> 47<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
there's fries point of minus 47 is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.570 
there's fries point of minus 47 is
required<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:34.070> fuel<00:01:35.070> sits<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
required because they fuel sits in the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.450 
required because they fuel sits in the
wing<00:01:35.760> tanks<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.750> high<00:01:36.990> altitude<00:01:37.650> long<00:01:38.070> flights

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
wing tanks at high altitude long flights

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
wing tanks at high altitude long flights
gets<00:01:39.150> down<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.690> cold<00:01:39.990> temperatures<00:01:40.350> but

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
gets down to very cold temperatures but

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.560 
gets down to very cold temperatures but
from<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.070> safety<00:01:41.340> point<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.850> view<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.150> handling

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
from a safety point of view of handling

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.270 
from a safety point of view of handling
in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.900> aircraft<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> ground<00:01:43.920> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
in the aircraft and on the ground in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
in the aircraft and on the ground in
these<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.790> flashpoint<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.720> least<00:01:45.870> 38

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
these a flashpoint of at least 38

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200 
these a flashpoint of at least 38
degrees<00:01:46.770> centigrade<00:01:47.010> so<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.060> two

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
degrees centigrade so there are two

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.149 
degrees centigrade so there are two
quite<00:01:48.510> conflicting<00:01:49.200> requirements<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.950> again

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
quite conflicting requirements and again

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.450 
quite conflicting requirements and again
it's<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.820> difficult<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.720> those<00:01:51.990> two

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's very difficult to get those two

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's very difficult to get those two
properties<00:01:53.460> from<00:01:53.940> any<00:01:54.570> other<00:01:54.659> sort<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.670> medium

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
properties from any other sort of medium

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.840 
properties from any other sort of medium

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the third is the thermal stability which

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.700 
the third is the thermal stability which
has<00:01:59.970> already<00:02:00.150> been<00:02:00.510> mentioned<00:02:00.720> this<00:02:01.590> is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
has already been mentioned this is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.550 
has already been mentioned this is
because<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.130> fuel<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.549> used<00:02:02.580> as<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.750> coolant

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
because the fuel is used as a coolant

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.649

is research
collected<00:02:18.360> around<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.960> keep<00:02:18.990> those

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
collected around there to keep those

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.050 
collected around there to keep those
cool<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.830> allow<00:02:20.070> them<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.430> operate<00:02:20.460> within

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
cool to allow them to operate within

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.090 
cool to allow them to operate within
reasonable<00:02:21.540> temperature<00:02:21.990> range<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.920> there's

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
reasonable temperature range so there's

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.830 
reasonable temperature range so there's
a<00:02:23.160> lot<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> heat<00:02:23.670> comes<00:02:24.300> out<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> oil

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
a lot of heat comes out of the oil

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.840 
a lot of heat comes out of the oil
system<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.710> what<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.610> put<00:02:26.640> that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
system and what we do is we put that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.270 
system and what we do is we put that
back<00:02:27.240> into<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.780> fuel<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.350> then<00:02:28.890> put<00:02:29.130> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
back into the fuel and then put that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.070 
back into the fuel and then put that
back<00:02:29.490> into<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> engine<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:30.480> we're<00:02:30.660> recycling

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
back into the engine so we're recycling

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.230 
back into the engine so we're recycling
a<00:02:31.410> lot<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.710> heat<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.490> means<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> fuel

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
a lot of heat that means that the fuel

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.120 
a lot of heat that means that the fuel
gets<00:02:33.480> very<00:02:33.690> hot<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.290> needs<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.980> withstand

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
gets very hot and needs to withstand

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.820 
gets very hot and needs to withstand
that<00:02:35.690> also<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> injectors<00:02:37.380> sit<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.709> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
that also the injectors sit in the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.770 
that also the injectors sit in the
combustors<00:02:38.340> at<00:02:38.610> very<00:02:38.850> high<00:02:38.940> temperature<00:02:39.630> and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
combustors at very high temperature and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.480 
combustors at very high temperature and
again<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.560> means<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> fuel<00:02:41.220> going

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
again that means that the fuel going

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.740 
again that means that the fuel going
through<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.820> injectors<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.570> high

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
through the injectors is in high

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.840 
through the injectors is in high
temperature<00:02:43.380> basically<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> fuel<00:02:44.730> was

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
temperature basically if the fuel was

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.580 
temperature basically if the fuel was
not<00:02:45.090> able<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.600> withstand<00:02:45.780> those<00:02:46.170> temperatures

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
not able to withstand those temperatures

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.070 
not able to withstand those temperatures
you<00:02:47.220> would<00:02:47.340> increase<00:02:47.700> fouling<00:02:48.300> rates<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
you would increase fouling rates and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.910 
you would increase fouling rates and
probably<00:02:49.709> cause<00:02:49.920> problems<00:02:50.370> with<00:02:50.459> reliability

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
probably cause problems with reliability

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.380 
probably cause problems with reliability
so<00:02:52.920> how<00:02:53.160> do<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.400> make<00:02:53.610> sure<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.150> fuel

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
so how do we make sure that the fuel

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.360 
so how do we make sure that the fuel
that<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.660> use<00:02:54.870> everyday<00:02:55.290> meets<00:02:56.160> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
that you use everyday meets the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.750 
that you use everyday meets the

jet<00:03:40.799> fuel<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.190> today<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.510> ensure<00:03:42.840> safety

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
jet fuel is today so it ensure safety

that<00:03:54.900> today<00:03:55.350> because<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:55.709> fairly<00:03:56.310> detailed

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
that today because it's fairly detailed

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.569 
that today because it's fairly detailed
but<00:03:57.420> basically<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.049> has<00:03:58.200> two<00:03:58.530> key<00:03:58.920> parts<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
but basically it has two key parts the

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.020 
but basically it has two key parts the
first<00:03:59.760> is<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.360> looks<00:04:00.660> at<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.930> composition<00:04:01.290> and

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
first is it looks at the composition and

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.910 
first is it looks at the composition and
and<00:04:03.030> some<00:04:03.360> performance<00:04:03.930> properties<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.769> it

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
and some performance properties so it

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.190 
and some performance properties so it
makes<00:04:05.220> some<00:04:05.940> controls<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.570> what<00:04:06.810> can<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:06.989> in

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
makes some controls on what can be in

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.470 
makes some controls on what can be in
there<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:08.040> also<00:04:08.220> makes<00:04:08.370> some<00:04:08.850> controls<00:04:09.269> on

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
there and it also makes some controls on

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.150 
there and it also makes some controls on
minimum<00:04:10.110> performance<00:04:10.290> requirements<00:04:11.070> the

go ahead today Rolls Royce had to do
some<00:04:41.389> extra<00:04:41.719> testing<00:04:42.229> to<00:04:42.709> make<00:04:42.739> sure<00:04:42.889> that

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:43.279 
some extra testing to make sure that

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:45.249 
some extra testing to make sure that
this<00:04:43.399> fuel<00:04:43.699> was<00:04:43.879> was<00:04:44.269> fit<00:04:44.479> for<00:04:44.509> the<00:04:44.719> purpose<00:04:45.139> of

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
this fuel was was fit for the purpose of

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.979 
this fuel was was fit for the purpose of
today's<00:04:45.589> test<00:04:46.269> so<00:04:47.269> the<00:04:47.479> field<00:04:47.689> was<00:04:47.809> been

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:47.989 
today's test so the field was been

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:51.639 
today's test so the field was been
blended<00:04:48.619> over<00:04:49.099> in<00:04:49.189> New<00:04:49.399> Zealand<00:04:49.879> and<00:04:50.649> sample

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:51.649 
blended over in New Zealand and sample

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:53.709 
blended over in New Zealand and sample
sent<00:04:51.889> across<00:04:52.069> the<00:04:52.189> UK<00:04:52.789> and<00:04:52.999> the<00:04:53.059> blend<00:04:53.569> is<00:04:53.659> a

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:53.719 
sent across the UK and the blend is a

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:56.469 
sent across the UK and the blend is a
50-50<00:04:54.559> blend<00:04:54.679> so<00:04:55.039> it's<00:04:55.129> fifty<00:04:55.489> percent<00:04:55.789> of<00:04:56.089> the

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
50-50 blend so it's fifty percent of the

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.479 
50-50 blend so it's fifty percent of the
jatropha<00:04:56.809> material<00:04:57.529> and<00:04:57.679> the<00:04:58.069> other<00:04:58.189> fifty

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:58.489 
jatropha material and the other fifty

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:01.539 
jatropha material and the other fifty
percent<00:04:58.789> was<00:04:59.059> with<00:04:59.419> jet<00:04:59.689> a1<00:05:00.279> so<00:05:01.279> the<00:05:01.369> first

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:01.549 
percent was with jet a1 so the first

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:02.649 
percent was with jet a1 so the first
thing<00:05:01.639> is<00:05:01.759> we<00:05:01.879> did<00:05:02.149> the<00:05:02.269> standard

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
thing is we did the standard

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.199 
thing is we did the standard
specification<00:05:03.379> test<00:05:03.619> requirements<00:05:04.339> and<00:05:04.489> the

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:05.209 
specification test requirements and the

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:07.719 
specification test requirements and the
fuel<00:05:05.479> met<00:05:06.110> or<00:05:06.289> exceeded<00:05:06.429> most<00:05:07.429> of<00:05:07.639> those

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
fuel met or exceeded most of those

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.879 
fuel met or exceeded most of those
requirements<00:05:08.209> so<00:05:08.959> that<00:05:08.989> was<00:05:09.499> good<00:05:09.649> that<00:05:09.829> was

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
requirements so that was good that was

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.969 
requirements so that was good that was
the<00:05:10.279> first<00:05:10.579> sort<00:05:11.119> of<00:05:11.300> hurdle<00:05:11.749> the<00:05:12.439> second<00:05:12.860> was

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
the first sort of hurdle the second was

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.009 
the first sort of hurdle the second was
we<00:05:13.489> looked<00:05:13.639> at<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:13.939> purity<00:05:14.389> so<00:05:14.599> we<00:05:14.719> did<00:05:14.989> some

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:15.019 
we looked at the purity so we did some

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:18.549 
we looked at the purity so we did some
very<00:05:15.639> forensic<00:05:16.639> analytical<00:05:17.300> work<00:05:17.419> on<00:05:17.689> it<00:05:17.839> and

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:18.559 
very forensic analytical work on it and

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:21.399 
very forensic analytical work on it and
again<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.129> fuel<00:05:19.369> is<00:05:19.699> probably<00:05:20.629> purer<00:05:21.050> than<00:05:21.229> a

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
again the fuel is probably purer than a

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.429 
again the fuel is probably purer than a
normal<00:05:21.589> jet<00:05:22.009> a1<00:05:22.369> actually<00:05:22.819> very<00:05:23.599> low<00:05:23.839> sulphur

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
normal jet a1 actually very low sulphur

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.679 
normal jet a1 actually very low sulphur
very<00:05:25.039> low<00:05:25.279> trace<00:05:25.639> metals<00:05:26.149> and<00:05:26.360> so<00:05:26.509> on<00:05:26.659> so

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689 
very low trace metals and so on so

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
summary the I'm now going to talk in how

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.139 
summary the I'm now going to talk in how
this<00:05:33.409> all<00:05:33.589> fits<00:05:33.619> in<00:05:34.069> with<00:05:34.309> both<00:05:34.579> rolls-royce<00:05:35.119> a

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:35.149 
this all fits in with both rolls-royce a

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.689 
this all fits in with both rolls-royce a
strategy<00:05:35.809> in<00:05:35.959> the<00:05:36.349> industry<00:05:36.769> and<00:05:36.829> we<00:05:36.949> see<00:05:37.159> the

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
strategy in the industry and we see the

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.759 
strategy in the industry and we see the
introduction<00:05:38.179> of<00:05:38.209> biofuels<00:05:38.719> as<00:05:38.929> both<00:05:39.139> for<00:05:39.709> a

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:39.769 
introduction of biofuels as both for a

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:42.040 
introduction of biofuels as both for a
challenge<00:05:40.610> because<00:05:40.819> we're<00:05:41.149> dealing<00:05:41.779> with<00:05:41.809> new

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
challenge because we're dealing with new

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.479 
challenge because we're dealing with new
materials<00:05:42.589> but<00:05:42.739> we<00:05:42.860> have<00:05:43.039> to<00:05:43.159> preserve

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:43.489 
materials but we have to preserve

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:45.790 
materials but we have to preserve
performance<00:05:44.389> and<00:05:44.569> safety<00:05:44.749> but<00:05:45.559> there<00:05:45.679> are

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
performance and safety but there are

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.429 
performance and safety but there are
opportunities<00:05:46.069> and<00:05:46.789> the<00:05:46.819> challenge<00:05:47.239> is

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
opportunities and the challenge is

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.540 
opportunities and the challenge is
supporting<00:05:48.439> the<00:05:48.589> industry<00:05:49.069> from<00:05:49.459> a

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
supporting the industry from a

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.919 
supporting the industry from a
rolls-royce<00:05:49.789> point<00:05:50.179> of<00:05:50.269> view<00:05:50.360> we<00:05:50.479> don't<00:05:50.689> make

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
looked at the fuel in detail we will be

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.229 
looked at the fuel in detail we will be
examining<00:06:11.839> the<00:06:12.409> engine<00:06:12.679> afterwards<00:06:13.129> to<00:06:14.089> look

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:14.239 
examining the engine afterwards to look

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:17.589 
examining the engine afterwards to look
at<00:06:14.360> how<00:06:14.509> the<00:06:14.809> fuel<00:06:15.379> performed<00:06:15.919> and<00:06:16.759> that's<00:06:17.419> the

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
at how the fuel performed and that's the

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.109 
at how the fuel performed and that's the
key<00:06:17.749> point<00:06:18.159> all<00:06:19.159> our<00:06:19.429> strategies<00:06:19.969> at

00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:20.119 
key point all our strategies at

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:21.639 
key point all our strategies at
