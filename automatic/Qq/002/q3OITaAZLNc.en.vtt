of<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.740> nervous<00:00:08.130> system<00:00:09.230> there<00:00:10.230> are<00:00:10.260> two

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
of the nervous system there are two

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.690 
of the nervous system there are two
major<00:00:10.710> divisions<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.309> nervous<00:00:11.670> system

major divisions of the nervous system

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.690 
major divisions of the nervous system
the<00:00:12.599> first<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.530> central<00:00:13.980> nervous<00:00:14.009> system

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
the first is the central nervous system

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.599 
the first is the central nervous system
