 all strips of fabric sewn together 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.380
 of course you have to look how long 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.119
 your book cover the larger and must 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.040

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.960
 what you exactly need is stated 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.759
 I all in the work descriptions 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.100
 look he has on the inside and in 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.700
 insert flap and he has that on the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.180
 floor and the back also see that and me

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.049
 lined with volume fleece you can also 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.890
 play a piece for you to use 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.540
 actually yes 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.409
 the only thing is that then stick bindings 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.439
 circles 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.390
 we will take yes if you had lost it 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.189
 so you can indeed fly volume 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.750
 use for that or filter for 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.380

 tape to close that is also stated 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.670
 all written i think this will 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.009

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.969

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.159
 kind of stuff anyway but it is 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.299
 is nice because you can and 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.729
 yes we just have a lot of fun 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.140
 stamps are okay in the store and and 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.599
 that's just what you do but also 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.849
 yes this is this is my my handbook 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.709
 got here throw candy i stick 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.840
 all nice handiwork 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.700
 you know the pattern signal then 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.480
 put the text you write on 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.250
 partisans 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.370
 yes yes but it is actually you can 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.840
 see what stamp like what you 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.140
 and what you will do with it 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.700
 these are two layers of top lk and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.400
 here i just have a little piece 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.950
 white dust and hide you packed 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.790
 of course also if you have one and you design 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.989
 have where 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.819
 do not wear such large flowers 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.920
 can also still stamp about yes i had 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.329
 winning a little more about you 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.069
 can also be a bit wider 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.870
 ribbon suits that also have a it 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.030
 what night is there you can 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.669
 stamp it over and then I would say 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.590
 from well search stamp I have 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:01.190
 here what 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.840
 what cut look and for sure heart 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.090
 the pattern is also all there 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.670
 so you can take it from it 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.989
 of the leaf and bigger heart and I something 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.700
 little heart in this case with the 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.140
 quails go with do not have any want 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.370
 if you just straighten it that too 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.830
 still nice the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.700
 and i have this is just a piece of white 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:24.410
 fabric and here is on 1 side on the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.000
 back that I have longer sin 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.840
 application fleece that say that 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.370
 actually 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.819
 piece of application loss against 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.709
 so you have put that on 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.390
 put your iron on and off, so bake it 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.459
 to each other okay you have to 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.650
 be careful that you build like that 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.049
 filled it always reports one 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.090
 vest does feel smell but I think 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.430
 that if you just have a loose piece of fabric 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.440
 used without that stuff could then 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.430
 it can also possibly also it 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.440
 slightly more difficult 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.900
 and what i have done i have the pattern 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.900
 imposed here and it is always easy 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.629
 as well as you have all your holes in it 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.299
 you also sits fabric to and 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.920
 nice and even stone 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.560
 so what i did i got this on it 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.750
 been and I have a one with one 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.850
 just is just a needle or plays or 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.910
 whatever, that's why I have so many 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.920
 mm the holes or was full of defects what 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.810
 you can very well see who is really on the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.030
 dust and then I know that I am right there 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.709
 stringing through immediately or one 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.450
 have to make pretty stitching 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.060
 actually then I also get a nice one 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.740
 regular wine here but whatever you like 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.760
 of course must first do is of course 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.169
 sterchele so we had the ink large 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.270
 we have one but it makes up 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.430
 not all that much 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.010
 I have packed a beak in the ink 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.139
 your stamp those blocks are also all 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.280
 in the store with some set they are 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.169
 In addition, I first have a look at one 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.389
 old piece of paper or I it 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.979
 stamp first look for a moment 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.979
 if you are good picks 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:01.279
 cue this putter one more time 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.800
 Well see, I hope we just did 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.539
 just as well tell remember that you have one 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.639
 bit out watch you here that way 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:11.360
 don't get the edge for us you get 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.099
 that also on you that are so of those things 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.169
 if you think you did wrong 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:18.259
 you're out there on the as yet 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.819
 completely pickled comes out even for a moment 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.120
 well see if I sit over the middle so 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.810
 a little gamble so one two three 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.699
 million 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.529
 so I am crooked but in front of me 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:35.270
 great fun 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:38.749
 well then you go new and there too 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.979
 you should of course not be too fat 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:43.629
 we don't focus on the edge 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.629
 try to be beautiful everywhere 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.040
 yes i use the shaver 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.670
 just so important 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.870
 the community is from opening yes you have 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.870
 cut it much easier 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.790
 he can even be small you see that 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.640
 write in a moment, but understand you 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.530
 at least what the ideas should be 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.600
 just a little bit a little bit 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.100
 be cut narrower 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.210
 and then you can start and then you stab 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.430
 Thus from one hole after another non 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.100
 want to do this with your needle in one 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.680
 sometime starts and you stick out from behind 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.930
 forward and you make sure you are in it 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.050
 first hole comes out 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.940
 wait a moment so button one on the 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.250
 back and not now at once 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.860
 to the next stitch want no to from 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:48.800
 up and down and offered him yes 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:50.570
 look and you can and that takes a while 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.780
 nor is it came with three minutes 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.920
 but then you have a super fun 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.570
 results 2 yes so that will be him 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.550
 they make it after he has so little 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.340
 making narrow yes it's all about that 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.080
 you know what you can do yes and then 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.720
 you stab him or with a very small one 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.250
 momentarily fix it and you look 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.840
 hosting that you get from you of course 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.409
 book off and then you can go with a very small one 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.539
 you can do that 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.580
 embossed put you have a drop 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.289
