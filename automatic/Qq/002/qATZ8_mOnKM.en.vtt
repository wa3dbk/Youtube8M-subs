three inches away from the microphone
which<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.790> not<00:00:06.120> usually<00:00:06.690> how<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:07.200> sit<00:00:07.830> when<00:00:08.040> I'm

video and be sitting about three inches
away<00:00:13.290> from<00:00:13.349> both<00:00:13.679> microphones<00:00:14.360> sensitivity

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
away from both microphones sensitivity

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.700 
away from both microphones sensitivity
for<00:00:15.480> me<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.839> blue<00:00:16.049> snowball<00:00:16.289> right<00:00:16.590> now

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
for me on this blue snowball right now

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.060 
for me on this blue snowball right now
is<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> set<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> 35%<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.600> my<00:00:18.690> computer<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.260> this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
is a set to 35% on my computer and this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
is a set to 35% on my computer and this
is<00:00:20.310> what<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> keep<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.150> at<00:00:21.270> all<00:00:21.390> time<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.810> this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
is what I keep it at at all time so this

is what it sounds like I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.430> switch<00:00:23.640> over<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> at2020<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
ahead and switch over to the at2020 and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.290 
ahead and switch over to the at2020 and
let<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.050> guys<00:00:25.170> hear<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.680> too<00:00:26.300> alright

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
let you guys hear that one too alright

let you guys hear that one too alright
guys<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> 8020<00:00:28.769> 20<00:00:29.070> plus<00:00:29.340> test

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
guys this is the 8020 20 plus test

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.999 
guys this is the 8020 20 plus test
compared<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> blue<00:00:30.960> microphone<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.830> do

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
compared to the blue microphone it I do

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.010 
compared to the blue microphone it I do
have<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.430> sensitivity<00:00:32.790> turned<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> 25

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
have the sensitivity turned down to 25

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.840 
have the sensitivity turned down to 25
on<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.260> computer<00:00:34.620> rather<00:00:34.950> than<00:00:35.070> 35<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
on my computer rather than 35 for the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
on my computer rather than 35 for the
blue<00:00:36.030> snowball<00:00:36.270> because<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.050> seems<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> little

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
blue snowball because it seems a little

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.080 
blue snowball because it seems a little
bit<00:00:37.559> more<00:00:37.680> sensitive<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.670> other<00:00:38.879> than<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
bit more sensitive but other than that I

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
bit more sensitive but other than that I
think<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.420> sound<00:00:39.660> quality<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.079> great<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.770> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
think the sound quality is great in it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.560 
think the sound quality is great in it
maybe<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> need<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> pop<00:00:42.030> filter<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.450> not

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
maybe you need a pop filter I'm not

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.959 
maybe you need a pop filter I'm not
using<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> pop<00:00:43.020> filter<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.500> any<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.829> these

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
using a pop filter for any of these

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.889 
using a pop filter for any of these
tests<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.450> something<00:00:45.600> you're

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
tests so if that's something you're

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.270 
tests so if that's something you're
worried<00:00:46.170> about<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.680> popping<00:00:46.980> sound<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
worried about the little popping sound a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.619 
worried about the little popping sound a
little<00:00:47.489> pop<00:00:47.610> filter<00:00:47.910> will<00:00:48.030> take<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> that

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
little pop filter will take all of that

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.660 
little pop filter will take all of that
out<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.710> equation<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.340> hope<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.550> guys

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
out of the equation but I hope you guys

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.850 
out of the equation but I hope you guys
enjoy<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> comparison<00:00:51.629> video<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.989> let's<00:00:52.739> get

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
enjoy the comparison video and let's get

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.080 
enjoy the comparison video and let's get
back<00:00:52.920> into<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.460> looks<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> boom<00:00:53.940> arm

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
back into how it looks on the boom arm

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.170 
back into how it looks on the boom arm

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
time doing a comparison video microphone

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.870 
time doing a comparison video microphone
wise<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> hope<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.199> did<00:01:04.320> okay<00:01:04.409> both<00:01:05.369> files<00:01:05.640> were

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
wise I hope I did okay both files were

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
wise I hope I did okay both files were
recorded<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.420> Sony<00:01:06.689> Vegas<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> high<00:01:07.619> quality

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
recorded in Sony Vegas on a high quality

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
recorded in Sony Vegas on a high quality
I<00:01:08.070> believe<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:09.119> don't<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.290> they're<00:01:10.409> both

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
I believe I don't know but they're both

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
I believe I don't know but they're both
recorded<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.950> Sony<00:01:11.070> Vegas<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.760> pretty<00:01:12.299> much

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
recorded in Sony Vegas so I pretty much

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
recorded in Sony Vegas so I pretty much
went<00:01:12.630> about<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.049> would<00:01:13.260> say<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.740> distance<00:01:14.040> may

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
went about I would say this distance may

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.800 
went about I would say this distance may
be<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.610> little<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:14.850> more<00:01:15.060> from<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.330> microphone

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
be a little bit more from the microphone

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.170 
be a little bit more from the microphone
and<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.799> both<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> reviews<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.909> think

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and for both of the reviews and I think

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.240 
and for both of the reviews and I think
I<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:18.659> myself<00:01:18.840> that's<00:01:19.200> at2020<00:01:19.619> sounds<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I think myself that's at2020 sounds a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.590 
I think myself that's at2020 sounds a
little<00:01:20.310> bit<00:01:20.520> better<00:01:20.670> than<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> blue<00:01:21.360> snowball

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
little bit better than the blue snowball

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
audiophile I would say it's worth it if

mic<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.740> probably<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
mic then I would probably go it's a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100

snowball<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.810> someone

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
snowball for you but if you're someone

snowball for you but if you're someone
that<00:01:46.140> wants<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> spend<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.740> extra<00:01:46.799> dollars

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that wants to spend the extra dollars

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.350 
that wants to spend the extra dollars
and<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.520> something<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.909> little<00:01:48.119> bit<00:01:48.210> better

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and get something a little bit better

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.819 
and get something a little bit better
than<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.659> would<00:01:48.810> definitely<00:01:49.140> go<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> 18<00:01:49.619> 20

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
than I would definitely go for the 18 20

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.530 
than I would definitely go for the 18 20
20<00:01:50.040> plus<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.880> yeah<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.180> what<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.390> looks

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
20 plus but yeah this is what it looks

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.580 
20 plus but yeah this is what it looks
like<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> boom<00:01:51.990> arm<00:01:52.140> right<00:01:52.320> here

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
like on the boom arm right here

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
like on the boom arm right here
I<00:01:52.710> can't<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.430> maneuver<00:01:53.640> everyone<00:01:54.180> with

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
I can't you can maneuver everyone with

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.149 
I can't you can maneuver everyone with
two<00:01:54.689> different<00:01:54.810> dials<00:01:55.290> I'd<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:56.040> gonna

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
two different dials I'd like I'm gonna

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.560 
two different dials I'd like I'm gonna
keep<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.460> at<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.700> probably<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.060> might<00:01:57.270> move<00:01:57.420> it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
keep it at this probably I might move it

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.270 
keep it at this probably I might move it
maybe<00:01:57.810> towards<00:01:58.380> me<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> little<00:01:58.770> bit<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.100> that's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
maybe towards me a little bit but that's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
maybe towards me a little bit but that's
probably<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.850> obviously<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.899> didn't<00:02:01.110> use<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
probably it and obviously I didn't use a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
probably it and obviously I didn't use a
pop<00:02:01.469> filter<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:01.920> any<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> tests<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.759> I'm

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
pop filter for any of the tests and I'm

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.280 
pop filter for any of the tests and I'm
not<00:02:03.149> using<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.869> there's<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> little

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
not using one now so there's a little

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.410 
not using one now so there's a little
popping<00:02:04.649> sound<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.100> why<00:02:05.420> especially

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
popping sound that is why especially

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.119 
popping sound that is why especially
like<00:02:06.960> when<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.140> announce<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.469> my<00:02:07.649> peas<00:02:07.890> are

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
like when I announce that my peas are

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.130 
like when I announce that my peas are
really<00:02:08.270> really<00:02:09.270> powerful<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:09.989> last

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
really really powerful because my last

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.050 
really really powerful because my last
name<00:02:10.259> starts<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.709> piece<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.280> don't<00:02:12.000> know

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
name starts with a piece so I don't know

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.949 
name starts with a piece so I don't know
if<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.209> has<00:02:12.300> anything<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.569> do<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.840> but

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
if that has anything to do with it but

when<00:02:35.570> I<00:02:35.600> said<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.900> had<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.080> use<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.470> for<00:02:36.680> this

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
when I said I had to use it for this

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.020 
when I said I had to use it for this
little<00:02:36.980> adapter<00:02:37.250> right<00:02:37.520> here<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.760> have<00:02:37.880> to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
little adapter right here you have to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.110 
little adapter right here you have to
screw<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.080> in<00:02:39.230> right<00:02:39.410> here<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.060> then<00:02:41.060> you

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
screw this in right here and then you

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.340 
screw this in right here and then you
screw<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.390> onto<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.630> boom<00:02:41.780> arm<00:02:41.960> by<00:02:42.140> there<00:02:42.320> and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
screw it onto the boom arm by there and

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.960 
screw it onto the boom arm by there and
that<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.920> adapter<00:02:43.310> comes<00:02:43.490> with<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.670> boom<00:02:43.820> arm

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
that the adapter comes with the boom arm

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.010 
that the adapter comes with the boom arm
