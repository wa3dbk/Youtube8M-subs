00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.699 

I<00:02:20.980> think<00:02:21.819> one<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.300> big<00:02:22.480> things<00:02:22.750> for<00:02:22.900> me<00:02:23.110> at

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
I think one of the big things for me at

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.380 
I think one of the big things for me at
least<00:02:23.770> with<00:02:24.130> all<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.430> successes<00:02:25.000> It's<00:02:25.180> Made

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
least with all the successes It's Made

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.420 
least with all the successes It's Made
Montana<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.349> much<00:02:26.530> more<00:02:26.680> important<00:02:27.220> because

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
Montana that much more important because

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.520 
Montana that much more important because
it<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.849> really<00:02:28.209> good<00:02:28.510> leveling<00:02:29.020> mechanism

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
it is a really good leveling mechanism

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.930 
it is a really good leveling mechanism
when<00:02:29.620> you're<00:02:29.739> traveling<00:02:30.130> around<00:02:30.250> being<00:02:30.880> able

when you're traveling around being able

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.220 
when you're traveling around being able

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
to kind of come back to the same place

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.020 
to kind of come back to the same place
and<00:02:32.410> not<00:02:32.830> have<00:02:32.860> people<00:02:33.340> care<00:02:33.520> who<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.790> are

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.330 

we<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.110> much<00:02:40.320> more<00:02:40.590> wilderness<00:02:40.830> than

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
we have so much more wilderness than

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.130 
we have so much more wilderness than
just<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.700> names<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.300> Glacier<00:02:42.810> Bob

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
beaten trail I just like the fact that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.320 
beaten trail I just like the fact that
there's<00:02:50.220> always<00:02:50.460> somewhere<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> go<00:02:51.150> that

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
there's always somewhere to go that

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.870 

that's<00:02:56.080> kind<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.410> thing<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.740> love<00:02:57.400> about<00:02:57.430> it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
that's kind of the thing I love about it

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.100 
that's kind of the thing I love about it
seem<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> lot<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.420> little<00:02:58.599> kids<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:58.959> stuff
