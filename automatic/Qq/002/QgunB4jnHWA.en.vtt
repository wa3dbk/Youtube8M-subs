00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
okay so this is a bit heavier this is a

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.089 
okay so this is a bit heavier this is a
little<00:00:11.660> lighter<00:00:11.929> if<00:00:12.139> you<00:00:12.230> have<00:00:12.440> you<00:00:12.709> know<00:00:12.830> just

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
little lighter if you have you know just
