00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.470
 that could have given it differently to great criticism if that is the case now 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.740
 goes on then it is seen in other aspects and movies as I said 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.380
 looked at with the magnifying glass and maybe I am now connected with these 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.370
 The difficulties one associates with I think that is completely exaggerated 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.420
 that is not the case, the work of Jogi Löw possibly a team 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.660
 highly professional and they act as if nothing had happened 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.470
 despite always previous position of strength Joachim Loew had it 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.460
 no longer guarantees so strong at the moment at least not so far 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.289
 has been the whole group at all 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.129
 so you have to be honest and stand by the tree we are as his seven 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.840
 Roth had scene then they are greedy there is the discussion of bankers around 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.040
 Bonus payments summer definitely abolish in these times come like that 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.710
 a claim on the table or is it more the power variant that is important 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.940
 and which in this case has failed it is a mixture of 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 All about the prices the Jungle personally bothers the most that he is in 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.069
 this drawer 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.639
 Valentin was wrapped up that he's money Direct the law is by no means me 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:01.509
 know him well enough to do so the others who are not in his circle either 

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:05.670
 While these are claims that I do not understand I can be absolutely right 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.720
 do not understand why that happened 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.480
 Percentage winter barley Steinheimer offer was the improved 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.470
 So there was talk of about 8 percent me one that's already the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.640
 do not deserve if those are worse Super did not represent the year properly 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 Base is already alright they have as I said 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.820
 for me a dream job equipped with all possibilities 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.790
 Job opportunities also financial possibilities 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.500
 Percent with the hammer normal contract extension was for me 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.119
 a 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.130
 he reminds one for Nissan's formality though 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.590
 who in different positions a hen 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.939
 One thing that would have been the quickest to settle that surprises me a lot 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.020
 that it is as escalating as could and going over Bierhoff 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.040
 that is precisely the demand so the divas the power areas now with content 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.009
 to the dfb president that he has a chance with it at all 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.399
 because that he clearly so that so first voluntarily of 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.429
 had given up his sphere of influence because there could not be more of it 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.549
 go out that Jan Zimmer honestly I ask myself this question 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.290
 also 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.580
 how fast can not she answer 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.930
 Per cent of what is behind it I mean to buy alone and this 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.679
 To ask things, who do you have to 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:13.339
 Böhm already a certain 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.629
 will have a certain self-image about his person that one believes 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.219
 that the BOD in his staging such things to let 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.519
 that would be incomprehensible to me for Oliver Bierhoff 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.499
 grossly overestimated 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.819
 Land the SAP could never go well in life and of course the DFB has immediately 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.909
 reacting to it correctly and we want to rebuild it now, of course 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.249
 like to listen to microphone recorded by Jürgen Bergener's interviews 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.429
 been just before she 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.429
 have entered the Palace of Culture in Warsaw cheered 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:48.359
 Oliver Bierhoff at the 6th discussion last day as Joker to Trier 4 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.499
 wanted to visit 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.389
 yes, always our concentration, we are not so demanded percent 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.739
 better result 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.669
 but then of course it is already in the em-qualifikations- 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.349
 Preparations will be in two weeks with the group opponents 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.320
 Just make the planning for the composition 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.690
 wm-qualification and the fully prepared 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.509
 Number Diavel instead 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.639
 yes I mean it is percent, the judgment must be promptly around even if it is in the 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.869
 Summer for us does not go on percent of whichever side 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.359
 we also do not want to continue DFB not 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.249
 Pröll that he was also possible for another result at the World Cup 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.929
 Of course, you have to leave everything in order to continue the plan as if to continue 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.489
 let that happen again would have forced to be forced 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.519
 successful for germany a-team 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.700
 To be that way no longer forwarded to the manager Leo Broloer 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.779
 National coach Löw 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.719
 that's too early to worry about Auer we focus on 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.909
 really full on the 2010 World Cup 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.180
 this could have been 4 could be image readers anyway RS after 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.819
 Antalya extend in this respect 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.719
 This is not a special situation for us, we know that if you are after 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.909
 Services or be evaluated and then you will just reassemble 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.009
 and percent both sides are considering whether they want to carry on the track 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.669
 and what they say is Rule of Olivia Flow together at the 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.199
 relationship 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.839
 of it I go out percent more Julia Penner summer confirmed it will therefore 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.389
 in a completely different impression 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.369
 Rima awakens if you understand we understand the media not just one 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.359
 Side you can still see the other lighting 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.859
 from one side is represented very much as if he were over the of 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.239
 a process who does that does not work at all times several times team also has that 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.329
 a reason why we acted as a team 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.189
 go under the studio from my side 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.519
 it was said when she puts the shoe reading days Roth ca she veto 

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.930
 Impossible demands 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.449
 for this tour through Almeida 5 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.539
 not because she's the business I wonder of course because it's normal process 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.279
 is in negotiations that you have different positions was for us 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.080
 that my offer percent 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.210
 Whatever is going on there and expand their brand Rummler what is not like 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.530
 it was presented today in the two media but ultimately had 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.139
 rails 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.319
 Of course this is the a la salsa is whether everyone needs understanding for the 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.050
 have different positions that is in negotiations also so that you look 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.400
 must approach 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.979
 Euro and also discuss it must be clean and so that our offer 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.870
 it was not discussed at all »but it was not a counter offer 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.110
 lamb was 48-hour ultimatum over the negotiable 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.600
