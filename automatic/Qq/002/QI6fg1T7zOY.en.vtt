00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
this that Simpsons lately have been

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.770 
this that Simpsons lately have been
somewhat<00:05:47.580> in<00:05:47.700> a<00:05:47.789> slump<00:05:48.090> but<00:05:48.330> you<00:05:48.479> know<00:05:48.599> what

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
somewhat in a slump but you know what

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.770 
somewhat in a slump but you know what
Cooper<00:05:49.169> AMA<00:05:49.520> never<00:05:50.520> went<00:05:50.849> down<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:51.300> think<00:05:51.630> in

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
Cooper AMA never went down I think in

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.870 
Cooper AMA never went down I think in
common<00:05:52.349> that's<00:05:52.860> true<00:05:53.130> actually

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
common that's true actually

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.080 
common that's true actually
so<00:05:54.360> if<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.320> were<00:05:55.500> like<00:05:55.919> old<00:05:56.250> Simpsons<00:05:56.940> that

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
so if you were like old Simpsons that

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.790 
so if you were like old Simpsons that
feel<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:57.360> those<00:05:57.690> new<00:05:57.840> citizens<00:05:58.380> act<00:05:58.590> like

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
feel that those new citizens act like

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.710 
feel that those new citizens act like
Frankie<00:05:59.550> piranha<00:05:59.880> if<00:06:00.150> you<00:06:00.240> haven't<00:06:00.510> tried<00:06:00.599> it
