00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and actually the frosty was invented in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.609 
and actually the frosty was invented in
1969<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> owner<00:01:12.030> Dave<00:01:12.450> Thomas<00:01:12.930> he<00:01:13.470> thought

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
1969 by the owner Dave Thomas he thought

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.960 
1969 by the owner Dave Thomas he thought
that<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> chocolate<00:01:14.010> milkshake<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.820> too

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that a chocolate milkshake would be too

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
that a chocolate milkshake would be too
strong<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.390> flavor<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:16.020> burger<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.560> fries

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
strong with flavor for burger and fries

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.070 
strong with flavor for burger and fries
so<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:17.670> combined<00:01:18.090> chocolate<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.840> vanilla

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
so they combined chocolate and vanilla

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.679 
so they combined chocolate and vanilla
to<00:01:19.380> make<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> frosty<00:01:20.060> great<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.270> gonna<00:01:21.330> put

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
to make the frosty great we're gonna put

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
to make the frosty great we're gonna put
it<00:01:21.780> into<00:01:21.960> our<00:01:21.990> ice<00:01:22.200> cream<00:01:22.530> maker<00:01:22.710> which

actually froze the base overnight and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.289 
actually froze the base overnight and
then<00:01:25.860> we're<00:01:25.979> gonna<00:01:26.070> let<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.310> mix<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:26.820> 20<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> 30
