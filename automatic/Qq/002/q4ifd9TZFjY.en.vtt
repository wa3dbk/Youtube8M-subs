Welcome to my Maleficent Inspired Makeup Tutorial

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.239
by Alexa Poletti.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.240
Of course, we are going to start with contacts.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.140
I had a really hard time picking out contacts
for Maleficent

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.800
because her eye color changes so much throughout
the movie,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.880
but I went with these Geo cosplay contacts
from Pinky Paradise,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.780
because of their black backing.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.620
This allows them to show up just as well on
dark eyes as they do on light eyes,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.930
which is very important for Maleficent.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.670
I am going to start my makeup by putting concealer
under my eyes

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.010
and blending it in with my fingers.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.400
Then I'm going to put on my palest foundation
to try to get Maleficent's super, super pale complexion.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.700
Then I will top it with powder to set my foundation
in place.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.120
Here is where it starts to get a little tricky.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.910
Those cheekbones.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.040
Not all of us are as lucky as Angelina to
have a professional makeup artist apply prosthetics

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:14.939
to our cheeks

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.619
for Halloween this year.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.770
So to create that crazy cheekbone effect,
I'm going to start with brown eyeshadow a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.079
little higher than my natural cheekbone,

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.179
and draw it down and curve it a little bit
to create that dramatic point she has on her cheeks.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.399
And then I'm going to use a black eyeshadow,

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.880
just on that main point

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.289
to make it look like it sticks out farther
than the rest

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.589
by giving it a deeper shadow.

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:40.139
Then blend your shadow down as if your cheek
bones stick out so far

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:43.359
that they cast a shadow down the rest of your
face.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.929
Now I'm going to grab a highlight from my
contour &amp; blush palette from BH Cosmetics.

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.149
And I'm going to brush it on top of my new
cheek bones and down my nose.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.340
Then I'm going to take a bright white eyeshadow
and apply it to the tip of the cheek

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.449
just to reinforce how crazy sharp Angelina's
prosthetic cheeks are.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.440
Angelina's eyeshadow in Maleficent is actually
a lot lighter than I would expect it to be.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.900
But she closes her eyes a lot whether she
is sleeping or thinking or observing Aurora,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.530
or whatever she is doing,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.420
so there are a lot of reference shots of her
eyeshadow throughout the movie.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.510
So starting with a copper eyeshadow base,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.690
I'm going back in with a dark brown eyeshadow
into my crease and blending it out.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.160
Next I am going to accentuate the outer corners
of my eye with a black eyeshadow,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.730
just to darken it up a little bit.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.220
Maleficent's eyeliner is a softer look than
I usually do,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.320
so if you want to use a gel eyeliner here,
go for it.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.210
Liquid liner is just a lot easier for me to
apply personally.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.870
And then I'll just go in with black eyeshadow
on a smaller brush after the fact

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.050
to soften it all up.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.040
And then I'm just going to carry that black
out into my crease and blend it all around.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.510
Now I'm going to use a light yellow eyeshadow
to pop a little warm highlight in right along

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.810
my brow bone.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.520
Then I am going to take some black eyeshadow
to line underneath my eyes.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.680
And I'm just going to use a fluffier brush
to soften that line out.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.860
It doesn't look like Maleficent's eyeliner
is too super dark,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.170
so I'm just going to use a beige eyeliner
to brighten up my waterline.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.000
Black mascara.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.520
You know what to do.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.580
Make sure you show your bottom lashes some
love, too!

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.720
Now for her pointy evil villainous eyebrows.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.990
I'm just going to line out my brows to have
a really high arch and be a lot pointier than usual.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.740
I have a very exciting sneak peek in the world
of false lashes.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.210
The creator of Dolluxe has designed a brand
new line of natural looking falsies called

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.749
RockALash.

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:38.860
For today's Maleficent look, I'm testing out
a really, really cute potential new lash design

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.229
for RockALash,

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.709
so if you like these lashes, please let us
know in the comments,

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:47.489
and if you do like them, maybe you'll see
them in production soon!

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.480
Finally, one of the most important parts of
Maleficent's look is her red lips.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.010
I'm going to use this red lip crayon to draw
on a base for my red lips.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.720
Because the red is a little brighter than
I want,

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.449
I'm going to follow it up with a darker red
lipstick on top.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.740
Maleficent wears a nude colored nail polish
on her nails,

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:38.900
so I am wearing So Nude from Madam Glam.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.500
For the best look, you should choose a color
that compliments your skin tone.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.270
Now that my makeup is done,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.810
time to get changed.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.099
For Maleficent's horn/hat combo, I'm going
to put all of my hair up into a wig cap.

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.729
A wig cap is not totally necessary for this
look. I just think it's the easiest way to

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.680
get all of your hair up in one place.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.990
And if your horns are a little bit too big like
mine are,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.990
you can use a black beanie for a little bit
of extra padding.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.580
And here is my finished Maleficent look.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.699
Thank you guys so so much for watching.
