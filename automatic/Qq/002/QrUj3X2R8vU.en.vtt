00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
before I put this on I reaches bearing

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.460 
before I put this on I reaches bearing
just<00:02:17.260> a

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
just a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.170 
just a
basic<00:02:17.770> foundations<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.520> kinda<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:18.910> made<00:02:19.060> my

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
basic foundations I kinda just made my

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.120 
basic foundations I kinda just made my
skin<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:22.060> made<00:02:22.180> my<00:02:22.330> skin<00:02:22.390> kind<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.870> even<00:02:23.290> and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
skin just made my skin kind of even and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.470 
skin just made my skin kind of even and
then<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.460> just<00:02:24.610> work<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.940> little<00:02:25.030> bit<00:02:25.240> more

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
then you can just work a little bit more

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.120 
then you can just work a little bit more
into<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> contours<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.560> give<00:02:26.770> yourself<00:02:27.070> a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
into the contours to give yourself a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.160 
into the contours to give yourself a
little<00:02:27.160> bit<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.460> definition<00:02:28.080> under<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
little bit of definition under the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.170 
little bit of definition under the
cheekbone<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.890> across<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.820> top<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
cheekbone and across the top of the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.970 
cheekbone and across the top of the
forehead<00:02:31.390> should<00:02:32.200> really<00:02:32.440> tie<00:02:32.650> my<00:02:32.800> hair<00:02:32.920> back

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
forehead should really tie my hair back

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.560 
forehead should really tie my hair back
it<00:02:33.280> isn't<00:02:33.520> ideal<00:02:33.790> um<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.240> just<00:02:37.330> kind<00:02:37.510> of

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
it isn't ideal um and you just kind of

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.360 
it isn't ideal um and you just kind of
catch<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.990> areas<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.860> Sun<00:02:39.130> actually

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
catch the areas that the Sun actually

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.370 
catch the areas that the Sun actually
would<00:02:39.760> catch<00:02:40.000> your<00:02:40.210> skin<00:02:40.480> which<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.110> kind<00:02:41.320> of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
would catch your skin which is kind of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.950 
would catch your skin which is kind of
across<00:02:41.590> here<00:02:41.980> top<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.430> forehead<00:02:42.810> ridge<00:02:43.810> of

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
across here top of the forehead ridge of

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960 
across here top of the forehead ridge of
the<00:02:43.990> nose

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the nose

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.190 
the nose
you<00:02:45.970> can<00:02:46.090> take<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.330> down<00:02:46.360> across<00:02:46.750> your<00:02:46.990> chest

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
you can take it down across your chest

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.590 
you can take it down across your chest
too<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.550> other<00:02:48.730> way<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:48.970> use<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.450> would

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
too so the other way to use this would

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.160 
too so the other way to use this would
just<00:02:49.690> be<00:02:49.840> with<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:49.990> normal<00:02:50.320> dry<00:02:50.920> brush<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:52.170> you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
just be with a normal dry brush and you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.590 
just be with a normal dry brush and you
would<00:02:53.320> just<00:02:53.350> go<00:02:53.620> across<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.340> just<00:02:55.270> use<00:02:55.420> it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
would just go across it and just use it

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.540 
would just go across it and just use it
as<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> normal<00:02:55.959> bronzer<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.830> does<00:02:57.070> darken

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
as a normal bronzer but it does darken

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.280 
as a normal bronzer but it does darken
the<00:02:57.640> skin<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:58.090> little<00:02:58.270> bit<00:02:58.480> more<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.080> it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
the skin a little bit more and it

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.810 
the skin a little bit more and it
doesn't<00:02:59.590> leave<00:02:59.740> it<00:02:59.890> with<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.130> really<00:03:00.610> nice

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
doesn't leave it with that really nice

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.470 
doesn't leave it with that really nice
glow<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.570> I<00:03:02.560> absolutely<00:03:03.280> love<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.150> technique

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
glow and I absolutely love the technique

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.390 
glow and I absolutely love the technique
with<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.810> moisturizer<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.040> can<00:03:06.160> kind<00:03:06.310> of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
with the moisturizer and you can kind of

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.850 
with the moisturizer and you can kind of
play<00:03:06.550> around<00:03:06.610> with<00:03:06.940> any<00:03:07.150> brush<00:03:07.480> any<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.740> know

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
play around with any brush any you know

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.410 
play around with any brush any you know
anyone<00:03:09.250> always<00:03:09.670> make<00:03:09.820> sure<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.240> wash

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
anyone always make sure that you wash

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.850 
anyone always make sure that you wash
these<00:03:10.660> because<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.140> think<00:03:11.320> your<00:03:11.470> skin<00:03:11.680> can

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
these because I think your skin can

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.650 
these because I think your skin can
really<00:03:12.040> break<00:03:12.250> out<00:03:12.459> if<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.270> keep<00:03:13.420> using

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
really break out if you keep using

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.150 
really break out if you keep using
brushes<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.320> mean<00:03:14.440> that's<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.740> rule<00:03:14.890> with<00:03:15.010> any

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
brushes I mean that's the rule with any

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.699 
brushes I mean that's the rule with any
brush<00:03:15.459> any<00:03:15.730> skin<00:03:16.030> brush<00:03:16.240> wash<00:03:16.990> as<00:03:17.200> much<00:03:17.410> as<00:03:17.590> you

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
putting it on I something thought well I

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.490 
putting it on I something thought well I
could<00:03:52.840> buy<00:03:53.140> it

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
could buy it

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.240 
could buy it

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
and so that's a really nice highlighter

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.710

which<00:03:57.250> I'm<00:03:57.430> really<00:03:57.670> enjoying<00:03:57.790> using<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.540> is

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.949 
which I'm really enjoying using that is
in<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.820> sunbeam<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:01.299> think<00:04:01.690> that's<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> only

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
in a sunbeam I think that's the only

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.199 
in a sunbeam I think that's the only
highlighter<00:04:02.590> color<00:04:02.860> that<00:04:03.040> they<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:04.120> the

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
highlighter color that they do so the

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.330 
highlighter color that they do so the
color<00:04:04.420> isn't<00:04:04.630> that<00:04:04.900> relevant<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.100> other

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
color isn't that relevant and the other

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.820 
color isn't that relevant and the other
