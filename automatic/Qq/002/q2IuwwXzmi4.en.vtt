00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.920 
terms of this chart in the current bear
market<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.960> crash<00:00:55.379> i<00:00:55.649> believe<00:00:55.980> went<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
market that crash i believe went to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.200 
market that crash i believe went to
below<00:00:57.930> 800<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.620> 700<00:00:59.250> i<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.609> below<00:00:59.820> 700

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
below 800 or 700 i think was below 700

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.290 
below 800 or 700 i think was below 700
anyway<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.070> chart<00:01:02.370> using<00:01:02.550> weekly<00:01:03.059> data

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
anyway in this chart using weekly data

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810 
anyway in this chart using weekly data
the<00:01:04.019> current<00:01:04.379> bear<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.010> black<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.640> can

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the current bear is in black and you can

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
the current bear is in black and you can
see<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.210> extremely<00:01:07.080> similar<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> bear

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
see it's extremely similar to the bear

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.340 
see it's extremely similar to the bear
in<00:01:08.490> 1996<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.659> 1999<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.030> i<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.780> analog

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
in 1996 to 1999 and i think this analog

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
in 1996 to 1999 and i think this analog
chart<00:01:13.740> gives<00:01:14.010> us<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.310> good<00:01:14.520> frame<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> reference

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
chart gives us a good frame of reference

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.920 
chart gives us a good frame of reference
for<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.340> expect<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.600> bear

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
for what we can expect as this bear

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
for what we can expect as this bear
looks<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> continue<00:01:20.280> but

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
looks like it's going to continue but

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.749 
looks like it's going to continue but
still<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.869> me<00:01:22.049> looks<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.920> its<00:01:23.490> final

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
still to me looks like it's in its final

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.770 
still to me looks like it's in its final
stages<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.270> we're<00:01:27.479> hearing<00:01:27.750> some

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
stages and you know we're hearing some

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.560 
stages and you know we're hearing some
predictions<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.500> 700<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.369> 800<00:01:29.520> dollars<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> i

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
predictions of 700 or 800 dollars and i

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
predictions of 700 or 800 dollars and i
just<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.259> any<00:01:31.500> basis<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.400> any

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
just don't see any basis for that in any

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.370 
just don't see any basis for that in any
of<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:32.939> work<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.570> chart<00:01:33.900> gives<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.200> one

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of my work and this chart gives you one

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740 
of my work and this chart gives you one
example<00:01:34.579> where<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:36.000> see<00:01:36.180> maybe<00:01:36.450> this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
example where you can see maybe this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.730 
example where you can see maybe this
bear<00:01:37.520> declines<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.530> thousand<00:01:40.530> or

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
bear declines to a thousand or

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.920 
bear declines to a thousand or
thereabouts--<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.390> makes<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> lot<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> sense

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
thereabouts-- that makes a lot of sense

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.490 
thereabouts-- that makes a lot of sense
to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.439> I'll<00:01:43.530> get<00:01:43.740> more<00:01:43.890> into<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:45.500> but

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to be and I'll get more into that but

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.700 
to be and I'll get more into that but
anyway<00:01:47.329> another<00:01:48.329> note<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> crash<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
anyway another note on the crash is the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.280 
anyway another note on the crash is the
reason<00:01:50.100> why<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:50.579> tend<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> happen<00:01:51.290> sooner

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
reason why they tend to happen sooner

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.859 
reason why they tend to happen sooner
and<00:01:52.640> those<00:01:53.640> bear<00:01:53.909> markets<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.420> shorter<00:01:54.810> is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and those bear markets are shorter is

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.450 
and those bear markets are shorter is
because<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.380> people<00:01:55.680> already<00:01:55.890> wiped<00:01:56.189> out

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
because the people already wiped out

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.039 
because the people already wiped out
when<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:56.939> into<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.149> bear<00:01:57.420> market<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
when you get into a bear market that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.859 
when you get into a bear market that
lasts<00:01:58.469> over<00:01:59.070> three<00:01:59.579> years<00:01:59.820> like<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
lasts over three years like this one and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.330 
lasts over three years like this one and
it<00:02:01.049> looks<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.799> last<00:02:02.009> for

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it looks like it's going to last for

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.450 
it looks like it's going to last for
years<00:02:03.079> most<00:02:04.079> people<00:02:04.439> are<00:02:04.530> already<00:02:04.740> wiped<00:02:05.130> out

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
years most people are already wiped out

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.999 
years most people are already wiped out
so<00:02:05.880> sure<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.020> severe<00:02:07.380> moves<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
so sure you can have severe moves at the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.359 
so sure you can have severe moves at the
end<00:02:08.190> but

end but

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.640 
end but
those<00:02:09.489> crash<00:02:09.789> type<00:02:10.149> moves<00:02:10.479> it's<00:02:11.049> just<00:02:11.319> very

those crash type moves it's just very

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.259 
those crash type moves it's just very

get<00:02:16.299> to<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> next<00:02:16.810> slide<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.349> weekly

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
get to the next slide this is a weekly

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.710 
get to the next slide this is a weekly
line<00:02:18.010> chart<00:02:18.370> where<00:02:18.640> we<00:02:18.730> have<00:02:18.909> gold<00:02:19.239> with<00:02:19.480> its

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
line chart where we have gold with its

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.780 
line chart where we have gold with its
80<00:02:20.019> week<00:02:20.260> moving<00:02:20.470> average<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.250> then<00:02:21.580> at<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
80 week moving average and then at the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.850 
80 week moving average and then at the
bottom<00:02:21.819> we<00:02:22.299> have<00:02:22.330> GV<00:02:22.750> z<00:02:23.170> which<00:02:23.349> is<00:02:23.379> Gold's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
bottom we have GV z which is Gold's

bottom we have GV z which is Gold's
volatility<00:02:24.580> index<00:02:24.870> again<00:02:25.870> talking<00:02:26.140> about<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
volatility index again talking about the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.229 
volatility index again talking about the
support<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:27.310> talked<00:02:27.519> about<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.760> thousand

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
support and we talked about a thousand

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.140 
support and we talked about a thousand
on<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.450> last<00:02:28.659> slide<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:30.010> next<00:02:30.370> clear<00:02:30.819> major

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
on the last slide the next clear major

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.380 
on the last slide the next clear major
support<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:32.079> a<00:02:32.349> thousand<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:34.030> could<00:02:34.269> say

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
support is a thousand and you could say

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.550 
support is a thousand and you could say
a<00:02:34.420> thousand<00:02:34.810> 2050<00:02:35.709> perhaps<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:38.349> know<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
a thousand 2050 perhaps and you know the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.990 
a thousand 2050 perhaps and you know the
problem<00:02:38.950> with<00:02:38.980> gold<00:02:39.310> over<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.670> last<00:02:39.819> couple

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
problem with gold over the last couple

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.089 
problem with gold over the last couple
years<00:02:40.209> there<00:02:40.569> just<00:02:40.750> wasn't<00:02:40.989> any<00:02:41.290> real<00:02:41.650> strong

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
years there just wasn't any real strong

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.819 
years there just wasn't any real strong
support<00:02:42.640> other<00:02:42.879> than<00:02:42.970> 15<00:02:43.540> 50<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.230> then<00:02:44.650> down

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
support other than 15 50 and then down

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.430 
support other than 15 50 and then down
to<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.099> thousand<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:45.879> gold<00:02:46.480> has<00:02:46.720> worked<00:02:47.019> its<00:02:47.290> way

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
to a thousand so gold has worked its way

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.440 
to a thousand so gold has worked its way
lower<00:02:47.739> over<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> last<00:02:48.519> two<00:02:48.819> years<00:02:48.849> but<00:02:49.329> it's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
lower over the last two years but it's

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.270 
lower over the last two years but it's
been<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.629> grind<00:02:49.959> lower<00:02:50.319> it's<00:02:50.560> been<00:02:50.739> very<00:02:50.980> very

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
been a grind lower it's been very very

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.390 
been a grind lower it's been very very
slow<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.780> very<00:02:52.989> difficult<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:53.590> bears<00:02:53.980> and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
slow but very difficult for bears and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.849 
slow but very difficult for bears and
bulls<00:02:54.640> but<00:02:55.569> we<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.680> see<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.220> triangle<00:02:57.790> and

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
bulls but we can see that triangle and

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.899 
bulls but we can see that triangle and
also<00:02:59.859> factor<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.579> that<00:03:00.989> gold<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:03.280> has<00:03:03.730> this

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
also factor in that gold it has this

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.390 
also factor in that gold it has this
base<00:03:04.209> going<00:03:04.540> for<00:03:04.959> seven<00:03:05.530> or<00:03:05.799> eight<00:03:05.950> months<00:03:06.159> or

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
base going for seven or eight months or

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.399 
base going for seven or eight months or
whatever<00:03:06.489> it's<00:03:06.819> been<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.810> that's<00:03:07.959> kind<00:03:08.319> of

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
whatever it's been and so that's kind of

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.229 
whatever it's been and so that's kind of
setting<00:03:08.799> up<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.159> gold<00:03:09.370> breaks<00:03:09.640> below<00:03:09.879> that

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
setting up if gold breaks below that

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.780 
setting up if gold breaks below that
it's<00:03:10.420> setting<00:03:10.750> up<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:11.109> strong<00:03:11.590> potential<00:03:12.519> for<00:03:12.670> a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
it's setting up a strong potential for a

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
it's setting up a strong potential for a
strong<00:03:13.090> break<00:03:13.389> down<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:15.540> again<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:16.780> see

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
strong break down and again you can see

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.720 
strong break down and again you can see
the<00:03:17.019> triangle<00:03:17.530> there<00:03:17.709> which<00:03:17.889> is<00:03:18.010> also<00:03:18.190> in<00:03:18.459> play

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
the triangle there which is also in play

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.030 
the triangle there which is also in play
break<00:03:19.690> below<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.260> that's<00:03:20.530> another<00:03:20.769> reason

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
break below that that's another reason

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.059 
break below that that's another reason
why<00:03:21.220> you'd<00:03:21.519> expect<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.410> sharper<00:03:23.410> moved<00:03:23.620> down<00:03:23.829> if

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
why you'd expect a sharper moved down if

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.460 
why you'd expect a sharper moved down if
gold<00:03:24.310> breaks<00:03:24.609> below<00:03:24.819> 1140<00:03:25.540> 1150<00:03:25.989> now<00:03:26.319> in

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
gold breaks below 1140 1150 now in

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.250 
gold breaks below 1140 1150 now in
addition<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.129> in<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.660> chart<00:03:28.959> with<00:03:29.139> the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
addition to that in this chart with the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.610 
addition to that in this chart with the
volatility<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:31.019> highlight<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.169> last<00:03:32.379> two

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
volatility I highlight the last two

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.830 
volatility I highlight the last two
times<00:03:32.859> where<00:03:33.220> volatility<00:03:34.150> bottom<00:03:34.569> did<00:03:34.720> then

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
times where volatility bottom did then

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.580 
times where volatility bottom did then
right<00:03:35.079> before<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.590> started<00:03:35.919> to<00:03:36.069> move<00:03:36.819> higher

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
right before it started to move higher

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.650 
right before it started to move higher
aggressively<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:38.859> can<00:03:39.489> see<00:03:39.730> those<00:03:40.180> times

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
aggressively and you can see those times

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.330 
aggressively and you can see those times
what<00:03:40.900> happened<00:03:41.260> gold<00:03:41.470> started<00:03:41.859> going<00:03:42.099> down

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
what happened gold started going down

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.550 
what happened gold started going down
and<00:03:42.579> then<00:03:42.669> it<00:03:42.790> accelerated<00:03:43.690> lower<00:03:44.199> as

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
and then it accelerated lower as

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.650 
and then it accelerated lower as
volatility<00:03:45.099> spike<00:03:45.669> so<00:03:45.910> we're<00:03:46.060> coming<00:03:46.389> into<00:03:46.540> a

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
volatility spike so we're coming into a

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.319 
volatility spike so we're coming into a
situation<00:03:46.930> where<00:03:47.639> volatility<00:03:48.639> is<00:03:48.730> still

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
situation where volatility is still

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.530 
situation where volatility is still
going<00:03:49.660> down<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:50.579> perhaps<00:03:51.579> in<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.060> next<00:03:52.209> month

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
going down but perhaps in the next month

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.750 
going down but perhaps in the next month
or<00:03:52.720> two<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.079> could<00:03:53.290> see<00:03:53.560> volatility<00:03:54.129> bottom

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
or two you could see volatility bottom

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.449 
or two you could see volatility bottom
and<00:03:54.849> then<00:03:55.000> start<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.389> turn<00:03:55.540> around<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.459> that's

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
and then start to turn around so that's

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.689 
and then start to turn around so that's
another<00:03:57.790> reason<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.389> think<00:03:58.599> that<00:03:58.750> if<00:03:59.230> gold

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
another reason to think that if gold

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.720 
another reason to think that if gold
breaks<00:04:00.699> below<00:04:01.030> 1140<00:04:01.959> 1150<00:04:02.470> on<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.799> weekly<00:04:03.129> basis

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
breaks below 1140 1150 on a weekly basis

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.490 
breaks below 1140 1150 on a weekly basis
you<00:04:04.090> get<00:04:04.329> some<00:04:04.480> increased<00:04:04.900> selling<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.410> then

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
you get some increased selling and then

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.140 
you get some increased selling and then
volatility<00:04:06.250> spikes<00:04:06.669> up<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:09.819> know<00:04:09.910> that

is you go back to last four or five
years<00:04:53.280> that's<00:04:54.000> kind<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.330> in<00:04:54.479> between<00:04:54.659> where

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
years that's kind of in between where

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.279 
years that's kind of in between where
the<00:04:55.319> range<00:04:55.650> has<00:04:55.889> been<00:04:56.159> in<00:04:57.169> considering<00:04:58.169> that

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
the range has been in considering that

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.779 
the range has been in considering that
we're<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.620> bear<00:04:58.800> market<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.310> thirty<00:04:59.580> one

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
we're in a bear market that thirty one

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.149 
we're in a bear market that thirty one
percent<00:04:59.819> is<00:05:00.240> very<00:05:00.479> high<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:00.990> mean<00:05:01.409> just<00:05:01.650> just<00:05:01.949> go

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
percent is very high I mean just just go

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.830 
percent is very high I mean just just go
back<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:02.400> look<00:05:02.729> at<00:05:02.880> where<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.150> lows<00:05:03.360> were<00:05:03.389> in

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
back and look at where the lows were in

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.879 
back and look at where the lows were in
2013<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.699> think<00:05:05.940> very<00:05:06.300> early<00:05:06.630> 2014<00:05:07.139> the

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
2013 and I think very early 2014 the

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.370 
2013 and I think very early 2014 the
lows<00:05:08.069> were<00:05:08.099> at<00:05:08.610> six<00:05:09.210> percent<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:09.900> then<00:05:09.990> seven

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
lows were at six percent and then seven

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.960 
lows were at six percent and then seven
percent<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:12.800> where<00:05:13.800> we<00:05:13.949> are<00:05:14.069> right<00:05:14.099> now<00:05:14.340> I<00:05:14.580> mean

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
percent so where we are right now I mean

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.089 
percent so where we are right now I mean
that's<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.240> real<00:05:15.449> problem<00:05:15.690> for<00:05:15.960> gold<00:05:16.560> bugs<00:05:16.830> and

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
that's a real problem for gold bugs and

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.620 
that's a real problem for gold bugs and
people<00:05:17.340> were<00:05:17.460> bullish<00:05:17.789> on<00:05:17.940> gold<00:05:18.000> because

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
people were bullish on gold because

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.300 
people were bullish on gold because
there's<00:05:18.870> just<00:05:18.930> too<00:05:19.199> many<00:05:19.319> speculators<00:05:20.039> left

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
there's just too many speculators left

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.730 
there's just too many speculators left
in<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.580> market<00:05:21.000> we<00:05:21.870> need<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.139> see<00:05:22.289> that<00:05:22.319> thirty

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
in the market we need to see that thirty

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.129 
in the market we need to see that thirty
one<00:05:22.949> percent<00:05:22.979> much<00:05:23.550> lower<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:25.159> if<00:05:26.900> gold<00:05:27.900> does

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
one percent much lower and if gold does

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.980 
one percent much lower and if gold does

we really want to see to get bullish is
gold<00:05:44.810> obviously<00:05:45.810> breaking<00:05:46.259> down<00:05:46.500> but<00:05:46.949> gold

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
gold obviously breaking down but gold

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.520 
gold obviously breaking down but gold
gets<00:05:47.909> really<00:05:48.240> close<00:05:48.389> to<00:05:48.690> that<00:05:48.840> a<00:05:48.870> thousand<00:05:49.440> to

gets really close to that a thousand to
ten<00:05:49.740> fifty<00:05:50.190> level<00:05:50.580> and<00:05:50.789> then<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.419> see<00:05:51.599> the<00:05:51.750> co

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
ten fifty level and then you see the co

ten fifty level and then you see the co
t<00:05:52.460> perhaps<00:05:53.460> even<00:05:53.669> below<00:05:53.969> six<00:05:54.270> percent<00:05:54.659> close

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.600 
t perhaps even below six percent close
to<00:05:55.110> zero<00:05:55.349> percent<00:05:55.800> because<00:05:55.979> I<00:05:56.219> mean<00:05:56.370> if<00:05:56.460> it's

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
to zero percent because I mean if it's

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.270 
to zero percent because I mean if it's
below<00:05:56.789> six<00:05:57.150> percent<00:05:57.599> the<00:05:58.380> net<00:05:58.590> position<00:05:58.800> would

below six percent the net position would

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.240 
below six percent the net position would
then<00:05:59.490> be<00:06:00.090> of<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.240> 13-year<00:06:00.810> low<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.380> it's<00:06:01.860> kind<00:06:02.159> of

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
then be of a 13-year low so it's kind of

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.180 
then be of a 13-year low so it's kind of
that<00:06:02.400> combination<00:06:03.030> of<00:06:03.650> really<00:06:04.650> extreme

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
that combination of really extreme

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.700 
that combination of really extreme
