00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
in five years and our prediction based

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.110 
in five years and our prediction based
on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> quite<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.190> humble<00:00:59.640> assumptions

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
on the quite you know humble assumptions

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.959 
on the quite you know humble assumptions
shows<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:01.079> 350<00:01:01.949> million<00:01:02.280> five

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
shows that we can do 350 million five

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.539 
shows that we can do 350 million five
already<00:01:03.229> yeah<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> let's

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
already yeah we can do this and let's

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.660 
already yeah we can do this and let's
make<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.420> booming<00:01:06.830> very<00:01:07.830> relevant<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
make it is booming very relevant and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
make it is booming very relevant and
very<00:01:08.880> interesting<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.780> being<00:01:10.080> everybody

many people are you again so how we are

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.219 
many people are you again so how we are
to<00:01:14.939> right<00:01:15.360> now<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.659> are<00:01:15.689> testing<00:01:16.110> our

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to right now we are testing our

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.929 
to right now we are testing our
prototype<00:01:16.830> okay<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.460> organize<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
prototype okay you organize the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.640 
prototype okay you organize the
assumptions<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> better<00:01:19.110> which<00:01:19.530> are

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
assumptions to make a better which are

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.249 
assumptions to make a better which are
going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.979> targeted<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.729> very<00:01:21.090> narrow

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
going to be targeted on a very narrow

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.870 
going to be targeted on a very narrow
okay<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> big<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.009> audience<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:23.670> is
