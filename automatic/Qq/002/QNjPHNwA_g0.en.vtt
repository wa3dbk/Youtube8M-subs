00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:11.690
 Hello to you I had a hole in it 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.150
 video i will tell you about the frontier and the soul 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.810
 this is one of the bosses of the foundry clan raid 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.080
 black mountain boss is quite interesting by 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.880
 to my mechanics, something like that 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.970
 I don't remember, let's start with the fact that the battle with 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.730
 this boss is divided into two phases out of 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.670
 first phase then the boss is trying you 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.590
 kill and at the same time how would it be necessary 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.100
 tank and the second phase when the boss 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.089
 trying to kill you but not him 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.979
 natankov yes yes he rolls on 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.719
 site and trying to crush you about 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.359
 probably we will start on this in more detail 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.350
 from the first phase with which the battle begins with 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:01:00.019
 setups two tanks take the boss as if 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.229
 Yes, and turn his face in rdk Ministry of Internal Affairs 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.239
 awning as shown in the video and 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.240
 according to america 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.250
 more start on it as a boss time 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.860
 this phase make a few throwing off 1 myself 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.400
 the dangerous ones are the acid flow then 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.980
 there he surrenders under the tank and so does the night 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.800
 damage to the entire raid is applied 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.090
 wears tanks physical damage and then 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.690
 how much damage 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.330
 absorb then say or reduce damage 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.840
 tank as much higher hit on 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.490
 raid 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.740
 dylan k therefore tanks should not 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.780
 appear or ask him for the sake of such 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.260
 like sakkra teeth like that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.810
 activities to make tanks break loose and 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.360
 changing one foot second line 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.290
 most often very often leads your 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.930
 wig further 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.690
 boss throws you don green j she 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.700
 appears after half seconds immediately 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.760
 same start quite painful to clean up 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.409
 raid therefore only throw over your head 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.870
 ally information that he has 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.690
 fly away come out go lay out 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.929
 there will be zones we are a snake that is, we go one 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.209
 rendzhi raid there is a tactic to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.280
 to drive in two components and thereby 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.680
 increases and psn is just not less 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.870
 run on with it and harder to heal 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.450
 about strength, I will probably say in the very 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.710
 end of the video followed by the explosive 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.280
 splinter he throws melikov applied 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.810
 damage and leaves it in place 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.520
 the most shard that will explode through 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.010
 three seconds and there will be more people 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.780
 so 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.430
 rushed Velikov explosive splinter 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.830
 great don't approach him what's on you 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.170
 throws it back clearly visible well not price 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.060
 certainly good but you can see at least him 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.000
 you need to go 100 percent also 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.760
 the boss casts a squall of black mountain 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.960
 a skill that damages throughout the raid 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.930
 quite noticeable damage so this 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.000
 skill is necessary to shoot down 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.440
 appoints you where and let not 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.810
 absolutely all castes are knocked down 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.250
 less bones will pass the theme to survive 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.920
 and what generally muffler 1 did not pass 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.370
 it is in principle this whole phase that is 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.020
 technicians fold your zone 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.500
 tanks tanks change from coming under 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.870
 flows are slots and accordingly are not great 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.410
 evaporated knock caste and uparyvatsya 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.310
 explosive scott transition to 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.980
 who probably about what in a way many chief 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.740
 the principle is the kid move is that the boss 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.690
 rides around the pitch before hitting about 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.820
 wall, he set forth choose 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.980
 where he goes to roll in general 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.450
 randomly but if you destroy the box 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.680
 which of course is necessary to destroy 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.620
 who lie on the floor 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.390
 a piece of ore and a boss appear from them 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.690
 trying to roll to himself 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.070
 the nearest piece of a ride on this 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.780
 a piece of ore he accordingly 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.120
 recover 10 percent of energy 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.110
 when the thief is again accumulating energy 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.350
 he will transfer to the first phase to therefore 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.460
 destroy all the boxes and 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.950
 we translate the main boss accordingly 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.900
 rule of his skating if he rolls in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.540
 center then he will ride down the center 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.520
 clockwise and respectively 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.370
 the edges he will ride counterclockwise 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.160
 Well, for those who are difficult to perceive 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.560
 information by ear I 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.960
 you will now see the picture on the video yes 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.010
 there you are all clearly visible also link to 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.840
 the picture will be in the description of the video clip 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.130
 on it is why poets like you picture 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.780
 which is clearly visible where the boss can 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.890
 roll and even dress it easier 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.780
 dodge do not forget that the sickly 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.970
 hard here to heal because they don't 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.500
 get that is you go behind the wall 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.820
 you are not visible and it does not pass therefore 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.620
 split into a group 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.060
 disperse four different points and 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.070
 pouring pieces of ore 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.740
 more precisely and more precisely here are these boxes with 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.130
 which manages . ore main by the way 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.330
 and a very interesting trick is that when 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.200
 you will score the required amount 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.670
 boxes 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.710
 the boss certainly won't have it all at once 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.040
 eat he will continue to ride and 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.360
 continue to do aoy damage and 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.830
 besides these words rolling yes 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.870
 practically you can of course 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.130
 survive we sell to stay to you or hearing 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.340
 n but no matter how welcome 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.100
 so what about the chips boxes more 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.990
 than necessary if you merge more 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.760
 the amount of the box of labor remains on 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.820
 next transition ki respectively 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.740
 less boxes need to be drained 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.870
 what is it all the same mastering people will 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.390
 die some us ruler people 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.220
 dying better drain the maximum 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.230
 the number of boxes that you have time 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.570
 say and thereby more effectively 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.110
 kill the boss but that's basically all 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.970
 About ohil aha I wanted to say yes 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.400
 why we were one computer orge and 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.900
 because it's easier to beat off wright is easier 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.330
 otkhilit raid and we did not publish any 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.730
 helix your car has totem tranquils on 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.639
 ohil and the like left remained 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.370
 always on the transition q &amp; a with it in 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.840
 like clouds yes there cinnamon thieves and so 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.280
 further there is a dome in dc 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.099
 they gave up on this phase and 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.469
 Respectively all all incoming damage in 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.810
 raid he just leaned back with those 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:02.870
 the most it is as if simplified our boss 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.629
 Well, on this principle, all the best of luck to you 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.469
 pools in bodies subscribe to the channel 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.469
 like bye
