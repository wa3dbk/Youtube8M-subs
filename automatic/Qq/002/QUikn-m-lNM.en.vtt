seal it back up and then just put in a
place<00:02:44.020> where<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.920> don't<00:02:45.100> want<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.370> coming<00:02:46.330> in

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
place where you don't want it coming in

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
to take over this package and pressors

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.920 
to take over this package and pressors
and<00:02:55.270> we're<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.600> going<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.780> take<00:02:55.990> up

whichever one you feel more comfortable

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.250 
whichever one you feel more comfortable
with<00:03:00.070> a<00:03:00.130> round<00:03:00.459> or<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> flat<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:02.020> want<00:03:02.200> to

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
with a round or a flat and you want to

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.449 
with a round or a flat and you want to
just<00:03:02.380> be<00:03:02.530> very<00:03:02.680> careful<00:03:02.890> when<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.280> do<00:03:03.430> this

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
just be very careful when you do this

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.270 
just be very careful when you do this
because<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.510> very<00:03:04.780> strong<00:03:04.990> like<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.290> said<00:03:05.530> if

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
because it is very strong like I said if

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.010 
because it is very strong like I said if
this<00:03:06.550> were<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> different<00:03:06.970> color<00:03:07.180> shoe<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.900> you

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
this were a different color shoe and you

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.930 
this were a different color shoe and you
were<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.200> get<00:03:08.350> this<00:03:08.440> on<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.709> clear<00:03:08.950> sole<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.820> is

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
were to get this on the clear sole it is

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.710 
were to get this on the clear sole it is
going<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.150> stain<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.690> clear<00:03:11.110> sole<00:03:12.720> heavily

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
going to stain the clear sole heavily

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.710 
going to stain the clear sole heavily
and<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:13.959> actually<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:15.450> probably<00:03:16.450> won't<00:03:16.600> be

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
and you actually you probably won't be

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.199 
and you actually you probably won't be
able<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> get<00:03:17.020> it<00:03:17.080> off<00:03:17.170> on<00:03:17.320> this<00:03:17.410> yields<00:03:17.770> a<00:03:18.209> see

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
able to get it off on this yields a see

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.699 
able to get it off on this yields a see
glow<00:03:19.390> or<00:03:19.540> maybe<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.810> retro<00:03:20.140> buy<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.290> try<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.560> get

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
glow or maybe a retro buy to try to get

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.680 
glow or maybe a retro buy to try to get
it<00:03:20.800> off<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.190> just<00:03:21.820> dropping<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.270> on<00:03:22.390> there<00:03:22.570> as

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
it off so just dropping it on there as

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.600 
it off so just dropping it on there as
you<00:03:22.870> can<00:03:22.930> see<00:03:23.020> that<00:03:23.410> it's<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:24.070> very<00:03:24.340> liquidy

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
you can see that it's it's very liquidy

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.070 
you can see that it's it's very liquidy
it's<00:03:24.970> not<00:03:25.150> it's<00:03:25.390> not<00:03:25.570> like<00:03:25.840> paint<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:28.810> this

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
it's not it's not like paint this this

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.630 
it's not it's not like paint this this
will<00:03:29.320> run<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:29.920> that's<00:03:30.070> why<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.220> have<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.430> use

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
will run so that's why you have to use

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.050 
will run so that's why you have to use
extreme<00:03:31.000> caution<00:03:31.060> when<00:03:31.450> you're<00:03:31.630> using<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:33.060> you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
extreme caution when you're using it you

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.360 
extreme caution when you're using it you
just<00:03:34.269> want<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.540> get<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.870> there<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
just want to get it in there and the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.360 
just want to get it in there and the
reason<00:03:36.580> that<00:03:36.610> you're<00:03:36.760> doing<00:03:36.970> this<00:03:38.370> you're

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
reason that you're doing this you're

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.570 
reason that you're doing this you're
doing<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.670> dye<00:03:41.130> instead<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.519> straight

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
doing the dye instead of just a straight

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.640 
doing the dye instead of just a straight
paint<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.269> because<00:03:45.420> when<00:03:46.420> they<00:03:46.630> when<00:03:47.470> they

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
paint is because when they when they

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.250 
paint is because when they when they
give<00:03:47.860> plastics<00:03:48.519> or<00:03:48.730> foams<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.750> color<00:03:49.930> it's

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
give plastics or foams of color it's

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.320 
give plastics or foams of color it's
it's<00:03:50.620> in<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.920> molding<00:03:51.670> process<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:52.209> it's

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
it's in the molding process that it's

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.530 
it's in the molding process that it's
given<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.720> color<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:54.070> all<00:03:54.700> these<00:03:55.000> things<00:03:55.239> just

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
given the color so all these things just

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.080 
given the color so all these things just
kind<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:55.840> just<00:03:56.019> hang<00:03:56.260> out<00:03:56.410> on<00:03:56.470> top<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.160> when

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
kind of just hang out on top and when

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.789 
kind of just hang out on top and when
you<00:03:58.120> wear<00:03:58.420> them<00:03:58.660> that's<00:03:59.320> when<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.590> get<00:03:59.680> the

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
you wear them that's when you get the

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.710 
you wear them that's when you get the
cracking<00:04:00.250> because<00:04:00.910> it's<00:04:01.090> really<00:04:01.299> not<00:04:01.420> meant

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
cracking because it's really not meant

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
it when it does crack you'll have this

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.600

purpose it's not as long just get basic

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.890 
purpose it's not as long just get basic
idea<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:39.010> know<00:04:39.340> you're<00:04:39.460> wondering<00:04:39.760> why<00:04:39.940> why

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
idea and I know you're wondering why why

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.810 
idea and I know you're wondering why why
can<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.230> just<00:04:41.410> leave<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.620> with<00:04:42.310> just<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.640> black

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
can I just leave it with just the black

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.570 
can I just leave it with just the black
dye<00:04:43.260> well<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.680> black<00:04:44.890> dye<00:04:45.190> is<00:04:45.610> not<00:04:45.940> truly

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
dye well the black dye is not truly

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.620 
dye well the black dye is not truly
black<00:04:48.580> so<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:51.160> can<00:04:52.000> actually<00:04:52.150> put<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.420> little

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
black so you can actually put a little

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.800 
black so you can actually put a little
bit<00:04:52.750> there<00:04:52.900> if<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.080> want<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.290> see<00:04:53.850> it<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:58.780> has

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
bit there if you want to see it it has

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.920 
bit there if you want to see it it has
sort<00:04:59.380> of<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.530> purple<00:05:00.270> essence<00:05:01.270> color<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:01.780> it

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
sort of a purple essence color to it

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.720 
sort of a purple essence color to it
sort<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:02.770> like<00:05:02.950> if<00:05:03.100> you<00:05:03.160> painted<00:05:03.550> with<00:05:03.700> a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
sort of like if you painted with a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.990 
sort of like if you painted with a
sharpie<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.360> gives<00:05:04.930> you<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.110> sort<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.380> a

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
sharpie it gives you that sort of a

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.310 
sharpie it gives you that sort of a
purple<00:05:07.000> essence<00:05:07.360> color<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:08.020> it's<00:05:08.170> not

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
purple essence color and so it's not

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.100 
purple essence color and so it's not
truly<00:05:09.360> all<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.660> way<00:05:10.840> black<00:05:12.540> so<00:05:13.540> there<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:13.960> go

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
truly all the way black so there you go

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.270 
truly all the way black so there you go
you<00:05:14.350> could<00:05:14.500> actually<00:05:14.620> give<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:14.920> a<00:05:14.950> couple<00:05:15.100> more

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
you could actually give it a couple more

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.570 
you could actually give it a couple more
coats<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.770> would<00:05:17.860> be<00:05:17.980> you<00:05:18.280> know<00:05:18.370> all<00:05:18.490> the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
coats and it would be you know all the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.670 
coats and it would be you know all the
way<00:05:18.670> black<00:05:18.850> on<00:05:19.060> that<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:20.050> that's<00:05:20.200> a<00:05:20.440> step

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
way black on that so that's a step

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:30.240 
way black on that so that's a step
number<00:05:20.830> two<00:05:28.170> so<00:05:29.170> now<00:05:29.290> in<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:29.530> sec<00:05:29.770> as<00:05:30.010> third

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
number two so now in this sec as third

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.740 
number two so now in this sec as third
portion<00:05:30.550> we're<00:05:30.910> going<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:33.330> be<00:05:34.330> making<00:05:34.480> the

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
the black with a dollar you'll see that

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.790 
the black with a dollar you'll see that
it's<00:06:21.490> slightly<00:06:21.640> matte<00:06:22.110> on<00:06:23.110> it<00:06:23.230> you<00:06:23.620> don't<00:06:23.710> want

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
it's slightly matte on it you don't want

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.160 
it's slightly matte on it you don't want
to<00:06:23.950> add<00:06:24.070> too<00:06:24.250> much<00:06:24.460> because<00:06:24.910> if<00:06:25.300> not<00:06:25.480> it

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
to add too much because if not it

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.400 
to add too much because if not it
becomes<00:06:26.530> very<00:06:27.130> very<00:06:27.460> fragile<00:06:27.790> and<00:06:28.240> it<00:06:29.140> turns

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
becomes very very fragile and it turns

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.160 
becomes very very fragile and it turns
sort<00:06:29.740> of<00:06:29.830> chalky<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:31.330> duller<00:06:31.540> is<00:06:31.690> very<00:06:31.930> very

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
sort of chalky the duller is very very

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:49.189 
sort of chalky the duller is very very
strong

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.260
