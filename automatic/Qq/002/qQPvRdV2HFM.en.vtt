00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.569 
I put that under my brow and then also
in<00:01:47.579> my<00:01:47.790> crease<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:49.399> proceeded<00:01:50.399> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
in my crease and then I proceeded to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.399 
in my crease and then I proceeded to
blend<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.509> well<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.259> was

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
blend that out as well so that it was

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.510 
blend that out as well so that it was
really<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.189> know<00:01:53.340> softened<00:01:54.439> pretty-looking

really you know softened pretty-looking

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.560 
really you know softened pretty-looking
then<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.549> went<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.420> original

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
then I went back to that original

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.179 
then I went back to that original
pigment<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.680> put<00:01:58.890> some<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.159> that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
pigment and I put some of that

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.609 
pigment and I put some of that
underneath<00:01:59.700> my<00:02:00.119> eye<00:02:00.360> I'm<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:01.409> gonna

brighten it up because I found that the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.450 
brighten it up because I found that the
dark<00:02:03.810> colors<00:02:04.229> were<00:02:04.439> too<00:02:04.619> dark<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.340> to
