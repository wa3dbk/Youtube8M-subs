00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.580
 and then to the crowd youtube hvt Allen and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 In this video tutorial we will go 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.630
 learn in a very simple way how to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.029
 render a sequence of moves 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.650
 in the after effects program 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.869
 here we have a sequence of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.180
 movements we create and to create 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.369
 Trusted movements need to arrive 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.119
 very close to the precision in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.669
 each action since we have 54 drawings and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.559
 I opted for fifteen frames per second 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.710
 When we draw sequence we will divide 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 how many drawings have there been 54 by 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 number of frames that fills a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.879
 second case 15 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.010
 then we have a fraction of 3.6 seconds 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.829
 So guys, we'll import this now. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.750
 sequence of drawings for arteflex 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.910
 knowing that we will have 3.6 seconds of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.129
 animation so let's get down to business 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.620
 first let's create a new composition 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.550
 and here we put the title of the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.550
 composition 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.010
 here you can leave as is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.810
 I'm going to put more or less here five 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.020
 A few seconds later, we have justice. 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.840
 now we need to import the sequence of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.570
 drawings by right-clicking and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.299
 choose to import files 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.939
 you can use the control + and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.680
 here is not our whole sequence 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.840
 is very important information to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.939
 everybody the whole sequence needs to be 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.259
 named in a growing fashion 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.090
 you can select the first 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.070
 drawing sequence after you 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 You need to bookmark this box to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.939
 import the complete sequence now 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.549
 We import all the animation and now 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.710
 we just need to adjust it in 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.970
 composition 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.979
 realize that the program has created animation and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.479
 25 frames per second 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.790
 but let's extend a little to 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.070
 we arrive in 3.6 seconds 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.100
 so let's select the sequence here 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.829
 in the design and we will apply the modifier 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.630
 of time is here in law and sign and 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.790
 I'm leaving, and me? 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.180
 now just select and drag what 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.640
 frame that is this diamond and then 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.660
 extend the sequence in the team online until 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.380
 get here next to the three bingos six 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.830
 seconds 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.890
 It 's almost ready now it's missing. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.890
 just adjust the space to be indemnified 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.000
 Okay, so here's our sequence in 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.240
 right time 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.680
 now let's pay and then let's see 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.460
 how are you going to stay 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.970
 so let's click on middle field there 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.190
 That tool has countless tools. 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.250
 settings we will only define that the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.310
 place to be salt and click on indemnify 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.220
 Click this button Renner 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.220
 ok let's wait 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.730
 finally our test is ready 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.960
 animation and transformed into a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.240
 movie 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.620
 if you have not seen how it's done 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.450
 animation process 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.580
 click on the video and see the first 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.010
 tutorial so this is it folks if you
