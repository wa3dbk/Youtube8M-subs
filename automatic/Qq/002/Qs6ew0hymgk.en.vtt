00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.700
 as well as they say that there is what you have to 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.859
 know the church to be behind 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.170
 the altars you also have to know the 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.550
 kitchen behind the stove I'm with 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.250
 one of the pillars of Mexican cuisine 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.710
 in his nikos restaurant that is neither more nor 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.329
 less than my great friend the chef gerardo 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.660
 Vázquez had jerry many thanks 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:22.550
 for this interview and we are very many 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.130
 thank you, we are in a time of chili peppers 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.840
 nogada before seeing the plate and moving to 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.250
 the tasting of the dish part 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.890
 fundamental are the ingredients is not 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.870
 true what are these ingredients that 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.550
 you can talk to us for all of us 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.590
 friends who do not know about our 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.900
 national dish good I think the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.090
 main protagonist is evidently 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.150
 the chili there is a subject that is very 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.340
 rigorous regarding the respect that 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.200
 we have to wait for the products if 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.390
 we take poblano chile if we make a 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.670
 emblematic dish of regional cuisine 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.739
 I think we have to go find the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.150
 product of origin if you can 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.130
 the poblano chile producers here 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.350
 This is the true poblano chile 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.930
 of origin in the village 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.350
 one 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.820
 it is not possible that we continue doing 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.310
 emblematic dishes of the kitchen 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.880
 traditional when we do not use chiles 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.870
 of origin a product really 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.240
 authentic for the preparation of a 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.580
 dish we can make interpretations of 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.229
 dish technical foul as to 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.320
 our own version every cook 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.330
 psoe your own version of everything 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.940
 investigated but I think it's a 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.979
 responsibility as Mexicans and this what 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.720
 we see in the great kitchens in all 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.729
 the countries we do not see ourselves in europe what 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.070
 we see in Latin America now that it has 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.910
 grown both the restoration in 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.210
 Latin America respect and taste that 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.369
 they have to preserve and consume their 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.530
 own products with their products 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.990
 has the ingredient has the chilies in 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.660
 nogada the famous portfolio of san juan no 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.180
 we talk about this little brown dog 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.270
 that maybe it's not so pretty but 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.729
 has the hardness has the aroma has the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.649
 just sweetness to prepare the chiles 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.120
 the fundamental grenade does not 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.220
 fundamental 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.590
 the degree of maturation all this fruit 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.950
 is cultivated and matured in the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.690
 Orchard is not a ripened fruit 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.780
 artificially or that has been harvested 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.660
 it is not imported they are organic products 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.120
 totally than apples for example 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.390
 that are smaller ones bigger than 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.270
 others are not perfect nature is 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.700
 perfect in your imperfection fuck those 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.650
 apples that have different colors 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.750
 is chapete walks on one side and the other 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.510
 side is greener because it was 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.400
 matured inside the tree and is the part 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.440
 red is where you hit it directly 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.630
 ray of the sun and the greenest part is 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.180
 right where it's on the side of the shadow 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.420
 of zacatlán tree of apples yes 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.890
 exactly big apple production 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.300
 who is in town friends for whom 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.670
 do not know how to get out is one of the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.510
 but major cities of Puebla and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.040
 also all the tomato that we use to 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.860
 the elaboration also this if it is 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.300
 organic this is a local production 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.170
 we try also as far as 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.120
 possible to avoid exporting 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.620
 from end to end there are some who do not 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.569
 you can and you have to go to the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.950
 product of origin but the product of 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.200
 base of the restaurant we try to 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.540
 consume productions as close 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.360
 follow this trend of 0 km 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.330
 or maximum 100 kilometers around 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.160
 is this stock and tomato that is one of the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.200
 egypt with some part of the tomatoes 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.710
 the tomato that says the kidney is the same 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.420
 Mark the salty 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.850
 equally if one cuts the tomato in 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.010
 the heart is red it was matured in the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.580
 Bush 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.590
 per share of the sun point is also not a 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.810
 tomato that has been cut and ripe 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.569
 to be able to hold thousands of kilometers 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.420
 of transportation you get as we received 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.560
 the right product ok and these are the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.959
 main fruits that carry 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.840
 exactly on the peach apple stick 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.640
 who are already chopping it in the kitchen 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.799
 we can see the kitchen we can see the 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.799
 other ingredients jerry we go excellent 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.749
 we went through with the effect aisles 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.549
 this is the nikos kitchen then a 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.290
 restaurant that is in a 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.130
 very old neighborhood of the city of 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.020
 mexico- of the oldest 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.770
 prehispanic that these fields something 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.759
 escapo is something that means anteater 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.759
 Y 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.570

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.480
 guillén that is the main hello hello 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.410

 very well thank you very much 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.099
 the downtimes there are no times 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.749
 dead in the kitchen then in the 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.389
 moments that do not have education 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:56.869
 They put to make production because part 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.300
 at the whim of my mom who is the one 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:00.370
 presents the previous one has gone 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.389
 interpreting 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.980
 issues is everything is chopped knife nothing 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:11.430
 it's canned and nothing is 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.780
 ground the meat 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.150
 what are these hard golden hard phrases 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.910
 the Guanches rivers in leaving him with the 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.850
 pulp a little harder firmer longer 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.850
 precisely the function acidity 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.670
 the sweetness of the fruit is the ideal 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.440
 for this and this perfect filling that 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.480
 other ingredients we already have rich that 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.820
 we have there is an ingredient that is is a 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.950
 very personal notion that considered a 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.680
 question of ethics as a missionary 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.120
 use products in danger of extinction 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.280
 the acitron that is traditional for the 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.950
 filling I do not use March is a kind 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.350
 the biznaga that is a constancy of the 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.420
 which traditional cider is made 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.550
 is losing is in shipping risks 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.849
 of decision is one of the species 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.069
 Mexicans that is world of fernán 100 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:02.020
 so today I decided to jump from the 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.020
 tradition saintly authenticity 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:11.710
 and replace them by their name in sweet 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.680
 the flavor but it gives the sweet element 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.180
 acid that also needs this filling 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.810
 Clear 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.810
 and here we have it 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:25.150
 of our friends of those who have done 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.539
 a great expansion partner that is united 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.190
 to a wonderful hacienda is also 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.410
 true Mexicans who produce are 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.830
 also known a large production 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.039
 organic much work much ingenuity has 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.620
 been achieved from the best companies 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:44.949
 SMEs last year for production 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.889
 precisely from something endemic with much 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:51.280
 very carefully 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.919

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:58.310
 perfect with what ingredients we follow 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.960
 jerry 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:06.820
 it develops 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:11.200
 let's start here in this case 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:16.110
