craft mod which after looking around on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.950 
craft mod which after looking around on
YouTube<00:00:23.430> no<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:23.910> seems<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.420> able<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.840> it

look into making this year the actual be

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.080 
look into making this year the actual be
a<00:00:38.790> barrel<00:00:39.180> itself<00:00:39.860> looking<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
a barrel itself looking here first of

you're uncreative also you can just

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.500 
you're uncreative also you can just
spawn<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.050> stuff<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.879> if<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.030> actually<00:00:51.180> want

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
way to doing it and this will have

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
way to doing it and this will have
recipe<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.850> makes<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> scaffolding<00:00:57.840> which

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
recipe here makes the scaffolding which

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.500 
recipe here makes the scaffolding which
you'll<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.730> you'll<00:00:59.730> need<00:00:59.940> two<00:01:00.270> planks

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you'll need you'll need two planks

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
you'll need you'll need two planks
obviously<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.500> rubber<00:01:01.920> wood<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
obviously for a rubber wood in the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
obviously for a rubber wood in the
middle<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.940> make<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.570> booth<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.110> bow<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
middle to make the booth the bow and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
middle to make the booth the bow and
then<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> year<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> wouldn't<00:01:06.510> tap<00:01:06.720> which

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
then this year is it wouldn't tap which

the ingredients there the wooden tap
will<00:01:30.390> keep<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.720> later<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.409> don't<00:01:31.500> need

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
will keep for later so we don't need

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.100 
will keep for later so we don't need
data<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.060> open<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.930> see

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you this happy over water cells row of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.060 
you this happy over water cells row of
hops<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.670> raw<00:01:42.000> wheat<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.860> another<00:01:43.860> world

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
hops and the raw wheat and another world

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.100 
hops and the raw wheat and another world
sugar<00:01:44.399> canes<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:45.270> these<00:01:45.540> top<00:01:45.810> three

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
sugar canes now these top three

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380 
sugar canes now these top three
ingredients<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.240> make

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
ingredients here are all you to make

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.620 
ingredients here are all you to make
beer<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:50.460> bottom<00:01:50.850> row<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.030> sugar<00:01:51.329> canes

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
beer and the bottom row of sugar canes

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.370 
beer and the bottom row of sugar canes
are<00:01:51.960> basically<00:01:52.680> used<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> make<00:01:53.189> run<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
are basically used to make run so the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.749 
are basically used to make run so the
difference<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.920> though<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.549> use

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
difference is though if you can use

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.499 
difference is though if you can use
series<00:01:57.659> does<00:01:58.560> use<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.399> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.270> put

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
series does use all of these if you put

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.359 
series does use all of these if you put
all<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> them<00:02:01.049> all<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.469> them<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.040> all<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.250> them

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
in the barrel at the same time you get

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.410 
in the barrel at the same time you get
beer<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.610> different<00:02:05.909> effect

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
beer but it would be different effect

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.529 
beer but it would be different effect
disease<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.200> used<00:02:07.680> five<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.759> these<00:02:08.879> say

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
disease if you used five of these say

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.150 
disease if you used five of these say
eight<00:02:10.140> hops<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.979> nine<00:02:11.640> week<00:02:11.879> each<00:02:12.660> time

eight hops and nine week each time

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.140 
eight hops and nine week each time
use<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> different<00:02:13.670> amount<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:14.030> each

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
use a different amount of each

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.820 
use a different amount of each
ingredient<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:15.050> end<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.410> with<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.590> different

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
ingredient you end up with a different

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.420 
ingredient you end up with a different
effect<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:17.210> it<00:02:17.650> that's<00:02:18.650> why<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.890> seem<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.280> find

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
effect to it that's why I seem to find

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.600 
effect to it that's why I seem to find
any<00:02:19.670> way<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.540> let's<00:02:21.020> put<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:21.950> few<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:24.610> so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
any way so let's put a few in like so

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.750 
any way so let's put a few in like so
they<00:02:25.820> retake<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.620> all<00:02:27.620> these<00:02:27.920> sugar<00:02:28.550> cane

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
they retake that all these sugar cane

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.020 
they retake that all these sugar cane
right<00:02:29.600> click<00:02:29.810> on<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.110> barrel<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.590> indigo<00:02:31.190> now

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
right click on the barrel and indigo now

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.720 
right click on the barrel and indigo now
it's<00:02:32.870> interesting<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:34.130> know<00:02:34.250> as<00:02:34.370> well<00:02:34.520> that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
it's interesting to know as well that

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.670 
it's interesting to know as well that
you<00:02:34.760> normally<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.600> wait<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.080> while<00:02:36.380> you'd

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you normally have to wait a while you'd

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.500 
you normally have to wait a while you'd
like<00:02:36.830> if<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.100> stick<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.490> tap<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.910> here<00:02:38.090> now<00:02:38.270> it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
like if I stick this tap in here now it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.920 
like if I stick this tap in here now it
would<00:02:38.750> allow<00:02:39.650> me<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.920> get<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.070> drink<00:02:40.310> out<00:02:40.600> but<00:02:41.600> it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
would allow me to get a drink out but it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.230 
would allow me to get a drink out but it
wouldn't<00:02:42.260> be<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.530> much<00:02:43.000> advantages<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.210> it

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
wouldn't be that much advantages to it

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.390 
wouldn't be that much advantages to it
to<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.480> honest<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:45.410> did<00:02:45.860> find<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.220> it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
to be honest and I did find that it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.000 
to be honest and I did find that it
could<00:02:46.610> kill<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.060> as<00:02:47.210> well<00:02:47.360> in<00:02:47.630> game<00:02:47.980> we<00:02:48.980> used

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
could kill you as well in game we used

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.010 
could kill you as well in game we used
to<00:02:49.190> have<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.550> server<00:02:50.060> for<00:02:50.420> like<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.720> city

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
to have it on a server for like a city

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.890 
to have it on a server for like a city
server<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.830> every<00:02:52.040> other<00:02:52.070> pub<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.900> basically

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
server and every other pub and basically

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.810 
server and every other pub and basically
a<00:02:54.050> lot<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.830> Minecraft<00:02:55.370> people<00:02:55.640> died

a lot of the Minecraft people died

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.190 
a lot of the Minecraft people died

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.250 
left good and the way I look at that now
that<00:03:54.860> doesn't<00:03:55.070> look<00:03:55.550> good<00:03:55.700> at<00:03:55.760> all<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.330> we'll

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
that doesn't look good at all so we'll

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.500 
that doesn't look good at all so we'll
test<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.709> but<00:03:57.980> at<00:03:58.550> on<00:03:58.730> takers<00:03:59.030> can<00:03:59.150> have<00:03:59.300> very

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
test it but at on takers can have very

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.560 
test it but at on takers can have very
good<00:03:59.660> results<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:00.610> bottoms<00:04:01.610> up<00:04:04.360> as<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.510> can

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
good results so bottoms up as you can

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.470 
good results so bottoms up as you can
see<00:04:05.870> right<00:04:06.140> here<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.340> created<00:04:07.790> mining<00:04:08.239> fatigue

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
see right here is created mining fatigue

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.949 
see right here is created mining fatigue
so<00:04:09.050> that's<00:04:09.230> not<00:04:09.410> good<00:04:09.680> really<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.840> what<00:04:11.840> that

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
so that's not good really so what that

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.810 
so that's not good really so what that
basically<00:04:12.140> does<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:12.920> will<00:04:13.040> slow<00:04:13.340> down<00:04:13.370> my

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
basically does is it will slow down my

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.100 
basically does is it will slow down my
mind<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.239> so<00:04:14.420> if<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.570> will<00:04:14.720> not<00:04:14.810> never<00:04:14.989> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
mind in so if I will not never the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.289 
mind in so if I will not never the
pickaxe<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.590> start<00:04:15.980> chopping<00:04:16.400> school<00:04:16.640> I<00:04:16.850> don't

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
pickaxe to start chopping school I don't

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.330 
pickaxe to start chopping school I don't
know<00:04:17.359> rock<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:18.680> would<00:04:18.859> probably<00:04:19.010> take<00:04:19.130> me

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
know rock it would probably take me

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.640 
know rock it would probably take me
longer<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.760> get<00:04:19.970> through<00:04:20.030> because<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:21.320> what

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
longer to get through because of what

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.250 
longer to get through because of what
I've<00:04:21.859> that<00:04:22.160> happened<00:04:22.520> there<00:04:22.700> as<00:04:23.450> we<00:04:23.660> trade<00:04:23.900> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
I've that happened there as we trade the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.899 
I've that happened there as we trade the
run

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.070 

the<00:04:28.909> Romans<00:04:29.180> actually<00:04:29.449> give<00:04:29.599> us<00:04:29.719> some

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
the Romans actually give us some

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.230 
the Romans actually give us some
resistance<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:31.009> damage<00:04:31.580> resistance<00:04:32.090> and

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
resistance the damage resistance and

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.909 
resistance the damage resistance and
some<00:04:32.539> fire<00:04:32.780> resistance<00:04:33.319> as<00:04:33.469> you<00:04:33.530> can<00:04:33.680> see<00:04:33.800> it

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
some fire resistance as you can see it

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.459 
some fire resistance as you can see it
doesn't<00:04:34.069> really<00:04:34.279> last<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.849> long<00:04:35.360> again<00:04:36.349> i

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
doesn't really last that long again i

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.230 
doesn't really last that long again i
don't<00:04:36.650> think<00:04:36.800> i<00:04:36.830> left<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.189> rum<00:04:37.430> then<00:04:38.029> this

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
don't think i left the rum then this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.300 
don't think i left the rum then this
long<00:04:38.509> enough<00:04:38.779> I'd<00:04:39.349> say<00:04:39.560> about<00:04:39.590> two<00:04:39.979> or<00:04:40.129> three

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
long enough I'd say about two or three

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.420 
long enough I'd say about two or three
minecraft<00:04:41.210> days<00:04:41.650> best<00:04:42.650> time<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:43.069> leave<00:04:43.249> them

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
minecraft days best time to leave them

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.300 
minecraft days best time to leave them
for<00:04:43.840> so<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:45.499> can<00:04:45.680> get<00:04:45.800> end<00:04:45.949> up<00:04:46.009> with<00:04:46.129> different

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
for so you can get end up with different

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.929 
for so you can get end up with different
effects<00:04:46.909> off<00:04:47.060> either<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.599> found<00:04:47.960> with<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.199> rum

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
effects off either I found with the rum

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.059 
effects off either I found with the rum
sometimes<00:04:49.939> you<00:04:50.689> get<00:04:51.080> like<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.409> dizzy<00:04:51.740> effect

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
sometimes you get like the dizzy effect

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.649 
sometimes you get like the dizzy effect
which<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.490> basically<00:04:52.789> when<00:04:53.090> you're<00:04:53.210> drunk<00:04:53.389> the

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
which is basically when you're drunk the

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.390 
which is basically when you're drunk the
whole<00:04:53.749> screen<00:04:54.139> goes<00:04:54.379> crazy<00:04:54.710> it's<00:04:55.069> just<00:04:55.279> like

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
whole screen goes crazy it's just like

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.459 
whole screen goes crazy it's just like
when<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:55.729> step<00:04:55.969> through<00:04:55.999> never<00:04:56.449> portal<00:04:56.900> the

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
when you step through never portal the

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.459 
when you step through never portal the
whole<00:04:57.620> screen<00:04:57.889> goes<00:04:58.159> nuts<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:59.349> the<00:05:00.349> other

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
whole screen goes nuts and the other

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.800 
whole screen goes nuts and the other
effects<00:05:00.979> of<00:05:01.159> founders<00:05:01.490> you<00:05:01.610> go<00:05:01.939> blind<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.599> lot

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
effects of founders you go blind a lot

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.200 
effects of founders you go blind a lot
of<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:03.319> screen<00:05:03.680> goes<00:05:03.830> black<00:05:04.129> very<00:05:04.849> hard<00:05:05.060> to

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
of the screen goes black very hard to

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.719 
of the screen goes black very hard to
see<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:06.500> other<00:05:06.560> effects<00:05:06.919> obviously<00:05:07.340> is<00:05:07.490> the

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
see the other effects obviously is the

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.219 
see the other effects obviously is the
fire<00:05:08.300> resistance<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:08.990> stuff<00:05:09.500> with<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.400> beer

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
fire resistance and stuff with the beer

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.959 
fire resistance and stuff with the beer
I<00:05:12.229> can't<00:05:12.800> really<00:05:13.009> remember<00:05:13.219> any<00:05:13.610> of<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.789> good

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
I can't really remember any of the good

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.760 
I can't really remember any of the good
advantages<00:05:14.659> of<00:05:14.750> beer<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.199> be<00:05:15.319> honest<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.740> only

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
advantages of beer to be honest the only

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.469 
advantages of beer to be honest the only
ones<00:05:16.069> I<00:05:16.189> can<00:05:16.219> be<00:05:16.460> think<00:05:16.729> I<00:05:16.849> with<00:05:17.029> the<00:05:17.089> bad<00:05:17.240> ones

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
ones I can be think I with the bad ones

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.670 
ones I can be think I with the bad ones
which<00:05:18.139> is<00:05:18.289> like<00:05:18.439> death<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.719> mining

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
which is like death and that the mining

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.550 
which is like death and that the mining
fatigue<00:05:22.629> so<00:05:23.629> i'll<00:05:23.930> have<00:05:24.080> to<00:05:24.199> do<00:05:24.289> some<00:05:24.319> more

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
fatigue so i'll have to do some more

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.920 
fatigue so i'll have to do some more
experimenting<00:05:25.249> with<00:05:25.279> that<00:05:25.520> but<00:05:25.789> to<00:05:26.599> be<00:05:26.689> honest

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
experimenting with that but to be honest

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.629 
experimenting with that but to be honest
I<00:05:27.020> never<00:05:27.080> really<00:05:27.319> used<00:05:27.710> via<00:05:28.009> that<00:05:28.189> much<00:05:28.400> only

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
I never really used via that much only

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.610 
I never really used via that much only
also<00:05:28.969> we<00:05:29.419> just<00:05:29.629> use<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.080> run<00:05:30.259> because<00:05:30.439> you

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
also we just use the run because you

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.790 
also we just use the run because you
give<00:05:30.919> you<00:05:31.039> the<00:05:31.159> drunk<00:05:31.400> effect<00:05:31.699> um<00:05:32.770> sure<00:05:33.770> i

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
give you the drunk effect um sure i

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.519 
give you the drunk effect um sure i
think<00:05:33.889> is<00:05:34.129> that<00:05:34.250> everything<00:05:35.319> so<00:05:36.319> like<00:05:36.439> i<00:05:36.469> said

think is that everything so like i said

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:38.980 
think is that everything so like i said
if<00:05:36.770> i<00:05:36.889> took<00:05:37.400> all<00:05:37.729> of<00:05:37.759> these<00:05:38.150> here<00:05:38.419> now<00:05:38.539> put<00:05:38.839> them

if i took all of these here now put them

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.639 
if i took all of these here now put them
in<00:05:39.139> I<00:05:39.409> left<00:05:39.979> it<00:05:40.129> for<00:05:40.279> three<00:05:40.909> days<00:05:41.649> minecraft

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
days that is not normal day it would

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.529 
days that is not normal day it would
probably<00:05:45.409> yield<00:05:45.830> me<00:05:46.189> some<00:05:46.849> probably<00:05:47.419> good

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
when we had our old city and you'd be

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.300 
when we had our old city and you'd be
trying<00:06:24.259> to<00:06:24.349> walking<00:06:24.649> down<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.889> street<00:06:25.129> and

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
trying to walking down the street and

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.610 
trying to walking down the street and
the<00:06:25.550> whole<00:06:25.699> world<00:06:26.029> is<00:06:26.240> doing<00:06:26.479> that<00:06:26.629> it<00:06:26.990> does

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
the whole world is doing that it does

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.670 
the whole world is doing that it does
not<00:06:27.649> help<00:06:28.069> at<00:06:28.189> all<00:06:29.050> but<00:06:30.050> that<00:06:30.080> guess<00:06:30.469> that's

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
not help at all but that guess that's

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.869 
not help at all but that guess that's
the<00:06:30.740> desired<00:06:31.250> effect<00:06:31.599> nausea<00:06:32.599> there<00:06:32.870> you<00:06:32.960> go

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:33.879 
the desired effect nausea there you go

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.339 
the desired effect nausea there you go
basically<00:06:34.879> that<00:06:34.909> that<00:06:35.659> is<00:06:35.779> the<00:06:35.870> effect<00:06:35.930> most

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
basically that that is the effect most

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.619 
basically that that is the effect most
people<00:06:36.680> on<00:06:36.769> the<00:06:36.889> also<00:06:37.190> used<00:06:37.430> to<00:06:37.550> want<00:06:37.819> when

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
people on the also used to want when

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:39.519 
people on the also used to want when
they<00:06:38.719> drunk<00:06:38.899> runs

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
they drunk runs

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:40.449 
they drunk runs
I can't<00:06:39.799> really<00:06:39.919> see<00:06:40.159> that<00:06:40.279> as<00:06:40.339> a

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:40.459 
I can't really see that as a

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:43.209 
I can't really see that as a
disadvantage<00:06:41.299> more<00:06:42.199> or<00:06:42.289> less<00:06:42.319> what<00:06:42.679> most

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
disadvantage more or less what most

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.659 
disadvantage more or less what most
people<00:06:43.489> do<00:06:43.669> when<00:06:43.849> they<00:06:43.999> do<00:06:44.149> people<00:06:44.329> drink<00:06:44.509> into

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
people do when they do people drink into

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.399 
people do when they do people drink into
anyway<00:06:46.669> I<00:06:47.029> thought<00:06:47.659> I'd<00:06:47.809> just<00:06:47.839> cover<00:06:48.229> this

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.409 
anyway I thought I'd just cover this

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:49.839 
anyway I thought I'd just cover this
because<00:06:48.679> like<00:06:48.799> I<00:06:48.829> said<00:06:48.949> I've<00:06:49.189> seen<00:06:49.399> it<00:06:49.519> no<00:06:49.699> way

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
because like I said I've seen it no way

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.389
