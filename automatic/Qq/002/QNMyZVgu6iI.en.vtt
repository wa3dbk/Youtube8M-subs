00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
construction I'm talking about see this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.569 
construction I'm talking about see this
if<00:00:57.120> you're<00:00:57.270> looking<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> there<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.920> right

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
if you're looking on it there is right

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.939 
if you're looking on it there is right
here<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.420> actually<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:01.050> its<00:01:01.230> own<00:01:01.410> frame

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
here this is actually on its own frame

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.759 
here this is actually on its own frame
this<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.059> not<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.780> frame<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:04.379> part<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
this is not the frame is not part of the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.130 
this is not the frame is not part of the
grill<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.250> mean<00:01:05.790> by<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.630> has<00:01:06.810> its<00:01:06.960> own

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
grill I mean by that is this has its own

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770 
grill I mean by that is this has its own
separate<00:01:07.650> cook<00:01:07.890> does<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.939> cast<00:01:09.210> aluminum

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
separate cook does this is cast aluminum

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
separate cook does this is cast aluminum
so<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.650> hold<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> heat<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
so it's going to really hold the heat in

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.280 
so it's going to really hold the heat in
and<00:01:11.970> everything<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.630> about<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> as
