don't<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.409> had<00:01:49.500> his<00:01:49.619> capsule<00:01:49.920> done

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
don't know if you had his capsule done

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.440 
don't know if you had his capsule done
or<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:50.610> guessing<00:01:50.939> he<00:01:51.060> did<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
or what I'm guessing he did because that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.600 
or what I'm guessing he did because that
is<00:01:51.780> fairly<00:01:52.020> easier<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.460> your

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
is fairly easier that then to get your

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
is fairly easier that then to get your
portfolio<00:01:54.119> done<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.380> need

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
portfolio done because you really need

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.139 
portfolio done because you really need
to<00:01:55.560> stay<00:01:55.799> focused<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.399> portfolio<00:01:56.670> where

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
to stay focused on your portfolio where

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.370 
to stay focused on your portfolio where
you're<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.299> gonna<00:01:57.479> procrastinate<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.259> way

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you're just gonna procrastinate it way

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.609 
you're just gonna procrastinate it way
too<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.899> was<00:02:01.020> obvious<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.439> me

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
too much and all so it was obvious to me

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.789 
too much and all so it was obvious to me
that<00:02:01.649> he<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:01.979> behind<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.500> little<00:02:04.500> bit

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that he was behind because a little bit

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.479 
that he was behind because a little bit
maybe<00:02:05.509> 15<00:02:06.509> minutes<00:02:06.750> into<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.489> conversation

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
maybe 15 minutes into the conversation

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.639 
maybe 15 minutes into the conversation
they<00:02:08.970> were<00:02:09.030> having<00:02:09.509> three<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.020> teachers<00:02:10.379> got

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
they were having three the teachers got

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.559 
they were having three the teachers got
up<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.129> they<00:02:11.160> left<00:02:11.550> probably<00:02:12.239> due<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
up and they left probably due to the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.920 
up and they left probably due to the
fact

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
fact

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.899 
fact
they<00:02:13.109> needed<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.439> get<00:02:13.590> their<00:02:13.769> work<00:02:13.950> done<00:02:14.010> David

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
they needed to get their work done David

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.179 
they needed to get their work done David
needed<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.209> go<00:02:15.329> to<00:02:15.359> their<00:02:15.780> class<00:02:16.099> whatever<00:02:17.099> the

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
needed to go to their class whatever the

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.500 
needed to go to their class whatever the
case<00:02:17.310> may<00:02:17.549> be<00:02:17.579> so<00:02:17.909> there<00:02:18.060> was<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.359> teacher

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
case may be so there was one teacher

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.319 
case may be so there was one teacher
left<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.189> it<00:02:20.340> was<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.549> kid<00:02:20.790> his<00:02:21.060> mom

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
left and it so it was the kid his mom

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.569 
left and it so it was the kid his mom
and<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.689> last<00:02:22.170> teacher<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.280> could<00:02:23.430> tell

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
and the last teacher and you could tell

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.860 
and the last teacher and you could tell
that<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.849> student<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.359> teacher<00:02:24.569> didn't

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
that the student in the teacher didn't

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.000 
that the student in the teacher didn't
have<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.170> great<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.409> a<00:02:25.620> relationship

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
have that great of a relationship

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.619 
have that great of a relationship
because<00:02:26.400> he<00:02:26.519> was<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.909> given<00:02:27.120> an<00:02:27.239> attitude

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
because he was kind of given an attitude

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.509 
because he was kind of given an attitude
store<00:02:27.959> towards<00:02:28.500> her<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.769> was<00:02:29.189> sitting<00:02:29.489> right

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
store towards her I was sitting right

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.089 
store towards her I was sitting right
across<00:02:29.879> like<00:02:30.450> maybe<00:02:30.900> 20<00:02:31.170> feet<00:02:31.500> away<00:02:31.620> from<00:02:31.920> them

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
across like maybe 20 feet away from them

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.250 
across like maybe 20 feet away from them
so<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> saw<00:02:32.969> everything<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.629> going<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.959> I

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so I saw everything that was going on I

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.709 
so I saw everything that was going on I
basically<00:02:35.040> heard<00:02:35.519> enough<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:36.030> sum<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.299> up<00:02:36.450> into

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
basically heard enough to sum it up into

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.099 
basically heard enough to sum it up into
the<00:02:36.840> story<00:02:37.139> time<00:02:37.409> so<00:02:38.219> the<00:02:39.060> teacher<00:02:39.329> got<00:02:39.659> up<00:02:39.840> and

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
the story time so the teacher got up and

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.750 
the story time so the teacher got up and
he's<00:02:40.349> like<00:02:40.409> there<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.920> an<00:02:41.069> option<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.489> your

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
he's like there is an option that your

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.369 
he's like there is an option that your
son<00:02:41.969> can<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.629> called<00:02:42.810> task<00:02:43.079> ramped

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
son can do and it's called task ramped

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.229 
son can do and it's called task ramped
up<00:02:43.560> where<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.069> go<00:02:44.310> ahead<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.790> roll<00:02:45.090> them

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
up where you can go ahead and roll them

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.569 
up where you can go ahead and roll them
into<00:02:45.359> a<00:02:45.480> period<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.230> he<00:02:46.709> basically<00:02:46.980> gets<00:02:47.340> I

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
into a period and he basically gets I

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.610 
into a period and he basically gets I
think<00:02:48.239> it's<00:02:48.329> two<00:02:48.480> hours<00:02:48.659> to<00:02:48.959> complete<00:02:49.290> as<00:02:49.470> much

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
think it's two hours to complete as much

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.740 
think it's two hours to complete as much
as<00:02:49.799> tasks<00:02:50.189> as<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.549> can<00:02:50.790> as<00:02:51.030> long<00:02:51.359> as<00:02:51.629> they're

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
as tasks as you can as long as they're

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.649 
as tasks as you can as long as they're
passing<00:02:52.169> he<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.650> put<00:02:52.769> them<00:02:52.829> as<00:02:52.980> portfolio<00:02:53.659> but

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
passing he can put them as portfolio but

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.080 
passing he can put them as portfolio but
what<00:02:55.620> he<00:02:55.859> what<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.280> apparent<00:02:56.730> didn't<00:02:56.970> know
