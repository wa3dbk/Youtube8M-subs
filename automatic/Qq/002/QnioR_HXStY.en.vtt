things off here so there's that one the
Intel<00:02:01.049> exchange<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.770> second<00:02:02.219> most<00:02:02.369> useful

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
Intel exchange is the second most useful

because there's a links and resources

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.700 
because there's a links and resources
you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.880> sign<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.560> ask

as sort

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.510 
as sort
so<00:02:12.520> here<00:02:13.520> there's<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:14.739> long<00:02:15.739> list<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.160> links

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
so here there's a long list of links

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.550 
so here there's a long list of links

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.640 
right there so here you can see that the
long<00:02:21.800> list<00:02:22.069> of<00:02:22.220> Link's<00:02:22.640> takes<00:02:22.910> up<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.620> lot<00:02:24.620> of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
long list of Link's takes up a lot of
