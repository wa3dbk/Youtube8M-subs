00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.380
 hi friends are sure that 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.610
 the intentional mayor is the one who 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.030
 big size 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.130
 so called it that it is worth being afraid 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.170
 the fact that he is merciless 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.869
 malaria source 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.470
 in fact his name is not malarial 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.869
 mosquitoes 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.500
 its biological name 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.970
 the centipede and he doesn't even have a sting 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.510
 to bite you mosquito- type 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:43.360
 lidia is a whole family numbering 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.640
 about 4,200 species whose representatives 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.980
 common everywhere 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.140
 Of course, except for Antarctica, those that 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.380
 tropical forests inhabit can 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.320
 reach 10 7 meter height 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.680
 mosquito lives on the lakes 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.380
 marshes in general near water bodies or 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.740
 places where there is moisture feed 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.720
 they are either nectar or holy spirit yes 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.050
 Yes, they have the ability 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.520
 oddly exist without food by 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.670
 my every person since childhood 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.130
 lay in the head that this is the one who 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.440
 need to be afraid and of course every 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.140
 tries at the sight of so much 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.260
 mosquito quickly kill him until he 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.530
 bit you but real peddlers 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.390
 malaria is as follows in 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.570
 mostly they live in hot countries 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.229
 such as africa central and south 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.800
 america southeast asia countries and 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.659
 others where there is no harsh winters they 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.200
 also live in Russia 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.270
 in the coldest regions they are not found, but in 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.900
 the rest of the country can 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 meet 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.030
 their main omens are long back 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.880
 legs apparently it is not located 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.390
 parallel to the surface and the back 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.780
 Zadran is another sign of hind legs 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.000
 not 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.420
 do not allow it to be in parallel 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.239
 surface as their wings are 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.819
 black spots and if we talk about females 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.790
 then they have their differences on the head 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.389
 they have a tentacle of the same length as 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.999
 proboscis 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:22.400
 but I think when you sit down to margot 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:24.859
 consider it will not be easy 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.769
 swat in general having learned that 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:30.499
 mosquitoes duty legs harmless explain 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.870
 to their close friends and acquaintances about it 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:35.299
 because when a butterfly flies past you 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.879
 you also do not have the desire and 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.980
 swat in general let's not 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.079
 disturb the harmony of nature friends 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.870
