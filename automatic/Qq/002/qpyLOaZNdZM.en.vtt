00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you're the exact same town of test as we

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
you're the exact same town of test as we
do<00:01:01.590> over<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.190> well<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.930> coming<00:01:03.930> into

doesn't<00:01:09.060> seem<00:01:09.540> super<00:01:09.900> super<00:01:10.140> fast<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.500> time

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
doesn't seem super super fast that time

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.510 
doesn't seem super super fast that time
bring<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.630> back<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.439> again<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.340> isn't

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the ND filter number one now I've done

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
the ND filter number one now I've done
one<00:01:16.950> test<00:01:17.189> without<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> filter<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:17.939> because<00:01:18.299> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
one test without a filter on because of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.600 
one test without a filter on because of
the<00:01:18.479> bright<00:01:18.840> lights<00:01:18.869> today<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.430> looks

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the bright lights today and it looks

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.100 
the bright lights today and it looks
something<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:21.720> bright

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
something really really really bright

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.780 
something really really really bright
and<00:01:22.170> too<00:01:22.590> bright<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:22.890> I've<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.580> only

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and too bright so I've put the only

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.840 
and too bright so I've put the only
filter<00:01:24.119> them<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.490> things<00:01:26.490> number<00:01:26.670> one

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
filter them or not and things number one

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.249 
filter them or not and things number one
anyway<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.630> should<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.840> an<00:01:27.990> ND<00:01:28.229> filter

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
anyway so it should be an ND filter

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.890 
anyway so it should be an ND filter
number<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.240> think<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.600> actually<00:01:30.689> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
number one I think it's actually you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300 
number one I think it's actually you
changing<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> filter<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> flower<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
changing the filter on the flower it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.640 
changing the filter on the flower it
says<00:01:32.430> nd<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> screen<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.259> put<00:01:34.500> 2

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
says nd one on the screen now if I put 2

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.930 
on three on that tour camcorder so yeah
and<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.390> going<00:03:30.570> round<00:03:31.670> what<00:03:32.670> does<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.850> look

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
and it going round what does it look

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.490 
and it going round what does it look
like

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
like

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.479 
like
again<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.530> mean<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.709> cat<00:03:34.890> will<00:03:35.070> tell<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
again I mean a cat will tell on the

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.539 
again I mean a cat will tell on the
screen<00:03:35.900> specifically<00:03:36.900> because<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.860> did<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> test

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
screen specifically because I did a test

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.979 
screen specifically because I did a test
without<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.850> end<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.209> ND<00:03:39.510> filter<00:03:39.540> on

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
without the end of the ND filter on

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.800 
without the end of the ND filter on
which<00:03:40.560> I'll<00:03:40.709> sure<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.220> looks<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.549> now<00:03:41.810> that's

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
which I'll sure it looks like now that's

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.229 
which I'll sure it looks like now that's
what<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.110> looks<00:03:43.230> like<00:03:43.350> with<00:03:43.530> no<00:03:43.709> filter<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.340> on

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
what it looks like with no filter and on

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.090 
what it looks like with no filter and on
the<00:03:45.360> screen<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.780> looks<00:03:45.959> really<00:03:46.140> nice<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:46.799> on

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
the screen that looks really nice but on

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.920 
the screen that looks really nice but on
the<00:03:47.220> computer<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:48.000> had<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.269> quick<00:03:48.510> look<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.780> there

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
the computer I had a quick look at there

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.050 
the computer I had a quick look at there
and<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.470> was<00:03:49.590> all<00:03:49.650> washed<00:03:49.890> out<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.850> we<00:03:50.940> are

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
and it was all washed out so we are

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.229 
and it was all washed out so we are
going<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.330> put<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.510> back<00:03:51.600> onto<00:03:51.810> number<00:03:51.989> one

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
going to put it back onto number one

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.800 
going to put it back onto number one
number<00:03:54.239> two

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
number two

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.090 
number two
and<00:03:57.440> number<00:03:58.190> three<00:03:59.530> and<00:04:00.530> we'll<00:04:00.680> do<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:00.890> once

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
and number three and we'll do that once

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.280 
and number three and we'll do that once
more<00:04:01.340> over<00:04:01.490> here<00:04:01.850> so<00:04:02.480> I'll<00:04:02.600> do<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.050> full

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
more over here so I'll do it to the full

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.470 
more over here so I'll do it to the full
kind<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.740> panning<00:04:04.130> shot<00:04:04.160> there<00:04:04.550> so<00:04:05.270> you<00:04:05.360> can

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
kind of a panning shot there so you can

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.940 
kind of a panning shot there so you can
kind<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.780> see<00:04:05.900> there's<00:04:06.080> more<00:04:06.230> sky<00:04:06.680> and

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
kind of see there's more sky and

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.220 
kind of see there's more sky and
everything<00:04:07.220> like<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:07.400> so<00:04:07.959> we're<00:04:08.959> gonna<00:04:09.020> go

everything like that so we're gonna go

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.740 
everything like that so we're gonna go
to<00:04:09.290> filter<00:04:09.680> off<00:04:10.240> so<00:04:11.240> it's<00:04:11.360> currently<00:04:11.480> off

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
to filter off so it's currently off

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.990 
to filter off so it's currently off
filter<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:13.580> then<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.850> number<00:04:14.209> one<00:04:15.910> number<00:04:16.910> two

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
filter and then to number one number two

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.950 
filter and then to number one number two
and<00:04:20.000> last<00:04:22.300> that's<00:04:23.300> sorry<00:04:23.540> that's<00:04:23.690> on<00:04:23.780> number

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
back to number one see what looks like

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.250 
back to number one see what looks like
on<00:04:37.550> there<00:04:37.760> again<00:04:38.600> I<00:04:38.660> can't<00:04:38.900> really<00:04:39.110> know<00:04:39.230> I

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
on there again I can't really know I

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.210 
on there again I can't really know I
don't<00:04:39.380> really<00:04:39.560> know<00:04:39.770> it's<00:04:39.919> gonna<00:04:40.010> look<00:04:40.130> like

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
don't really know it's gonna look like

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.030 
don't really know it's gonna look like
until<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.610> stick<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.030> on<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.180> computer<00:04:41.360> and

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
until I stick it on the computer and

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.260 
until I stick it on the computer and
it's<00:04:43.040> just<00:04:43.160> got<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.310> little<00:04:43.430> bit<00:04:43.669> darker<00:04:44.090> at<00:04:44.180> the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
it's just got a little bit darker at the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.610 
it's just got a little bit darker at the
moment<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:44.750> kind<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.050> give<00:04:45.169> you<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.260> bit<00:04:45.410> more<00:04:45.440> of

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
moment so kind of give you a bit more of

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.390 
moment so kind of give you a bit more of
skyline<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:47.680> think<00:04:48.680> it's<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.890> longer<00:04:49.160> video<00:04:49.280> than

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
skyline I think it's a longer video than

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.980 
skyline I think it's a longer video than
I<00:04:49.520> would<00:04:49.640> normally<00:04:49.669> do<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.330> gas<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.660> my<00:04:50.780> video

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
I would normally do the gas to my video

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.110 
I would normally do the gas to my video
tests<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.950> reason<00:04:52.280> for<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.520> well<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:53.000> is

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
tests the reason for that well it is

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.480 
tests the reason for that well it is
just<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.419> dedicated<00:04:53.840> camcorder<00:04:54.410> so<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.950> think<00:04:55.400> it

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
just a dedicated camcorder so I think it

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.850 
just a dedicated camcorder so I think it
is<00:04:55.580> deserving<00:04:56.060> so<00:04:56.210> on<00:04:56.270> kind<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:56.630> long<00:04:56.810> test<00:04:57.050> and

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
is deserving so on kind of long test and

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.900 
is deserving so on kind of long test and
last<00:04:58.070> but<00:04:58.190> not<00:04:58.280> least<00:04:58.490> we're<00:04:58.700> just<00:04:58.820> gonna

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
last but not least we're just gonna

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.180 
last but not least we're just gonna
zooming<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.419> little<00:04:59.630> shed<00:04:59.840> down<00:05:00.050> there<00:05:00.320> and

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
zooming to little shed down there and

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.770 
zooming to little shed down there and
this<00:05:01.370> is<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.580> fastest<00:05:02.030> he<00:05:02.150> can<00:05:02.270> zoom<00:05:02.479> in<00:05:02.630> zoom

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
this is the fastest he can zoom in zoom

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.580 
this is the fastest he can zoom in zoom
all<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.740> way<00:05:04.160> in<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.930> what<00:05:06.110> does<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.290> detail

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
all the way in and what does the detail

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.159 
all the way in and what does the detail
look<00:05:06.710> like<00:05:06.890> I<00:05:07.479> mean<00:05:08.479> again<00:05:08.750> looking<00:05:08.990> on<00:05:09.080> the
