loto<00:05:36.480> box<00:05:37.520> it<00:05:38.520> doesn't<00:05:38.820> fit<00:05:38.940> too<00:05:39.120> comfortable

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
loto box it doesn't fit too comfortable

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.390 
loto box it doesn't fit too comfortable
but<00:05:40.350> I'm<00:05:40.590> going<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.860> rock<00:05:40.980> the<00:05:41.130> hell<00:05:41.250> that

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
but I'm going to rock the hell that

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.860 
but I'm going to rock the hell that
means<00:05:41.430> these<00:05:41.880> are<00:05:42.030> pretty<00:05:42.180> hard<00:05:42.450> with<00:05:42.720> some

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
means these are pretty hard with some

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.750 
means these are pretty hard with some
jeans<00:05:43.110> tongue<00:05:44.070> that<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:44.280> guys<00:05:44.430> think<00:05:44.670> with

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
jeans tongue that you guys think with

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.620 
jeans tongue that you guys think with
the<00:05:44.880> laces<00:05:45.270> red<00:05:46.050> or<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.770> regular<00:05:47.250> ones<00:05:47.490> I<00:05:47.730> like

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
the laces red or the regular ones I like

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.970 
the laces red or the regular ones I like
the<00:05:48.660> white<00:05:48.930> but<00:05:49.260> I<00:05:49.290> think<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.620> red<00:05:49.770> is<00:05:49.890> going

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
the white but I think the red is going

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.850 
the white but I think the red is going
to<00:05:50.070> pop<00:05:50.220> off<00:05:50.870> these<00:05:51.870> are<00:05:51.990> all<00:05:52.020> wrapped<00:05:52.410> up<00:05:52.620> be
