00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 In this video I want you the wolf 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.100
 Earlier, Graf also called 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.930
 mobile 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.880
 which is indeed in Amazon has the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.910
 cheap for 11 euros and that's fine 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.599
 something very meaningful so comes the good 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.599
 piece to home 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.900
 Actually, that's really fast 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.500
 packed short description and that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.350
 was it me that I prepared something 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.449
 have this little device and it is 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.619
 quite real meaningful I had 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 always the problem if I am with now 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.890
 wood have built or so one has 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.570
 now no stand drill or 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 Similar but one would like to straight 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.160
 drill holes and just when you 're doing it 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.050
 should have to go faster then the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.960
 really hard and there helps this aid 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.360
 uncommon is in more stable or more valuable 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.100
 plastic so firmly to high quality 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.570
 then you have different hole here 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.350
 strengthen 456 8 and 10 mm and these holes 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 are here with with precious metal 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 that means amplified if you go in here 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 board so here you would the drill 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.890
 then, so to speak , creates 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.300
 It does not work and it really does 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.850
 Ensures that actually in the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.729
 all this life this boring 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.250
 help the drill just vertical and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.049
 in the right angle in the work piece 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.799
 is introduced and that is the whole 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.210
 sense of it 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.380
 now you might ask yourself 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.119
 yes great if I'm here now 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 Mark how do I know that because of me 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 really for me to go over there 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.210
 the orientations are here running one 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 long and you see each one here 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.619
 single hole gives one here 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.329
 Orientation so therefore I can 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.400
 no longer a point but I give 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.409
 a bigger cross, so to say, and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.380
 can therefore me in too 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.619
 the xy coordinate then move, so to speak 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.689
 with these drills or with these 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.810
 this aid and I have there I can 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.759
 also drill holes well what 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.500
 Workers nice thing is that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.759
 there is such a little rubber ball here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.100
 they do not look big, but big 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.079
 are so far beyond that one stands now 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.030
 for example also on flow or on 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.770
 smooth surfaces just a good one 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.590
 Now we could get to the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.780
 wall board so to speak 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.640
 which is also a very sensible thing 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.430
 I personally think that you are in 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.230
 which one turns this aid down 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.239
 For example, can you see dirt? 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.430
 always fall the filth but what's up 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.400
 then the dirt really stays here too 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.660
 then hang in and out, so to speak 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.180
 not out so that also one more 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 quite nice thing that you always the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.379
 drilling progress or even the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.450
 dirt can catch without that 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.420
 you now need a vacuum cleaner and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.000
 Last but not least, there is a right angle 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.620
 here below 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.319
 this note has the following features 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.959
 namely that with this aid 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.870
 also how one looks at one 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.340
 rectangular imagine born could not 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.680
 that you slip off here now or 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.019
 You could do the same 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.209
 then help with a screw on a 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.540
 pipe or round wood tension and can there 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.640
 also without problems 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.200
 drill precise holes and I have to 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.340
 say that's really a thing 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.319
 I have wished for a long time and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.019
 I would say that is complete money 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.090
 value is definitely fun with it 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.290
 I work now I have new 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.819
 I'll do another test though 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.980
 I really used that and so on 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.900
 But overall I would have Conclusion 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.540
 now say that I firmly I'll to the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.650
 10 euro is always worth it because we know 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.049
 all sometimes it just works 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.000
 Precision and then it is extremely important 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.430
 and you have to be thankful about that 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.290
 such a small practical help where you 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.010
 It can be really worth it to say 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.010
 complete
