00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
long these bonds but that was just off

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.959 
long these bonds but that was just off

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
so now let's go and try to find him he

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.950 
so now let's go and try to find him he
actually<00:00:53.480> spawned<00:00:54.050> from<00:00:54.590> about<00:00:55.040> right<00:00:55.310> here

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
actually spawned from about right here

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.300 
actually spawned from about right here
to<00:00:56.960> up<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:58.220> this<00:00:58.820> little<00:00:59.030> area<00:00:59.330> and<00:01:00.140> up<00:01:00.920> and

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
to up in this little area and up and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.210 
to up in this little area and up and
around<00:01:01.580> up<00:01:01.790> till<00:01:02.030> was<00:01:02.270> in<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.540> little<00:01:02.900> point

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.640 

this<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.280> basically<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.240> route<00:01:08.510> he<00:01:09.290> usually

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
this is basically the route he usually

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.410 
this is basically the route he usually
spawns<00:01:10.130> around<00:01:10.520> actually<00:01:10.970> about<00:01:11.360> right<00:01:11.570> here

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
spawns around actually about right here

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.740 
spawns around actually about right here
it's<00:01:14.420> most<00:01:14.690> common<00:01:15.050> point<00:01:15.430> respond<00:01:19.330> but<00:01:20.330> he

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
it's most common point respond but he

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.980 
it's most common point respond but he
walks<00:01:21.080> all<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.410> way<00:01:21.770> up<00:01:21.950> here<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:25.610> apparently

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
walks all the way up here and apparently

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.130 
walks all the way up here and apparently
spawns<00:01:26.990> up<00:01:27.229> here<00:01:27.530> too<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:29.420> this<00:01:29.570> is<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.960> route

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
spawns up here too so this is the route

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.060 
spawns up here too so this is the route
that<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.500> just<00:01:30.680> take

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.970 

I've<00:01:34.580> tracked<00:01:35.480> beasts<00:01:36.110> on

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.990 

and<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.270> can't<00:01:40.450> aim<00:01:40.600> them<00:01:40.810> at<00:01:40.900> 81<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.580> while

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
and you can't aim them at 81 is a while

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.620 
and you can't aim them at 81 is a while
reading<00:01:43.330> one<00:01:43.420> team

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
reading one team

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.290 
reading one team
um

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
um

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.030 
um
I<00:01:47.850> would<00:01:48.850> not<00:01:48.970> recommend<00:01:49.120> him<00:01:49.830> anyone<00:01:50.830> getting

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
I would not recommend him anyone getting

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.890 
I would not recommend him anyone getting
81<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:53.920> little<00:01:54.190> 81<00:01:54.910> see<00:01:55.240> also<00:01:55.510> spawned

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
81 I was that little 81 see also spawned

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.860 
81 I was that little 81 see also spawned
here<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.660> tamed<00:01:58.900> him<00:01:59.160> but<00:02:00.160> that<00:02:00.510> was<00:02:01.510> very

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
here and I tamed him but that was very

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.820 
here and I tamed him but that was very
lucky<00:02:02.110> very<00:02:03.060> very<00:02:04.060> lucky<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.530> two

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
lucky very very lucky going to two

lucky very very lucky going to two
healers<00:02:07.080> home<00:02:08.250> person<00:02:09.250> left<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.940> second<00:02:10.360> one

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
healers home person left the second one

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.500 
healers home person left the second one
seed<00:02:10.660> with<00:02:10.840> me<00:02:12.120> from

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
seed with me from

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.660 
seed with me from
so<00:02:15.140> yeah<00:02:15.560> that's<00:02:16.280> what<00:02:16.489> he<00:02:18.189> finally<00:02:19.189> I<00:02:19.220> got<00:02:19.459> him

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
so yeah that's what he finally I got him

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.020 
so yeah that's what he finally I got him
but<00:02:19.970> they<00:02:20.299> pull<00:02:20.510> out<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.720> threat<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:22.030> 10,000

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
but they pull out of threat it's 10,000

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.460 
but they pull out of threat it's 10,000
damage<00:02:23.420> per<00:02:23.870> second<00:02:24.200> which<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.890> lot<00:02:26.470> and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
damage per second which is a lot and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.330 
damage per second which is a lot and
then<00:02:27.709> take<00:02:27.739> a<00:02:27.920> 9.1<00:02:29.470> second<00:02:30.470> cast<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:31.190> tame<00:02:33.340> so

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
then take a 9.1 second cast to tame so

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.240 
then take a 9.1 second cast to tame so
if<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.480> get<00:02:35.659> him<00:02:35.810> he's<00:02:36.110> usually<00:02:36.620> put<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.010> link

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
if you get him he's usually put a link

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.130
