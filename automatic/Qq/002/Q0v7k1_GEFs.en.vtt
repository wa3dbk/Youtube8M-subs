now the reason why I can get like right

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.039 
now the reason why I can get like right
here<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> work<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.659> they

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
here and make it work is because they

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.390 
here and make it work is because they
can't<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.280> they

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
can't see you because of this so they

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.740 
can't see you because of this so they
can't<00:01:20.610> uh<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.180> light<00:01:21.360> themselves<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
can't uh you know light themselves on

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
can't uh you know light themselves on
fire<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> can't<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.220> run<00:01:23.490> all

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
fire so you kind of can't like run all

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.219 
fire so you kind of can't like run all
the<00:01:23.700> way<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> hopper<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.080> kind

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the way up to the hopper there you kind

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.480

kind of have to do this if you're
building<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.549> ground<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:37.000> can<00:02:37.030> you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
building this in the ground you can you

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.910 
building this in the ground you can you
guys<00:02:37.599> can<00:02:37.780> figure<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.110> out<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.230> don't<00:02:38.739> know<00:02:38.799> how

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
guys can figure it out I don't know how

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.500 
guys can figure it out I don't know how
that<00:02:38.950> would<00:02:39.069> exit<00:02:39.400> actually<00:02:40.030> like<00:02:40.180> play<00:02:40.390> out

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
that would exit actually like play out

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.270 
that would exit actually like play out
but<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.750> doesn't<00:02:40.989> matter<00:02:41.109> so<00:02:41.560> basically<00:02:41.829> you

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
but it doesn't matter so basically you

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.770 
but it doesn't matter so basically you
just<00:02:42.340> want<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.640> hoppers<00:02:42.879> to<00:02:43.030> go<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.390> way<00:02:43.599> and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
just want the hoppers to go that way and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.630 
just want the hoppers to go that way and
take<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.650> guy<00:02:44.829> out<00:02:44.859> like<00:02:45.159> that<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:45.579> you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
take that guy out like that and then you

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.460 
take that guy out like that and then you
can<00:02:45.730> put<00:02:45.879> your<00:02:45.970> chest<00:02:46.209> here<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:47.079> that

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
the next thing you want to do is drop

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.449 
the next thing you want to do is drop
down<00:03:16.810> here<00:03:17.200> space<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.709> out<00:03:17.829> one<00:03:18.129> like<00:03:18.310> that

guy<00:03:24.579> right<00:03:24.849> there<00:03:24.910> like<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.290> just

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
guy right there like that and then just

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.280 
guy right there like that and then just
build<00:03:27.519> us<00:03:27.639> out<00:03:27.760> three<00:03:28.419> I<00:03:28.449> think<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.079> is

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
build us out three I think is that is

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.720 
build us out three I think is that is
that<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.530> I'm<00:03:29.680> not<00:03:29.919> totally<00:03:30.129> sure<00:03:30.280> but<00:03:30.430> I'll

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
that it I'm not totally sure but I'll

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.670 
that it I'm not totally sure but I'll
figure<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.060> out<00:03:31.150> doesn't<00:03:31.419> matter<00:03:31.540> now<00:03:32.139> the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
figure it out doesn't matter now the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.839 
figure it out doesn't matter now the
next<00:03:32.709> thing<00:03:32.859> you<00:03:32.980> want<00:03:33.069> to<00:03:33.160> do<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:33.459> throw

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
next thing you want to do is just throw

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.189 
next thing you want to do is just throw
your<00:03:33.970> hopper<00:03:34.239> down<00:03:34.359> right<00:03:34.750> there<00:03:34.900> like<00:03:35.019> that

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
your hopper down right there like that

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.629 
your hopper down right there like that
you<00:03:35.410> want<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.620> take<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:35.919> hopper<00:03:36.280> throw<00:03:36.519> it

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
you want to take this hopper throw it

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.490 
you want to take this hopper throw it
into<00:03:36.879> that<00:03:37.209> hopper<00:03:37.599> just<00:03:37.810> like<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.470> then

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
into that hopper just like so and then

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.990 
into that hopper just like so and then
do<00:03:38.859> that<00:03:39.099> and<00:03:39.310> then<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.549> will<00:03:39.699> make<00:03:39.849> your

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
do that and then that will make your

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.879 
do that and then that will make your
redstone<00:03:40.629> clock<00:03:40.930> then<00:03:41.530> you<00:03:41.620> can<00:03:41.739> put<00:03:41.859> a

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
redstone clock then you can put a

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.800 
redstone clock then you can put a
comparator<00:03:42.370> right<00:03:42.519> there<00:03:42.699> like<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.269> facing<00:03:43.599> it

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
comparator right there like so facing it

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.629 
comparator right there like so facing it
that<00:03:43.959> way<00:03:44.079> so<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.319> two<00:03:44.440> prongs<00:03:44.709> are<00:03:44.980> against

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
that way so the two prongs are against

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.970 
that way so the two prongs are against
the<00:03:46.150> awesome<00:03:46.629> hopper<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:47.049> epicness<00:03:47.349> and<00:03:47.680> then

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
the awesome hopper of epicness and then

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.259 
the awesome hopper of epicness and then
you<00:03:48.099> want<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.310> throw<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.609> they're<00:03:48.819> like<00:03:49.030> so

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
you want to throw that they're like so

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.150 
you want to throw that they're like so
and<00:03:49.510> then<00:03:49.540> just<00:03:50.139> take<00:03:50.620> these<00:03:50.739> redstone

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
and then just take these redstone

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.830 
and then just take these redstone
torches<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:51.760> build<00:03:51.910> on<00:03:52.060> up<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.480> like<00:03:52.599> that

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
torches and build on up just like that

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.569 
torches and build on up just like that

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
make yourself a nice little power towers

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.800 
make yourself a nice little power towers
what<00:03:54.879> i<00:03:54.910> like<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.180> call<00:03:55.209> these<00:03:55.480> things<00:03:55.510> to

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
what i like to call these things to

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.629 
what i like to call these things to
power<00:03:55.959> towers<00:03:56.349> of<00:03:56.379> Awesomeness<00:03:56.859> so<00:03:57.459> just

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
power towers of Awesomeness so just

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.860 
power towers of Awesomeness so just
going<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.849> keep<00:03:57.940> on<00:03:58.120> building<00:03:58.359> them<00:03:58.599> up<00:03:58.659> like

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
going to keep on building them up like

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.020 
going to keep on building them up like
that<00:03:59.049> and<00:03:59.290> then<00:03:59.739> once<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.400> get<00:04:00.519> up<00:04:00.609> here<00:04:00.849> you

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
that and then once you get up here you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.460 
that and then once you get up here you
are<00:04:01.209> good<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.510> go<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.139> next<00:04:02.260> thing<00:04:02.349> that

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
are good to go so the next thing that

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.520 
are good to go so the next thing that
you<00:04:02.620> want<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:02.829> do<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.549> just<00:04:03.639> take<00:04:04.180> this<00:04:04.389> and<00:04:04.629> put

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
you want to do is just take this and put

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.140 
you want to do is just take this and put
some<00:04:05.739> obsidian<00:04:06.069> blocks<00:04:06.459> right<00:04:06.699> there<00:04:06.970> and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
some obsidian blocks right there and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.140 
some obsidian blocks right there and
then<00:04:07.709> put<00:04:08.709> your<00:04:08.739> dispensers<00:04:09.280> like<00:04:09.639> not<00:04:09.909> like

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
then put your dispensers like not like

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.460 
then put your dispensers like not like
that<00:04:10.329> don't<00:04:10.599> do<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.750> I'm<00:04:11.139> going<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.349> break

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
that don't do that I'm going to break

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.869 
that don't do that I'm going to break
this<00:04:11.620> out<00:04:11.769> just<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.340> it's<00:04:12.489> easier<00:04:12.699> to<00:04:12.760> place

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
this out just so it's easier to place

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.610 
this out just so it's easier to place
them<00:04:13.060> there<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.599> go<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:14.139> like<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.319> and

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
them there you go just like that and

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.319 
them there you go just like that and
then<00:04:14.739> put<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:15.310> block<00:04:15.519> back<00:04:15.729> if<00:04:15.909> you<00:04:15.970> guys<00:04:16.090> end

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
then put this block back if you guys end

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.640 
then put this block back if you guys end
up<00:04:16.389> having<00:04:16.449> to<00:04:16.659> break<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.930> out<00:04:16.989> or<00:04:17.289> something

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
up having to break that out or something

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.409 
up having to break that out or something
whatever<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.880> then<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.060> next<00:04:19.180> thing<00:04:19.299> you

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
whatever and then the next thing you

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.479 
whatever and then the next thing you
want<00:04:19.479> to<00:04:19.570> do<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:19.870> seal<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.320> stuff<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.799> like<00:04:21.220> so

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
want to do is seal this stuff in like so

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.740 
want to do is seal this stuff in like so
the<00:04:21.669> reason<00:04:21.789> why<00:04:21.940> we're<00:04:22.120> using<00:04:22.240> obsidian

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
the reason why we're using obsidian

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.360 
the reason why we're using obsidian
obviously<00:04:23.110> it's<00:04:23.349> um

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
obviously it's um

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.590 
obviously it's um
can't<00:04:24.639> blow<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:24.820> up<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.000> stuff<00:04:25.210> like<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.360> so

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
can't blow it up and stuff like that so

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.240 
can't blow it up and stuff like that so
if<00:04:25.660> creepers<00:04:26.380> happen<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.770> blow<00:04:26.949> up<00:04:27.070> in<00:04:27.190> the

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
if creepers happen to blow up in the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.280 
if creepers happen to blow up in the
machine<00:04:27.550> then<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.570> know<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:28.930> minimal

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
machine then you know you have minimal

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.750 
machine then you know you have minimal
damage<00:04:29.470> probably<00:04:29.800> have<00:04:30.010> damaged<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.370> hopper

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
damage probably have damaged the hopper

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.550 
damage probably have damaged the hopper
maybe<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.030> little<00:04:31.150> bit<00:04:31.300> out<00:04:31.449> here<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.960> the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
maybe a little bit out here and the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.300 
maybe a little bit out here and the
dispensers<00:04:32.979> but<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.850> will<00:04:34.090> be<00:04:34.120> good<00:04:34.389> to<00:04:34.449> go<00:04:34.780> now

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
dispensers but it will be good to go now

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.260 
dispensers but it will be good to go now
the<00:04:36.310> next<00:04:36.400> thing<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.639> want<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.820> do<00:04:36.940> is<00:04:37.120> build

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
the next thing you want to do is build

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.879 
the next thing you want to do is build
this<00:04:37.479> back<00:04:37.930> like<00:04:38.229> that<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:38.620> want<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.800> put

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
this back like that so you want to put

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.320 
this back like that so you want to put
four<00:04:39.100> blocks<00:04:39.340> in<00:04:39.490> there<00:04:39.580> like<00:04:39.760> so<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.300> then

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
four blocks in there like so and then

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.939 
four blocks in there like so and then
take<00:04:40.750> these<00:04:40.900> repeaters<00:04:41.260> throw<00:04:41.590> them<00:04:41.740> in<00:04:41.860> there

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
take these repeaters throw them in there

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.830 
take these repeaters throw them in there
like<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.520> then<00:04:42.820> put<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.449> there<00:04:43.660> and

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
like that and then put that in there and

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.000 
like that and then put that in there and
then<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:44.139> adjust<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.560> speed<00:04:44.740> if<00:04:44.919> you

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
then you can adjust the speed if you

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.070 
then you can adjust the speed if you
want<00:04:45.190> here<00:04:45.970> you<00:04:46.090> can't<00:04:46.330> go<00:04:46.510> all<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.810> way<00:04:46.840> like

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
want here you can't go all the way like

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.629 
want here you can't go all the way like
that<00:04:47.290> because<00:04:47.500> if<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.830> do<00:04:47.949> that<00:04:48.100> then<00:04:48.250> it's<00:04:48.430> a

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
that because if you do that then it's a

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.879 
that because if you do that then it's a
little<00:04:48.910> slow<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.050> dispensers<00:04:50.500> actually

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
little slow and the dispensers actually

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.159 
little slow and the dispensers actually
don't<00:04:51.040> click<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:52.240> maximum<00:04:52.419> you<00:04:52.690> can<00:04:52.720> do<00:04:52.930> is

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
don't click so the maximum you can do is

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.810 
don't click so the maximum you can do is
right<00:04:53.410> there<00:04:53.590> now<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.830> guys<00:04:54.040> can<00:04:54.280> change<00:04:54.610> the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
right there now you guys can change the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.580 
right there now you guys can change the
redstone<00:04:55.210> power<00:04:55.479> if<00:04:55.750> you<00:04:55.870> want<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.169> slow<00:04:56.440> it

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
redstone power if you want to slow it

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.110 
redstone power if you want to slow it
down<00:04:56.620> a<00:04:56.800> little<00:04:57.070> bit<00:04:57.250> whatever<00:04:57.610> you<00:04:57.789> guys<00:04:57.910> can

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
down a little bit whatever you guys can

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.629 
down a little bit whatever you guys can
make<00:04:58.270> that<00:04:58.449> alteration<00:04:59.080> as<00:04:59.199> well<00:04:59.350> so<00:05:00.340> like<00:05:00.520> you

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
make that alteration as well so like you

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.490 
make that alteration as well so like you
can<00:05:00.820> you<00:05:01.090> know<00:05:01.180> bus<00:05:01.449> the<00:05:01.630> stuff<00:05:01.840> out<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.350> then

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
can you know bus the stuff out and then

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.050 
can you know bus the stuff out and then
like<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.800> know<00:05:02.919> build<00:05:03.280> it<00:05:03.400> out<00:05:03.520> this<00:05:03.699> way<00:05:03.880> or

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
like you know build it out this way or

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.000 
like you know build it out this way or
something<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:04.660> don't<00:05:05.289> even<00:05:05.350> know<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:05.889> guys

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
something I don't even know but you guys

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.980 
something I don't even know but you guys
can<00:05:06.250> mess<00:05:06.370> with<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:06.639> but<00:05:07.449> this<00:05:07.600> way<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:07.900> will

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
can mess with it but this way it will

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.659 
can mess with it but this way it will
work<00:05:08.050> for<00:05:08.500> now<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:08.979> other<00:05:09.010> thing<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.460> have

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
work for now and the other thing I have

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.590 
work for now and the other thing I have
on<00:05:09.850> here<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.150> just<00:05:10.300> kind<00:05:10.510> of<00:05:10.539> a<00:05:10.630> fail<00:05:10.870> safe

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
on here is just kind of a fail safe

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.969 
on here is just kind of a fail safe
somewhat<00:05:13.600> you<00:05:14.110> just<00:05:14.380> have<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.620> chest<00:05:14.800> up

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
somewhat you just have the chest up

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.260 
somewhat you just have the chest up
there<00:05:15.100> like<00:05:15.220> that<00:05:15.340> with<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.669> hoppers<00:05:15.970> going

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
there like that with to hoppers going

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.480 
there like that with to hoppers going
into<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.960> dispensers<00:05:17.860> like<00:05:18.010> so<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.460> then

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
into the dispensers like so and then

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.980 
into the dispensers like so and then
what<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:18.699> can<00:05:18.850> do<00:05:19.120> is<00:05:19.360> you're<00:05:19.690> going<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.870> have

to<00:05:20.110> take<00:05:20.199> your<00:05:20.380> creeper<00:05:20.650> eggs<00:05:20.800> because<00:05:21.639> these

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
to take your creeper eggs because these

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.580 
to take your creeper eggs because these
are<00:05:22.030> what<00:05:22.270> you<00:05:22.360> can<00:05:22.510> buy<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.870> shop<00:05:23.139> currently

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
we're probably going to add some more in

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.670 
we're probably going to add some more in
the<00:05:25.389> future<00:05:25.539> so<00:05:25.900> don't<00:05:26.229> worry<00:05:26.320> about<00:05:26.410> that

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
guys I know you got a lot of guys wanted

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.839 
guys I know you got a lot of guys wanted
more<00:05:28.630> spawn<00:05:28.990> eggs<00:05:29.200> in<00:05:29.380> spawners<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:30.639> stuff

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
more spawn eggs in spawners and stuff

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.089 
more spawn eggs in spawners and stuff
like<00:05:30.970> that<00:05:31.030> so<00:05:31.180> basically<00:05:32.020> on<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.740> just<00:05:32.919> fill

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
like that so basically on you just fill

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.290 
like that so basically on you just fill
them<00:05:33.160> in<00:05:33.250> there<00:05:33.430> like<00:05:33.580> that<00:05:33.729> and<00:05:33.789> this<00:05:34.030> is<00:05:34.210> the

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
them in there like that and this is the

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.520 
them in there like that and this is the
expensive<00:05:34.720> part<00:05:34.750> cuz<00:05:35.050> these<00:05:35.110> creeper<00:05:35.410> eggs

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
expensive part cuz these creeper eggs

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.860 
expensive part cuz these creeper eggs
aren't<00:05:35.740> really<00:05:36.010> that<00:05:36.160> cheap<00:05:36.220> but<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:37.360> can<00:05:37.539> jam

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
aren't really that cheap but you can jam

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.390 
aren't really that cheap but you can jam
through<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.139> mcmmo<00:05:38.560> levels<00:05:38.950> of<00:05:39.039> it<00:05:39.130> but

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
through the mcmmo levels of it but

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.589 
through the mcmmo levels of it but
anyhow<00:05:39.669> what<00:05:39.910> I'm<00:05:40.000> talking<00:05:40.300> about<00:05:40.419> with<00:05:40.539> the

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
anyhow what I'm talking about with the

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.240 
anyhow what I'm talking about with the
failsafe<00:05:40.780> kind<00:05:41.200> of<00:05:41.260> dealio<00:05:41.500> is<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.919> creepers

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
failsafe kind of dealio is the creepers

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.040 
failsafe kind of dealio is the creepers
won't<00:05:42.460> spawn<00:05:42.729> unless<00:05:43.150> you<00:05:43.360> are<00:05:43.479> standing<00:05:43.720> on

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
won't spawn unless you are standing on

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.190 
won't spawn unless you are standing on
the<00:05:44.680> pressure<00:05:44.919> pad<00:05:45.389> so<00:05:46.389> basically<00:05:46.810> these<00:05:47.139> are

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
the pressure pad so basically these are

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.440 
the pressure pad so basically these are
locked<00:05:47.590> so<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.490> creeper<00:05:48.789> eggs<00:05:48.970> actually

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
locked so the creeper eggs actually

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.650 
locked so the creeper eggs actually
don't<00:05:49.780> fill<00:05:50.080> up<00:05:50.110> in<00:05:50.440> here<00:05:50.849> until<00:05:51.849> the<00:05:52.210> redstone

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
don't fill up in here until the redstone

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.600 
don't fill up in here until the redstone
is<00:05:52.690> actually<00:05:53.289> activated<00:05:53.889> which<00:05:54.220> allows

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
is actually activated which allows

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.370 
is actually activated which allows
everything<00:05:55.479> to<00:05:55.630> feed<00:05:55.900> through<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.139> hoppers

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
everything to feed through the hoppers

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.710 
everything to feed through the hoppers
as<00:05:56.500> you<00:05:56.590> guys<00:05:56.680> can<00:05:56.800> see<00:05:56.860> it's<00:05:57.099> in<00:05:57.190> the<00:05:57.280> chest

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
as you guys can see it's in the chest

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.360 
as you guys can see it's in the chest
normally<00:05:58.720> if<00:05:58.900> we<00:05:59.380> didn't<00:05:59.620> have<00:05:59.650> this<00:06:00.070> right

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
normally if we didn't have this right

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.670 
normally if we didn't have this right
this<00:06:00.760> redstone<00:06:01.060> power<00:06:01.360> here<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:02.169> creeper

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
this redstone power here the creeper

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.620 
this redstone power here the creeper
eggs<00:06:02.830> would<00:06:03.010> go<00:06:03.160> into<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.610> hoppers<00:06:03.970> and<00:06:04.000> into

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
eggs would go into the hoppers and into

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.230 
eggs would go into the hoppers and into
the<00:06:04.960> dispensers<00:06:05.530> but<00:06:05.830> they<00:06:06.190> stay<00:06:06.490> right<00:06:07.000> here

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
the dispensers but they stay right here

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.580 
the dispensers but they stay right here
locked<00:06:07.479> into<00:06:07.750> place<00:06:07.840> which<00:06:08.139> is<00:06:08.260> kind<00:06:08.440> of<00:06:08.500> what

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
locked into place which is kind of what

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.740 
locked into place which is kind of what
you<00:06:08.770> want<00:06:08.949> sometimes<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:10.150> guys<00:06:10.300> can<00:06:10.479> change

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
you want sometimes you guys can change

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.270 
you want sometimes you guys can change

that as well if you want with the
redstone<00:06:12.639> power<00:06:12.849> just<00:06:13.060> need<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.210> invert<00:06:13.570> this

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
redstone power just need to invert this

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.589 
redstone power just need to invert this
power<00:06:14.050> and<00:06:14.289> stuff<00:06:14.500> and<00:06:14.620> work<00:06:14.830> but<00:06:15.699> anyhow<00:06:15.970> so

there<00:06:30.190> this<00:06:30.910> is<00:06:31.090> going<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.330> make<00:06:31.419> the<00:06:31.449> clock<00:06:31.930> so

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
there this is going to make the clock so

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.380 
there this is going to make the clock so
basically<00:06:32.740> on<00:06:33.130> when<00:06:33.340> this<00:06:33.460> block<00:06:33.760> moves<00:06:34.060> into

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
basically on when this block moves into

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.719 
basically on when this block moves into
this<00:06:34.570> hopper<00:06:34.810> the<00:06:35.169> comparator<00:06:36.159> will<00:06:36.430> read

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
this hopper the comparator will read

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:37.679 
this hopper the comparator will read
that<00:06:36.969> there's<00:06:37.150> a<00:06:37.180> block<00:06:37.390> in

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:37.689 
that there's a block in

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.269 
that there's a block in
here<00:06:38.049> which<00:06:38.199> will<00:06:38.319> send<00:06:38.499> the<00:06:38.559> redstone<00:06:39.009> signal

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:39.279 
here which will send the redstone signal

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:41.939 
here which will send the redstone signal
up<00:06:39.719> so<00:06:40.719> basically<00:06:41.049> all<00:06:41.169> you<00:06:41.349> want<00:06:41.469> to<00:06:41.529> do<00:06:41.619> now

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
up so basically all you want to do now

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.619 
up so basically all you want to do now
that<00:06:42.219> we<00:06:42.519> have<00:06:42.549> that<00:06:42.699> completed<00:06:43.239> is<00:06:43.360> stand

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.629 
that we have that completed is stand

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:45.319 
that we have that completed is stand
right<00:06:43.839> here<00:06:43.869> and<00:06:44.169> they<00:06:44.589> will<00:06:44.769> start<00:06:45.009> spawning

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:45.329 
right here and they will start spawning

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:47.729 
right here and they will start spawning
just<00:06:46.329> like<00:06:46.449> that<00:06:46.659> and<00:06:47.229> then<00:06:47.319> you<00:06:47.409> just<00:06:47.589> kind<00:06:47.709> of

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:47.739 
just like that and then you just kind of

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:49.469
