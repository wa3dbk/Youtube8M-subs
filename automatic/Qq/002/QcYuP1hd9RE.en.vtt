 what I bring a contribution for you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.629

 issues with which you will be able to change 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.830
 the design of the fight for example the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.240
 Application icons design 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 in some cases the drawer of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.529
 applications or some widgets by 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 example the task manager or 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.180
 the music widget hits to be able 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.439
 install or use these themes this 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 practically works in any 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.369
 family device and in this case 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.769
 I can only try it on the versions 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.150
 of android ice cream sanwich jay living 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.070
 as well as in android kitkat 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.480
 I do not know if it works in other versions of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.190
 Android this would be a matter of you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 tested but good in itself the requirements 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.850
 to have only 21 that you 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.649
 device is running they talked 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.870
 original of the device as well as the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.879
 original launcher of the jean and that has 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 the option to be able to apply the themes 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.329
 we will be able to apply the themes without 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.859
 No problem is worth mentioning that both 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.719

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.410
 you can see me change the background of 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.209
 screen as well as the design of the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.250
 icons of some applications I will go 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.690
 to the drawer and well then in this case I do not 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.569
 change the drawer design of 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.700
 applications and the design of the 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.550
 widgets I will apply another theme

 as the administrator of tasks and 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.430

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.440
