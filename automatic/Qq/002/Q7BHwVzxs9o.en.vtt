00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
a lot of drainage beyond growing berries

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.910 
a lot of drainage beyond growing berries
I<00:03:06.239> think<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:06.750> important<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.170> focus<00:03:07.350> on<00:03:07.650> fruit

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
I think it's important to focus on fruit
