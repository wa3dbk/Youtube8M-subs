00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 the charles in the area and welcome to one more 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.960
 video only this time we leave 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.230
 of it and I made video because each 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.730
 thanks to comments on the galera fuck in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.789
 no moment in the videos makes sense 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.160
 comments 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:26.039
 I ended up discovering that a company 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.330
 Brazilian and such thinking goes there 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:35.300
 they will get the game planseúde 2 and 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.300
 do then publish in brazil 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:52.969
 to come now will wear or take it is the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:55.530
 die today I'm not a fan of enemy enemies 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.680
 the focus on note 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.680
 and even fucking the ace 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.710
 well I think the gamela érika the name of the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.180
 company that will serve the servers in the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.229
 Brazil Everything Else 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.810
 Sister, Sergio will have something to 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.900
 Do you buy premium and talca study here? 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.090
 in brazil good buy your use is only ticket 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.460
 banking and everything else and more expensive 1 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:34.040
 Cent is the guess a little too late 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.619
 You are seeing baruffi of 4 and neither is 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.140
 new time I see it working 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.159
 very cool because at last the game is old 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:50.619
 fuck the fuck 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:53.869
 Only I do not know if it's very Brazilian. 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.229
 knows as well as Jaú João saying that 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:02.090
 Brazil is in the hospital bringing in itself no 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.310
 it's because type is swap server server 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.459
 gringo with the crowd organized for 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.049
 fuck if you read all the operation 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.910
 first of all not saying that the 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.819
 can not do that can 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.400
 very well but from experience in 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.400
 other games and also for the sae de cara 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.120
 it's hard to happen anymore 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:31.129
 logically when I go I go 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.069
 to play to make a score to play there 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.489
 A time and everything. 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.890
 It's this guy I found a galera who 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.560
 try to play the game at least the way 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.989
 More or less he's got to play. 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.370
 the organization of teamwork all 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.040
 more 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.560
 I can be very well 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.410
 I can not stay playing the hard but difficult 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.410
 face is difficult because I already know a 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.790
 people and 15 reads that we make a mother 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.230
 makes the year more of a dialect of the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:13.190
 All right, you just got it. 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:18.380
 a fan because the most has one thing that I 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.450
 I can say if you have there are 151 and br 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.669
 quite numerous 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.730
 at 44 a br 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:33.760
 right away, our face does not matter 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.750
 that you enter will dominate because 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.410
 organization is going to change everything is 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.150
 simply a handful of people provokes 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.269
 A lot of people might know how to care. 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.579
 enough with the kill and everything else kb 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.459
 It's a guy, I do not care about jail. 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.739
 but I do not have a hair 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.780
 negative or human fucking 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.530
 I always kill a lot more than mon 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.110
 and it is because the tires matter to me if the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.860
 personal type so play these games 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.410
 what really matters matters 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.700
 I do not know where to go and win the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.580
 health you will not gain much 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.580
 not only to die incredibly and 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.980
 also lose because you do not move 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.510
 do not leave the corner and such 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.880
 the galera will win the points to 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.250
 conquer the map all you 're there 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.590
 in that place killing 23 expensive once 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.510
 I do not know, everyone is 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.540
 conquering everything around that one 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.190
 game conquest in the game and killing is one 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.090
 Kill game because we live by 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.120
 Carai but the main goal of the game 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:44.490
 not knowing the biggest chain and everything else is 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.860
 to simply win what I do not 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.940
 I know why the war does not end 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.940
 but you conquer on a continent 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:02.130
 speaking then the band was basically 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.070
 That's what I had to say if I wait. 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.830
 I think a cool thing meets very well in the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.840
 server, just because there's going to be 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.930
 Most at least talk understand the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.500
 of order and such but that the galley that 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.160
 will play like this always from the expensive website eu 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.880
 I'll tell you soon, you have to know. 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.729
 accept or not if you do not accept 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.460
 desmandou just think we could not 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.669
 for this place here the majority with 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.950
 to agree 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.440
 This is it, wanting to be in the 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:45.210
 Everyone wants a corner and 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:48.419
 everything he sings is this is just to 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.630
 guys starting in the game 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.590
 accustom to receiving order because if you 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.590
 not get used efe 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.910
 You will not like the game because the game is 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.780
 good because a lot of people play together and everything 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.090
 more and work as a team and these 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.730
 I stopped by here to make a video walking 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.940
 behind the enemy lines doing 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.790
 for no reason, because the letters 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.520
 I was not allowed to take troponin before 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.800
 I liked it a little more not so much 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:28.310
 because of this could be to conquer 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.310
 things are always really on 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:39.980
 cord well 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.980
 The only thing I most expect is 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:52.770
 organized galley that is killing us 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:58.130
 as long as you make sure you know with 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.130
 organization can not lose was not 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.320
 obviously a cassette and so it's personal 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:13.169
 that's what you liked and 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:15.870
 as always the guy who puts on a good 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.950
 late on a good night and of course a good 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.290
 day 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:23.640
 to this is something you have worked 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:25.350
 this business and the blind side b rs gonna 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.830
 paste or not 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.570
 mark coleman I'm not saying when the 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:36.030
 macumba 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:40.770
 the worm will catch hardly I will 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:42.770
 swapping the server b gringo is very 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.770
 difficult 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.770
 went
