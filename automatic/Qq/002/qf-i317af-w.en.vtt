00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.810
 everything you say can be used in your 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.100
 against is getting worse 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.100
 what kind of number is there 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.820
 you know it so natural feet 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.220
 that are the 123 I have seen the books 0 not 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.700
 appears but good are the integers that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.000
 they are represented with a z that are 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:38.040
 the natural and the negative 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.040
 01 23 then which ones come 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.960
 do not 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 of the types of numbers 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.490
 the rational 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.539
 the natural ones the whole ones 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.460
 the rationals that can be expressed 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:04.710
 as a fraction it is worth two thirds less 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.360
 minus three quarters and this has 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.540
 can have 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.620
 an infinite number 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.620
 of decimals 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.990
 are and the irrational 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.830
 that the rationals have a number 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.810
 Infinity of decimals 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.810
 not periodic 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.790
 and once the number is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.320
 Pisces 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.940
 pi 3,14 15 9 and I have to go to all the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.680
 life writing decimals that you 're not going to 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.820
 end never root of 2 and irrational 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.920
 and already numerous and root of three root 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.370
 four for example you put it as 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.840
 trap because root of 4 is not irrational 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:11.330
 because it gives 2 and 2 is natural 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.569
 you can draw this from the next 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.569
 way 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.599
 the real numbers that make up a 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.270
 set there are two types are the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.060
 rational 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.060
 following two or three 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.439
 do not 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.520
 and something else 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.590
 and then there are the rational ones the 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.670
 rational to fractions two thirds 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:53.480
 less a room inside are the integers 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.080
 they are minus 23 and inside are the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.080
 natural 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.370
 let's be an exercise 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.130
 they're new
