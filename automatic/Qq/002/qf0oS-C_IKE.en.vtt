00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.299
 i am artik 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.910
 I certainly know that with filming it 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.880
 video I tightened a bit since all of you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 you know the end is coming right now 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.470
 quarter of the school year 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.390
 Well, I had some problems with 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.230
 estimates 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:27.349
 Here and I could not find the time to shoot 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.769
 this video well and as you now see i 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.980
 time is 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:39.629
 found and get started as you see on the table 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.570
 I have a machine worth some 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.120
 similar to nissan skyline in general it and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.870
 have nissan skyline 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:54.920
 let's see it from the side as 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.789
 see see the suspension he has 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.649
 relies on before as period he has 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.539
 rear 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.040
 Well, in general, I would like to do 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.140
 all-wheel drive version but so if it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:17.570
 looks leaning on the front 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:22.619
 highway then it looks pretty cooler than 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:28.409
 leaning on all sides of the highway 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:32.509
 Well, here's how you see what's here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:37.530
 sports discs are set discs from 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:40.439
 lego reuters series but i just found them 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.170
 and decided to deliver as they are very 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.320
 even here came the engine 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.689
 eight-cylinder 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.420
 if anyone understands the machines he immediately 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:57.290
 will understand that there is quite a powerful engine 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 it stands here in front even written in 8 here 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.530
 how could I have it painted 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:10.890
 on topic there is a pattern even 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.060
 small here are the lights here are below 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.489
 stand usually 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.420
 and round and on top you can say 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:22.260
 xenon since they glow in 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.150
 dark well how do you know if anyone 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.569
 of course understands left him 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.269
 clearly met these lights 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.069
 well they glow in the dark 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:39.900
 let me show you but you 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:43.800
 charge them from the sun and gradually they 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:49.100
 gain energy so to speak and when you 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.100
 turn off the lights they just light up 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:04.849
 so I see I do not know so here on the side 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.220
 here the sticker is also from the series 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.180
 reuters i just recently dug my own 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.760
 lego here and found 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.359
 outlets decided to put 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.910
 in general, from behind it looks like a lot 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:25.950
 nissan skyline well, since here and 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:32.970
 It is written that this is the skyline and it is issued 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:36.420
 your rear lights here dimensions well 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.180
 in general, as if in some versions of nissan 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.790
 skyline 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.519
 real versions here should be 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:54.329
 four dimensions but i made 2 since u 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:57.750
 me machine model 4 by 12 here 4 by 12 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:01.709
 pins here as here there 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.620
 the trunk here I put the money well 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.430
 gold nugget ingot 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.440
 just here I have a bandit 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:17.789
 You can say here below too 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.669
 there is a red backlight 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.820
 because the dimensions are red by themselves 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:27.710
 but I decided to make a red highlight and and 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:34.919
 front blue it is so pure for beauty 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:39.360
 here as if the hood hood is not here 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:41.940
 you can say well he is well here his 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.500
 this whole hood is occupied by the engine 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:51.740
 Now he will show he's engine 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:05:01.430
 Well, here's the hood with a hole under the engine 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:05:06.620
 so here is pretty 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.539
 pretty model in my opinion here 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.490
 In general, I have such models and very 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:20.219
 many future releases we will cover 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:23.130
 a few more models here in the back here 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:27.469
 such protection is established as it were 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:30.590
 tell people not to fly 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:35.789
 swinging there and so on and so forth 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:45.710
 now we will show you yourself 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:50.539
 minifigure skateboarder minifigure 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.719
 I think she's my fourth series 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.890
 minifigures 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:06:00.180
 well pretty cool i minifigure 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:03.000
 back, too, a clear drawing but this 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.020
 the moment not the orcs of the figures says 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.659
 Well , I boil it armed so 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.659
 a gun homemade so 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.150
 Now we will consider our nissan 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.710
 skyline below 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.930
 from the bottom it's pretty simple I mean 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.900
 was not 1 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.210
 monotonous plate to 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.510
 attach I just delved into the details 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:37.670
 and me it is assembled from the henchmen so 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:45.800
 say the details here are pretty 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:48.200
 beautiful model looks like this 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.020
 only 1 is placed in it 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.270
 minifigure but still how would I 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.790
 the other and I did not count 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:07:02.630
 but generally I like this homemade 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.620
