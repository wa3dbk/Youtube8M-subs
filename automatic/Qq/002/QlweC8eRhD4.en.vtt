00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
guess it's called fluoroscopy which is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.099 
guess it's called fluoroscopy which is
an<00:00:15.299> xray<00:00:15.920> that<00:00:16.920> they<00:00:17.490> take<00:00:17.880> as<00:00:18.180> your<00:00:18.660> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
an xray that they take as your to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.000 
an xray that they take as your to
validate<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.060> fill<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.570> okay<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.410> it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
validate that the fill is okay and it

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.599 
validate that the fill is okay and it
was<00:00:23.100> kind<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.369> cool<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:25.380> process<00:00:25.800> took<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> lot

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
was kind of cool the process took a lot

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.980 
was kind of cool the process took a lot
longer<00:00:26.849> than<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> thought<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.930> my

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
longer than what I thought on my

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.740 
longer than what I thought on my
appointment<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.680> 12<00:00:28.890> 45<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.390> really

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
appointment was at 12 45 and I really

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.330 
appointment was at 12 45 and I really
didn't<00:00:30.960> get<00:00:31.140> taken<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> back<00:00:31.830> until<00:00:32.219> like

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
didn't get taken in the back until like

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.220 
didn't get taken in the back until like
215<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.239> were<00:00:33.300> behind<00:00:33.600> schedule<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
215 so they were behind schedule and I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.850 
215 so they were behind schedule and I

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
mean you stand in front of an x-ray and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.279 
mean you stand in front of an x-ray and
then<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.910> passed<00:00:51.210> me<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> cup<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.840> barium

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
then they passed me a cup of barium

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.069 
then they passed me a cup of barium
solution<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.940> all<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> had<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> take<00:00:54.899> one

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
solution and all I had to do is take one

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
solution and all I had to do is take one
big<00:00:55.260> swig<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> can

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
big swig and that was it so I can

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
big swig and that was it so I can
tolerate<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:57.960> big<00:00:58.140> swig<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> took<00:00:58.680> one

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
tolerate just one big swig so I took one

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920 
tolerate just one big swig so I took one
big<00:00:59.100> swig<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.480> kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> cool

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
big swig and it was really kind of cool

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.260 
big swig and it was really kind of cool
because<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.370> fluid<00:01:02.820> going

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
because then you can see the fluid going

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
because then you can see the fluid going
down<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.840> stomach<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:05.400> through<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
down the stomach and going through and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.980 
down the stomach and going through and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.480 
it was really funny because one of the
nurses<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.409> there<00:01:07.560> said<00:01:07.710> oh<00:01:07.890> wow<00:01:08.159> yeah<00:01:08.430> you
