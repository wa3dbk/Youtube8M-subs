00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.800
 I like soccer 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.510
 but they are addicted to common 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.900
 You have duration of how to manage your 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.900
 team 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.430
 then at the time 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.560
 hello yonkis of communion welcome to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.890
 this channel 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.990
 welcome to community 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.620
 a channel that as its own name 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.320
 indicates then 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.320
 is going to talk about classical music 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.880
 Well, I'm going to try to upload 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.530
 periodically videos about 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:49.660
 communion and new information signings 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.230
 possible you gotten'll also try 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.320
 help them 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.600
 talking about players that a priori 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.559
 They are recommended on players who 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.079
 they can be revelation at low cost os 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.659
 can give very good results you can 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.110
 be with them and then already once 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.430
 start the season 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.430
 I will try before each day 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.070
 possible possible alignments of 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.500
 the teams 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.390
 and although all that I'm going to smoke 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.010
 would like to make comments on the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.010
 comments of each video 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.300
 We could comment on your doubts about 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.110
 termination put on 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.120
 listen to a player swim about you have 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.000
 a debt of 6 million 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.830
 here in selling to whoever does not that kind of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.010
 things that I feel is also a second 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.050
 opinion and that I think they can always 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.870
 can they help 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.640
 but what do you say 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.330
 but what does the community say a citizen 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.330
 of community 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.689
 answering these two questions a day 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.120
 because certain operations that do not 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.760
 can wait 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.319
 obviously we will correspond writing 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.680
 I'm not going to make a video for each 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.680
 answer 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.810
 and nothing else basically about this 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.440
 I hope I can help I hope that you 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.380
 like forgive the image and the sound 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.780
 of the student a laptop 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.960
 but well I think with this again 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.620
 ok I do not want to stretch more simply 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:56.530
 6-2 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.909
 alive nothing see you in the next video 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.909
 goodbye small
