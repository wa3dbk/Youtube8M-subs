00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.070
 they ask about brushes the person who 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.789
 I used what brush I can recommend 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.230
 for her to use it for her makeup 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.089
 and so I wanted to talk about this 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.970
 brush because it's good to buckle up 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.070
 as one more time of I try them and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.260
 know how to wash them and all that know if they are 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.810
 good quality and if they are worth the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.510
 sorry, I recommend it to you 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.220
 as I told you this prose and I have 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.850
 basically like a month and a half that 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.190
 I bought through amazon.com so he 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 is leaving the direct links of these 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.720
 brush down the one that is interested in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.049
 know then they bring the links below to 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.369
 that they happen and they are super economic right now 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.450
 the price does not come to me I think 11 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.280
 dollars but 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.380
 if he is not the prisoner he is leaving 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.090
 company here on the screen because I do not 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 comes to mind and really the price 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.130
 original but the one that is pretty 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.409
 accessible the price and good girls like 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.140
 I would tell you are you from brushes is 20 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.259
 brushes there are 5 brushes for the face that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.479
 are these 5 that you can be explaining 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.979
 a little like I use myself this 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.869
 buckles I use it for what is the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.079
 bach makeup base'm super 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.390
 super enamored is a brush then a 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.520
 little angular but as a round 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.580
 it's completely flat and the truth is that 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.319
 It fits very well to the face and 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.010
 It distributes very well all the product and 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.410
 the super dryness completely 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.270
 very well applied the truth that I like 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.880
 much this brush to apply what is 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.640
 the base the following is this that is a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.130
 little round powder brooch I do not know how 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.870
 tell this form to develop but the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 it's really pretty good I like it 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.150
 a lot to seal what is the concealer 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.399
 in this area under the eyes and 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.680
 I feel that by using this I feel that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.110
 I am not defined much what is the 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.770
 line expression in this area do not know 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.390
 according to me I think it's the 12 brush in the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.430
 beige the thing is that the brush 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.100
 quite like it is very good and is 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.610
 Pretty soft are bristle brushes 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.760
 synthetic girls and tell you this but the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.010
 truth that I love very very good and the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.110
 Makeup apply it super well 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.960
 next is this brush that I tell you 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.450
 kind to painter's brush something like that because 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.330
 it's quite fat and like that pointy 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.580
 I use it also to apply the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.650
 concealer under the eyes to have 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.690
 this tip, it helps a lot of power 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.840
 get more 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.390
 more to the corner and all that and the truth 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.550
 skin that feels very very soft 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.320
 truth that does not bother nor with that neither 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.570
 click or anything the truth that I like 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.750
 quite this brush the next phrase 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.870
 are this this is a broach because angular 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.120
 and flat that is angular and flat the truth 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.040
 that it could not be used 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.260
 use also to apply the base 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.280
 I have not tried it yet to apply the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.320
 base basically I have not used it this 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.300
 but the truth is that it feels very very 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.550
 well on the skin as I tell them all it 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.830
 they feel super soft on the skin and the 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.400
 next is this other one that is also 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.310
 completely flat 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.769
 and he has not finished using 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.870
 It's a brush I do not know, but the truth is that 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.450

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.670

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.209
 the 5 of the face will now happen with 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.920
 the 5 of which I use for the eyes and the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.010
 I'm really super super delighted 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.989
 with them because they are very very good 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.209
 I'll start with these two that used it 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.609
 the one used now enough to 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.340
 blur to blur what is the 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.190
 makeup and the basin and all the truth 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.930
 that blur super super well that's 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.609
 buenisimas truth is not to say 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.930
 girl but hard they have these 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.540
 brushes is fine of what I am 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.639
 speaking because the truth that to me by 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.920
 at least to me it has come out very very 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:17.150
 good and the truth that they work quite 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.150
 well I have these two that I have used 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.820
 this is angular with a witch 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.860
 angular is a little flat too and what 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.710
 used to apply basically as 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.110
 which is vanilla shade in all the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.990
 eyelid and the truth that feels 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.240
 very soft and pretty as fishing and 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.160
 I really love that, it's also a 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.160
 I have not used a flat brochet 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.200
 but I do not know is that they are very, very 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.900
 good the truth the truth that I am 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.520
 enchanted with these brushes this is the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.830
 I like the most for 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.810

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.840
 makeup under the lower eyelid 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.450
 sorry and this is like a boli type the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.670
 truth that works very well to the part 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.370
 of which you apply the product will be 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.370
 also with this same can blur and 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.440
 it's quite soft, it's a bit firm 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.270
 a bit hard but the truth is that 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.790
 bothers for nothing the truth that to me 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.310
 the girls love this brush too 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.160
 they can get it in other shades other 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.620
 colors is black the truth that the 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.270
 mango feels quite not very very 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.139
 heavy but it will grow quite 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.180
 hilito is not very heavy 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.199
 You can also get it in color 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.490
