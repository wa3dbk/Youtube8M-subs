and one and two and three and one and
three<00:06:14.310> and<00:06:15.389> then<00:06:16.389> all<00:06:16.659> you<00:06:16.840> would<00:06:16.930> do<00:06:17.110> is

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
three and then all you would do is

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.709 
three and then all you would do is
repeat<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:17.979> so<00:06:18.789> once<00:06:18.969> you<00:06:19.120> used<00:06:19.360> to<00:06:19.479> playing

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
repeat that so once you used to playing

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:21.300 
repeat that so once you used to playing
this<00:06:19.900> at<00:06:20.110> a<00:06:20.139> slower<00:06:20.469> speed<00:06:20.590> then<00:06:21.039> you<00:06:21.159> can

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
this at a slower speed then you can

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.720 
this at a slower speed then you can
start<00:06:21.550> increasing<00:06:21.940> with<00:06:22.419> speed

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.100 

until<00:06:26.730> you<00:06:26.850> comfortable<00:06:27.360> with<00:06:27.480> it<00:06:27.630> so<00:06:27.810> that's

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
until you comfortable with it so that's

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.560 
until you comfortable with it so that's
how<00:06:28.290> you<00:06:28.440> play<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:28.770> instrumental<00:06:29.700> so<00:06:30.389> that's

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
how you play the instrumental so that's

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.870 
how you play the instrumental so that's
the<00:06:30.720> end<00:06:30.810> of<00:06:30.840> my<00:06:30.990> tutorial<00:06:31.230> I<00:06:31.919> really<00:06:32.580> hope<00:06:32.760> you

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
the end of my tutorial I really hope you
