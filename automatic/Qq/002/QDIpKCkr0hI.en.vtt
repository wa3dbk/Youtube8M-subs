00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 how to check water quality and clean 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.440
 water at home 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.389
 to determine the presence of harmful 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.429
 organic drinking water 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.660
 use manganic acid solution 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.690
 potassium 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.050
 to prepare the solution is necessary in one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.029
 liter of water put 0.3 0.4 grams 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.939
 potassium permanganate to check 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.000
 water you need to take water of about 100 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.489
 milliliters pour glass jar with 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 narrow neck 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.100
 add one or two sulfuric acid 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 millimeter is about 1 teaspoon 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.289
 and then pour in 5 milliliters of solution 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.780
 potassium permanganate water must be heated 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.719
 if the water becomes discolored it means 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.270
 it has organic matter than 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.059
 the more discolored the more 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.820
 substances in water from 1 to which 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.850
 changed harmful organic impurities 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.769
 no or very little 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.010
 can determine the presence of harmful substances 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.560
 water in a simpler way to clean 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.930
 white glass bottle to pour 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.479
 water and dissolve a teaspoon 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.570
 sugar sand bottle should be good 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.810
 close and place over two days in 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.000
 warm place if the water becomes turbid or 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.670
 will contain flakes then it has 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.850
 harmful substances if water remains 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.159
 transparent means she is clean to 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.400
 clean the water from dissolved in it 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 substances you need a low pot with 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.710
 wide neck 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.380
 pour on 2 3 water and put in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.950
 freezer for the lining of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.340
 plywood or in the winter outside keep up 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.250
 freezing half the water the liquid part 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.549
 it is necessary to pour the ice and defrost 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.350
 use to drink whether you want to eat 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.259
 remove molecules from water 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.159
 radioactive water re-place 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.369
 water in the freezer or on the street in winter 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.100
 wait until a thin film of ice appears 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.800
 separate the ice from the water and discard the water 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.819
 use for cooking 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.680
 freezing does not completely clear the water from 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.239
 microorganisms therefore to destroy 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.140
 microorganisms 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.140
 water must be boiled before or after 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.140
 frost
