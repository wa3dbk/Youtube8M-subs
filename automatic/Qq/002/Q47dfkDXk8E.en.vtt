00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
very difficult to see and as I said

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.830 
very difficult to see and as I said
people<00:05:26.440> never<00:05:26.740> forget<00:05:27.040> seeing<00:05:27.610> them<00:05:27.850> and<00:05:28.090> once

people never forget seeing them and once

people never forget seeing them and once
they<00:05:29.050> see<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.350> once<00:05:29.710> they<00:05:29.890> make<00:05:30.130> that

they see it once they make that

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.520 
they see it once they make that

connection they never forget it they

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.680 
connection they never forget it they
want<00:05:32.740> to<00:05:32.860> protect<00:05:33.250> these<00:05:33.370> animals<00:05:33.880> as<00:05:34.090> best

want to protect these animals as best
they<00:05:34.870> can<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.560> then<00:05:36.250> we<00:05:36.400> also<00:05:36.670> have<00:05:37.150> been

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
they can and then we also have been

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.110 
they can and then we also have been
examining<00:05:38.050> gene<00:05:38.500> flow<00:05:38.710> across<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.610> landscape

examining gene flow across the landscape

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.150

again<00:05:40.750> that's<00:05:41.020> one<00:05:41.200> of<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.410> major<00:05:41.590> concerns

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
again that's one of the major concerns

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.730 
again that's one of the major concerns
for<00:05:42.430> these<00:05:42.700> wild<00:05:43.120> feel<00:05:43.390> it's<00:05:43.600> not<00:05:44.200> only<00:05:44.500> here

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
for these wild feel it's not only here

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.160 
for these wild feel it's not only here
in<00:05:44.770> Tucson<00:05:45.220> but<00:05:45.400> around<00:05:45.640> the<00:05:45.820> world<00:05:45.850> is<00:05:46.450> do<00:05:47.050> we

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
in Tucson but around the world is do we

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.990 
in Tucson but around the world is do we
have<00:05:47.200> gene<00:05:47.560> flow<00:05:47.740> across<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:48.160> landscape<00:05:48.490> so

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
have gene flow across the landscape so

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.590 
have gene flow across the landscape so
we<00:05:49.210> used<00:05:49.540> genetic<00:05:50.320> techniques<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:52.150> look<00:05:52.390> at
