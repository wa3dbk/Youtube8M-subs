00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.059
 hello very good morning welcome the 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.889
 Tuesday for one more time today we have with 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.380
 us the unboxing of the past 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.420
 headphones that do not exist to presented 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.029
 it's about the n system wireless 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.160
 bluetooth 8 with louis kahn selling with 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.989
 noise cancellation and let's see what 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.939
 this unboxing holds as always 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.040
 first of all because they appreciate there 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.829
 the trust you've put in the blog and 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.000
 lending me the equipment for analysis 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.210
 let's go directly as always 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.140
 we started with the packaging I'm going to open 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.940
 to go faster is the package as 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.160
 I always say, well, I do not know who I'm with 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.320
 I will find exactly since I do not 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.300
 the open as you see is perfectly 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.460
 sealed the pardon I'm gone a little 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.440
 from hands the ampa kings the unboxing 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.410
 too fast, let's start with the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.000
 packaging as always as you see in the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.000
 frontal because we have the general image 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.520
 of the headphones very good looking 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.170
 the truth yes seen from outside and some 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.149
 of its main characteristics not 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.950
 Well, we have what the cancellation said 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.470
 of very interesting noise and 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.540
 compatibility with nfc I do not think that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.610
 there are many teams still available 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.960
 of nfc by default no 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.120
 low we have then that is compatible 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.940
 let's get a little closer so that 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.600
 you see then with all kinds of computers 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.180
 tablets laptops iphone windows 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.550
 phone up which god android forgiveness 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.830
 blackberry with all not the truth that 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.860
 very very well that is compatible with 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.600
 everyone and let's see what brings us not here 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.660
 puts the content as they are the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.370
 headphones itself a cable usb cable 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.720
 audio I guess three and a half a 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.300
 carrying case and a manual 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.970
 of user we do not lose a small code 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.920
 bidi as always 36 months warranty 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.660
 say three years let's see what else 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.550
 We have an image here in the hotel 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.520
 also general elsewhere because the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.229
 logo of having exists in the heart and 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.240
 let's look back to what information 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.090
 it comes not to leave you a little 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.190
 so you can see and as I say here 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.840
 we have not because it explains us quickly 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.390
 what is the noise cancellation is 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.900
 that the ambient noise does not interfere 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.550
 not in the quality of the sound that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.010
 we are receiving not from the music that 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.510
 we are listening and some of your 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.920
 characteristics as it said the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.010
 Noise Cancellation 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.120
 nfc with the mobiles the bluetooth in this 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.640
 case os 4.0 has an audio cable of 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.930
 lightning of three and a half jack 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.220
 we have here a control issue 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.950
 extended calls we can also 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.040
 use it as hands-free we could 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.120
 say and you can fold this very 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.330
 interesting especially for the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.280
 transport over here that we have more 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.160
 some more advanced Christ then well 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.380
 little else does not repeat us more or less 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.269
 same characteristics but a little 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.519
 more developed development does not put 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.010
 rechargeable lithium battery but not 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.569
 we know how much of how many 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.600
 milliamperes will try will have to see 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.810
 how long does it last and how does it work? 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.530
 we are already with him with the field here with the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.600
 unboxing sorry 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.100
 that the truth is that I like it I have not 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.680
 opened before inadvertently but it's 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.260
 interesting this way of lifting the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.140
 little box and see here not this like a little 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.319
 as a treasure not nearly there exposed a 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.150
 reminiscent neighbor is not yet 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.340
 advertise but I had ago 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.170
 some time a microsoft mouse the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.480
 that was tactile not in italy steam 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.940
 ningbo is called and I remember that it is one of 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.489
 the most beautiful packaging I've seen and 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.900
 this as good throws some out there 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.580
 not the truth is that this form of 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.890
 arrange the product as it is very 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.000
 elegant we are not going to take it out and to the truth 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.670
 is that we do not have anything else here 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.430
 this is simply a little bit of 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.230
 of plastic of this kind of rubber that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.200
 Well padded for transportation is 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.580
 very well not so we have everything in this 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.100
 small box that comes with a small 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.739
 carabiner for transport very very 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.420
 elegant the truth and here we have 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.500
 the logo we are not going to open to see 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.500
 That we meet 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.790
 and here we have perfectly packed 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.830
 the truth is that this is a joy that 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.700
 give to everything we also have here the 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.070
 headphones that we are going to take out now 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.840
 we have here the typical little book 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.519
 that they bring do not exist not with 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.829
 small instructions over 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.229
 guarantee and I suppose that some 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.180
 sort of catalog not of your products 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.950
 little ones that always always brings 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.620
 we go though more there 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.850
 and here then we have the line of three 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.830
 and a half and this one here and the usb cable 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.280
 usb myth so I guess it's for 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.810
 for the loading of the equipment does not come 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.370
 nothing else in the package but I think it's 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.590
 more than enough the truth is that 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.110
 many many features are 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.270
 wireless and it's fine and we're going to 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.460
 see already the headphones themselves do not like 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.740
 you see they have folded like this the truth 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.990
 is that they occupy quite a bit not for 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.590
 the pileup that is not because they are 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.870
 big boys not the truth is that the 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.030
 fold because it stays pretty fixed and 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.940
 when obviously having it in your head 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.250
 because it supposes to expand enough so that 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.230
 there's going to be a problem that we're doubled 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.420
 or anything in terms of 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.480
 so first hand because the feeling is 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.830
 good materials because they are mothers more 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.390
 or less that you need handles a lot 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.480
 well on all equipment of this type 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.800
 polycarbonate plastic with a 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.440
 Pretty pretty soft finish 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.350
 interesting 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.420
 that is good feeling I'm seeing 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.090
 that the salts themselves can therefore have 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.800
 if you can see a kind of movement 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.870
 so that they adapt better is that 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.820
 very well have here the connection of the 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.000
 jack of three and a half here the subject of 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:50.770
 control volume calls more or 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.870
 least we have here to turn on 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.259
 we have here a small button of zinc that 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.870
 use for bluetooth and we have here 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:01.659
 so the microusb connection here we have 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.039
 the noise canceling theme of the 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.840
 noise cancellation this is fine 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.940
 not because there are times we prefer 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.849
 listen very well our music sorry 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.099
 that you are not seeing anything we prefer 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.530
 listen well to our music not then 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.000
 activate the option to cancel 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.009
 noise and other times because we want no 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.050
 know if something happens around us 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.569
 is usually fine and we can turn it off 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.159
 and listen a little bit to what's outside the 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.849
 true that very well here we have the 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:29.710
 part of the nfc very clear very visual and 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:32.110
 The truth is that the first sidewalks 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.270
 I like them I do not like them they are beautiful 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.250
 the truth also well done have 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.400
 many details that I like not 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.190
 this movement the ones that fold 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.960
 connections how clear are the truth 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.479
 that all very well not very well and the 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.729
 package well this unboxing well 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.159
 you see you do not need more, no, 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.370
 small usb cable the jack of 3 and a half 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:55.540
 a package well worked well fine 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.790
 studied 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.370
 and little else does not need anything else to 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.720
 that a product because it causes this good 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.330
 feeling that is causing me 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.910
 first hand a little more to say of 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.340
 unboxing we'll see how they behave 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.380
 as always about everything else I have 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.210
 eager to see is the theme of the battery not 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.270
 a little gadget so small you say where 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:20.890
 is your battery not where does it charge this 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.960
 how long it takes to see how it is not a little 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.360
 more than saying as I say so that 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.880
 this for this to end this unboxing 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.920
 thank once again to energy sistem in 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.200
 the favor they give me in lending me the 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.790
 terminal for your test and analysis and 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.610
 all of you then keep reading 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.270
 the blog for watching these videos and nothing else 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.270
 until next time
