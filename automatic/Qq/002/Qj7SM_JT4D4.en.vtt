00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.770 

it's<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> second<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.639> two<00:00:11.790> podcasts<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
it's the second of two podcasts on the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.930 
it's the second of two podcasts on the
eye<00:00:13.070> what<00:00:14.070> we're<00:00:14.190> looking<00:00:14.490> at<00:00:14.610> here<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
eye what we're looking at here is a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.599 
eye what we're looking at here is a
simple<00:00:15.330> color<00:00:15.570> blindness<00:00:16.139> test<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.279> you

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
simple color blindness test and so you

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:35.900 
simple color blindness test and so you
can<00:00:17.820> see<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.399> we're<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.790> in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
can see so what we're going to do in

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729 
can see so what we're going to do in
this<00:00:36.030> video<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.510> take<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> look<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.500> how<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
this video is take a look at how the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.860 
this video is take a look at how the
cones<00:00:38.129> actually<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.210> color<00:00:39.510> what

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
cones actually do see color what

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.990 
cones actually do see color what
activates<00:00:40.320> them<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.920> send<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.340> message<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
activates them to send that message to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.209 
activates them to send that message to
your<00:00:42.149> brain<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.719> how<00:00:43.410> does<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.649> brain<00:00:43.950> do

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
your brain and how does your brain do

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:53.720 
your brain and how does your brain do
that<00:00:44.370> interpretation<00:00:51.890> flips<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.190> images

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that interpretation flips to the images

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.540 
that interpretation flips to the images
that<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.350> example<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.010> letter<00:00:56.250> K

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that we see so for example this letter K

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:07.960 
that we see so for example this letter K
actually<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.980> reason<00:01:02.129> being<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.730> because

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.990 

essentially<00:01:08.970> though<00:01:13.520> objects<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.880> bit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
essentially though objects a little bit

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.440 
essentially though objects a little bit
larger<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> seems<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.549> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
larger to so you know it seems and so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:34.609 
larger to so you know it seems and so
that<00:01:22.320> image<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:31.729> that's<00:01:32.729> pretty<00:01:32.880> amazing<00:01:33.619> in

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that image that that's pretty amazing in

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.640 
that image that that's pretty amazing in
fact<00:01:34.680> new<00:01:35.159> forms<00:01:36.140> their<00:01:37.549> vision<00:01:39.439> actually<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
fact new forms their vision actually is

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:54.800 
fact new forms their vision actually is
flipped<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.820> can't<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:52.409> was<00:01:53.570> put<00:01:54.570> some

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
flipped they can't it was put some

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.719 
flipped they can't it was put some
goggles<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.409> glasses<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.340> put<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
goggles or glasses on then they put the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.359 
goggles or glasses on then they put the
image<00:01:57.030> after<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.719> couple<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.140> days<00:01:58.409> their<00:01:58.979> brain

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
image after a couple of days their brain

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.450 
image after a couple of days their brain
actually<00:01:59.549> does<00:01:59.759> adjust<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.259> change<00:02:01.460> so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
actually does adjust to that change so

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.120 
actually does adjust to that change so
your<00:02:03.390> eye<00:02:03.479> does<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> mechanical<00:02:04.860> things

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
your eye does all the mechanical things

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.459 
your eye does all the mechanical things
but<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> brain<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.090> pretty<00:02:06.689> amazing<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.320> does

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
but the brain is pretty amazing it does

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.740 
but the brain is pretty amazing it does
all<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> interpreting<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
all the interpreting of

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.700 
all the interpreting of
images<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:11.660> let's<00:02:11.870> go<00:02:11.990> back<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.530> rosin

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
images then let's go back to the rosin

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:28.930 
images then let's go back to the rosin
cones

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:39.480 

so<00:02:29.480> each<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.780> those<00:02:30.020> clearly<00:02:38.260> really

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
so each of those clearly really

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.910 
so each of those clearly really
well-liked<00:02:40.720> just<00:02:41.720> why<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.989> don't<00:02:42.110> see<00:02:42.260> colors

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
well-liked just why we don't see colors

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.820 
well-liked just why we don't see colors
very<00:02:43.310> clear<00:02:43.700> at<00:02:43.880> night<00:02:44.320> now<00:02:45.320> if<00:02:45.440> we<00:02:45.530> look<00:02:45.650> at

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
very clear at night now if we look at

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.500 
very clear at night now if we look at
this<00:02:46.010> image<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.640> eyeball<00:02:47.000> here's<00:02:47.360> our

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
this image of the eyeball here's our

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.300 
this image of the eyeball here's our
lens<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.260> very<00:02:48.410> much<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.920> straight

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
lens and very much going straight

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.520 
lens and very much going straight
through<00:02:49.340> at<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.300> region<00:02:50.840> called<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.170> fovea

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
through at this region called the fovea

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.640 
through at this region called the fovea
is<00:02:52.010> where<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.520> cones<00:02:53.060> aren't<00:02:53.570> most<00:02:53.870> highly

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
is where the cones aren't most highly

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.240 
is where the cones aren't most highly
concentrated<00:02:55.660> now<00:02:56.660> we<00:02:56.989> don't<00:02:57.170> have<00:02:57.620> nearly<00:02:58.040> as

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
concentrated now we don't have nearly as

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.110 
concentrated now we don't have nearly as
many<00:02:58.550> cones<00:02:58.910> as<00:02:59.180> we<00:02:59.330> do<00:02:59.450> rods<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.400> rods<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:01.970> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
many cones as we do rods so rods on the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.750 
many cones as we do rods so rods on the
other<00:03:02.209> hand<00:03:03.550> here<00:03:04.580> ron's<00:03:05.150> help<00:03:05.510> us<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.930> see

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.699 

rods<00:03:10.760> are<00:03:11.120> highly<00:03:11.510> concentrated<00:03:11.930> everywhere

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
rods are highly concentrated everywhere

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.570 
rods are highly concentrated everywhere
else<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.280> periphery<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.209> retina<00:03:18.580> okay

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
else in the periphery of the retina okay

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.940 
else in the periphery of the retina okay
so<00:03:20.150> rods<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.780> cones<00:03:20.989> are<00:03:21.320> two<00:03:21.590> different

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
so rods and cones are two different

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.440 
so rods and cones are two different
types<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.280> photoreceptors<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.060> there<00:03:23.299> right

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
types of photoreceptors in there right

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.759 
types of photoreceptors in there right
now<00:03:23.920> now<00:03:24.920> let's<00:03:25.160> look<00:03:25.310> at<00:03:25.370> one<00:03:26.030> more<00:03:26.060> step<00:03:26.769> how

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
now now let's look at one more step how

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.860 
now now let's look at one more step how
do<00:03:27.830> these<00:03:28.160> rods<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:28.760> cones<00:03:28.910> actually<00:03:29.450> create

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
do these rods and cones actually create

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.780 
do these rods and cones actually create
electrical<00:03:30.380> impulses<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.160> gets<00:03:31.400> into<00:03:31.730> your

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
electrical impulses that gets into your

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.860 
electrical impulses that gets into your
brain<00:03:32.080> well<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.170> all<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.700> done<00:03:34.700> by<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.330> work<00:03:35.630> of

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
brain well it all is done by the work of

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.860 
brain well it all is done by the work of
rhodopsin<00:03:36.380> rhodopsin<00:03:37.040> or<00:03:37.850> protein<00:03:38.329> that's

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
rhodopsin rhodopsin or protein that's

00:03:38.870 --> 00:04:01.150 
rhodopsin rhodopsin or protein that's
made<00:03:58.690> anyways<00:03:59.720> let's<00:04:00.410> orient<00:04:00.769> yourself<00:04:01.100> to

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
made anyways let's orient yourself to

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.490 
made anyways let's orient yourself to
this<00:04:01.579> picture<00:04:01.940> down<00:04:02.299> here<00:04:02.360> first

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
this picture down here first

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.850 
this picture down here first
see<00:04:04.010> we<00:04:04.160> have<00:04:04.310> rods<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.209> cones<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:06.140> this

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
see we have rods and the cones and this

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.610 
see we have rods and the cones and this
is<00:04:09.459> all<00:04:10.459> of<00:04:10.700> this<00:04:10.850> stuff<00:04:11.150> as<00:04:11.360> well<00:04:11.600> is<00:04:11.930> part<00:04:12.590> of

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
is all of this stuff as well is part of

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.380 
is all of this stuff as well is part of
the<00:04:12.739> rod<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.190> cone<00:04:13.400> shoes<00:04:13.760> there's<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.060> lot<00:04:14.299> of

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
the rod and cone shoes there's a lot of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.740 
the rod and cone shoes there's a lot of
stuff<00:04:14.630> I'm<00:04:14.780> very<00:04:14.989> top<00:04:15.350> that<00:04:15.769> are<00:04:15.950> important<00:04:16.750> so

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
stuff I'm very top that are important so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.220 
stuff I'm very top that are important so
let's<00:04:17.959> zoom<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.349> on<00:04:18.470> just<00:04:18.680> one<00:04:18.799> of<00:04:19.190> those

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
let's zoom in on just one of those

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.700 
let's zoom in on just one of those
myself<00:04:22.010> at<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.940> very<00:04:23.210> top<00:04:23.600> of<00:04:23.630> these<00:04:24.020> disks

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
myself at the very top of these disks

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.370 
myself at the very top of these disks
and<00:04:24.920> that's<00:04:25.130> where<00:04:25.340> workouts<00:04:25.820> in<00:04:26.120> lies<00:04:26.420> so

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
and that's where workouts in lies so

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.680 
and that's where workouts in lies so
when<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.770> light<00:04:28.040> wave<00:04:28.280> strikes<00:04:28.850> here<00:04:29.420> the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
when the light wave strikes here the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.970 
when the light wave strikes here the
right<00:04:29.960> wavelength<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:31.370> activates<00:04:31.970> rhodopsin

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
right wavelength it activates rhodopsin

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.680 
right wavelength it activates rhodopsin
it<00:04:33.980> excites<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.670> so<00:04:34.820> it<00:04:34.940> changes<00:04:35.510> its

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
it excites it so it changes its

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.250 
it excites it so it changes its
conformation<00:04:36.340> slightly<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.580> that

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
conformation slightly and that

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.200 
conformation slightly and that
confirmation<00:04:39.260> change<00:04:39.290> then<00:04:40.280> has<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.610> series<00:04:41.180> of

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
confirmation change then has a series of

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.260 
confirmation change then has a series of
events<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.840> domino<00:04:42.380> effect<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.860> events<00:04:43.490> that

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
events the domino effect of events that

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.750 
events the domino effect of events that
causes<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.230> permeability<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.070> this<00:04:46.310> membrane

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
causes the permeability of this membrane

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.540 
causes the permeability of this membrane
to<00:04:47.120> change<00:04:47.420> so<00:04:47.720> perhaps<00:04:47.960> maybe<00:04:48.380> sodium<00:04:49.130> starts

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
to change so perhaps maybe sodium starts

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.150 
to change so perhaps maybe sodium starts
going<00:04:49.910> in<00:04:50.170> that's<00:04:51.170> happy<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:51.740> might<00:04:51.950> go<00:04:52.130> out

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
going in that's happy you might go out

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.390 
going in that's happy you might go out
calcium<00:04:52.970> at<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.210> synapse<00:04:53.720> may<00:04:54.380> rush<00:04:54.710> in<00:04:55.100> you

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
calcium at the synapse may rush in you

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.050 
calcium at the synapse may rush in you
know<00:04:56.030> what<00:04:56.660> happens<00:04:57.520> create<00:04:58.520> an<00:04:58.610> action

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
know what happens create an action

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.740 
know what happens create an action
potential<00:04:59.950> so<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:00.980> change<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:02.060> shape<00:05:02.480> from

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
potential so that change in shape from

potential so that change in shape from
rhodopsin<00:05:03.410> knew<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.800> light<00:05:04.010> changes<00:05:04.940> the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
rhodopsin knew the light changes the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.140 
rhodopsin knew the light changes the
permeability<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:06.170> the<00:05:06.380> memory<00:05:06.890> which<00:05:07.760> creates

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
permeability in the memory which creates

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.180 
permeability in the memory which creates
our<00:05:08.270> action<00:05:08.690> potential<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.470> can<00:05:09.680> be<00:05:09.800> sent<00:05:10.010> to

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
our action potential and can be sent to

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.090 
our action potential and can be sent to
the<00:05:10.280> right<00:05:10.720> so<00:05:11.720> that's<00:05:11.840> a<00:05:11.990> closer<00:05:12.230> look<00:05:12.620> at<00:05:12.890> how

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
the right so that's a closer look at how

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.210 
the right so that's a closer look at how
our<00:05:13.970> eye<00:05:14.210> actually<00:05:14.960> works<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.590> give<00:05:15.950> those

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
our eye actually works to give those

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.910 
our eye actually works to give those
images<00:05:16.670> to<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.000> occipital<00:05:17.390> lobe<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.710> hope

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
images to the occipital lobe and I hope

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.460 
images to the occipital lobe and I hope
you<00:05:19.070> found<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.370> helpful
