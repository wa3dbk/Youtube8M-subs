00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.740
 6 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 Y 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.350
 down 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.630
 ah 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.640
 I 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:38.500
 I'm Juan Carlos and the president of the bce 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.100
 very well and how do you think that 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.070
 back in the race then in principle 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.650
 Normally except a small 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.060
 incident an incident of a person 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.890
 that has fallen that has had to 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.260
 take the moral otherwise everything with 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.350
 of humanity how many participants has 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.690
 had the race come out 210 200 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.400
 participants between schools and the rest 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.980
 business have been fulfilled 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.380
 expectations of viewers in 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.270
 principle if we only hope that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.210
 when you build the test then 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.240
 go talk more than every year that the 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.580
 we go doing the test because it 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.530
 go commenting on things and this because 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.700
 My friends are running here 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.950
 quite a good high level and to see how 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.739
 the race develops 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.349
 to see how they are going to cheer him up and 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.180
 be there supporting them at all times 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.769
 What is it that has called you the most? 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.470
 pay attention to all this because here 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.209
 What has struck me most has been the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.140
 part of the river that people there 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.580
 my mother banked to the water because no 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.349
 they knew how to control the bike well and 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.480
 are all I say mother of mine in the first 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.890
 place I want to congratulate you for having 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.630
 made this tremendous effort in this 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.599
 circuit that is quite complicated and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.280
 good to ask you a little bit how you have 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.349
 seen you the race with test that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.239
 you live in the first person the truth that 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.239
 I liked it because it has its life 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.860
 none of that I liked very much 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.590
 and that you liked a lot you found 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.340
 that your competitors have offered you 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.340
 resistance 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.609
 there was a particularly complicated stretch 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.579
 in one of the descents where many people 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.079
 has been has had some altercation like 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.760
 have you seen that stretch I've spent with 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.980
 ease do not weigh them easily 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.439
 truth that does not stop with possibility what 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.510
 it was easy for me to keep the race 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.189
 the truth that the first thing that the circuit 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.630
 of bids because it was a circuit 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.700
 very technical 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.590
 very mountain bike style then I have 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.160
 been able to enjoy the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.720
 mail of what has been according to him 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.550
 the stretch most had is something else 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.210
 and there is a technical rise of stone and 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.420
 then the descent that I had yes enough 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:05.790
 to a loose cube but I lost one 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:08.420
 way but as you have seen he had in 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.900
 general career from the organization 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.790
 in short everything all the posts all the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.100
 things in general that I had in the race 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.390
 until the car living well marked to 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.820
 people did not complain that it has 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.820
 lost and abundance and 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.039
 It has been very good provisioning 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.509
 that we carry here is ours and then more 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.509
 up the water organization 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.430
 specific 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.940
 Explain 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:52.910
 that is very very the tremendous second 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.840
 they packed up comparing and so this race 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.840
 as one of the hardest 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.530
 Well, but he told us that you 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.560
 let's see what Christian thinks 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.560
 cristian what do you think is hard is hard 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.100
 risen broken stone and fun in 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.960
 descents 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.020
 I do not rule out that it's the hardest because 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.260
 there are still many races left and we'll see 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.260
 why 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.259
 as you have seen in general a 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.009
 organization as the 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.569
 career that has felt good with everything 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:32.380
 what is the distribution in all 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:34.720
 states very well and good she is going to 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.430
 to ask is to see what has 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.949
 seemed the match package race 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:43.180
 I liked it a lot because it was pretty 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:45.520
 hard but had worked a lot too 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.860
 I managed to do I have not wanted was 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.860
 enough for today and I was fine 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.750
 Y 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.289
 yes 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.660
 LOL
