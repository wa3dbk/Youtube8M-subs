accessories so i expect the keyboard to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.860 
accessories so i expect the keyboard to
work<00:00:39.930> pretty<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> dedicated<00:00:41.870> TV

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
they're raised just well enough so you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.970 
they're raised just well enough so you
can<00:01:00.480> type<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:00.989> feels<00:01:01.410> good<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> type

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
can type on it feels good when you type

very very thin is to give you that an
idea<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:07.799> thin<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.280> I'll<00:01:08.790> definitely<00:01:09.119> have

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
idea how thin it is I'll definitely have

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.899 
idea how thin it is I'll definitely have

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
here's where it's pretty much at its

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
here's where it's pretty much at its
thickest<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.430> where<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.240> pretty

here takes two double A batteries and
that's<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> keyboard

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that's pretty much it for the keyboard

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.820 
that's pretty much it for the keyboard
will<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.320> more<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.619> depth<00:01:22.799> with

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that later on now let's do a quick

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.649 
that later on now let's do a quick
hardware<00:01:25.619> tour<00:01:25.830> around<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.509> the

hardware tour around you see here the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
hardware tour around you see here the
box<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> pretty<00:01:28.049> light<00:01:28.470> don't<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.280> have

sort of a shiny plastic covering and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.710 
sort of a shiny plastic covering and
we'll<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> back<00:01:35.720> this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
we'll take a look here on the back this

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.999 
we'll take a look here on the back this
is<00:01:36.869> pretty<00:01:37.079> much<00:01:37.200> where<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> action<00:01:37.680> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
is pretty much where all the action is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.730 
is pretty much where all the action is
you<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.210> connect<00:01:39.689> button<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you have your connect button for to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.990 
you have your connect button for to
synchronize<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.400> different<00:01:41.700> logitech

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
synchronize on different logitech

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700 
synchronize on different logitech
devices<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> interact<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.409> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
devices that can interact with this so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.819
