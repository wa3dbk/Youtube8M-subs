00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.430
 hello good kids we are here 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.350
 new white video all of you are in 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.509
 a game of dominoes I will not lose 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.040
 the cards for quite some time we 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.570
 there would be one with this rifle always 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.610
 tried to vary a little bit not to not 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.130
 always climb with the same weapons but 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.940
 is one of my favorites and you know that 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.820
 let's see if they take a day 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.570
 see back and you see that if you go with 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.570
 shotgun that was going 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.989
 being up and me 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.630
 we go double there 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.810
 I should have killed him inside the 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.720
 flag is there is there to see if I get 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.070
 up 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.340
 the corner 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.160
 come man, man, vale, vale, I have clouds, vale, 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.210
 Well, this starts pretty well because 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.250
 with what's left of this one 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.940
 and mine and we can leave it enough to 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.940
 see see see 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.649
 no no no no no no 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.270
 in fact, a little girl there is worth 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.490
 takes place all that will recharge 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.620
 I have no ammo left and jump shot 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.340
 come on let's entertain there 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.510
 and so they come out here, it's worth, okay. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.980
 the dogs left regret so I like 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.830
 to see why now they can leave 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.850
 anywhere wharton is 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.910
 this game the rest but in a way 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.390
 that is not normal 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.390
 voucher voucher 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870
 to you 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.830
 here 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.080
 my mother who got involved in a moment 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.510
 there's another one behind the car but I do not 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.540
 It's cool that guy does not like me 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.500
 for the fact that come come come 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 He has a dog 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.500
 good answer 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.930
 I was throwing the streak. 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.930
 another come comes comes 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.410
 It's around here I think it's 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.040
 there nothing nothing is dead seems 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.110
 you do not have yet who you flip but fuck 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.580
 I had already see you all and above me 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.380
 fellow has also taken out the clouds 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.380
 so I was giving him a 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.080
 here where the man dogs this is 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.000
 indra 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.130
 we should not take so many flags 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.140
 but if it will not make the team 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.670
 equally so let's see if 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.050
 we can draw another recipe that has not 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.750
 been nothing bad is has been quite 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.720
 fast 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.760
 they are all here I have 4 that the most 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.430
 important as they start to take the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.440
 Uncle young flag if the team 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.410
 You see how death goes too 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.650
 then 30 seconds is worth no earlier 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.560
 it does not have to 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.610
 chris is my mother with the w in which 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.180
 gave to see is dead 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.090
 and good my youth as they are giving it 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.280
 now here 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.260
 has a turret here so that 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.560
 flag will be complicated that the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.560
 take 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.549
 you have there by cesium yes 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.549
 today we are going 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.430
 mother I do this I feel 135 to 29 28 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.560
 3 if I have the ue sant pere and reserved to 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.720
 see if we can take out now is not to 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.580
 get out of this round throw the sad v 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.230
 see if I can take the flag and kill 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.140
 a new at least two and get something out 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.190
 of fast streak but will end super 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.950
 super fast this as we go 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.270
 I go straight to see going out here 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.310
 because on the left so I do not 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.590
 like nothing when the francs 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.620
 there to all that I do not know how many are in the 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.200
 another team seems to be two only 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.200
 this is there that we are all my mother 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.260
 I blow this and so more points are worth it 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.209
 ok they're going in, it's that 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.880
 is taking this flag also my 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.350
 partner I'm going to help him because that's how 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.910
 I already see it but it is not worth 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.800
 It's worth taking as many flags 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.950
 to take the one who will take 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.889
 OK 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.330
 we go 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:42.139
 say that the site has not burst 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.139
 this box 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.760
 is there behind we are going to have the guard 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.010

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.400
 they shit on me, he had an uncle and on top 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:58.169
 room come to god 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.370
 this is worth so let's go now if it is 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.870
 which is crazy when you have the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.870
 Quartz come out where you want 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.460
 stop 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.380
 ok they are here they know here all of them 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.600
 well - armed one guy 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.449
 voucher voucher 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.870
 is dead 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.650
 my mother is crazy this 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.650
 test 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.699
 for here here 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.270
 let's go another 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.720
 modernity the stocks that has 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.720
 given takes place days and that tells me 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.869
 resistances but they do not take anything 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.900
 OK 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.560
 and I had seen him go out I say is already 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.330
 here and now mess let's have the rat 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.330
 again turbo we just 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:05.070
 we have missed 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.290
 come on come on come on, there's nothing left 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.910
 departure but good at least 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.980
 we take advantage of there good because 49 4 and 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.630
 a rachita and just start has been 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.910
 pretty cool this end also not 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.530
 but that was what my team was taking 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.480
 flags there like crazy 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.490
 I tried to help them to catch the 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.680
 points too but it was they who 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.150
 they took before so I do not expect anything 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.150
 have liked and until next time
