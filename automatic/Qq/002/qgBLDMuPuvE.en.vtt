00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.540 
throw it second the other end of the
rope<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:32.820> tied<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.630> tree<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.399> my

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
rope I've tied off to a tree so that my

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
rope I've tied off to a tree so that my
entire<00:00:35.880> rope<00:00:36.239> doesn't<00:00:36.660> go<00:00:36.750> flying<00:00:37.200> over<00:00:37.469> the

entire rope doesn't go flying over the
limb<00:00:38.510> we<00:00:39.510> found<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.050> looks<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
limb we found what looks to be like a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:52.240 
limb we found what looks to be like a
good<00:00:41.100> limb<00:00:42.590> pretty<00:00:43.590> Heine

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.740 

we<00:00:53.250> got<00:00:53.430> lucky<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> first<00:00:54.300> throw<00:00:56.600> now<00:00:59.750> what

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
we got lucky on the first throw now what

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.920 
we got lucky on the first throw now what
makes<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> PCT<00:01:01.590> method<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.460> ingenious<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
makes the PCT method so ingenious is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500 
makes the PCT method so ingenious is
we're<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> take<00:01:05.309> our<00:01:05.519> carabiner<00:01:06.240> which

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
we're going to take our carabiner which

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.460 
we're going to take our carabiner which
is<00:01:06.660> attached<00:01:07.050> to<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.520> bag<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> rock<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.390> it

is attached to the bag with a rock in it

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.680 
is attached to the bag with a rock in it
we're<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> snap<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.670> Rope<00:01:11.970> through<00:01:12.300> the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
we're going to snap the Rope through the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.900 
we're going to snap the Rope through the
carabiner<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.160> that<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> slides<00:01:14.910> up<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
carabiner so that it slides up like this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.889 
carabiner so that it slides up like this
now<00:01:17.910> I'm<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.390> untie<00:01:18.600> my<00:01:19.440> anchored<00:01:19.979> in
