is<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.590> one<00:02:43.710> you<00:02:43.830> see<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> back<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.670> this

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
is the one you see in the back and this

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.090 
is the one you see in the back and this
is<00:02:45.150> my<00:02:45.300> three<00:02:45.900> blocks<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.530> kind<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:46.890> had

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
is my three blocks that I kind of had

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.970 
is my three blocks that I kind of had
here<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:48.060> show<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.840> cube<00:02:49.140> Roll<00:02:49.350> logo<00:02:49.740> all

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
here to show the cube Roll logo all

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.699 
here to show the cube Roll logo all
right<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.820> start<00:02:51.180> with<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:52.250> okay<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.520> then

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
right so I start with this okay and then

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.720 
right so I start with this okay and then
this<00:02:55.709> was<00:02:55.950> next<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:58.610> then<00:02:59.610> these

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
this was next to it and then these

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.240 
this was next to it and then these
blocks<00:03:00.090> went<00:03:00.420> up<00:03:00.570> here<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.040> could<00:03:02.220> just

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
blocks went up here and I could just

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.550 
blocks went up here and I could just
show<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.700> quick<00:03:03.060> test<00:03:03.420> because<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.320> got<00:03:04.470> to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
show you a quick test because you got to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.229 
show you a quick test because you got to
make<00:03:04.680> sure<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.070> inner<00:03:05.220> holes<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.940> they

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
make sure that the inner holes and they

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.330 
make sure that the inner holes and they
show<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> instructions<00:03:07.350> too<00:03:07.620> that

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
show you in the instructions too that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.150 
show you in the instructions too that
shaded<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.180> grey<00:03:09.690> section<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.950> inner

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
shaded like grey section is the inner

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.430 
shaded like grey section is the inner
part<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.700> need<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> worry<00:03:12.150> about<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
part you need to worry about so that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.130 
part you need to worry about so that
went<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.820> let<00:03:14.970> me<00:03:15.090> put<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.450> marble<00:03:15.810> on

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
went to that now let me put a marble on

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.680 
went to that now let me put a marble on
there<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:17.040> I'll<00:03:17.400> show<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.640> may<00:03:18.300> not<00:03:18.480> go<00:03:18.630> all

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
there and I'll show you may not go all

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.330 
there and I'll show you may not go all
the<00:03:18.720> way<00:03:18.810> because<00:03:18.930> there's<00:03:19.170> not<00:03:19.290> enough<00:03:19.560> speed

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the way because there's not enough speed

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.580 
the way because there's not enough speed
and<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.330> comes<00:03:21.540> out<00:03:21.750> at<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.959> bottom<00:03:22.050> so

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
and then it comes out at the bottom so

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.010 
and then it comes out at the bottom so
that's<00:03:22.770> that<00:03:23.239> now<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.420> gets<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.690> upper

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
that's that now that gets the upper

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.670 
that's that now that gets the upper
section<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:26.070> just<00:03:26.100> gotta<00:03:26.430> have<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.850> build<00:03:27.270> up

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
section you just gotta have to build up

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.920 
section you just gotta have to build up
so<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:29.040> goes<00:03:29.250> out<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.550> little<00:03:29.850> bit<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.360> these

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
so it goes out a little bit so these

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.930 
so it goes out a little bit so these
blocks<00:03:31.260> here<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:32.130> really<00:03:32.370> didn't<00:03:32.760> matter

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
blocks here it really didn't matter

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.390 
blocks here it really didn't matter
which<00:03:33.390> blocks<00:03:33.810> are<00:03:34.050> used<00:03:34.290> actually<00:03:35.190> they<00:03:35.280> go

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
which blocks are used actually they go

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.050 
which blocks are used actually they go
out<00:03:35.519> here<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:38.820> built<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.420> up<00:03:40.970> for<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
out here and I just built it up for the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.949 
out here and I just built it up for the
next<00:03:42.269> level<00:03:42.900> really<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.590> these<00:03:43.709> are<00:03:43.860> all<00:03:44.010> just

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
next level really so these are all just

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.900 
next level really so these are all just
unimportant<00:03:45.959> blocks<00:03:46.200> because<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.610> would<00:03:47.820> be

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
unimportant blocks because this would be

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.390 
unimportant blocks because this would be
the<00:03:48.060> next<00:03:48.330> block<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:48.900> there<00:03:49.799> needs<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.070> be<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
the next block and there needs to be the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.759 
the next block and there needs to be the
next<00:03:50.640> blocks<00:03:51.140> because<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.260> marble<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.620> going

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
next blocks because the marble is going

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.060 
next blocks because the marble is going
to<00:03:52.860> now<00:03:53.430> travel<00:03:54.000> back<00:03:54.180> here<00:03:54.769> I'll<00:03:55.769> show<00:03:56.010> you

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
to now travel back here I'll show you

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.199 
to now travel back here I'll show you
that<00:03:56.280> next<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:57.890> this<00:03:58.890> goes<00:03:59.130> here<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.670> then

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
that next and this goes here and then

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.610 
that next and this goes here and then
your<00:04:00.329> tallest<00:04:00.660> tower<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.560> back<00:04:03.380> is<00:04:04.380> the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
your tallest tower in the back is the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.660 
your tallest tower in the back is the
starting<00:04:04.980> point<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.750> this<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.900> where<00:04:07.110> I

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
starting point so this is where I

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.750 
starting point so this is where I
started<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.200> should<00:04:10.530> work<00:04:10.769> I'll<00:04:11.459> have<00:04:11.489> to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
started so it should work I'll have to

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.560 
started so it should work I'll have to
check<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.000> over<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.540> think<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.500> got<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.570> then

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
check it over I think I got it and then

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.690 
check it over I think I got it and then
I<00:04:15.600> just<00:04:15.690> dropped<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.260> marbles<00:04:16.620> here<00:04:18.229> okay<00:04:19.700> you

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
I just dropped the marbles here okay you

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.009 
I just dropped the marbles here okay you
do<00:04:20.850> have<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.150> spend<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.479> little<00:04:21.570> time<00:04:21.690> I'm<00:04:21.900> going

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
do have to spend a little time I'm going

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.990 
do have to spend a little time I'm going
kind<00:04:22.229> of<00:04:22.290> quick<00:04:22.440> here<00:04:22.770> didn't<00:04:23.550> really<00:04:23.729> line<00:04:23.970> up

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
kind of quick here didn't really line up

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.170 
kind of quick here didn't really line up
everything<00:04:24.479> as<00:04:24.810> best<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.200> should<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:26.910> that's<00:04:27.120> a

[Applause]
okay<00:04:32.760> let<00:04:33.360> me<00:04:33.450> straighten<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.900> up<00:04:33.960> just<00:04:34.139> a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
okay let me straighten it up just a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.810 
okay let me straighten it up just a
little<00:04:34.350> bit<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.980> I'll<00:04:35.250> run<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.490> marbles

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
little bit and I'll run the marbles

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.640 
little bit and I'll run the marbles
through<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.030> few<00:04:36.240> more<00:04:36.360> times<00:04:36.630> for<00:04:36.750> you<00:04:37.020> okay<00:04:37.500> if

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
everything set up I kind of pushed the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.550 
everything set up I kind of pushed the
blocks<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.600> little<00:04:39.810> tighter<00:04:40.020> together<00:04:40.320> now<00:04:40.500> the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
blocks a little tighter together now the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.710 
blocks a little tighter together now the
one<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.919> did<00:04:41.040> had<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:41.880> couple<00:04:42.180> extra<00:04:42.660> in

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
one that I did had a couple extra in

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.600 
one that I did had a couple extra in
here<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.080> weren't<00:04:43.230> in<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.620> catalog<00:04:44.190> area
