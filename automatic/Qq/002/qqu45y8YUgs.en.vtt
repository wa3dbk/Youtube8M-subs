couple vintage guitars and an electric
mandolin<00:00:51.640> i<00:00:51.879> use<00:00:52.449> that<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.899> boost<00:00:53.109> that<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
mandolin i use that to boost that the

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.540 
mandolin i use that to boost that the
direct<00:00:55.359> drive<00:00:55.600> i<00:00:55.929> use<00:00:56.710> for<00:00:56.890> overdrive<00:00:57.339> tones

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
direct drive i use for overdrive tones

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.770 
direct drive i use for overdrive tones
let<00:00:57.729> me<00:00:57.819> give<00:00:57.940> you<00:00:57.999> the<00:00:58.089> clean<00:00:58.300> signal<00:00:58.510> real

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
let me give you the clean signal real

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.540 
let me give you the clean signal real
quick<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.079> then<00:00:59.140> I'll<00:00:59.350> activate<00:00:59.589> the<00:01:00.129> direct

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
quick and then I'll activate the direct

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:19.010 
quick and then I'll activate the direct
drive

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.120 

so<00:01:20.020> that's<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.320> tone<00:01:20.470> on<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.740> it's<00:01:20.920> pretty

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
so that's the tone on that it's pretty

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.770 
so that's the tone on that it's pretty
versatile<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.640> can<00:01:21.670> touch<00:01:22.060> distortion<00:01:22.630> with

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
versatile you can touch distortion with

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.000 
versatile you can touch distortion with
this<00:01:22.930> but<00:01:23.200> it's<00:01:23.350> it's<00:01:23.620> a<00:01:23.740> really<00:01:23.950> good

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
this but it's it's a really good

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.170 
this but it's it's a really good
overdrive<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:26.590> i<00:01:26.860> use<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.310> ibanez<00:01:27.729> jet

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
overdrive then i use the ibanez jet

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:42.830 
overdrive then i use the ibanez jet
driver<00:01:28.420> for<00:01:28.660> my<00:01:28.780> distortion

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.760 

oh<00:01:44.299> if<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.479> ever<00:01:45.600> want<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.049> into<00:01:46.200> leads<00:01:46.500> i'll

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
oh if I ever want to go into leads i'll

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:59.620 
oh if I ever want to go into leads i'll
use<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> combination<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.090> two<00:01:48.149> pedals

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.319 

and<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.560> puts<00:02:01.770> my<00:02:01.979> lead<00:02:02.250> tone<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:03.090> little

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and that just puts my lead tone a little

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.059 
and that just puts my lead tone a little
bit<00:02:03.750> more<00:02:03.869> upfront<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.319> i'm<00:02:04.469> running<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
bit more upfront when i'm running the

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.419 
bit more upfront when i'm running the
direct<00:02:05.340> drive<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:07.069> then<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> multi

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
direct drive with it then the multi

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.609 
direct drive with it then the multi
chorus<00:02:08.789> i<00:02:08.940> use<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> very<00:02:09.450> little<00:02:10.200> bit<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.410> course

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
chorus i use a very little bit of course

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.550 
chorus i use a very little bit of course
for<00:02:10.890> my<00:02:11.400> cleans<00:02:11.750> just<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.840> give<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.049> a<00:02:13.290> more

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
for my cleans just to give it a more

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.559 
for my cleans just to give it a more
shimmery<00:02:14.519> crisp<00:02:14.849> sound<00:02:15.209> but<00:02:16.519> i'll<00:02:17.519> play<00:02:17.819> both

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
shimmery crisp sound but i'll play both

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:32.940 
shimmery crisp sound but i'll play both
the<00:02:18.810> dry<00:02:19.019> in<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> woods

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.010 

so<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.610> pedal<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.090> get<00:02:35.210> really<00:02:35.540> luscious

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
so this pedal can get really luscious

so this pedal can get really luscious
and<00:02:36.170> really<00:02:36.440> heavy<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.150> just<00:02:38.570> a

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
slight a slight course on my cleans then

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.280

turn it down to like half time or a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.430 
turn it down to like half time or a
quarter<00:03:04.340> time<00:03:04.959> has<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:06.020> bunch<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.320> different

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
quarter time has a bunch of different

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.360 
quarter time has a bunch of different
options<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.570> 24<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.600> believe<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.370> different

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
options of 24 I believe of different

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.880 
options of 24 I believe of different
waveforms<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:11.270> so<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.870> pet<00:03:12.290> hos<00:03:12.500> really

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
waveforms and so this pet hos really

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.150 
waveforms and so this pet hos really
complex<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.870> there's<00:03:15.440> some<00:03:15.560> good<00:03:15.680> demos<00:03:15.980> out

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
complex so there's some good demos out

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.620 
complex so there's some good demos out
there<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.820> one<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.180> can<00:03:17.330> check<00:03:17.480> out

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
there on this one that you can check out

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.570 
there on this one that you can check out
but<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:18.020> just<00:03:18.500> use<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.770> for<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.950> straight<00:03:19.190> tremolo

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
but I just use it for a straight tremolo

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.720 
but I just use it for a straight tremolo
I<00:03:19.790> really<00:03:20.390> wanted<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.810> for<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.140> tap<00:03:21.730> option

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
I really wanted it for the tap option

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:35.520 
I really wanted it for the tap option
here's<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.780> time

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.050 

so<00:03:36.530> yeah<00:03:36.710> that's<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.100> tremolo<00:03:37.430> with<00:03:37.880> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
so yeah that's the tremolo with the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.030 
so yeah that's the tremolo with the
other<00:03:38.210> cool<00:03:38.480> thing<00:03:38.510> about<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:39.170> pedal<00:03:39.860> is

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
other cool thing about this pedal is

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.570 
other cool thing about this pedal is
that<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.400> has<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.610> tap<00:03:41.090> out<00:03:41.680> actually<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:43.280> Jack

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
that it has a tap out actually this Jack

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.820 
that it has a tap out actually this Jack
can<00:03:43.760> be<00:03:43.850> either<00:03:44.060> uses<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.660> tap-in<00:03:44.990> or<00:03:45.410> tap<00:03:45.620> out

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
can be either uses it tap-in or tap out

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.970 
can be either uses it tap-in or tap out
I<00:03:46.040> have<00:03:46.490> it<00:03:46.610> set<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:46.820> currently<00:03:47.270> as<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.420> tap<00:03:47.690> out

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
I have it set up currently as a tap out

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.540 
I have it set up currently as a tap out
and<00:03:49.720> what<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:50.750> does<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.920> allows<00:03:52.070> me<00:03:52.430> to

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
and what that does is it allows me to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.820 
and what that does is it allows me to
tap<00:03:52.730> in<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.000> tempo<00:03:53.300> speed<00:03:53.510> here<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.560> comes

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
tap in the tempo speed here this comes

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.320 
tap in the tempo speed here this comes
out<00:03:54.950> then<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.220> split<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.610> signal<00:03:55.940> two<00:03:56.090> ways

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
out then I split the signal two ways

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.380 
out then I split the signal two ways
into<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.870> boss<00:03:57.110> dd7<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.950> my<00:03:58.010> boss<00:03:58.190> DD<00:03:58.520> 20<00:03:58.880> so

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
into a boss dd7 and my boss DD 20 so

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.960 
into a boss dd7 and my boss DD 20 so
when<00:03:59.870> I<00:03:59.900> set<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.440> tempo<00:04:01.040> speed<00:04:01.400> you're<00:04:01.940> going

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
when I set this tempo speed you're going

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.240 
when I set this tempo speed you're going
to<00:04:02.120> be<00:04:02.240> able<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.480> adjust<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> tempo<00:04:03.830> on<00:04:04.040> both

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
to be able to adjust the tempo on both

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.710 
to be able to adjust the tempo on both
of<00:04:04.280> these<00:04:04.520> pedals<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:08.060> that's<00:04:08.210> really<00:04:08.510> cool

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
of these pedals so so that's really cool

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.660 
of these pedals so so that's really cool
about<00:04:08.900> about<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.980> pedal<00:04:10.250> that's<00:04:10.370> one<00:04:10.520> of<00:04:10.580> the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
about about this pedal that's one of the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.830 
about about this pedal that's one of the
things<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:10.940> really<00:04:11.150> like<00:04:11.300> about<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.540> and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
things that I really like about it and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.340 
things that I really like about it and
this<00:04:12.830> setup<00:04:13.100> now<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.850> boss<00:04:14.209> d7<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:14.990> just<00:04:15.200> that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
this setup now the boss d7 is just that

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.800 
this setup now the boss d7 is just that
i<00:04:15.530> have<00:04:15.770> it<00:04:15.890> set<00:04:15.920> for<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.340> standard<00:04:16.810> digital

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
i have it set for a standard digital

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.940 
i have it set for a standard digital
delay<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:21.010> i<00:04:22.010> have<00:04:22.790> it<00:04:22.910> at<00:04:23.060> at<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:24.650> the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
delay and i have it at at the the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.670 
delay and i have it at at the the
repeats<00:04:25.340> are<00:04:25.460> kind<00:04:25.640> of<00:04:25.700> strong<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:29.530> use<00:04:30.530> it

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
repeats are kind of strong but I use it

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.550 
repeats are kind of strong but I use it
for<00:04:30.710> mostly<00:04:31.310> for<00:04:31.490> like<00:04:31.640> my<00:04:31.910> clean<00:04:32.210> delays<00:04:33.880> then

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
for mostly for like my clean delays then

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.040 
for mostly for like my clean delays then
the<00:04:36.560> DD<00:04:37.040> 20<00:04:37.510> you<00:04:38.510> know<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.660> can<00:04:38.840> have<00:04:38.960> your

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
the DD 20 you know you can have your

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.710 
the DD 20 you know you can have your
presets<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.910> also<00:04:40.910> your<00:04:41.090> manual<00:04:41.419> mode<00:04:41.570> in

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
presets and also your manual mode in

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.500 
presets and also your manual mode in
your<00:04:41.810> manual<00:04:41.990> mode<00:04:42.230> I<00:04:42.260> said<00:04:42.620> it<00:04:46.210> with<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.240> mod

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
your manual mode I said it with a mod

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.600 
your manual mode I said it with a mod
delay<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.169> I<00:04:48.919> like<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.250> use<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.400> in

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
delay and I like to use that in

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:06.980 
delay and I like to use that in
conjunction<00:04:49.730> with<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:52.540> wisps<00:04:53.540> is<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.780> d7

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.970 

so<00:05:07.990> yeah<00:05:08.140> you<00:05:08.230> can<00:05:08.350> get<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.470> bunch<00:05:08.650> of<00:05:08.710> cool

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
so yeah you can get a bunch of cool

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.860 
so yeah you can get a bunch of cool
tones<00:05:09.250> with<00:05:09.430> that<00:05:09.610> as<00:05:09.880> well<00:05:10.060> as<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.570> i<00:05:10.720> like

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
tones with that as well as like i like

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:25.020 
tones with that as well as like i like
to<00:05:10.990> use<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.260> with<00:05:11.380> a<00:05:12.000> reverse<00:05:13.000> delay

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.490 

so<00:05:26.030> yeah<00:05:26.210> so<00:05:26.419> that<00:05:26.539> adds<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:29.169> like<00:05:30.169> having<00:05:30.440> a

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
so yeah so that adds I like having a

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.290 
so yeah so that adds I like having a
delayed<00:05:30.770> signal<00:05:31.009> and<00:05:31.250> then<00:05:31.370> affected<00:05:32.120> by<00:05:32.240> this

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
delayed signal and then affected by this

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.210 
delayed signal and then affected by this
whatever<00:05:32.930> specialty<00:05:33.560> delay<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:33.949> I<00:05:34.009> want<00:05:34.160> to

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
whatever specialty delay that I want to

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.330 
whatever specialty delay that I want to
have<00:05:34.310> it<00:05:34.430> with<00:05:34.550> on<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.870> DD<00:05:36.440> 20<00:05:36.710> i<00:05:36.740> also<00:05:36.919> have<00:05:37.220> it

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
have it with on the DD 20 i also have it

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.749 
have it with on the DD 20 i also have it
set<00:05:37.550> up<00:05:37.580> for<00:05:37.729> like<00:05:38.090> an<00:05:38.240> analog<00:05:38.630> delay<00:05:39.669> if<00:05:40.669> i

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
set up for like an analog delay if i

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.300 
set up for like an analog delay if i
want<00:05:40.910> to<00:05:40.940> be<00:05:41.060> do<00:05:41.240> if<00:05:41.509> i<00:05:41.599> want<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:41.810> do<00:05:41.930> like<00:05:42.310> for

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
want to be do if i want to do like for

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:57.909 
want to be do if i want to do like for
my<00:05:43.400> gain<00:05:43.610> and<00:05:44.030> have<00:05:44.180> some<00:05:44.360> delay<00:05:44.539> on<00:05:44.660> that<00:05:56.919> so

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
my gain and have some delay on that so

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.350 
my gain and have some delay on that so
yeah<00:05:58.070> i'm<00:05:58.190> able<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.490> use<00:05:58.610> just<00:05:58.880> that<00:05:59.060> you<00:05:59.240> know

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
yeah i'm able to use just that you know

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.600 
yeah i'm able to use just that you know
different<00:06:00.229> modes<00:06:00.650> on<00:06:00.860> this<00:06:01.039> that<00:06:01.250> that's<00:06:01.460> why

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
different modes on this that that's why

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.089 
different modes on this that that's why
i<00:06:01.639> really<00:06:01.880> like<00:06:02.030> this<00:06:02.150> pedal<00:06:02.960> it<00:06:03.080> has<00:06:03.229> a<00:06:03.259> the

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
i really like this pedal it has a the

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.270 
i really like this pedal it has a the
four<00:06:04.310> different<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:04.789> then<00:06:04.880> really<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.180> fist

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
four different and then really the fist

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.339 
four different and then really the fist
mode<00:06:07.280> with<00:06:07.520> when<00:06:08.180> you<00:06:08.270> use<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.630> manual<00:06:09.080> mode

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
mode with when you use the manual mode

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.320 
mode with when you use the manual mode
so<00:06:09.800> you<00:06:09.830> got<00:06:10.190> your<00:06:10.220> four<00:06:10.550> presets<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:11.120> then

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
so you got your four presets and then

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.120 
so you got your four presets and then
whatever<00:06:11.930> you're<00:06:12.259> actually<00:06:12.410> tuning<00:06:12.860> in<00:06:12.979> here

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
whatever you're actually tuning in here

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.810 
whatever you're actually tuning in here
is<00:06:13.220> going<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:13.370> be<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:13.610> manual<00:06:13.970> mode<00:06:14.120> so<00:06:15.820> so

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
is going to be that manual mode so so

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.200 
is going to be that manual mode so so
yeah<00:06:16.970> so<00:06:17.449> that's<00:06:17.599> essentially<00:06:18.880> my<00:06:19.880> pedalboard

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
yeah so that's essentially my pedalboard

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.779 
yeah so that's essentially my pedalboard
setup<00:06:20.690> like<00:06:21.169> i<00:06:21.259> said<00:06:21.319> a<00:06:22.009> lot<00:06:22.310> of<00:06:22.400> these<00:06:22.490> pedals

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
setup like i said a lot of these pedals

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.700 
setup like i said a lot of these pedals
have<00:06:23.150> way<00:06:23.539> more<00:06:23.569> into<00:06:24.259> them<00:06:24.380> than<00:06:24.470> what<00:06:24.530> i'm

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
have way more into them than what i'm

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.249 
have way more into them than what i'm
actually<00:06:24.889> like<00:06:25.310> detailing<00:06:25.849> but<00:06:26.060> I<00:06:26.750> just<00:06:27.110> kind

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
actually like detailing but I just kind

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.839 
actually like detailing but I just kind
of<00:06:27.320> want<00:06:27.470> to<00:06:27.560> show<00:06:27.680> what<00:06:27.860> i<00:06:27.889> use<00:06:28.099> them<00:06:28.280> for<00:06:28.520> and

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
of want to show what i use them for and

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.450 
of want to show what i use them for and
so<00:06:29.509> hopefully<00:06:30.110> i'll<00:06:30.229> be<00:06:30.259> adding<00:06:30.590> a<00:06:30.949> pog<00:06:31.190> to

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
so hopefully i'll be adding a pog to

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.149 
so hopefully i'll be adding a pog to
pretty<00:06:31.759> soon<00:06:32.229> my<00:06:33.229> main<00:06:33.409> gigging<00:06:33.770> amp<00:06:33.949> is<00:06:34.130> a

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
pretty soon my main gigging amp is a

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.360 
pretty soon my main gigging amp is a
fender<00:06:34.849> for<00:06:35.300> 10<00:06:35.539> de<00:06:35.630> Ville<00:06:35.810> and<00:06:35.990> it<00:06:36.800> has<00:06:36.979> reverb

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
fender for 10 de Ville and it has reverb

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.870 
fender for 10 de Ville and it has reverb
but<00:06:37.580> this<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:39.710> black<00:06:40.009> heart<00:06:40.250> doesn't<00:06:40.460> so<00:06:40.759> i'll

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
but this the black heart doesn't so i'll

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.279 
but this the black heart doesn't so i'll
probably<00:06:41.060> be<00:06:41.240> adding<00:06:41.479> a<00:06:41.570> reverb<00:06:41.900> pedal<00:06:42.080> as

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
probably be adding a reverb pedal as

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:43.899 
probably be adding a reverb pedal as
well<00:06:42.469> for<00:06:42.740> when<00:06:42.860> i'm<00:06:42.979> using<00:06:43.370> the<00:06:43.520> black<00:06:43.699> car

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
well for when i'm using the black car

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:49.000 
well for when i'm using the black car
but<00:06:44.710> that's<00:06:45.710> pretty<00:06:45.919> much<00:06:46.039> the<00:06:46.190> setup<00:06:46.550> thanks
