00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.790
 or the here counterparts 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.490
 and that's what we 're going to see today what I 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.650
 I call screaming bending open days of 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.600
 guitarist who puts faces this guy 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.980
 depends on how much more cause you put of 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 statistical efforts are better going to sound 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
 because people also kinda ends up 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.619
 to win he does not know what you're doing 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.140
 making the influx of him have to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.150
 hurt to cost a lot to do and in addition 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.160
 the really cool sound really what it 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.680
 is doing here is playing very easy 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:19.290
 having these notes in me and then at 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.270
 touch this and raise the I make myself 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.270
 I go from my sharp 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.859
 Y 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.530
 and once found can be given a 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.530
 little vibrato 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.840
 really raise and lower the temperature 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.840
 after doing 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.980
 and if we do it it 's been argued that the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.880
 Accompaniment of a moment that gets 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:10.560
 in the stretch to give equal 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.560
 and even in the sun sustained by doing 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.560
 and with this I mean that you can 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.069
 Log anywhere you want, for example 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.069
 you want to do 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.680
 but good 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.370
 what happens if we want to do it 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.739
 more acute and we have to move to the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.930
 ropes down the fret relationship 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.790
 and fingers will no longer be the same will be a 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.530
 little wider for example if the fa 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.810
 sharp is here or here 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.150
 we have to put here the sharp f 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:50.400
 at 14 and he will be at 10 and 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.400
 race 14 17 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.500
 in this case it would be here could be done 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.500
 or with your finger 34 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.720
 I like more interest in this case 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.720
 because you have to open a lot of time 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.900
 and then to 17 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.480
 16 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.260
 do not 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.260
 all right 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.920
 Y 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.319
 write vending do not forget very 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.580
 important to put face of effort and 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.580
 tourist yes no 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.730
 see you later
