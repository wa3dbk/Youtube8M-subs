00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello everyone we find ourselves for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.929
 the review of the woman for her purposes 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.740
 cybergun version 2012 generation too 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.060
 so the famas is a French weapon 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 so used by the French army by 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.650
 the army in version f1 so he 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.480
 are several declensions of famas so 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.910
 there is the new declination 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.750
 of famas pellin that can be seen here 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.430
 I also paving and 2 which freezes a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.420
 side that I do not know many things 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.879
 on it so I could not really 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 tell you finally to compose here we get 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.219
 found for the review of the farm at its 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.530
 ends so that's the manufacturer's box 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.829
 cybergun so except hamas is equipped 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.180
 a new gearbox finally the best 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.510
 gearbox and a motherboard connector 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.289
 so we can see it here ignore the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.650
 metal gear 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:11.670
 so there is the gun to the metal 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.490
 so there is a tactical handle 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.360
 included but that's not that one 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.360
 so there is a 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 laughs sure franz is adjustable and the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.729
 system backs so the system focused the opow 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 cybergun and a battery and charger 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.130
 therefore includes this replica 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.759
 communicable thematic the replica 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.950
 step 360 is an fps with 0.1g so 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.880
 do not have to see that that's it it's a 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.930
 rule at 0.2 g so to advise it 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.729
 manufactures three-day rate of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.119
 shot and 750 bipar minutes maximum of 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.920
 doors and 60m chargers at and cap of 300 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.850
 shines of one thousand eight hundred and fifty 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.039
 grams the length is 75 5 centimes 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 so is the max system a war 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:12.470
 boots with metal degust so we go 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.550
 switch to replica 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.880
 so when we receive the replica 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.410
 so we had a cybergun manual 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.890
 manual of its mass and infi catalog 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.230
 of accessories from it bergen we see 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.220
 there the famas so and the famas we have a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.010
 battery 8 at sight on board 1100 images 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.650
 I do not use that one game I use 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.100
 a battery of such is that it 4 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.450
 bolt but 600th match 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:50.269
 I find these places more of more than 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.269
 potato so a battery charger 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.490
 so in Aix and that this version of famas 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.990
 a tactical grip that I do not like 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:14.310
 a lot I do not like rendering 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:24.750
 aesthetic and of course the fabre and his 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:34.380
 to remove it without doing any damage and the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:42.230
 stump rod so that's the famas 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:47.160
 so so the famas that famas and equipped 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.390
 daraj and laughed 120 mm to install 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.290
 a handful 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.520
 I believe that install a pony as if 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.520
 so the replica is in abs 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.580
 but to some metal parts like 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:11.700
 his bipod so one hand 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:16.020
 it's not easy so here is the reply 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.660
 and it is lowered the yoke is made of metal 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:23.460
 the gun is metal the charger is in 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.310
 metal and so this is the trigger mans 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.650
 methane is also straps fasteners 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.780
 otherwise everything is plastic what is 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.640
 a little bit, it's not too bad because 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.100
 good the answer is the same true 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:41.700
 women at this is not all the metal so 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:47.090
 so now the aim we can well 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.090
 see where we are very small here 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:58.110
 the system backs are adjusted at the back 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:01.910
 of the replica and rubs we see if the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.910
 system backs so not to the people 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:10.790
 so we set left or right we 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:14.120
 is set here seen seen here 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.120
 try to put it back 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:27.600
 so let's go i'll show you what 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:32.750
 it gives with their tactical faith it 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.750
 repeat me that I do not like much 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:54.410
 and here are these tax beds nor so 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.410
 pull the lukewarm load is dummy 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.330
 here we have the 10 hours for unss potato 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.870
 so the battery is lodged in the gard 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.200
 tomorrow so in fact have to shoot this is going 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.610
 to be like that was pulling the guard tomorrow 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.860
 take being a guy's battery 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.030
 tomorrow their masters and we click on 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.550
 know quite difficult so I'm not going to 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:24.860
 do in the video so the charger 300 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.860
 blow mike ap 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.400
 e 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.610
 and bread I think that's pretty much 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.610
 all 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:43.270
 so this famas will be customized 1 g I 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:45.219
 am going to put a rail of 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.569
 support on the famas and put a 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:53.080
 look at the tex at 150.2 so there I 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:55.330
 ordered the frs bahamas interface rail 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.460
 for Sevilla went from so cybergun 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.839
 these cyber warfare stick to a 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:05.110
 interface so I'm going to put it on 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:09.129
 surely famas to be able to put a 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.449
 tactical lamp or other so when I 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.189
 so I'm going to do a boxing video 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:18.009
 dewatering is received and I will surely 

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:20.169
 a video review of this fps and so is 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:22.990
