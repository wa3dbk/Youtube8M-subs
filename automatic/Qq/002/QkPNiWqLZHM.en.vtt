00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
okay now we've done a glucose test and

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay now we've done a glucose test and
it's<00:00:02.490> time<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.870> administer<00:00:03.870> an<00:00:03.990> insulin<00:00:04.410> shot

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
it's time to administer an insulin shot

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.650 
it's time to administer an insulin shot
so<00:00:04.830> I'm<00:00:04.890> going<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.069> show<00:00:05.160> what<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.460> do<00:00:05.660> right

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
so I'm going to show what we do right

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.740 
so I'm going to show what we do right
over<00:00:06.810> here<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.680> have<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.220> box<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:09.000> insulin<00:00:09.570> this

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
over here we have a box of insulin this

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.530 
over here we have a box of insulin this
happens<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.290> cumulant<00:00:10.920> n<00:00:11.360> comes<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.480> a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
happens to be cumulant n comes in a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.780 
happens to be cumulant n comes in a
glass<00:00:12.690> jar<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.530> little<00:00:14.009> rubber<00:00:14.190> stopper<00:00:14.610> like

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
glass jar a little rubber stopper like

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.840 
glass jar a little rubber stopper like
this<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.289> it's<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.980> suspension<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this and it's it's in a suspension and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.670 
this and it's it's in a suspension and
you're<00:00:17.970> supposed<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.449> mix<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.410> don't<00:00:19.560> want

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
you're supposed to mix it you don't want

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.689 
you're supposed to mix it you don't want
to<00:00:19.740> shake<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.949> because<00:00:20.340> that's<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
to shake it because that's going to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.529 
to shake it because that's going to
destroy<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:22.109> actual<00:00:22.650> product<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> do

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
destroy the actual product so what I do

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.040 
destroy the actual product so what I do
is<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.930> roll<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.769> flip<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.029> roll<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
is I roll it I flip it I roll it I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.250 
is I roll it I flip it I roll it I
gently<00:00:28.619> toss<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.400> around<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
gently toss it around a little like this

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.240 
gently toss it around a little like this
it's<00:00:31.260> sort<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.800> milky<00:00:32.189> watery<00:00:32.790> formula<00:00:33.630> and

it's sort of a milky watery formula and
when<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.370> mixed<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.960> takes<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
when it's mixed up which just takes a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.020 
when it's mixed up which just takes a
little<00:00:37.350> bit<00:00:37.530> you'll<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.250> because<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.790> all

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
little bit you'll know because it's all

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.319 
little bit you'll know because it's all
evenly<00:00:39.510> distributed<00:00:40.640> this<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.030> insulin

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
going to do is pull the plunger back to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.500 
going to do is pull the plunger back to
approximately<00:00:58.609> 5.5<00:00:59.609> because<00:01:00.090> whatever<00:01:00.300> you

take out of there you want to replace

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.010 
take out of there you want to replace
with<00:01:03.300> air<00:01:04.280> pull<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> needle<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> cover

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
with air pull the needle out the cover

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.590 
with air pull the needle out the cover
off<00:01:07.260> let's<00:01:07.740> make<00:01:07.860> sure<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.420> mixed<00:01:09.420> well

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
off let's make sure this is mixed well

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.500 
off let's make sure this is mixed well
the<00:01:10.530> needle<00:01:10.799> goes<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.360> rubber

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the needle goes into the little rubber

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.050 
the needle goes into the little rubber
area<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> center<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
area in the center and you're going to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.340 
area in the center and you're going to
keep<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.979> bottle<00:01:16.979> upside<00:01:17.159> down<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.729> this

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
keep the bottle upside down like this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.570 
keep the bottle upside down like this
push<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> plunger<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.979> that's<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> add

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
push the plunger in that's going to add

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.020 
push the plunger in that's going to add
five<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> half<00:01:21.570> units<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> air<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.100> then

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
five and a half units of air and then

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.550 
five and a half units of air and then
you're<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> pull<00:01:24.540> back<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.470> have

to do this slowly you do not want any

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
to do this slowly you do not want any
bubbles<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:27.869> actually<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
bubbles in here actually there's a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.510 
bubbles in here actually there's a
little<00:01:28.619> bubble<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.250> we're<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
little bubble there so we're going to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.990 
little bubble there so we're going to
start<00:01:29.729> over<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.320> pull<00:01:31.320> back<00:01:31.350> slowly<00:01:32.000> until

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you get to 5.5 remove the needle replace

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.240 
you get to 5.5 remove the needle replace
the<00:01:41.130> cap<00:01:41.810> okay<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.229> no<00:01:43.680> danger

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the cap okay that we no danger

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
the cap okay that we no danger
so<00:01:45.030> there's<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.329> 5.5<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.409> we're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
so there's not 5.5 in here and we're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.850 
so there's not 5.5 in here and we're
ready<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> administer<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.729> shot<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.299> our

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
patient Sheila who's actually very

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.569 
patient Sheila who's actually very
cooperative<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.920> let<00:01:55.920> her<00:01:55.979> smell<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.520> she

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
cooperative I let her smell it so she

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.010 
cooperative I let her smell it so she
