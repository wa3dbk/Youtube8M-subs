we've been doing so far we've managed to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.110 
we've been doing so far we've managed to

next ten to twenty years there are a

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.409 
next ten to twenty years there are a
couple<00:03:22.199> of<00:03:22.379> main<00:03:22.590> trends<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:23.699> we'll<00:03:23.849> see<00:03:24.150> in

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
couple of main trends that we'll see in

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.259 
couple of main trends that we'll see in
the<00:03:24.659> industry<00:03:25.109> one<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.859> for<00:03:26.159> downsizing<00:03:26.879> and

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
the industry one is for downsizing and

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.300 
the industry one is for downsizing and
down<00:03:27.419> speeding<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.049> engines<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.709> improve<00:03:29.159> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
down speeding of engines to improve the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.129 
down speeding of engines to improve the
efficiency<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.879> engines<00:03:30.299> for<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.870> turbo

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
efficiency of engines for the turbo

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.719 
efficiency of engines for the turbo
charges<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.769> means<00:03:31.949> we<00:03:32.159> need<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.459> get<00:03:32.609> the

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
charges that means we need to get the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.550 
charges that means we need to get the
same<00:03:32.940> level<00:03:33.299> of<00:03:33.389> performance<00:03:33.569> out<00:03:34.169> of<00:03:34.349> much

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
same level of performance out of much

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.430 
same level of performance out of much
smaller<00:03:35.030> turbochargers<00:03:36.030> smaller<00:03:36.419> engines<00:03:36.959> so

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
smaller turbochargers smaller engines so

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.979 
smaller turbochargers smaller engines so
it<00:03:37.500> will<00:03:37.650> drive<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.209> extremes<00:03:39.720> of

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
it will drive to the extremes of

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.229 
it will drive to the extremes of
tolerances<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:41.010> will<00:03:41.159> increase<00:03:41.519> temperatures

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
tolerances it will increase temperatures

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.080 
tolerances it will increase temperatures
pressures<00:03:42.629> speeds<00:03:43.349> which<00:03:44.310> means<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.669> need<00:03:44.819> new

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
pressures speeds which means we need new

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.759 
pressures speeds which means we need new
materials<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:45.840> new<00:03:45.930> technologies<00:03:46.739> to

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
materials and new technologies to

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.550 
materials and new technologies to
support<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.810> another<00:03:48.810> trend<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.229> we<00:03:49.409> will

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
support that another trend that we will

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.960 
support that another trend that we will
see<00:03:49.799> is<00:03:50.040> an<00:03:50.159> increasing<00:03:50.729> use<00:03:50.760> of

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
see is an increasing use of

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.830 
see is an increasing use of
hybridization<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.739> industry<00:03:53.840> an

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
hybridization in the industry an

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.589 
hybridization in the industry an
increasing<00:03:55.530> use<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.680> electrification<00:03:56.599> so

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
increasing use of electrification so

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.689 
increasing use of electrification so
there'll<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.930> turbo<00:03:58.739> charges<00:03:59.159> connected<00:03:59.459> to

there'll be turbo charges connected to

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.670 
there'll be turbo charges connected to
