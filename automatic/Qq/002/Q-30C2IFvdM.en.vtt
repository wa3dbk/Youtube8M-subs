this<00:04:12.889> type<00:04:13.190> of<00:04:13.220> epoxy<00:04:13.849> is<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.209> does<00:04:14.359> a

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
this type of epoxy is that it does a

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.210 
this type of epoxy is that it does a
wonderful<00:04:14.690> job<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.169> maintaining<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.980> same

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
wonderful job of maintaining the same

wonderful job of maintaining the same

in fact this brand of epoxy is about 80%

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.200 
in fact this brand of epoxy is about 80%
easier<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.340> juggle<00:04:23.760> than<00:04:23.880> your<00:04:24.000> standard

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
construction like this and epoxy is that

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.110 
construction like this and epoxy is that
it<00:04:28.350> is<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:28.650> light<00:04:28.920> it's<00:04:29.220> able<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.490> float<00:04:29.880> over

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
it is so light it's able to float over

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.330 
it is so light it's able to float over
crumbly<00:04:30.870> sections<00:04:31.320> really<00:04:31.560> easy<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:32.130> also

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
crumbly sections really easy it also

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.710 
crumbly sections really easy it also
deals<00:04:32.670> with<00:04:32.820> white<00:04:33.150> water<00:04:33.390> really<00:04:33.600> well

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
deals with white water really well

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.840 
deals with white water really well
because<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.440> buoyant<00:04:34.890> these<00:04:35.070> XF<00:04:35.520> boards

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
because it's so buoyant these XF boards

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.640 
because it's so buoyant these XF boards
are<00:04:35.970> also<00:04:36.090> pretty<00:04:36.450> easy<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.900> maneuver<00:04:37.350> because

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
are also pretty easy to maneuver because

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.960 
are also pretty easy to maneuver because
they're<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:37.950> light<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.400> can<00:04:38.430> kind<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:38.790> just

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
they're so light you can kind of just

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.220 
they're so light you can kind of just
throw<00:04:39.210> them<00:04:39.390> around<00:04:39.510> under<00:04:39.960> your<00:04:40.080> feet

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
throw them around under your feet

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.690 
throw them around under your feet
however<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.770> choose<00:04:40.800> some<00:04:41.370> would<00:04:41.550> say

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
however you choose some would say

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.400 
however you choose some would say

with chop on the water that well because

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.350 
with chop on the water that well because
when<00:04:47.100> your<00:04:47.220> board<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.550> heavy<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.940> can<00:04:48.120> kind<00:04:48.300> of

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
when your board is heavy you can kind of

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.000 
when your board is heavy you can kind of
plow<00:04:48.600> through<00:04:48.930> imperfections<00:04:49.830> on<00:04:49.980> the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.860 
anyway this is a pretty low soft rail

buoyant boxy rail and soft meaning this

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.210 
buoyant boxy rail and soft meaning this

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
sense of that imagine pouring water out

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.370 
sense of that imagine pouring water out
of<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.940> glass<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.420> this<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:09.930> just<00:05:09.960> shears

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
of a glass like this and it just shears

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.230 
of a glass like this and it just shears
out<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.830> pours<00:05:11.100> nicely<00:05:11.610> then<00:05:11.850> imagine

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
out and pours nicely then imagine

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.730 
out and pours nicely then imagine
pouring<00:05:12.510> water<00:05:12.660> out<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:13.020> coffee<00:05:13.260> mug<00:05:13.440> or

something with a wider more rounded edge

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.060 
something with a wider more rounded edge
right<00:05:15.810> here<00:05:16.140> and<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.350> doesn't<00:05:16.500> really<00:05:16.710> pour

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
right here and it doesn't really pour

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.650 
right here and it doesn't really pour
instead<00:05:17.610> it<00:05:17.730> just<00:05:17.760> sort<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.120> grips<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.570> the

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
instead it just sort of grips to the

instead it just sort of grips to the
edge<00:05:18.780> of<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.050> drizzles<00:05:19.590> down<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.860> side<00:05:20.040> of

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
the cup and makes a mess that really

the cup and makes a mess that really
