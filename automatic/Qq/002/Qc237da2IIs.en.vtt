00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.050 
bracing you get my 45s on the corners
here<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> way<00:01:01.920> around<00:01:03.379> rounded<00:01:04.379> off

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
here all the way around rounded off

here all the way around rounded off
actually<00:01:06.060> rounded<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:08.130> poor<00:01:08.549> pieces

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
actually rounded off the the poor pieces

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.719 
actually rounded off the the poor pieces
here<00:01:09.979> before<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> put<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> box<00:01:11.520> together

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
here before I put the box together

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.270 
here before I put the box together
rounded<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.390> off<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> router<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
rounded it off with a with a router to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
rounded it off with a with a router to
make<00:01:14.340> sure<00:01:14.640> there's<00:01:15.150> some<00:01:15.330> nice<00:01:15.479> clean<00:01:15.900> air

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
make sure there's some nice clean air

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
make sure there's some nice clean air
flow<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.860> same<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.280> piece<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.759> all

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
flow and same with this piece it's all

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.870 
flow and same with this piece it's all
rounded<00:01:18.210> overall<00:01:18.600> nice<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.729> basically

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
rounded overall nice so I just basically

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880 
rounded overall nice so I just basically
got<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> blow<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.509> thing<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.530> some<00:01:22.680> glue

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
got to blow this thing out get some glue

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.289 
got to blow this thing out get some glue
down<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> joints<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:24.030> time<00:01:24.270> just

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
down on the joints one more time just

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.999 
down on the joints one more time just
make<00:01:24.689> sure<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.229> sealed<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.619> inside

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
