to me I think this was really false

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.480 
to me I think this was really false
advertisement<00:01:51.020> especially<00:01:51.469> with<00:01:51.649> on<00:01:52.159> the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
the mop itself does spend every time

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.900 
the mop itself does spend every time
they<00:01:57.870> mop<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> floor<00:01:58.620> it<00:01:58.980> was<00:01:59.130> spinning<00:01:59.520> and

false<00:02:18.990> advertisement<00:02:19.590> especially<00:02:20.520> at<00:02:21.180> a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
false advertisement especially at a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.810 
false advertisement especially at a
price<00:02:24.110> thirty<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.560> get<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.920> come<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.730> a

price thirty if I can get this come up a
little

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.149 

again<00:02:30.159> I<00:02:30.700> would<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.719> talk<00:02:32.170> about<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.859> mop

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
again I would like to talk about the mop

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.369 
again I would like to talk about the mop
that<00:02:33.459> spins<00:02:33.819> away<00:02:34.150> dirt<00:02:34.659> I<00:02:35.909> think<00:02:36.909> this<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.540> not

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
that spins away dirt I think this is not

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.860 
that spins away dirt I think this is not
a<00:02:38.409> goodbye

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
a goodbye

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.699 
a goodbye
especially<00:02:40.870> at<00:02:41.849> $39.99<00:02:42.849> from<00:02:43.750> Bath<00:02:43.959> Body<00:02:43.989> and

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
especially at $39.99 from Bath Body and

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.899 
especially at $39.99 from Bath Body and
works<00:02:46.590> based<00:02:47.590> off<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.980> information<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.819> he

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
works based off the information that he

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:56.699 
works based off the information that he
provided<00:02:48.939> and<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:52.120> product<00:02:52.599> itself<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:55.709> think

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
provided and the product itself I think

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.429 
provided and the product itself I think
it<00:02:56.889> would<00:02:57.010> basically<00:02:57.719> false<00:02:58.719> advertisement

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
it would basically false advertisement

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.349 
it would basically false advertisement
especially<00:03:01.169> 360<00:03:02.169> rotating<00:03:02.950> action<00:03:03.549> never

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
happens the only time that that happens

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.420 
happens the only time that that happens
it's<00:03:08.169> always<00:03:08.290> right<00:03:08.560> here<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.889> not<00:03:09.040> actually
