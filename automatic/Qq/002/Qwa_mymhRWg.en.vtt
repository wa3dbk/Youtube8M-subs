 put it in the dish then we go 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.730

 well three quarters of an hour to cook I 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.159
 advise you to cut it in four if 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.600

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.280
 could have cut in 6 that's a lot 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.820
 faster to cook I put the onions 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.010
 with the chicken then I will recover 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.900
 my head of garlic and I'm going to separate the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.810
 pods we do not remove there for that 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.350

 he keeps himself obviously the ouch was washed 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.360
 1 it remains only to add 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.390
 the seasoning so I put a little 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.340
 little olive oil and I do not put salt 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.990
 and pepper that otherwise they fall 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.210
 at the bottom of the dish and do not salt and the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.630
 not pepper the chicken and I finish with 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.630
 salt 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.270
 we have all the good advice 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.670
 start cold oven a thermostat then 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.690
 200 degrees for 45 minutes after that 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.950

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.360
