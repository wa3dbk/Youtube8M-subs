don't<00:00:53.090> they<00:00:53.210> jump<00:00:53.690> around<00:00:53.780> everywhere<00:00:57.280> I

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
don't they jump around everywhere I

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.820 
don't they jump around everywhere I
thought<00:00:58.700> you<00:00:59.210> know<00:00:59.630> but<00:00:59.930> I<00:00:59.960> would<00:01:00.230> guess<00:01:00.500> this

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830
