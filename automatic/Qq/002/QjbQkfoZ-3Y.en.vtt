championship game LSU will face off
against<00:00:09.360> Alabama<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.519> think<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
against Alabama I think this is the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.120 
against Alabama I think this is the
matchup<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.389> needed<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.719> happen<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.410> couple

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
matchup that needed to happen a couple

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.180 
matchup that needed to happen a couple
weeks<00:00:14.610> back<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.910> said<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.960> really<00:00:16.920> didn't

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
weeks back I said that I really didn't

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.220 
weeks back I said that I really didn't
want<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.670> match<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.949> reason<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.279> that

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
want this match and the reason for that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.990 
want this match and the reason for that
really<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.500> if<00:00:22.980> Alabama<00:00:23.939> comes<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.570> wins

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
really is if Alabama comes in and wins

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.839 
really is if Alabama comes in and wins
then<00:00:27.000> they've<00:00:27.210> gone<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.250> verse<00:00:29.250> LSU

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
then they've gone one in one verse LSU

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.990 
then they've gone one in one verse LSU
and<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.240> Timmy<00:00:30.539> kind<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.900> makes<00:00:31.850> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and that Timmy kind of makes kind of a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
and that Timmy kind of makes kind of a
split<00:00:33.210> decision<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.899> know<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> guess

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
split decision you know but I guess

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.440 
split decision you know but I guess
that's<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> nature<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.120> college

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that's just the nature of college

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880 
that's just the nature of college
football<00:00:36.840> looks<00:00:37.020> who<00:00:37.110> ever<00:00:37.260> wins<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.739> any

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
football looks who ever wins on any

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.660 
football looks who ever wins on any
given<00:00:38.070> day<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.350> day<00:00:40.680> will<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.520> day

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
given day and this day will be the day

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
given day and this day will be the day
that<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.000> championship<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.629> decided<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that the championship is decided and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.090 
that the championship is decided and
honestly<00:00:44.309> either<00:00:44.610> team<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.000> wins<00:00:45.950> earns<00:00:46.950> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
honestly either team that wins earns it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
honestly either team that wins earns it
it's<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.760> Alabama<00:00:48.510> was<00:00:48.750> routed<00:00:49.170> by<00:00:49.320> LSU

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it's not like Alabama was routed by LSU

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.490 
it's not like Alabama was routed by LSU
in<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> first<00:00:50.309> meeting<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:51.199> went<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> overtime

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
in the first meeting I went to overtime

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
in the first meeting I went to overtime
i<00:00:52.829> went<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> field<00:00:53.879> goal<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.420> very

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
i went to a field goal it was a very

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.060 
i went to a field goal it was a very
tight<00:00:55.050> game<00:00:56.000> I<00:00:57.000> expect<00:00:57.629> we'll<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.739> few<00:00:58.770> more

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
tight game I expect we'll see a few more

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.299 
tight game I expect we'll see a few more
points<00:00:59.309> scored<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.969> game<00:01:00.800> but<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.070> not

points scored in this game but it's not

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.030 
points scored in this game but it's not
going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.170> blowout<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.350> anything<00:01:04.890> we're

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
