00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 very well 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.080
 well this cake is a floor 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.900
 learn in a way the legend where 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.940
 you vote as a team 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.150
 and we were working putting each 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.150
 each of these chocolate sticks 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.390
 the Lions 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.309
 again but we started discussing him 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.080
 he did because it 's taking time to do it and 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.480
 it's good to take that milestone time that 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.750
 It is the only chocolate floor of the 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.589
 stung crisis not because it has a 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.900
 second skewer the cake and the first 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.850
 beach bite and it is precisely yet 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.949
 it's going to happen that if you in a mold 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.619
 small to throw it up is what 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.570
 it happened to us chefs 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.129
 and music 90 to see if I can not get you 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.699
 I will show here 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.540
 as we found it a good exquisite 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.420
 we find 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.520
 as a portraitist of tartlets 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.950
 chiquitas we had each 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 of 10 centimeters or so and we said 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.660
 good instead of making a big mold of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.510
 biscuit we make three of these 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.250
 billboards and ready well then at home 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.550
 you will find a practical solution 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.160
 The idea is to have a mold 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.380
 big down and one guy up the guy 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.900
 it has to be quite smaller than the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.970
 from below because otherwise I do not like 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.800
 is is proportional to the truth 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.420
 the place is from balcony to put 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.280
 so much fruit was to put so much precision 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.119
 as a contribution cited in this case by 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.240
 example cove and the one below is 38 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.090
 30 and the one on top of day there's a lot 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.860
 difference then it 's built from 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.570
 chocolate list now I'm saying the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.000
 quantities we see you with a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.950
 knife of these developments 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.980
 Carlos we see a regional in two parts 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.230
 since the filling had not happened 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.290
 as we are of the age of strawberries 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.740
 it's called making a bud filling with 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 cream 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.560
 simple but rich very rich and good marked 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.580
 one line marked the second notice that 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.320
 they are appropriating the cake with the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.480
 sponge cake as we said the other scale 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:31.130
 is cold is rested is not better 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.130
 use it tomorrow for example 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 and also it is simply too martina 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.849
 mark it 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.510
 we have options if you have a knife 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.540
 big like this bread that almost gas and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.659
 gives you the length to cut everything but 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.129
 the book does it but you do not have to me a 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.129
 they taught me a secret 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.650
 on the floor 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.250
 we have things that we do well 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.380
 and you do not have 16 minutes have concluded 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.930
 that the children should have the area of â€‹â€‹my 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.180
 brothers then of those and those of 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.910
 cannes to show with the old men 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.530
 Then they do double or triple 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.870
 let's see if it does not work by doing it 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:42.780
 bend the thread but it has to be a thread 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.780
 of sewing should not be cut anymore 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.990
 at Christmas and around there people come back 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.020
 things with the rate of it 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.810
 it accommodates you in this groove that you made 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.780
 with the knife they then fried 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.050
 you accommodate in everything everything all the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.070
 diameter we help and in that moment 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.070
 started to cross 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.310
 while crossing the thread you are cutting 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.010
 in friends 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.020
 no no 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.710
 magic craft keep today from having been 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.710
 the thread 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.670
 this is spectacular in technique is the 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.160
 duty of all kinds 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.340
 I send a kiss to who taught me this 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.860
 when I had I do not know 14 years that is 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.960
 omar him and so is lilly's husband who 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.710
 it works like the one billion game 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.930
 years 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.010
 secretly and the truth that works very 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:54.180
 ok so we pull the thread until 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.960
 do not see each other and cut the two layers 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.960
 from ready to the ground 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.890
 good what we do now let's improve 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.540
 always a verbena and we will see the world 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.780
 it's always good when this is a 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.670
 disc is soil that is a bit late and 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.490
 give him some syrup in this case of 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.580
 orange thing that will absorb the 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.260
 it came too dry says that as 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.240
 we made here the equal parts of water and 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.100
 sugar , we boiled it with some 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.150
 orange peels for about 5 minutes 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.640
 and so it does not have to be very dense 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.710
 happens here, the success of the 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.710
 syrup with orange and it is not dry 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.330
 and well then we follow first step 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:44.520
 we open with orange friends 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.319
 and this we're going to put candy on 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.319
 milk or de gea takes care of
