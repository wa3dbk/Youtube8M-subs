00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.280
 I'm slower 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.310
 so 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 if we are not 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.210

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.530
 with its surroundings around the eye to me 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.530

 we all arrived in a car I'm pushing 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.480
 in this environment and outside 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.620
 the counter

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.190
 I'm looking forward to good and 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.190

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.270
 save yourself 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.160
 like they do not go with roulettes but that 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:14.750
 you have to put in salads but not 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.750
 the previous ones are in physical time 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.290
 what do we play 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.050
 good 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.500
 this is very easy because it's not going 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.230
 crash leaves me a little bit of advantage 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.420
 in research will run a little this 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.160
