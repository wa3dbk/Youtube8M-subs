with a very yo low u value for the geeks
of<00:00:55.620> 1.2<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.900> means<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.620> let<00:00:58.830> out<00:00:58.980> very

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of 1.2 that means they let out very

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.420 
of 1.2 that means they let out very
little<00:00:59.550> heat<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.960> hear<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.430> action

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you can hear it like it shuts out all

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.080 
you can hear it like it shuts out all
the<00:01:06.390> noise<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:07.230> shuts<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.550> cold<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the noise it shuts out all the cold and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.240 
the noise it shuts out all the cold and
if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.050> hand<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.560> even<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.190> the

winter you can feel no drafts they
really<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.890> fantastic<00:01:14.130> windows<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> our<00:01:16.800> idea

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
really are fantastic windows so our idea

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.830 
really are fantastic windows so our idea
was<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.640> much<00:01:17.850> blading<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.479> possible

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
was to get as much blading and possible

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.490 
was to get as much blading and possible
in<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.050> room<00:01:20.450> because<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> Sun

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
in this room because it's like a Sun

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
in this room because it's like a Sun
space<00:01:22.800> or<00:01:23.010> a<00:01:23.040> passive<00:01:23.430> solar<00:01:23.720> orientation

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
space or a passive solar orientation

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.750 
space or a passive solar orientation
with<00:01:25.229> south<00:01:25.409> east<00:01:25.680> facing<00:01:25.979> which<00:01:26.370> is<00:01:26.520> good

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
with south east facing which is good

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.540 
with south east facing which is good
which<00:01:26.909> means<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.720> lots<00:01:27.870> of<00:01:27.990> sunshine

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
which means we can get lots of sunshine

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.850 
which means we can get lots of sunshine
I've<00:01:29.550> got<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.540> old<00:01:30.690> wall<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> house<00:01:31.409> here

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I've got the old wall of the house here

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.240 
I've got the old wall of the house here
which<00:01:32.580> is<00:01:32.850> structural<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.630> holds<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.860> roof<00:01:35.040> up

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
which is structural I holds the roof up

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.510 
which is structural I holds the roof up
but<00:01:36.060> also<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.630> very<00:01:36.720> good<00:01:37.290> thermal<00:01:37.740> mass<00:01:37.920> ie

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
but also it's very good thermal mass ie

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.960 
but also it's very good thermal mass ie
it<00:01:39.030> soaks<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.600> heat<00:01:40.010> and<00:01:41.010> then<00:01:41.460> lets<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> out

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it soaks up heat and then lets it out

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270 
it soaks up heat and then lets it out
when<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.479> air<00:01:42.659> temperatures<00:01:43.140> cooler<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
when that air temperatures cooler so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.570 
when that air temperatures cooler so
when<00:01:44.850> there's<00:01:45.270> warm<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.290> wall<00:01:46.590> warms<00:01:47.130> up<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
when there's warm this wall warms up and

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.149 
when there's warm this wall warms up and
then<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.330> air<00:01:48.479> cools<00:01:48.780> down<00:01:48.900> this<00:01:49.830> wall

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
then when the air cools down this wall

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.730 
then when the air cools down this wall
gives<00:01:50.729> off<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.479> heat<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.260> evenings

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
gives off the heat so in the evenings

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.160 
gives off the heat so in the evenings
it's<00:01:53.159> nice<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> warm<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.510> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> day<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it's nice and warm and in the day it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.190 
it's nice and warm and in the day it
keeps<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.470> nice<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.680> cool<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:57.720> get<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:57.930> four

into<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> attic<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:04.220> as<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
into the attic and as you can see this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.940 
into the attic and as you can see this
is<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> attic<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.260> old<00:02:07.409> line<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
is the attic this is the old line of the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.830 
is the attic this is the old line of the
roof<00:02:08.159> this<00:02:08.549> way<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.909> way<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:09.720> we've

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
roof this way in that way and then we've

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.430 
roof this way in that way and then we've
taken<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.409> across<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.920> way<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.610> another

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
taken it across that way to get another

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
taken it across that way to get another
office<00:02:13.440> room<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.130> little<00:02:14.370> bathroom

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
office room and a little bathroom

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.550 
office room and a little bathroom
here<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.630> see<00:02:16.900> where<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.290> haven't

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
here you can see where we haven't

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.820 
here you can see where we haven't
finished<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.040> roof<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:20.290> we've<00:02:20.470> got<00:02:20.650> about

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
finished the roof that we've got about

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.430 
finished the roof that we've got about
five<00:02:21.190> inches<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:23.970> roof<00:02:24.970> rafter<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.230> that's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
five inches of roof rafter and that's

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.710 
five inches of roof rafter and that's
what<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:26.710> filled<00:02:27.010> behind<00:02:27.490> there<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.880> full<00:02:28.510> of

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
what we filled behind there is full of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.110 
what we filled behind there is full of
chutes<00:02:28.990> with<00:02:29.170> insulation<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.910> sheep's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
chutes with insulation but the sheep's

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.260 
chutes with insulation but the sheep's
will<00:02:31.330> would<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.540> fallen<00:02:31.780> out<00:02:32.050> if<00:02:32.320> we'd<00:02:32.740> have

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
will would have fallen out if we'd have

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.790 
will would have fallen out if we'd have
not<00:02:34.270> had<00:02:34.420> anything<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.140> put<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.470> plaster

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
not had anything so put the plaster

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.020 
not had anything so put the plaster
board<00:02:35.950> on<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.130> top<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:36.460> before<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:36.790> put<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
board on the top but before we put the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.460 
board on the top but before we put the
platform<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.570> put<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.840> extra<00:02:38.230> layer<00:02:38.350> of

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
platform and put this extra layer of

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.150 
platform and put this extra layer of
insulation<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.230> foam<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.800> was

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
insulation this is the the foam I was

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.520 
insulation this is the the foam I was
talking<00:02:42.550> about<00:02:42.580> with<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.240> tin<00:02:43.780> foil<00:02:44.050> layer<00:02:44.320> on

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
talking about with the tin foil layer on

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.120 
talking about with the tin foil layer on
it<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:46.600> much<00:02:46.780> insulation<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.800> that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
it and that much insulation is like that

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.950 
it and that much insulation is like that
much<00:02:48.310> sheep's<00:02:48.580> wool<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.420> that's<00:02:49.600> why<00:02:49.810> we're

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
much sheep's wool so that's why we're

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.600 
much sheep's wool so that's why we're
using<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.320> there<00:02:50.500> because<00:02:50.680> we<00:02:50.800> keep<00:02:51.400> our

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
using it there because we keep our

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.320 
using it there because we keep our
headspace

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
headspace

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.660 
headspace
we've<00:02:52.690> also<00:02:52.960> taped<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.770> increase<00:02:54.490> the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
we've also taped it up to increase the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.510 
we've also taped it up to increase the
air<00:02:54.820> tightness<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:56.020> building<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:57.400> we

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
air tightness of the building but we

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.700 
air tightness of the building but we
have<00:02:57.700> had<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.970> make<00:02:58.090> compromises<00:02:58.240> I<00:02:58.780> wouldn't

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
have had to make compromises I wouldn't

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.470 
have had to make compromises I wouldn't
have<00:02:59.800> liked<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.160> use<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.580> stuff<00:03:00.850> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
have liked to use this stuff the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.930 
have liked to use this stuff the
polyurethane<00:03:01.990> li<00:03:02.530> but<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.040> consider<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.820> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
polyurethane li but I consider that the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.060 
polyurethane li but I consider that the
insulation<00:03:04.270> was<00:03:04.570> more<00:03:04.810> important<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.650> also

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
insulation was more important and also

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.140 
insulation was more important and also
having<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.880> usable<00:03:07.360> space<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> if<00:03:08.860> by<00:03:09.730> not<00:03:09.940> using

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
having a usable space so if by not using

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.550 
having a usable space so if by not using
this<00:03:10.480> stuff<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.930> would<00:03:11.050> have<00:03:11.140> had<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.440> have

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
this stuff we would have had to have

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.830 
this stuff we would have had to have
very<00:03:11.800> very<00:03:11.860> low<00:03:12.760> roofs<00:03:13.060> we've<00:03:13.300> had<00:03:13.450> less

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
very very low roofs we've had less

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.950 
very very low roofs we've had less
usable<00:03:14.380> space<00:03:14.590> up<00:03:15.010> here<00:03:15.450> then<00:03:16.450> we<00:03:16.570> may<00:03:16.750> not

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
usable space up here then we may not

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.840 
usable space up here then we may not
have<00:03:17.200> stayed<00:03:17.770> in<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.010> small<00:03:18.250> house<00:03:18.520> he<00:03:18.640> may<00:03:18.760> have

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
have stayed in a small house he may have

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.280 
have stayed in a small house he may have
moved<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.210> bigger<00:03:19.390> house<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:19.990> what<00:03:20.170> you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
moved to a bigger house and what you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.770 
moved to a bigger house and what you
notice<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.950> our<00:03:21.040> terrace<00:03:21.490> is<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.420> houses

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
notice in our terrace is that the houses

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.530 
notice in our terrace is that the houses
either<00:03:22.930> side<00:03:23.350> when<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.770> snowed<00:03:24.100> I've<00:03:24.430> not<00:03:25.330> got

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
either side when it snowed I've not got

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.060 
either side when it snowed I've not got
snow<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.170> as<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.410> still<00:03:26.650> got<00:03:26.800> snow<00:03:27.040> on

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
snow on and as I still got snow on

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.830 
snow on and as I still got snow on
because<00:03:27.730> we're<00:03:27.880> keeping<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.210> heat<00:03:28.420> in<00:03:28.600> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
because we're keeping the heat in the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.540 
because we're keeping the heat in the
house<00:03:28.990> where<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.320> belongs<00:03:29.620> rather<00:03:30.220> than<00:03:30.340> just

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
house where it belongs rather than just

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.890 
house where it belongs rather than just
letting<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.880> off<00:03:30.970> into<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.270> environment

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
letting it off into the environment

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.080 
letting it off into the environment
we<00:03:32.740> had<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.920> very<00:03:33.160> low<00:03:33.340> budget<00:03:33.490> to<00:03:33.760> build<00:03:33.940> this

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
we had a very low budget to build this

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.440 
we had a very low budget to build this
house<00:03:34.360> we<00:03:35.200> had<00:03:35.440> between<00:03:35.650> us<00:03:36.040> six<00:03:37.000> months<00:03:37.300> off

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
house we had between us six months off

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.960 
house we had between us six months off
work<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.880> we<00:03:40.240> built<00:03:40.600> another<00:03:41.320> 40<00:03:42.220> square

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
work and we built another 40 square

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.660 
work and we built another 40 square
meters<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.480> space<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.160> house<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.370> now

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
meters of space so the house is now

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.100 
meters of space so the house is now
hundred<00:03:46.060> square<00:03:46.240> meters<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.840> was

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
hundred square meters and it was

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.460 
hundred square meters and it was
originally<00:03:47.950> 60<00:03:48.910> square<00:03:49.180> metres<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.350> we've

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
originally 60 square metres so we've

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.830 
originally 60 square metres so we've
nearly<00:03:50.740> doubled<00:03:51.250> our<00:03:51.460> living<00:03:51.730> area<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.510> but

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
nearly doubled our living area and but
