00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.429
 hello climent is where rest is us 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.810
 we have found one of the 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.710
 most anticipated devices of the fair 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:13.059
 the renewal of the line is not about 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:20.050
 from samsung galaxy no 4 come on let's go with 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:24.220
 the first one let's start with the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.480
 internal improvements android kitkat 4.4 voucher 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.430
 this is not an internal improvement as such 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.490
 because the previous model also had 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.210
 kitkat but has one more processor 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.650
 powerful a quad-core processor to 2.7 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.180
 gigahertz 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.670
 also has 3 gigs of memory 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.950
 ram 32 gigs of internal storage and 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.350
 all the connectivity of which already 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.990
 had the previous model that is to say the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.280
 nou 3 on the other hand and in the part 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.750
 external is where we are going to find 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.070
 I loose the biggest older majors 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.739
 differences that are not either 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.489
 a lot but you can see the screen 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:01.060
 of 57 inches and resolution 4 hd super 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.280
 amoled that is 2560 x 1440 pixels of 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.760
 resolution perhaps what stands out most is 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.450
 what 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.000
 in this model they have also used a 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.100
 small metallic line an edge quoted 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.220
 bevelled that the truth is that it gives you a 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.869
 pretty pretty more attractive appearance 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.080
 than in the previous model at least 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.970
 more elegant in the back 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.450
 we still have this simile of skin 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.830
 plastic that in the very plastic background and 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.869
 that the truth that we never liked 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.420
 a lot but they have added the sensor here 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.460
 heart rate with which always 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.800
 we can use the sensor if we do not have 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.909
 another wearable that we do here 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.530
 we have water to overturn to be more 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.159
 practical to take it directly in the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.350
 clock 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.070
 the bracelet or wherever in this little hole 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.530
 is where I would go 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.409
 spain of course the pencil that has 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.200
 to accompany everything you value 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.620
 2048 pressure points and 15 grams of 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.729
 weight that by the way the device weighs 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.470
 176 grams taking into account that the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.479
 screen is 5.7 inches as os 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.390
 he said he is not at all bad at all 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.310
 On the other hand the cameras ahead of 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.180
 the front camera 3.7 megapixels 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.470
 eye efe 1.9 go improved luminosity 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.980
 because they have seen that of the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.270
 selfish has a lot of pull and then 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.360
 have done we can make it all 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.770
 much easier and if not then that will come 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.459
 the bradley cooper photo that always come out 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.930
 phenomenal that man rear camera 16 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.180
 megapixels but here what stands out 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.660
 above all is that this time they have 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.580
 added the optical stabilizer that does not 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.700
 had previously if for example 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.709
 we activate the camera we find 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.420
 that has the hdr that maybe not here 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.250
 it shows a lot but that is a hr in 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.819
 real time of course still recording 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.770
 video in 4k as I already did for 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:58.170
 example the 5 s and a German 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.849
 and lied nothing so let's move on 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.380
 and I'm going to talk about what is 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.660
 inside but you do not see the battery of 3 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.510
 thousand 220 milliamps and with a mode of 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.180
 fast charge that makes us able 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.140
 fill the battery of our know 4 in 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.790
 only 30 minutes at 50% for the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.590
 presentation of this new 4 have been 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.650
 supported on two major brands the first 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.870
 of swarovski brands to make these 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.760
 rear finishes that good that you 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.430
 they may like it or not but at least they are 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.480
 different and who has said that I do not 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.220
 I liked the eye 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.220
 Well the fact is that I love it, I know 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.599
 which is a little flashy plus another 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.580
 the premium brands with which it has 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.099
 associated samsung has been with montblanc 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.860
 what then to launch devices 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:45.760
 of writing but not of ink 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.549
 writing devices for your no 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.560
 they have the pointer and they have here a 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.709
 button that will allow us to activate by 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.040
 example the function of the command or the 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.040
 script 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.830
 and be able to use it as we would use the 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.840
 normal stylus but with a lot more 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.580
 style and it is also accompanied by 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.040
 special cases specifically 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.440
 designed also for the nou of 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.810
 montblanc that really do that 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.650
 look like even a design portfolio 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.910
 so 13 improved 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.230
 possibly too little improved 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.400
 for what you would expect but for 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.020
 example if you have gotten the 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.690
 fingerprint reader but that 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.420
 certainly has the same look so 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.220
 great that has the nou 3 and that 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.450
 true still keeping certain 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.450
 functions with the spain 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.500
 put some that have improved we will continue 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.460
 informing 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.460
