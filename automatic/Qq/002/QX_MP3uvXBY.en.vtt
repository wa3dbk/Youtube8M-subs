all the guns up and this is just a start
but<00:00:31.509> this<00:00:31.630> was<00:00:31.839> a<00:00:31.869> game<00:00:32.110> of<00:00:32.320> Team<00:00:32.500> Deathmatch

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.270 
but this was a game of Team Deathmatch
and<00:00:33.040> it<00:00:33.490> was<00:00:33.640> literally<00:00:34.030> over<00:00:34.720> in<00:00:34.930> about<00:00:35.470> three

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
and it was literally over in about three

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.840 
and it was literally over in about three
and<00:00:36.310> a<00:00:36.460> half<00:00:36.490> minutes<00:00:36.850> I<00:00:37.240> had<00:00:38.140> free<00:00:39.070> people<00:00:39.610> in

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
and a half minutes I had free people in

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.360 
and a half minutes I had free people in
the<00:00:39.970> party<00:00:40.210> with<00:00:40.510> me<00:00:40.540> I'm<00:00:40.960> not<00:00:41.170> sure<00:00:41.370> can't
