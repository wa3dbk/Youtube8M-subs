okay this is looking towards the north

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.290 
okay this is looking towards the north
side<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.500> Wichita<00:00:07.500> Falls<00:00:07.799> towards<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.880> city

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
side of Wichita Falls towards a city

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.250 
side of Wichita Falls towards a city
view<00:00:09.510> Burkburnett<00:00:11.990> and<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.200> right<00:00:13.469> off<00:00:13.710> of

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
view Burkburnett and just right off of

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.599 
view Burkburnett and just right off of
Seymour<00:00:16.260> highway<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.430> can

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
Seymour highway here and that you can

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.269 
Seymour highway here and that you can
tell<00:00:20.789> that's<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.230> that's<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.320> wall<00:00:22.560> cloud<00:00:22.949> up

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
tell that's the that's a wall cloud up

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.140 
tell that's the that's a wall cloud up
there<00:00:25.400> that's<00:00:26.400> where<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:26.849> said<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
there that's where they said the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.330 
there that's where they said the
rotation<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:30.260> see<00:00:31.260> how<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.619> takes<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.160> that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
rotation was see how that takes on that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.530 
rotation was see how that takes on that
like<00:00:32.579> UFO<00:00:33.329> type<00:00:34.260> appearance<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.480> there's<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
like UFO type appearance and there's a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.959 
like UFO type appearance and there's a
what<00:00:37.200> happens<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.739> there's<00:00:38.010> horizontal

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
what happens is there's horizontal

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
what happens is there's horizontal
rotation<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.899> this<00:00:42.899> lower<00:00:43.440> part<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
rotation there and this lower part of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.540 
rotation there and this lower part of
the<00:00:44.370> wall<00:00:44.550> cloud<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.450> where<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:47.129> cloud

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the wall cloud that's where the cloud

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.080 
the wall cloud that's where the cloud
will<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.910> rotating<00:00:48.719> horizontally<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:50.090> then

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
will be rotating horizontally and then

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.830 
will be rotating horizontally and then
when<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> becomes<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.809> tornado<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.850> runs<00:00:54.600> over

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
when it becomes a tornado it runs over

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.580 
when it becomes a tornado it runs over
vertically<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> right<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:57.719> that's<00:00:57.989> just

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
vertically and so right now that's just

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
vertically and so right now that's just
about<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.340> around<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.879> city<00:01:00.629> view<00:01:00.899> Bourke

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
about right up around a city view Bourke

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.250 
about right up around a city view Bourke
area<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.550> towards<00:01:02.910> Wichita<00:01:03.420> Falls<00:01:03.660> maybe<00:01:03.960> just

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
area up towards Wichita Falls maybe just

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740 
area up towards Wichita Falls maybe just
a<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.559> bit<00:01:04.680> north<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:06.180> city<00:01:06.420> views

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
a little bit north of the city views

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:19.240 
a little bit north of the city views
probably<00:01:07.140> closer<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> Shepherd<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.240> Burke

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.859 

just<00:01:20.250> checking<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.760> some<00:01:20.790> portions<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.690> don't

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
just checking out some portions I don't

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
just checking out some portions I don't
know<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.140> visible<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> camera

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
know if it's visible on the camera

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.890 
know if it's visible on the camera
but<00:01:26.090> some<00:01:27.090> portions<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:29.330> put<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.360> cloud<00:01:30.630> right

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
but some portions of put a cloud right

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.490 
but some portions of put a cloud right
over<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.940> that's<00:01:32.940> dropped<00:01:33.450> down<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
over there that's dropped down that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.940 
over there that's dropped down that
doesn't<00:01:34.950> look<00:01:35.100> too<00:01:35.250> good<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:37.409> dropped<00:01:37.830> down

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
doesn't look too good it's dropped down

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.420 
doesn't look too good it's dropped down
with<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.540> little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> cone<00:01:40.430> trailing

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
with a little bit of a cone trailing

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:51.710 
with a little bit of a cone trailing
behind<00:01:41.610> oh<00:01:44.000> Jesus<00:01:47.270> there's<00:01:50.179> there's<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.270> funnel

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
behind oh Jesus there's there's a funnel

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.410 
behind oh Jesus there's there's a funnel
coming<00:01:51.899> down<00:01:52.229> right<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:55.850> okay<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> dip<00:01:57.179> back

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
coming down right there okay a dip back

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.639 
coming down right there okay a dip back
up<00:01:59.270> yeah<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.080> funnel<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
up yeah that was that was a funnel that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.020 
up yeah that was that was a funnel that
dropped<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:04.610> okay<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.909> was

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
dropped down right there okay it was

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.360 
dropped down right there okay it was
definitely<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:07.100> funnel<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.729> looking<00:02:09.030> at<00:02:10.370> she

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
definitely a funnel I was looking at she

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.570 
definitely a funnel I was looking at she
right<00:02:11.519> up<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.910> way<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.769> probably<00:02:13.769> looked

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
right up that way so probably looked

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.780 
right up that way so probably looked
like<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.060> more<00:02:15.330> likely<00:02:15.600> in<00:02:16.019> between<00:02:16.790> City

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
like it was more likely in between City

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.350 
like it was more likely in between City
View<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.360> Hitler<00:02:18.810> occur<00:02:19.080> between<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
View and Hitler occur between the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.580 
View and Hitler occur between the
Shepherd<00:02:21.360> Air<00:02:21.480> Force<00:02:21.720> Base<00:02:21.959> missile<00:02:22.380> Road

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
Shepherd Air Force Base missile Road

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.090 
Shepherd Air Force Base missile Road
area<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.730> Burke<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.769> was<00:02:25.890> definitely

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
area and and Burke but it was definitely

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.050 
area and and Burke but it was definitely
a<00:02:26.489> little<00:02:26.790> bit<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.090> funnel<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.500> it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
a little bit of funnel I can see it

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.150 
a little bit of funnel I can see it
not<00:02:30.450> sure<00:02:30.630> how<00:02:30.810> clear<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.860> camera

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
not sure how clear it is on the camera

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.380 
not sure how clear it is on the camera
but<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.060> saw<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.570> drop<00:02:33.810> down<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.730> then<00:02:35.730> go<00:02:36.180> back

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
but I saw it drop down and then go back

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.940 
but I saw it drop down and then go back
up<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:37.220> with<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> speed<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.940> which<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.510> did

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
up and with the speed in which it did

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.500 
up and with the speed in which it did
I've<00:02:40.950> seen<00:02:41.250> seen<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.970> before

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
I've seen seen that before

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.690 
I've seen seen that before
it<00:02:42.780> was<00:02:42.930> pretty<00:02:43.290> clear<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.980> was<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.190> funnel

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
it was pretty clear that it was a funnel

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.289 
it was pretty clear that it was a funnel
cloud<00:02:46.190> looks<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.370> there<00:02:47.519> may<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.730> another

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
cloud looks like there may be another

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:57.720 
cloud looks like there may be another
one<00:02:48.630> dropping<00:02:49.530> down<00:02:49.560> there<00:02:50.040> now

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.179 

and<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:59.420> just<00:02:59.959> heard<00:03:00.109> some<00:03:00.349> chatter<00:03:00.379> that<00:03:01.069> there

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
and I just heard some chatter that there

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.149 
and I just heard some chatter that there
was<00:03:01.310> possibly<00:03:01.790> another<00:03:02.359> one<00:03:02.920> with<00:03:03.920> some

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
was possibly another one with some

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.289 
was possibly another one with some
potential<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:05.349> make<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.379> tornado<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:08.060> was

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
potential to make a tornado that was

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.349 
potential to make a tornado that was
over<00:03:08.629> closer<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.200> our<00:03:09.980> park<00:03:10.400> area<00:03:10.760> which<00:03:11.209> would

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
over closer to our park area which would

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.479 
over closer to our park area which would
be<00:03:11.389> over<00:03:11.629> this<00:03:11.810> way<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.379> little<00:03:13.099> bit<00:03:13.219> farther

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
be over this way a little bit farther

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.099 
be over this way a little bit farther
Northwest<00:03:14.560> Wichita<00:03:15.560> Falls<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.689> it<00:03:17.689> does<00:03:17.870> look

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
Northwest Wichita Falls and it does look

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.729 
Northwest Wichita Falls and it does look
like<00:03:18.169> a<00:03:19.419> little<00:03:20.419> bit<00:03:20.510> worse<00:03:20.719> over<00:03:21.079> that<00:03:21.290> way

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
like a little bit worse over that way

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.449 
like a little bit worse over that way
it's<00:03:22.069> like<00:03:22.189> some<00:03:22.340> real<00:03:22.549> heavy<00:03:22.730> rain<00:03:23.919> but<00:03:24.919> not

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
it's like some real heavy rain but not

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.250 
it's like some real heavy rain but not
only<00:03:25.609> are<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:25.909> mosquitoes<00:03:26.120> bad<00:03:26.719> right<00:03:27.049> here

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
only are the mosquitoes bad right here

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.949 
only are the mosquitoes bad right here
but<00:03:27.439> the<00:03:27.560> Lightning<00:03:28.069> is<00:03:28.310> it's<00:03:29.269> pretty<00:03:29.450> bad<00:03:29.930> out

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
but the Lightning is it's pretty bad out

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.119 
but the Lightning is it's pretty bad out
here<00:03:30.230> now<00:03:30.590> though

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
here now though

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.039 
here now though

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
but I wanted to come out here and get a

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.490 
but I wanted to come out here and get a
quick<00:03:33.349> look<00:03:34.069> this<00:03:34.340> is<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:37.269> pretty<00:03:38.269> nice<00:03:38.500> vantage

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
quick look this is a pretty nice vantage

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.210 
quick look this is a pretty nice vantage
point<00:03:39.919> here

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.800 

and<00:03:48.220> I've<00:03:48.520> got<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.700> little<00:03:48.880> bit<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.210> experience

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
and I've got a little bit of experience

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.580 
and I've got a little bit of experience
here<00:03:50.050> living<00:03:50.440> here<00:03:50.470> now<00:03:50.860> for<00:03:50.920> over<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.940> decade

here living here now for over a decade

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.450 
here living here now for over a decade
around<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.920> decade<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.900> long<00:03:56.770> time<00:03:57.010> ago<00:03:57.250> in

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
around the decade and a long time ago in

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.610 
around the decade and a long time ago in
and<00:03:59.100> flight<00:04:00.100> training<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.850> had<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.090> study

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
and flight training I had to study

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.430 
and flight training I had to study
meteorology<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:03.520> know<00:04:03.640> for<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.090> FAA<00:04:04.810> exam

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
meteorology you know for the FAA exam

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.720 
meteorology you know for the FAA exam
and<00:04:05.650> everything<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.190> have<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.400> know<00:04:06.550> these

and everything you have to know these
things<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:08.100> one<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.250> things<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.640> always

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
things and one of the things that always

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.990 
things and one of the things that always
sticks<00:04:10.180> with<00:04:10.270> me<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:11.080> use<00:04:11.650> living<00:04:12.430> in<00:04:12.850> this

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
sticks with me that I use living in this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.600 
sticks with me that I use living in this
area<00:04:13.330> things<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.350> know<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.890> how<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.370> look

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
area things that I know is how to look

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.010 
area things that I know is how to look
on<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.790> radar<00:04:16.350> for<00:04:18.390> clouds<00:04:19.390> when<00:04:19.720> they<00:04:19.840> say

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
on a radar for clouds when they say

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.260 
on a radar for clouds when they say
there's<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.320> wall<00:04:20.560> cloud<00:04:20.890> coming<00:04:21.460> or<00:04:21.820> there's<00:04:22.210> a

there's a wall cloud coming or there's a

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.120 
there's a wall cloud coming or there's a

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
severe thunderstorm coming and you see

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.660 
severe thunderstorm coming and you see
that<00:04:27.370> hook<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:29.140> hook<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.560> clouds<00:04:29.890> down

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
that hook the hook of clouds down

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.810 
that hook the hook of clouds down
towards<00:04:31.150> like<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.390> south<00:04:32.200> southwest<00:04:33.160> portion

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
towards like the south southwest portion

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.460 
towards like the south southwest portion
of<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.360> thunderstorm<00:04:35.400> pretty<00:04:36.400> well<00:04:36.580> no<00:04:36.820> that's

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
of a thunderstorm pretty well no that's

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.200 
of a thunderstorm pretty well no that's
that's<00:04:38.470> one<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.800> most<00:04:38.980> likely<00:04:39.250> areas<00:04:39.880> for

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
that's one of the most likely areas for

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.230 
that's one of the most likely areas for
a<00:04:40.240> tornado<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.230> develop<00:04:41.950> and<00:04:42.270> then<00:04:45.090> once<00:04:46.090> a

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
a tornado to develop and then once a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.650 
a tornado to develop and then once a
tornado<00:04:46.660> does<00:04:47.320> develop<00:04:47.920> it<00:04:48.850> almost<00:04:49.330> always

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
tornado does develop it almost always

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.500 
tornado does develop it almost always
travels<00:04:50.440> northeast<00:04:51.430> that's<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:52.240> one<00:04:52.480> of

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
travels northeast that's like one of

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.930 
travels northeast that's like one of
those<00:04:53.220> constants<00:04:54.220> one<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.460> those<00:04:54.580> things<00:04:54.820> you

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
those constants one of those things you

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.600 
those constants one of those things you
pretty<00:04:55.180> much<00:04:55.360> rely<00:04:55.750> on<00:04:56.010> you<00:04:57.010> know<00:04:57.040> if<00:04:57.310> you<00:04:57.490> were

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
pretty much rely on you know if you were

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.240 
pretty much rely on you know if you were
ever<00:04:57.910> out<00:04:58.510> in<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.960> open<00:04:59.380> somewhere<00:04:59.830> you're<00:05:00.130> on

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
ever out in the open somewhere you're on

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.550 
ever out in the open somewhere you're on
the<00:05:00.370> on<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.880> road<00:05:01.120> or<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:02.170> know<00:05:02.290> you<00:05:02.350> don't

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
the on the road or you know you don't

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.090 
the on the road or you know you don't
have<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.830> storm<00:05:03.280> shelter<00:05:03.340> or<00:05:03.940> something<00:05:05.100> you

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
have a storm shelter or something you

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.650 
have a storm shelter or something you
know<00:05:06.220> they<00:05:06.400> tell<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.790> don't<00:05:06.910> don't<00:05:07.330> try<00:05:07.600> to

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
know they tell you don't don't try to

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.570 
know they tell you don't don't try to
get<00:05:07.900> out<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.290> don't<00:05:08.380> try<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.680> outrun<00:05:08.860> one<00:05:09.370> and

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
get out and don't try to outrun one and

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.770 
get out and don't try to outrun one and
all<00:05:09.670> that<00:05:09.910> but<00:05:11.370> you<00:05:12.370> know<00:05:12.490> in<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.450> in<00:05:13.630> the

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
all that but you know in the in the

all that but you know in the in the
likelihood<00:05:14.380> that<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.830> do<00:05:15.220> happen<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.670> be

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
likelihood that you do happen to be

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.550 
likelihood that you do happen to be
caught<00:05:16.060> out<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.630> you<00:05:16.750> need<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.050> seek<00:05:17.290> shelter

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
caught out and you need to seek shelter

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.590 
caught out and you need to seek shelter
and<00:05:18.040> you're<00:05:18.130> not<00:05:18.310> exactly<00:05:18.700> sure<00:05:18.970> where<00:05:19.360> it's

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
and you're not exactly sure where it's

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.920 
and you're not exactly sure where it's
where<00:05:20.230> it's<00:05:20.410> at<00:05:20.620> or<00:05:20.650> where<00:05:21.040> it's<00:05:21.220> going<00:05:21.930> the

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
where it's at or where it's going the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.960 
where it's at or where it's going the
things<00:05:23.200> you<00:05:23.470> do<00:05:23.680> want<00:05:23.980> to<00:05:24.040> keep<00:05:24.190> in<00:05:24.340> mind<00:05:24.610> is

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
things you do want to keep in mind is

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.780 
things you do want to keep in mind is
that<00:05:26.130> almost<00:05:27.130> always<00:05:27.570> because<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.810> the

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
that almost always because of the

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.460 
that almost always because of the
rotation<00:05:30.790> of<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:32.260> tornado<00:05:32.980> the<00:05:34.380> rotation<00:05:35.380> of

rotation of the tornado the rotation of
the<00:05:35.590> whole<00:05:36.150> what<00:05:37.150> they<00:05:37.240> call<00:05:37.450> a<00:05:37.480> Coriolis

the whole what they call a Coriolis

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.540 
the whole what they call a Coriolis
effect<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:40.270> tornadoes<00:05:41.020> tend<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:41.770> almost

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
effect the tornadoes tend to almost

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.140 
effect the tornadoes tend to almost
always<00:05:42.970> travel<00:05:43.450> in<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:44.110> northeast<00:05:44.740> direction

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
always travel in a northeast direction

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.839 
always travel in a northeast direction
so<00:05:46.150> definitely

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
so definitely

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.429 
so definitely
you<00:05:48.240> don't<00:05:48.629> want<00:05:48.869> to<00:05:50.209> have<00:05:51.209> a<00:05:51.240> storm<00:05:51.599> to<00:05:52.409> the

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:52.439 
you don't want to have a storm to the

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.189 
you don't want to have a storm to the
west<00:05:52.740> of<00:05:53.039> you<00:05:53.249> approaching<00:05:54.179> you<00:05:54.389> and<00:05:54.599> then<00:05:55.050> you

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
west of you approaching you and then you

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.689 
west of you approaching you and then you
take<00:05:55.409> off<00:05:55.649> in<00:05:55.830> a<00:05:55.889> northwesterly<00:05:56.550> direction

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
take off in a northwesterly direction

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.169 
take off in a northwesterly direction
trying<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.539> escape<00:05:57.719> it<00:05:58.729> that's<00:05:59.729> where<00:06:00.059> it

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:00.179 
trying to escape it that's where it

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:04.360 
trying to escape it that's where it
could<00:06:00.659> come<00:06:00.839> up<00:06:00.990> on<00:06:01.169> you<00:06:01.349> from<00:06:01.800> behind

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.300 

or<00:06:04.940> travel<00:06:05.480> travel<00:06:06.020> Southwest<00:06:06.650> you<00:06:07.070> wouldn't

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
or travel travel Southwest you wouldn't

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.470 
or travel travel Southwest you wouldn't
want<00:06:07.430> to<00:06:07.490> do<00:06:07.610> that<00:06:07.790> either<00:06:07.970> because<00:06:08.120> you<00:06:08.270> might

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
want to do that either because you might

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.420 
want to do that either because you might
run<00:06:08.750> headlong<00:06:09.080> right<00:06:09.500> into<00:06:09.740> it<00:06:09.889> that's<00:06:10.280> your

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
run headlong right into it that's your

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.820 
run headlong right into it that's your
storm<00:06:10.730> chaser<00:06:11.270> and<00:06:11.449> we've<00:06:12.169> got<00:06:12.380> plenty<00:06:12.560> of

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
storm chaser and we've got plenty of

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.310 
storm chaser and we've got plenty of
those<00:06:12.949> yay<00:06:13.190> who's<00:06:13.430> around<00:06:13.750> that's<00:06:14.750> exactly

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
those yay who's around that's exactly

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.230 
those yay who's around that's exactly
what<00:06:15.500> they<00:06:15.650> do<00:06:15.710> around<00:06:15.979> here<00:06:16.280> you<00:06:16.880> see<00:06:17.090> them

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
what they do around here you see them

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:27.460 
what they do around here you see them
heading<00:06:17.540> towards<00:06:18.050> the<00:06:18.229> things

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.080 

looks<00:06:28.130> like<00:06:28.310> we're<00:06:28.520> probably<00:06:28.670> going<00:06:29.000> to

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
looks like we're probably going to

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:36.370 
looks like we're probably going to
escape<00:06:29.300> an<00:06:29.720> actual<00:06:30.410> tornado<00:06:31.100> here<00:06:31.880> so<00:06:34.960> and<00:06:35.960> due

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
escape an actual tornado here so and due

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.370 
escape an actual tornado here so and due
to<00:06:36.530> lightning<00:06:37.010> and<00:06:37.340> tiger<00:06:38.240> mosquitoes<00:06:38.930> I'm

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
to lightning and tiger mosquitoes I'm

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.400 
to lightning and tiger mosquitoes I'm
getting<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:39.680> hell<00:06:39.860> out<00:06:40.040> of<00:06:40.070> here<00:06:42.970> okay<00:06:43.970> a

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
getting the hell out of here okay a

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.070 
getting the hell out of here okay a
little<00:06:45.410> bit<00:06:45.560> of<00:06:45.800> an<00:06:45.890> update<00:06:46.690> this<00:06:47.690> is<00:06:47.840> not<00:06:48.050> a

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
little bit of an update this is not a

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.260 
little bit of an update this is not a
real<00:06:48.380> defined<00:06:48.920> what<00:06:49.400> I<00:06:49.430> would<00:06:49.670> call<00:06:49.820> wall

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
real defined what I would call wall

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.860 
real defined what I would call wall
cloud<00:06:50.690> but<00:06:51.790> you<00:06:52.790> might<00:06:53.120> define<00:06:53.480> that<00:06:53.660> as<00:06:53.840> a

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
cloud but you might define that as a

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:00.550 
cloud but you might define that as a
wall<00:06:54.140> cloud<00:06:55.390> coming<00:06:56.390> at<00:06:56.540> me<00:06:57.460> it's<00:06:59.080> not<00:07:00.080> exactly

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 
wall cloud coming at me it's not exactly

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.320 
wall cloud coming at me it's not exactly
traveling<00:07:01.160> northeast<00:07:01.700> it's<00:07:02.030> kind<00:07:02.270> of

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
traveling northeast it's kind of

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.670 
traveling northeast it's kind of
swinging<00:07:02.930> around<00:07:03.050> here<00:07:04.450> towards<00:07:05.450> the

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
swinging around here towards the

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:13.990 
swinging around here towards the
southeast<00:07:06.680> a<00:07:07.240> bit<00:07:08.650> and<00:07:10.030> so<00:07:12.550> yeah<00:07:13.550> that<00:07:13.850> looks

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
southeast a bit and so yeah that looks

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.530 
southeast a bit and so yeah that looks
pretty<00:07:14.090> ominous<00:07:14.690> and<00:07:15.970> get<00:07:16.970> the<00:07:17.090> hell<00:07:17.270> out<00:07:17.510> of

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
pretty ominous and get the hell out of

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.840 
pretty ominous and get the hell out of
here
