seen master prestigious in previous

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.050 
seen master prestigious in previous
games<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.920> we're<00:00:17.070> all<00:00:17.220> sort<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.730> million

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
that in that sense I think black ops 2

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.769 
that in that sense I think black ops 2
was<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> only<00:00:20.789> game<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.090> had<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> master

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
was the only game that had a master

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.710 
was the only game that had a master
prestige<00:00:22.670> correct<00:00:23.670> me<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:24.000> wrong<00:00:24.029> there<00:00:24.539> I

that as a 16th prestige like we did in
master<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.759> there's<00:00:33.000> actually<00:00:33.120> 15<00:00:33.840> real

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110

which I think you can upgrade straight
away<00:00:37.739> once<00:00:38.040> you've<00:00:38.219> surpassed<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.780> 15

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
away once you've surpassed all of 15

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.350 
away once you've surpassed all of 15
