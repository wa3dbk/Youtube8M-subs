00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
could say is dynamically equal both

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.530 
could say is dynamically equal both
sides<00:03:51.770> try<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.220> follow<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.820> plans<00:03:52.850> on<00:03:53.330> each

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
side of the board

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.650 
side of the board
c4<00:03:56.209> came<00:03:56.450> from<00:03:56.690> my<00:03:56.840> opponent<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:58.420> now<00:03:59.420> it

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
c4 came from my opponent and now it

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.300 
c4 came from my opponent and now it
looks<00:03:59.980> logical<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.820> break<00:04:02.120> with<00:04:02.450> g5<00:04:03.160> but<00:04:04.160> then

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
looks logical to break with g5 but then

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.199 
looks logical to break with g5 but then
black<00:04:04.550> has<00:04:04.790> h5<00:04:05.420> closing<00:04:06.290> down<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.790> King<00:04:07.970> side

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
black has h5 closing down the King side

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.490 
black has h5 closing down the King side
and<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:09.770> moves<00:04:10.100> like<00:04:10.340> g6<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.209> Knight<00:04:11.390> f5<00:04:11.840> he

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
and the moves like g6 and Knight f5 he

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.410 
and the moves like g6 and Knight f5 he
can<00:04:12.650> consolidate<00:04:13.010> his<00:04:13.459> his<00:04:14.030> King<00:04:14.270> side

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
can consolidate his his King side

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.039 
can consolidate his his King side
position<00:04:14.630> so<00:04:15.880> it's<00:04:16.880> much<00:04:17.150> more<00:04:17.330> effective<00:04:17.600> to

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
position so it's much more effective to

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.740 
position so it's much more effective to
play<00:04:18.680> h5<00:04:19.340> first<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:20.000> was<00:04:20.150> what<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:20.419> played

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
play h5 first and that was what I played

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.950 
play h5 first and that was what I played
in<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:20.959> game

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
in the game

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.040 
in the game
c63<00:04:23.960> c63<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:25.130> queen<00:04:25.400> evade<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.180> now<00:04:26.990> the

c63 c63 and queen evade and now the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.800 
c63 c63 and queen evade and now the
black<00:04:27.380> age<00:04:27.590> poem<00:04:28.010> has<00:04:28.670> been<00:04:28.880> fixed<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.420> now

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
black age poem has been fixed and now

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
black age poem has been fixed and now
it's<00:04:29.990> time<00:04:30.140> to<00:04:30.350> break<00:04:30.590> with<00:04:31.630> g5h<00:04:32.630> 65<00:04:33.530> and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it's time to break with g5h 65 and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.110 
it's time to break with g5h 65 and
Knight<00:04:34.340> g4<00:04:34.880> Knight<00:04:35.450> a5<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:36.310> Bishop<00:04:37.310> takes<00:04:37.550> g5

Knight g4 Knight a5 and Bishop takes g5

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.470 
Knight g4 Knight a5 and Bishop takes g5
and<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:39.110> believe<00:04:39.710> it's<00:04:40.010> a<00:04:40.220> very<00:04:40.480> uncomfortable

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
and I believe it's a very uncomfortable

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.820 
and I believe it's a very uncomfortable
position<00:04:42.080> for<00:04:42.560> black<00:04:42.650> now<00:04:43.450> 86<00:04:44.450> is<00:04:44.900> surely<00:04:45.650> in

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
position for black now 86 is surely in

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.060 
position for black now 86 is surely in
the<00:04:45.980> air<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.450> also<00:04:47.450> a<00:04:47.480> piece<00:04:47.840> second<00:04:48.290> f6<00:04:48.770> could

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
the air and also a piece second f6 could

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.940 
the air and also a piece second f6 could
be<00:04:49.220> possible<00:04:49.670> in<00:04:50.300> any<00:04:50.720> case<00:04:50.990> black<00:04:51.710> must

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
be possible in any case black must

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.520 
be possible in any case black must
concentrate<00:04:52.310> on<00:04:52.520> his<00:04:52.790> defense<00:04:52.970> now<00:04:53.420> so<00:04:54.410> he

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
concentrate on his defense now so he

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
concentrate on his defense now so he
pays<00:04:54.740> king<00:04:55.250> a7<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:57.430> solves<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.490> problem

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
pays king a7 and it solves the problem

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.580 
pays king a7 and it solves the problem
of<00:04:59.080> of<00:05:00.080> me<00:05:00.680> playing<00:05:01.040> 86<00:05:01.760> but<00:05:02.480> he<00:05:02.810> also<00:05:03.020> puts<00:05:03.410> his

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
of of me playing 86 but he also puts his

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.480 
of of me playing 86 but he also puts his
King<00:05:03.830> on<00:05:04.040> a<00:05:04.370> dangerous<00:05:04.820> diagonal<00:05:05.510> because<00:05:06.050> if

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
King on a dangerous diagonal because if

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.640 
King on a dangerous diagonal because if
I<00:05:07.490> can<00:05:07.670> put<00:05:07.910> my<00:05:08.120> bishop<00:05:08.750> on<00:05:09.110> this<00:05:09.290> diagonal

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
I can put my bishop on this diagonal

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.040 
I can put my bishop on this diagonal
then<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:10.460> could<00:05:10.640> force<00:05:10.880> an<00:05:11.120> exchange<00:05:11.570> of<00:05:11.750> the

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
then I could force an exchange of the

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.770 
then I could force an exchange of the
the<00:05:12.410> good<00:05:13.270> night<00:05:14.270> on<00:05:14.480> f5<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:16.550> my<00:05:17.300> next<00:05:17.600> move

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
the good night on f5 and my next move

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.540 
the good night on f5 and my next move
starts<00:05:18.260> a<00:05:18.590> plan<00:05:19.070> that<00:05:20.710> would<00:05:21.710> allow<00:05:21.860> me<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.340> put

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
starts a plan that would allow me to put

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.570 
starts a plan that would allow me to put
a<00:05:22.730> bishop<00:05:23.180> on<00:05:23.390> this<00:05:23.660> diagonal<00:05:24.140> so<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:24.830> play<00:05:25.040> d4

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
would like to play Bishop h6 but

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.300 
would like to play Bishop h6 but
unfortunately<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:55.880> queen<00:05:56.330> is<00:05:56.540> on<00:05:56.720> in<00:05:57.410> on<00:05:57.710> f8

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
unfortunately the queen is on in on f8

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.730 
unfortunately the queen is on in on f8
is<00:05:58.550> defending<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.720> square<00:05:59.960> h6<00:06:00.560> so<00:06:00.710> I

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
is defending the the square h6 so I

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.360 
is defending the the square h6 so I
cannot<00:06:01.100> do<00:06:01.940> better<00:06:02.180> than<00:06:02.420> the<00:06:02.660> take<00:06:03.500> on<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:03.740> f6

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
cannot do better than the take on the f6

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.420 
cannot do better than the take on the f6
here<00:06:04.580> and<00:06:04.760> I<00:06:05.540> believe<00:06:06.140> black<00:06:06.740> should<00:06:07.070> be<00:06:07.250> able

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
here and I believe black should be able

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.980 
here and I believe black should be able
to<00:06:07.700> hold<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.600> position<00:06:09.100> so<00:06:10.690> he<00:06:11.690> could<00:06:11.900> have

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
to hold this position so he could have

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.510 
to hold this position so he could have
played<00:06:12.880> Knight<00:06:13.880> takes<00:06:14.210> d4<00:06:14.630> here<00:06:14.870> perhaps<00:06:15.520> but

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
played Knight takes d4 here perhaps but

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.180 
played Knight takes d4 here perhaps but
in<00:06:16.760> the<00:06:16.940> game<00:06:17.120> he<00:06:17.300> played<00:06:17.440> Queen<00:06:18.440> p4<00:06:18.860> instead

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
in the game he played Queen p4 instead

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.210 
in the game he played Queen p4 instead
and<00:06:19.990> leaving<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.140> defense<00:06:21.440> like<00:06:21.650> this<00:06:21.860> is

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
and leaving the defense like this is

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.460 
and leaving the defense like this is
much<00:06:22.880> too<00:06:22.910> dangerous<00:06:23.150> for<00:06:23.600> black<00:06:23.930> because<00:06:24.170> now

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
much too dangerous for black because now

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.650 
much too dangerous for black because now
