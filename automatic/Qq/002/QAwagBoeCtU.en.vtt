 eight 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.230
 because 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.840
 the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.870
 veterans 5 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.820
 output 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 to 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.880
 we stack 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880
 on m he 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.220
 to win 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.289
 shortly speaking 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.929
 in Ukraine 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.299
 rub 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.299
 revenue pro 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.359
 prim it 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.069
 check 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.249
 what to them 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.249
 man reading
