00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
as appearing on the screen and if we

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.890 
as appearing on the screen and if we
there<00:01:15.800> we<00:01:15.950> go<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:16.220> can<00:01:16.250> see<00:01:16.720> plugging<00:01:17.720> it<00:01:17.810> in

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
there we go we can see plugging it in

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.160 
there we go we can see plugging it in
again<00:01:18.640> we<00:01:19.640> get<00:01:19.820> our<00:01:20.000> notification<00:01:20.690> here<00:01:20.930> and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
again we get our notification here and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.640 
again we get our notification here and

then it is in the Action Center as well

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.400 
then it is in the Action Center as well

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
so if we miss it we can get it back up

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.830 
so if we miss it we can get it back up
by<00:01:27.650> viewing<00:01:27.980> it<00:01:28.100> in<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.280> Action<00:01:28.640> Center

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
rather than it just disappearing forever

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.630 
rather than it just disappearing forever
we<00:01:32.930> can<00:01:33.140> clear<00:01:33.470> those<00:01:33.680> messages<00:01:34.130> out<00:01:34.400> of<00:01:34.580> the

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.900 
can see as before if we plug in our USB
device<00:06:25.039> we<00:06:25.490> get<00:06:25.639> a<00:06:25.669> notification<00:06:26.919> if<00:06:27.919> I<00:06:28.190> now

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
device we get a notification if I now
