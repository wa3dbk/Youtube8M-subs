00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.380 

so<00:00:40.850> here's<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.210> 5mm<00:00:41.750> production<00:00:43.000> as<00:00:44.000> you<00:00:44.239> can

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
so here's the 5mm production as you can

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.900 
so here's the 5mm production as you can
see<00:00:44.570> I<00:00:44.600> finished<00:00:45.219> quite<00:00:46.219> a<00:00:46.250> few<00:00:46.519> different

cutting<00:02:42.520> aluminum<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.820> titanium<00:02:44.830> style<00:02:45.830> D<00:02:46.130> is

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
cutting aluminum and titanium style D is

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.410 
cutting aluminum and titanium style D is
the<00:02:47.510> 3/4<00:02:48.050> inch<00:02:48.670> diameter<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.150> matches

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
the 3/4 inch diameter so this matches

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.530 
the 3/4 inch diameter so this matches
the<00:02:51.080> larger<00:02:51.700> adjustable<00:02:52.700> gap<00:02:52.850> receiver<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the larger adjustable gap receiver and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.520 
the larger adjustable gap receiver and
then<00:02:54.410> e<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.680> F<00:02:55.040> are<00:02:55.310> also<00:02:55.640> larger<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.420> E<00:02:57.080> is

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
then e and F are also larger and E is
