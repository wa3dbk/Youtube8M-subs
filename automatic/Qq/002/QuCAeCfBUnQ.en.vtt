00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
in very little soil disturbance it will

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.530 
in very little soil disturbance it will
cut<00:00:58.350> through<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> residue<00:00:59.190> it<00:01:00.120> doesn't<00:01:00.539> plug

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
cut through the residue it doesn't plug

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.820 
cut through the residue it doesn't plug
it's<00:01:02.690> working<00:01:02.960> really<00:01:03.050> good

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.370 

there<00:01:07.370> is<00:01:07.550> no<00:01:07.760> closing<00:01:08.150> wheel<00:01:08.570> attachment

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
there is no closing wheel attachment

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.010 
there is no closing wheel attachment
necessary<00:01:10.010> it's<00:01:10.850> very<00:01:11.180> simple<00:01:11.660> all<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.990> have

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
necessary it's very simple all you have

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.220 
necessary it's very simple all you have
is<00:01:12.410> a<00:01:12.440> blade<00:01:12.800> 24-inch<00:01:13.790> blade<00:01:14.120> slicing<00:01:15.050> through

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
is a blade 24-inch blade slicing through

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.200 
is a blade 24-inch blade slicing through
the<00:01:15.350> residue<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.490> then<00:01:16.640> there's<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.910> foot

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
the residue and then there's a foot

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.900 
the residue and then there's a foot
running<00:01:17.920> right<00:01:18.920> behind<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.430> blade<00:01:19.610> or

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
running right behind the blade or

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.270 
running right behind the blade or
basically<00:01:20.450> almost<00:01:21.380> touching<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.890> blade<00:01:22.040> the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
basically almost touching the blade the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.100 
basically almost touching the blade the
tip<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.760> foot<00:01:22.970> would<00:01:23.240> touch<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.660> blade<00:01:23.840> on

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
tip of the foot would touch the blade on

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.220 
tip of the foot would touch the blade on
the<00:01:24.260> edge<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.680> blade<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:26.240> runs<00:01:26.510> clean<00:01:26.900> it

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
the edge of the blade it runs clean it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.350 
the edge of the blade it runs clean it
doesn't<00:01:27.410> build<00:01:27.740> up<00:01:27.950> with<00:01:28.130> residue<00:01:28.580> or<00:01:28.900> soil<00:01:29.900> it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
doesn't build up with residue or soil it

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.450 
doesn't build up with residue or soil it
seals<00:01:32.360> well<00:01:33.040> and<00:01:34.040> that's<00:01:34.100> what<00:01:34.340> I've<00:01:34.430> been

looking for haven't really been able to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.120 
looking for haven't really been able to
find<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:38.170> opener<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.500> would<00:01:39.710> do<00:01:39.830> everything

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130
