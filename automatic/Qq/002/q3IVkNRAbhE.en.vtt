 ready to dive into the flow of fresh news 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.259
 from the world of high technology together from 3 to 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.099
 news daily 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.929

 windows 81 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.029
 thanks to deep cloud integration 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.650
 service and operating system work 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.779
 with files in the cloud will be just as easy 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.939
 as if they were on a hard disk 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.490
 computer main feature skydrive 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.980
 windows 8 1 is designed to facilitate 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.020
 life of mobile device owners 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.910
 even if the device has less memory 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.440
 than the amount of data stored in the cloud 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.449
 the user will still have 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.969
 full access to solve the problem 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.039
 smart file system helps smart files 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.289
 look like regular files and folders they 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.210
 will have all their attributes but occupy 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.739
 much less space for example 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.690
 if you have a large collection of photos 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.190
 in the cloud then the hard disk will 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.230
 stored their miniatures 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.359
 and if you need a full photo then 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.199
 when opened, it will be quickly loaded 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.609
 from storage 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.469
 the same goes for the most 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.969
 common office formats 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.580
 documents for instant access 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.950
 smart files are created containing only 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.900
 piece of information 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.030
 skype continues to evolve and next 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.820
 stage of development will be the offset from 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.490
 habitual architecture of the roosters system . . 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.259
 towards cloud services as well as 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.970

 performing part of a function by 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.750
 cloud services will unload the processor 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.030
 mobile device which in turn 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.009
 will help save the battery charge of the gadget 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.840
