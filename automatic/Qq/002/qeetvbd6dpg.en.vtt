for<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.370> think<00:03:31.410> two<00:03:32.410> almost<00:03:32.800> three<00:03:33.100> hours<00:03:33.730> at

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
for I think two almost three hours at

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.050 
for I think two almost three hours at
this<00:03:34.330> point<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:36.280> was<00:03:36.400> such<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.580> cute<00:03:36.820> color

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
this point and it was such a cute color

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.390 
this point and it was such a cute color
and<00:03:38.020> so<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.320> looks<00:03:38.500> like<00:03:38.560> my<00:03:38.950> hair<00:03:39.190> had

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
and so it looks like my hair had

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.310 
and so it looks like my hair had
actually<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.420> color<00:03:40.600> actually<00:03:41.050> really

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
actually like the color actually really

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.650 
actually like the color actually really
stuck<00:03:41.710> to<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.980> hair<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.030> was<00:03:43.240> really<00:03:43.390> happy

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
stuck to the hair so I was really happy

looks<00:04:00.640> like<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.820> sunset<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:01.960> I<00:04:01.990> guess<00:04:02.290> my<00:04:02.500> hair

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
looks like a sunset so I guess my hair

looks like a sunset so I guess my hair
looks<00:04:02.920> like<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.100> sunset<00:04:03.460> now<00:04:03.940> who<00:04:04.180> would<00:04:04.390> have

looks like a sunset now who would have

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.630 
looks like a sunset now who would have
thought<00:04:04.720> yeah<00:04:05.110> that's<00:04:05.440> kind<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:05.980> why<00:04:06.190> my<00:04:06.430> hair

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
thought yeah that's kind of why my hair

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.960 
thought yeah that's kind of why my hair
turned<00:04:06.910> into<00:04:07.200> it's<00:04:08.200> quite<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.100> process<00:04:09.250> next

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
turned into it's quite the process next

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.010 
turned into it's quite the process next
time<00:04:10.120> I'm<00:04:10.180> gonna<00:04:10.300> be<00:04:10.420> putting<00:04:10.600> quite<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.870> bit

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
time I'm gonna be putting quite a bit

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.860 
time I'm gonna be putting quite a bit
more<00:04:11.140> pink<00:04:11.410> dye<00:04:11.590> into<00:04:11.980> my<00:04:12.100> mixture<00:04:12.430> I

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
more pink dye into my mixture I

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.760 
more pink dye into my mixture I
definitely<00:04:13.870> am<00:04:13.960> gonna<00:04:14.080> begin<00:04:14.380> a<00:04:14.470> different

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
definitely am gonna begin a different

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.199 
definitely am gonna begin a different
brand<00:04:14.950> because<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.490> do<00:04:15.550> believe<00:04:15.910> that<00:04:15.940> this

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
brand because I do believe that this

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.560 
brand because I do believe that this
enriched<00:04:16.600> color<00:04:16.900> washes<00:04:17.170> right<00:04:17.650> out<00:04:18.570> leaving

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
enriched color washes right out leaving

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.570 
enriched color washes right out leaving
something<00:04:19.900> in<00:04:20.080> for<00:04:20.260> two<00:04:20.470> hours<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.100> having<00:04:21.459> it

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
something in for two hours and having it

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.060 
something in for two hours and having it
wash<00:04:21.760> out<00:04:22.000> is<00:04:22.180> ridiculous<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.800> purple<00:04:24.040> I

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
wash out is ridiculous and the purple I

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.520 
wash out is ridiculous and the purple I
use<00:04:24.340> is<00:04:24.580> my<00:04:24.790> usual<00:04:24.970> funky<00:04:25.419> colors<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.020> violet

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
use is my usual funky colors and violet

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.290 
use is my usual funky colors and violet
I<00:04:26.650> love<00:04:26.919> that<00:04:27.130> purple<00:04:27.430> dye<00:04:27.550> I've<00:04:27.790> been<00:04:27.940> used<00:04:28.120> it

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
I love that purple dye I've been used it

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.230 
I love that purple dye I've been used it
for<00:04:28.480> almost<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.810> year<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.290> it's<00:04:30.100> amazing<00:04:31.030> I

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
for almost a year and it's amazing I

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.430 
for almost a year and it's amazing I
love<00:04:31.450> it

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
love it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.980 
love it
I<00:04:32.470> think<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.340> reason<00:04:33.610> why<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.970> stuck<00:04:34.750> better

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
I think the reason why that stuck better

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.950 
I think the reason why that stuck better
is<00:04:35.169> because<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.880> funky<00:04:36.880> colors<00:04:37.150> but<00:04:37.750> it

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
is because of the funky colors but it

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.420 
is because of the funky colors but it
washed<00:04:38.230> out<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.530> bit<00:04:38.710> more<00:04:38.860> because<00:04:39.010> it<00:04:39.250> was

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
washed out a bit more because it was

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.880 
washed out a bit more because it was
mixed<00:04:39.760> with<00:04:39.940> this<00:04:40.390> Pink's<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.440> don't

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
mixed with this Pink's I don't

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.140 
mixed with this Pink's I don't
recommend<00:04:42.100> this<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.520> think<00:04:42.700> next<00:04:42.850> time<00:04:43.000> I'm

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
recommend this I think next time I'm

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.210 
recommend this I think next time I'm
gonna<00:04:43.240> be<00:04:43.330> drying<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.780> Manic<00:04:44.110> Panic<00:04:44.230> cotton

starting to fade out again like this dye

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.770 
starting to fade out again like this dye
sucks<00:04:59.950> that's<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.760> process<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.419> went<00:05:01.630> through

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
sucks that's the process I went through

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.990 
sucks that's the process I went through
to<00:05:01.900> get<00:05:02.020> my<00:05:02.200> pink<00:05:02.500> hair<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:03.010> know<00:05:03.070> it's<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.910> was

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
to get my pink hair I know it's it was

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.210 
to get my pink hair I know it's it was
just<00:05:04.210> so<00:05:04.330> stupid<00:05:04.690> process<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.100> usually

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
just so stupid process and it usually

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.800 
just so stupid process and it usually
shouldn't<00:05:06.700> be<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:06.940> difficult<00:05:06.970> but<00:05:07.690> it<00:05:07.780> was

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
shouldn't be that difficult but it was

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.550 
shouldn't be that difficult but it was
pretty<00:05:08.140> difficult<00:05:08.730> if<00:05:09.730> you<00:05:10.480> guys<00:05:10.630> have<00:05:11.350> any

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
pretty difficult if you guys have any

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.290 
pretty difficult if you guys have any
suggestions<00:05:12.040> for<00:05:12.280> which<00:05:12.580> dyes<00:05:12.820> that<00:05:13.030> she<00:05:13.210> is

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300
