00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
it to my t2i

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.430 
it to my t2i
the<00:00:55.789> way<00:00:55.909> it<00:00:56.059> locks<00:00:56.299> or<00:00:56.659> the<00:00:56.719> mechanism<00:00:57.289> that

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
the way it locks or the mechanism that

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.009 
the way it locks or the mechanism that
locks<00:00:57.679> it<00:00:57.949> in<00:00:58.039> place<00:00:58.069> is<00:00:58.549> essentially<00:00:59.030> it's<00:00:59.749> a

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
locks it in place is essentially it's a

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.410 
locks it in place is essentially it's a
screw<00:01:00.350> that's<00:01:00.589> built<00:01:00.859> into<00:01:01.069> the<00:01:01.309> top<00:01:01.519> of<00:01:01.819> the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
screw that's built into the top of the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.510 
screw that's built into the top of the
the<00:01:05.420> battery<00:01:05.720> grip<00:01:05.870> itself<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.680> removes

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
the battery grip itself and it removes

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.300 
the battery grip itself and it removes
so<00:01:07.939> I'll<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:08.210> unlock<00:01:08.600> this<00:01:08.810> real<00:01:08.990> quick<00:01:09.310> so

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
so I'll just unlock this real quick so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.370 
so I'll just unlock this real quick so
you<00:01:10.340> just<00:01:10.579> remove<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:10.969> this<00:01:11.119> way<00:01:14.049> it<00:01:15.049> slides

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
you just remove it this way it slides

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.550

it's lasted me a long long time it's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.789 
it's lasted me a long long time it's
fantastic<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:49.160> other<00:02:49.579> part<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.560> when<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.590> use

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
fantastic the other part is when I use

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.550 
fantastic the other part is when I use
the<00:02:51.950> t2i<00:02:52.690> without<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.870> battery<00:02:54.230> grip

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the t2i without the battery grip

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.069 
the t2i without the battery grip
something<00:02:55.489> about<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> balance<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.690> the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
something about the balance of the the

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.849 
something about the balance of the the
camera<00:02:57.500> itself<00:02:57.890> felt<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.670> little<00:02:58.879> off<00:02:59.680> not<00:03:00.680> to

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
camera itself felt a little off not to

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.080 
camera itself felt a little off not to
the<00:03:00.950> point<00:03:01.129> where<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.280> don't<00:03:01.340> like<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:01.700> camera

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
the point where I don't like the camera

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.670 
the point where I don't like the camera
are<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.269> gonna<00:03:02.390> throw<00:03:02.629> it<00:03:02.750> away<00:03:02.780> or<00:03:03.200> sell<00:03:03.500> it

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
are we gonna throw it away or sell it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.440 
are we gonna throw it away or sell it
because<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.129> was<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.849> know<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:04.970> deal<00:03:05.209> breaker

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
because it was you know a deal breaker

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.030 
because it was you know a deal breaker
but<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.930> was<00:03:06.019> just<00:03:06.170> felt<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.590> little<00:03:06.709> different

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
but it was just felt a little different

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.690 
but it was just felt a little different
right<00:03:07.430> when<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.180> add<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:09.109> Canon<00:03:09.700> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
right when I add the the Canon the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.580 
right when I add the the Canon the
battery<00:03:11.030> grip<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.019> just<00:03:12.200> put<00:03:12.379> on<00:03:12.470> the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
battery grip to it and I just put on the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.069 
battery grip to it and I just put on the
wrist<00:03:12.769> grip<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.640> feels<00:03:14.000> much<00:03:14.299> more<00:03:14.480> balanced

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
wrist grip it feels much more balanced

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.660 
wrist grip it feels much more balanced
in<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.319> hand<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.739> does<00:03:15.920> add<00:03:16.099> a<00:03:16.129> little<00:03:16.400> bit<00:03:16.579> of

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
in the hand it does add a little bit of

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.640 
in the hand it does add a little bit of
weight<00:03:16.790> obviously<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.540> it's<00:03:18.290> fantastic

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
weight obviously but it's fantastic

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.789 
weight obviously but it's fantastic
because<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.519> fits<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.909> hand<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.109> offers

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
because it fits the hand and it offers

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.580 
because it fits the hand and it offers
the<00:03:21.889> camera<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.370> nice<00:03:22.700> feel<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.900> balance<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.470> it

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
the camera a nice feel and balance to it

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.110 
the camera a nice feel and balance to it
even<00:03:24.889> with<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.099> kit<00:03:25.310> lens<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.669> I<00:03:25.730> have<00:03:25.910> the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
even with the kit lens that I have the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.020 
even with the kit lens that I have the
1855<00:03:26.660> right<00:03:27.049> now<00:03:27.200> I've<00:03:27.950> added<00:03:28.599> a<00:03:30.849> 70-200<00:03:31.849> lens

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
1855 right now I've added a 70-200 lens

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.190 
1855 right now I've added a 70-200 lens
to<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.599> it<00:03:33.139> feels<00:03:34.000> even<00:03:35.000> better<00:03:35.450> because

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
to this and it feels even better because

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.140 
to this and it feels even better because
the<00:03:36.410> weight<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.859> lens<00:03:37.099> no<00:03:37.459> longer<00:03:37.849> feels

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
the weight of the lens no longer feels

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.240 
the weight of the lens no longer feels
like<00:03:38.239> it's<00:03:38.480> weighing<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.989> down<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:40.129> know

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
like it's weighing it down to you know

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.400 
like it's weighing it down to you know
head<00:03:40.609> forward<00:03:41.150> it's<00:03:41.629> much<00:03:41.870> more<00:03:42.019> balanced

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
head forward it's much more balanced

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.509 
head forward it's much more balanced
because<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:42.859> added<00:03:43.160> weight<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.430> this

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
because that added weight of this

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.550 
because that added weight of this
battery<00:03:43.819> grip<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.660> gives<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:45.049> a<00:03:45.139> sturdy

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
battery grip and it gives it a sturdy

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.300 
battery grip and it gives it a sturdy
feel<00:03:45.919> and<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.669> like<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.919> but<00:03:48.919> other<00:03:49.069> than<00:03:49.190> that

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
feel and I like it but other than that
