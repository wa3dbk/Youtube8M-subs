00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello there are new arrivals that was 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.740
 wrong there are new phenomena again 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.200
 of course in the next month what would be one 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.300
 month without book new releases 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.040
 but I have picked out the top 5 here 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.440
 the ones that interest me the most 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 or where I believe that you on 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.500
 Most interested as always halt and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.680
 I think that's the first month where 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.080
 just certainly not what the top 5 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.090
 only one book does not rank 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.279
 Continuation is and the facilities are 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.130
 all parts but where i am 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.260
 think that they are great and had 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.300
 interesting or him for me completely 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.440
 especially ok, we start with that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.129
 I believe the book the most 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.370
 is expected nothing month in February is 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 the elite the second part of selection 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 kiev's budget is already there 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.250
 as in English is already 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.770
 I think this may be april in may 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.059
 may have come out in england i have it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.739
 So already read by the whole time 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.290
 I'm just waiting eagerly now 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.299
 The third volume I believe in March 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.150
 comes out or something if I did not 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.310
 sure but or in june somehow 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.990
 anyhow still a while back 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.240
 but in German now appears the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 second when the elite of the action 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 So, buy it and really buy it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.880
 if you liked the first bank 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.259
 buy the second event is not 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.970
 regret it is just right 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.610
 Well the story is totally fantastic 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.439
 Next and I was just totally 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.170
 excited about the second band as well 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.759
 like from the first band so come out 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.759
 in february writes behind the ears 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.250
 I'm sorry but I will 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.790
 not now i will do it again 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.070
 then start the second part 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.159
 of fire and glass of brigitte riebe 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.960
 and is called the conspiracy 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.000
 that was fire and glass the pact of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.229
 brigitte rubbed and that came out before 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.719
 I went to england 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.009
 that means it has to be well before two 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.509
 years have come out and me 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.950
 Personally, I personally think it's one 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.040
 insolence for so long with the second volume 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.590
 to wait because then you lose too 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.240
 easy 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.739
 The address I want to continue anyway 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.899
 yes read the first band not now 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.129
 I liked it so much because I somehow 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.540
 really knew what that one 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.819
 should be history should fantasy 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.440
 history should be 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.019
 be historical roman what is that 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.879
 she really wants me really well 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.780
 not liked but still curious 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.569
 in second place 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.010
 I copy it as a recessions 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.260
 inquire and if it does not get then 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.879
 I do not buy myself as I said 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.099
 just think it's really outrageous 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.269
 two years to wait because I believe 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.840
 it has meantime 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.489
 other books still published and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.579
 I do not quite know 5 time somehow 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.989
 stupid if you write books then 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.269
 April so stops a first part 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.489
 makes it and then the reader 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.829
 no second part can deliver in one 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.060
 at least in the time he is still 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.799
 batchwise to the history in 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.060
 can I can still very rough because 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.989
 so i could really remember it 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.180
 But still so together piece but so 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.829
 I'm not really in it anymore and 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.030
 Well, at least the second one appears there 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.519
 Maybe someone has one of you 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.500
 just read at 1 and then 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.500
 also appears the second part of the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.120
 mojang's longest heart stone is this 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.930
 same is the first band already 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.130
 at least one and a half two years ago and 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.180
 I just can not do that anymore 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.590
 do not remember history I know too 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.630
 that the brother of the protagonist 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.010
 was kidnapped and then the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.819
 went off and then something was in 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.799
 an arena 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.120
 I think I fought your son and 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.319
 something with the desert was, I think 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.720
 but that too with one 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.280
 dry lake or something like that 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.239
 also everything I know and that 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.639
 can the same sister as 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.010
 review copies if this time 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.840
 I am looking forward to reading, even if I am 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.250
 not then I do not buy me then 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.720
 maybe someday I'll see if 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.940
 I get that cheap on ebay or 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.530
 but so am I not ready 20 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.630
 spend euro 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.310
 so often that I had to wait two years 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.230
 and where I forgot again 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.079
 But in any event, so come that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.060
 lenz der hartstein part 2 out and then 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.919
 These are the three books or two books 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.970
 I'm interested in us I 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.989
 already read but you 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.019
 interested and now come two more 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.940
 books that might interest you 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.240
 I think because it is very much a lot 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.470
 Known the other 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.840
 I am beautiful on that 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.030
 take care of every case and that one 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.459
 his book is the third part of amy 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.800
 plan in the plan is the plan with this 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.400
 beautiful purple and green I believe 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.200
 covers 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.330
 I do not know how the first band 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.930
 but the third one is called now by 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.460
 kissed the stars and if you are now 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.140
 no image before eyes there are just times 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.350
 a nanny disgrace immediately know that 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.240
 it in this magical haunted 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.490
 cover somehow and there comes the third 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.280
 Part out in february on which the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.480
 I think a lot of waiting 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.010
 I did not start with the series 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.980
 do not even pretend it's not like that 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:53.810
 my theme is necessarily now in the moment 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.610
 wait, I got a message 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.030
 sorry i thought you will 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.980
 really that's out and then comes 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.990
 a book and that's the one of mine 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.690
 mine that I'm in any case 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.090
 will buy or request or something 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.560
 but it's a love story of me 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.290
 just totally responsive or as a 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.750
 fate dear thing and indeed 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.740
 that means forever and a day and is 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.540
 from a blog 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.850
 yes and that is a story of 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.010
 Klappentext says stop that at this 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.400
 virgin the protagonist and like me 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.490
 think cancer or brain cancer something like that 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.490
 is forecasted 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.410
 and she has another year to live and 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.340
 She begins a book viewer diary 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.290
 to write or somehow theirs 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.280
 to stick with thoughts in any case 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.450
 the things they actually still 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.180
 I want to experience that she is a woman 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.440
 i think 29 still very young and 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.030
 Of course you are the kindermann 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.530
 grandchildren want to see children grow up 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.020
 World see everything that she writes 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.280
 that everything goes on and on and on 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.650
 more and more things in fulfillment 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.110
 somehow and I think that sounds like that 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.620
 nice and it cover of the book is too 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.330
 so beautiful and yes that's mine 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.980
 History appeals to me very much 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.500
 will get me determined 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.870
 And these are the five books of this top 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.670
 5 new releases film 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.280
 february and then I still have 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.710
 which books are written on which 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.850
 parts of any rows 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.040
 They do not appear to me now 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.480
 I may not appeal 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.890
 know i know i think yes i know 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.380
 I heard from two and the rest 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.410
 I am completely alien but there always 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.270
 very informed now very fast 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.450
 in the grip as it appears the second 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.970
 Part of the heart in the heart tears in the 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.260
 hearts of wrath or in heart the race 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.490
 unbelievable heart revenge and im 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.740
 hearts of anger or something 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.610
 in the heart now seems the second 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.710
 part then appears from the hunters 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:55.210

 how many millions of books, there are of them 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.650

 those are thousands of books, this gives 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.030
