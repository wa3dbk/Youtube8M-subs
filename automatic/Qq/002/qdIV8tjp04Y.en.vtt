00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Ronja we have a winner video for 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.920
 the clever promised but you do 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.600
 now advertising 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.610
 I am an engineer and collection of facts 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.710
 Here thomas writes us that we 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.309
 accidentally a h2 is shown high there 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 to have 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.949
 I change the graphics facts today 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.560
 it's about the following storage space in the clever 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.570
 maxi kids the special fridge the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.910
 weird kitchen safety technology 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.550
 special features and to vehicle and 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.550
 accessories price thank you for the new roof 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.760
 now it fits the exhibition vehicle 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.640
 The storage space under the bed includes more 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.500
 than 400 liters when you bed and that 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.500
 Schott front out takes even more 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.899
 even in the bathroom 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.480
 you get a lot below above the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.680
 cab is a lot of space for example 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.180
 for jackets and over the table on whole 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.030
 width also the 145 liter fridge 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.580
 We already mentioned the narrow one 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.750
 design has cleverly developed itself there 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.750
 Fits and a lot of cool beer 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.000
 Again, this kitchen is watching us 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.000
 take a closer look 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.720
 above are pretty big ones 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.720
 jam fan 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.539
 I wanted to know it exactly and that's why 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.429
 I asked the seller if that 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:53.270
 with the kitchen is quite impractical 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.679
 they are mounted here in the square because 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 it in the hectic of the fair preparation 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:02.119
 because there were problems with the tool thought 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.849
 I should be the hearth, actually 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.039
 are to the left and the faucet will 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.039
 then mounted in the far right corner 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 now for safety 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.269
 you pull these kid-friendly stairs 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.970
 forward she is so nothing in the 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.440
 away if you do not need them and 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.049
 behind the standard bench is that 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.849
 additional bed board but more interesting 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.560
 are the straps look good 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.580
 Locks are in so tilt the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.260
 child seats just not outward 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.360
 other special features made me clever 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.180
 boss better then explained in interview 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.120
 hardly on supporting frame windows the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.420
 even strengthen the body and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.590
 furniture installed all 15 instead of 12 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.750
 mm thick 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.400
 the cabinets are no longer accurate 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:58.690
 therefore a standard lit 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.030
 rain wages as well and an insulation the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.459
 No water draws so the Baden was 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.200
 just the opposite, more like a like 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.470
 fly in but just closed 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.440
 pores and not together and then 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.760
 then we came to the price question 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.690
 the car was with distance on 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.910
 best 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.489
 next to and that's what I have him on the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.030
 Head pledged there is hardly too 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.030
 belong in it 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.650
 then he showed me the two packages that 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.430
 First, I think the second is great 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.400
 pure luxury 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.889
 why is the climate the ronja manually 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.620
 no jokes please that are tangible 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.750
 technician there, the language is secondary 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.030
 they build good cars but they have 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.620
 unfortunately bad marketing better than 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.180
 vice versa 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.700
 what can be recommended from the catalog 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.409
 is the pilot's bench there can be 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.500
 even the two are sitting apart 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.620
 Back on travel pleasant and the 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.019
 green details are already in the cover 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.930
 included in the comparison price and then 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.060
 I clearly leafed through a boss bigger than 10,000 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.329
 euro on the table 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.730
 yes and as 20 books at 500 euro each 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.970
 worth and what is there for it 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.970
 he said if he had at least five chambers 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.700
 gets sold for 5 in five months 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.459
 Each buyer will pay 500 Euro as a coupon for 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.470
 accessories great and what you want now that 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.710
 I do not need them but I give them 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.479
 happy to be interested in you further 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.120
 not a clever one now but a bad one 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.220
 to have bought revo no you know 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.389
 I like our long beds clearly 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.479
 your two meters 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.900
 yes and at the cmt in stuttgart there are 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.440
 by the way, also with 1 636 car 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.440
 long ago
