00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.940
 Hello 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.660
 if the rat 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.890
 hydrostatic blooded 2 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:23.930
 urs and berna the frontal cut of 85 cm 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:27.310
 donkey lÃ¼tschine the case earth does not 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.990
 do not fall like on the braiding rider 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.390
 To clean it, you need the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.850
 disassemble using a groupie that I 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:42.830
 will try to show you who is 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:46.070
 find it pretty much in the center I do not know 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.469
 if you get to the lane then 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.329
 more with a frontal cut is 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.210
 that we can go under the bus 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:01:00.469
 we see where we go and the wheels are 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:05.539
 behind so we do not crush the grass at 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:08.810
 passage the cutting height is set 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:14.390
 directly on the crankcase that is 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:18.440
 graduated from 1 to 6 and the housing is in 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.289
 steel then at the level of orders all 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.130
 is simple you have the accelerator that 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:30.679
 is the man the joystick to get off the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.220
 plateau so we see everything is within reach 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.440
 from the hand 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.440
 it's really easy to use 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.760
 so 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.460
 advantage with the static hydra is that 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.180
 you have no speed has passed you 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.780
 just have a pedal to move forward 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.940
 back away so you save time and the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.340
 third who's right here it's just 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:00.150
 the brake that's going to end now on 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:11.140
 the engine behind us 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:17.160
 so that is easy to access so it's 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:22.380
 a stratton he makes 9 horses 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.320
 the gas tank that is here 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:33.520
 which contains it 8 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:38.260
 the rider weighs 165 kg and we can go to 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:42.459
 a speed of 7 km hour so there is no 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.660
 of risk to be flashed so 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.450
 listen I'll leave you 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:54.070
 and I'll give you a video as soon as the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:59.140
 cutting season will be started for you 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.350
 show the rider in action at 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.350
 soon
