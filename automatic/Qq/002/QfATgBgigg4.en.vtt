00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.730
 hey dear friends and welcome to 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.490
 a new hunger games video for you 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.870
 I do not play live here but that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.210
 a round which was taken sometime 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.600
 have since I have played with them 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.520
 The round is just as I said not live 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.290
 So say play I should her 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.770
 Just watch the gameplay in the background 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.090
 that is a map from the bhd server but 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.180
 that's why I know an older round 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.820
 not if the web is still yes yes yes 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.980
 So it would have to be on servers 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.420
 see for yourself 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.789
 otherwise I'll just say it 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.370
 Have fun and usually look 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.949
 would have something striking and indeed 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.649
 if you see the video at 11.30 or 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.629
 or so around the rotation around there is namely 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.629
 you have to be online 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.989
 ask where is I say 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.890
 the sap and although this video is here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.070
 a small replacement for the discount because 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.190
 I wanted to enter after 100 years 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 make super great peschl or one 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.220
 Special consequence is the following 100 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.000
 you will always be yourself 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.369
 definitely wants to formulate 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 this special or this special episode 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.770
 to do something with the sas 2.0 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.729
 and yes, unfortunately, the first time on the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:33.060
 14.2 minecraft version resp 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.680
 been updated to rss 2.0 so yes 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.350
 I'm just waiting for that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 first update is or the esam update 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.219
 Anyway, and if that is the case 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.609
 there is also the case 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:47.850
 hundredth episode in time you have to 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:51.060
 unfortunately wait or that is here 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.030
 such a small survey at the same time 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.039
 you can decide that 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.969
 Do you want me to wait with you now? 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.829
 the appearance of the acer 2.0 soder the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.899
 version for 14.2 like yourself 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.340
 he wanted to say that I wanted to 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.469
 Wait and then in addition to follow that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.470
 Laundry makes or tells you that I am 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:14.070
 now rather easy to follow on 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.680
 should do and then just follow 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.390
 because of me at 101 then because so off 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.510
 and works numbering or simply 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.819
 quite normal with 100 the second number 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.750
 No matter in any case wanted 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.459
 that keeps going and yes the whole thing 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.170
 eat every day and then if 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.150
 then the moral preaching will say that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.790
 According to 100, we are simply in the form of one 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.769
 specials comes or would be 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.599
 you say no nee I'm waiting for the dogs 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.170
 Follow this to become something very special 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.340
 yes, because I would want it too, I want it 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.599
 not really affect me though 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.700
 I just want to make it that way 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.480
 continues normally and someday 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.220
 as a separate special high because the starting 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.620
 which in the st notker still quite a long time 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.250
 last because the developer has too 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.049
 nothing exactly announced and yes that 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.420
 the first ever has been adapted 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:07.040
 the 1.0.0 so since the full version of 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.690
 minecraft is also pretty long 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.739
 It was also very early on 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.549
 unlikely that anyone at all 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:17.420
 is saved and that is why 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.090
 Just look what you prefer 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.269
 either dispense and someday that 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.910
 update out comes the whole following 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.230
 seen in doubt or simply completely 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.639
 continue normally 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.889
 with the sls play and then when the 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.810
 According to them, and then 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.310
 will someday be the eater 200 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.500
 It is known for the outside 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.530
 minecraft version 1.4 point two or 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.699
 Maybe then there will always be yes 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.980
 I will then make the example video 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:46.280
 So there are the two possibilities 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.410
 either continue or wait until the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.389
 first update will be and i just had it 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.410
 that 's how it was here from now on 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.419
 Video 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.660
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.680
 I want to say that Japan simply enters 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.169
 Of course there are others 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.940
 videos and yes I hope you can then 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.010
 today a day without it out 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.480
 come good for me say connoisseur 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.760
 I want to see it 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.329
 and I just like that until the next one 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.530
 times 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.530
 ciao people
