problem<00:02:16.360> with<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> game<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.230> story

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
problem with the game is that the story

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.500 
problem with the game is that the story
is<00:02:17.739> just<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.220> little<00:02:18.489> too<00:02:18.670> obtuse<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.269> its<00:02:19.360> own

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
is just a little too obtuse for its own

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.960 
is just a little too obtuse for its own
good<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.409> to<00:02:20.530> pay<00:02:20.769> really<00:02:21.280> really<00:02:21.760> close

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
good you have to pay really really close

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.520 
good you have to pay really really close
attention<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.540> pick<00:02:22.810> up<00:02:22.930> everything<00:02:23.230> that's

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
attention to pick up everything that's

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.949 
attention to pick up everything that's
going<00:02:23.860> on<00:02:24.010> inside<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.909> plot<00:02:25.150> but<00:02:25.540> if<00:02:25.659> you<00:02:25.780> do

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
going on inside the plot but if you do

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.780 
going on inside the plot but if you do
it's<00:02:26.319> kind<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> worth<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.159> end<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
it's kind of worth it in the end and the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.550 
it's kind of worth it in the end and the
upcoming<00:02:28.060> DLC<00:02:28.269> looks<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.930> shed<00:02:29.110> more<00:02:29.260> light<00:02:29.319> on

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560

upcoming DLC looks to shed more light on
it<00:02:29.830> another<00:02:30.430> kind<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.819> problem<00:02:31.090> with<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.269> plot

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
it another kind of problem with the plot

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.149 
it another kind of problem with the plot
is<00:02:31.629> that<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.930> voice<00:02:32.110> acting<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.680> pretty

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
is that the voice acting is pretty

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.949 
is that the voice acting is pretty
shoddy<00:02:33.549> in<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:33.909> game<00:02:34.120> it's<00:02:34.329> like<00:02:34.659> on<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
shoddy in this game it's like on the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.800 
shoddy in this game it's like on the
level<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.409> safe<00:02:35.680> house<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.459> dead<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:37.030> this

level of safe house of the dead for this

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.330 
level of safe house of the dead for this
is<00:02:37.930> kind<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.200> surprising<00:02:38.319> considering<00:02:39.129> that

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
is kind of surprising considering that

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.399 
is kind of surprising considering that
