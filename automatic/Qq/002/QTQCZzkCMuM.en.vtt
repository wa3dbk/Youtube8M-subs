00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.960 

there's<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.710> think<00:04:26.009> I<00:04:26.069> did<00:04:26.250> great<00:04:26.490> job<00:04:26.669> on<00:04:26.849> this

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
there's I think I did great job on this

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.020 
there's I think I did great job on this
figure<00:04:27.210> especially<00:04:27.780> on<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.020> body<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:30.120> yeah

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
figure especially on the body so yeah

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.140 
figure especially on the body so yeah
and<00:04:33.620> here<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:34.830> one<00:04:35.280> machine<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:35.849> is<00:04:36.000> also

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
and here is one machine this is also

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.499 
and here is one machine this is also
done<00:04:36.449> by<00:04:36.479> Lego<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:38.000> think<00:04:39.000> they<00:04:39.120> did<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.449> really

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
done by Lego I think they did a really

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.770 
done by Lego I think they did a really
decent<00:04:39.810> job<00:04:40.169> on<00:04:40.199> this<00:04:41.060> but<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.389> don't

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
decent job on this but I don't

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.990 
decent job on this but I don't
understand<00:04:43.380> why<00:04:43.530> they<00:04:43.740> put<00:04:44.009> him<00:04:44.130> in<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.580> set

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
understand why they put him in that set

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.120 
understand why they put him in that set
because<00:04:45.419> he's<00:04:46.020> not<00:04:46.319> in<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:47.069> movie<00:04:47.430> at<00:04:47.699> all

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
because he's not in the movie at all

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.830 
because he's not in the movie at all
well<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.250> war<00:04:50.639> machine<00:04:51.000> armor<00:04:51.180> isn't<00:04:51.509> at

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
well the war machine armor isn't at

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.029 
well the war machine armor isn't at
least<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:53.659> so<00:04:54.659> I<00:04:54.690> added<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.259> piece<00:04:55.530> it's<00:04:55.770> not

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
least I so I added this piece it's not

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.950 
least I so I added this piece it's not
actually<00:04:56.490> as<00:04:56.729> long<00:04:56.789> as<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:57.569> I<00:04:57.599> added

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
actually as long as that but I added

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.779 
actually as long as that but I added
there<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.289> there<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:58.889> it<00:04:59.130> could<00:04:59.220> be<00:04:59.370> longer

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
there on there so it could be longer

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.800 
there on there so it could be longer
