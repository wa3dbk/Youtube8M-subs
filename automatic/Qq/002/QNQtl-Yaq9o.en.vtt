00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.190
 hi friends and friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.180
 teach to do something very very easy that 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.070
 is on the network lately that 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.559
 they are doing amounts that are the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.980
 owls if I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.929
 owl very easy this with molds that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.329
 I found it is very easy 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.170
 so I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.440
 to do 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.800
 they are going to cut the mold if between the 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.550
 double the cove we have going to leave one 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.370
 small opening down here come and for 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.280
 here we are going to turn and we are going to 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.960
 fill it in the meantime let's have 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.440
 ready with this mold the little one if 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.440
 is this let's have a circle of 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.100
 seven centimeters let's cut the base 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 of the white eye and let's cut the part 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.170
 round four centimeters 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.140
 simply with this now we are going to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.409
 put together easily what we are going to do 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.260
 is we grab the circles we paste one 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.850
 on the other they can hit it with a gun 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.890
 or you can sew them and as you want 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.130
 either of the two options is fine 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.570
 and they are going to put first they are going to present 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.500
 the little eyes if there and the little one are going to 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 put down 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:33.369
 they are going to present it and then they paste it and 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.469
 everything is ready our owls so that 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.909
 gift in series if they want more 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.929
 guys the only thing they have to do is 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.069
 shrink the molds on a form in a 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.929
 Photocopying ask you to be the 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.380
 bail and leave smaller can 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.289
 do the bunnies can do this 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.990
 bigger ones as they want too 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.539
 They can introduce bags if by 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.909
 have bags that make noise 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.099
 some bags not of these but those of the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.799
 candies saw and put you here 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:06.690
 then they squeeze it to make noise if it 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:11.780
 You can also put this one 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:15.180
 to vÃ©lez and bells but as I told you 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.210
 so they give easy easy and simple to 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.500
 use good I hope you liked it 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.600
 they do this might also be 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.130
 add if they want wings but as they 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.370
 I say this is the idea of doing something right 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.319
 fast and easy 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.260
 you can also add some pocket 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.150
 what they want good we see ourselves in the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.440
 next tutorial I hope they do and 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.440
 comment see you
