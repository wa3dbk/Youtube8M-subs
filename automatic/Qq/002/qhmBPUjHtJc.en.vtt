00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
doing a little research I've discovered

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.160

apparently the blue light here blinking
is<00:01:02.909> basically<00:01:03.909> the<00:01:04.149> equivalent<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:05.830> red

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
is basically the equivalent of the red

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.130 
is basically the equivalent of the red
ring<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.340> death<00:01:06.399> or<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.539> yellow<00:01:07.840> ring<00:01:08.020> of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
death or yellow light or whatever on the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.850 
death or yellow light or whatever on the
ps3<00:01:09.850> water<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.690> ps3<00:01:11.080> had<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
ps3 water that the ps3 had so this is

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.900 
ps3 water that the ps3 had so this is
apparently<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.340> blue<00:01:15.550> light<00:01:15.759> of<00:01:15.789> death<00:01:17.910> I've

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
back from them hopefully they can fix it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.010 
back from them hopefully they can fix it
because<00:01:39.970> your<00:01:40.179> account<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.599> tied<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.929> the

because your account is tied to the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
system so if they give me a new system

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.029 
system so if they give me a new system
I'd<00:01:43.840> have<00:01:43.989> to<00:01:44.080> create<00:01:44.289> a<00:01:44.349> new<00:01:44.440> account<00:01:44.739> I'd

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
I'd have to create a new account I'd

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.080 
I'd have to create a new account I'd
lose<00:01:45.190> all<00:01:45.310> my<00:01:45.459> save<00:01:45.759> data<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.640> would<00:01:48.819> just

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
lose all my save data that would just

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.620
