00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
impacting the surrounding area the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.310 
impacting the surrounding area the
Mucklow<00:03:26.910> islands<00:03:27.270> they're<00:03:27.540> protected<00:03:28.170> sea

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
Mucklow islands they're protected sea

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.930 
Mucklow islands they're protected sea
bird<00:03:28.440> sanctuaries<00:03:28.950> out<00:03:29.100> there<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.490> what's

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
bird sanctuaries out there and what's

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.400 
bird sanctuaries out there and what's
protected<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.720> wedge-tailed<00:03:31.140> Shearwater

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
protected is the wedge-tailed Shearwater

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.290 
protected is the wedge-tailed Shearwater
it's<00:03:31.890> basically<00:03:32.250> their<00:03:32.460> nesting<00:03:32.790> ground<00:03:33.060> and

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
it's basically their nesting ground and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.540 
it's basically their nesting ground and
they<00:03:33.630> come<00:03:33.810> about<00:03:34.080> mid<00:03:34.290> spring<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.860> they<00:03:35.340> stay

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
they come about mid spring and they stay

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.640 
they come about mid spring and they stay
for<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.760> number<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.060> months<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:37.110> kind<00:03:37.560> of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
for a number of months and just kind of

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.920 
for a number of months and just kind of
build<00:03:38.070> their<00:03:38.280> nests<00:03:38.580> in<00:03:38.700> there<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.240> just<00:03:39.750> live

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
build their nests in there and just live

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.210 
build their nests in there and just live
in<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.110> protected<00:03:40.560> islands<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.100> they

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
in the protected islands you know they

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.560 
in the protected islands you know they
don't<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.550> worry<00:03:41.700> about<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.970> fire<00:03:42.180> ants

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
don't have to worry about the fire ants

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.330 
don't have to worry about the fire ants
and<00:03:42.780> mongoose<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.620> other<00:03:43.770> creatures<00:03:44.160> out

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
and mongoose and other creatures out

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.920 
and mongoose and other creatures out
there<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.700> reserve<00:03:44.970> specifically<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.810> them

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
there to reserve specifically for them

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.330 
there to reserve specifically for them
so<00:03:46.440> it's<00:03:46.560> one<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.800> main<00:03:46.950> things<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.250> you

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
so it's one of the main things that you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.890 
so it's one of the main things that you
get<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.610> see<00:03:47.760> out<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.030> mocha<00:03:48.180> lazar<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
get to see out the mocha lazar the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.380 
get to see out the mocha lazar the
wedge-tailed<00:03:49.350> Shearwater<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:50.910> guys<00:03:51.090> look<00:03:51.270> up

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
wedge-tailed Shearwater you guys look up

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.670 
wedge-tailed Shearwater you guys look up
you<00:03:51.510> can<00:03:51.630> kind<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.870> see<00:03:52.020> some<00:03:52.050> information<00:03:52.320> of

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
you can kind of see some information of

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.620 
you can kind of see some information of
the<00:03:52.740> island<00:03:53.040> up<00:03:53.130> here<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:54.060> there<00:03:54.210> we<00:03:54.390> do<00:03:54.510> our

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
the island up here and there we do our

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.270 
the island up here and there we do our
first<00:03:54.810> eco<00:03:55.200> hike<00:03:55.350> around<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:55.860> we<00:03:55.950> do<00:03:56.070> about<00:03:56.220> a

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
first eco hike around so we do about a

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.460 
first eco hike around so we do about a
20<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.760> 25<00:03:57.180> minute<00:03:57.480> hike<00:03:57.630> around<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.140> island

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
20 to 25 minute hike around that island

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.380 
20 to 25 minute hike around that island
and<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:59.220> look<00:03:59.370> for<00:03:59.520> rock<00:03:59.700> crabs<00:04:00.060> and

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
and you look for rock crabs and

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.910 
and you look for rock crabs and
different<00:04:00.660> varieties<00:04:01.020> of<00:04:01.050> fish<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.770> learn

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
different varieties of fish we learn

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.920 
different varieties of fish we learn
about<00:04:02.300> Volcanology<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.450> how<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.600> islands

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
about Volcanology and how the islands

about Volcanology and how the islands
were

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
were

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.440 
were
as<00:04:04.560> well<00:04:05.069> as<00:04:05.250> like<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.610> main<00:04:05.849> island<00:04:06.239> chain<00:04:06.420> in

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
as well as like the main island chain in

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.119 
as well as like the main island chain in
the<00:04:06.689> background<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.140> cola<00:04:07.379> Laos

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
see a lot of over here in the islands

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.310 
see a lot of over here in the islands
are<00:04:29.940> some<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.360> these<00:04:30.449> tide<00:04:30.720> pools<00:04:31.050> and

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
are some of these tide pools and

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.080 
are some of these tide pools and
shallows<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.400> what<00:04:32.550> we're<00:04:32.669> looking<00:04:32.760> at<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.060> a

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
shallows and what we're looking at is a

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.870 
shallows and what we're looking at is a
reef<00:04:33.270> blenny<00:04:33.600> it's<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.500> small<00:04:34.770> fish<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.100> gets

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
reef blenny it's a small fish that gets

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.120 
reef blenny it's a small fish that gets
trapped<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.389> these<00:04:36.479> pools<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.169> as<00:04:37.500> sometimes

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
trapped in these pools and as sometimes

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.650 
trapped in these pools and as sometimes
the<00:04:38.460> waves<00:04:38.669> come<00:04:38.940> during<00:04:39.150> certain<00:04:39.300> parts<00:04:39.479> of

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
the waves come during certain parts of

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.300 
the waves come during certain parts of
the<00:04:39.750> year<00:04:39.780> they'll<00:04:40.080> blast<00:04:40.229> over<00:04:40.620> here<00:04:40.860> will

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
the year they'll blast over here will

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.580 
the year they'll blast over here will
make<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> large<00:04:42.000> trickling<00:04:42.479> effect<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.080> it

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
make a large trickling effect and it

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.870 
make a large trickling effect and it
sounds<00:04:43.919> beautiful<00:04:44.100> know<00:04:44.520> what<00:04:44.610> these<00:04:44.699> fish

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
sounds beautiful know what these fish

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.340 
sounds beautiful know what these fish
can<00:04:45.060> do<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.389> they<00:04:45.479> can<00:04:45.600> hop<00:04:45.810> from<00:04:45.990> pool<00:04:46.199> to<00:04:46.229> pool

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
can do is they can hop from pool to pool

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.510 
can do is they can hop from pool to pool
until<00:04:46.800> they<00:04:46.860> find<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.100> place<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:47.400> they
