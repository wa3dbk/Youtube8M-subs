see<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.350> little<00:01:17.590> bit<00:01:17.799> I'm<00:01:18.039> literally<00:01:18.430> just

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
see a little bit I'm literally just

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.490 
see a little bit I'm literally just
taking<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.270> tip<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.600> my<00:01:19.780> brush<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.350> has<00:01:20.470> a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
taking the tip of my brush it has a

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.870 
taking the tip of my brush it has a
little<00:01:20.710> bit<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:20.950> nail<00:01:21.159> polish<00:01:21.369> I'm<00:01:21.670> just

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
little bit of nail polish I'm just

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.609 
little bit of nail polish I'm just
letting<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.240> down<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.750> all<00:01:23.170> those<00:01:23.350> four

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
letting it down and all those four

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.679 
letting it down and all those four
corners<00:01:24.100> if<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:25.149> doesn't<00:01:25.390> work<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.509> can

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
corners if that doesn't work you can

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:26.910 
corners if that doesn't work you can
actually<00:01:25.869> just<00:01:26.170> push<00:01:26.380> down<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.710> brush

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
actually just push down the brush

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.039 
actually just push down the brush
straight<00:01:27.340> down<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:28.270> creates<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.689> petal

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
straight down and that creates a petal

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.810 
straight down and that creates a petal
it's<00:01:29.259> going<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.500> be<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.590> bigger<00:01:29.770> pedal<00:01:30.220> but<00:01:30.670> that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
it's going to be a bigger pedal but that

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.040 
it's going to be a bigger pedal but that
still<00:01:31.000> works<00:01:31.270> like<00:01:31.659> I'm<00:01:31.810> doing<00:01:32.050> right<00:01:32.080> now<00:01:32.259> and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
still works like I'm doing right now and

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.600 
still works like I'm doing right now and
that<00:01:35.050> will<00:01:35.170> actually<00:01:35.319> also<00:01:35.830> work<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.490> it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
that will actually also work and it's

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.130 
that will actually also work and it's
like<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:36.759> stamp<00:01:37.119> kind<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.750> that's<00:01:43.899> what<00:01:44.049> it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
like a stamp kind of so that's what it

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.870 
like a stamp kind of so that's what it
looks<00:01:44.259> like<00:01:44.350> after<00:01:44.530> you're<00:01:44.830> done<00:01:44.950> now<00:01:45.220> to

single<00:01:56.170> petal

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.520 

so<00:02:05.030> if<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.300> nail<00:02:05.450> polish<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.900> not<00:02:06.050> dry<00:02:06.290> which

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
so if the nail polish is not dry which

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.380 
so if the nail polish is not dry which
mine<00:02:06.740> wasn't<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:07.520> actually<00:02:07.790> going<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.180> drag

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
mine wasn't it's actually going to drag

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.850 
mine wasn't it's actually going to drag
in<00:02:08.570> with<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> color<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.320> that's<00:02:09.440> perfectly

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
in with the color and that's perfectly

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.410 
in with the color and that's perfectly
fine<00:02:09.950> we'll<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.550> add<00:02:10.670> some<00:02:10.700> more<00:02:10.940> colors<00:02:11.240> to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
fine we'll just add some more colors to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.420 
fine we'll just add some more colors to
the<00:02:11.450> petals<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.050> it'll<00:02:12.890> actually<00:02:13.040> make<00:02:13.220> it

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the petals and it'll actually make it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.250 
the petals and it'll actually make it
easier<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.760> drag<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.210> but<00:02:14.810> if<00:02:15.020> you're<00:02:15.110> going<00:02:15.200> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
easier to drag in but if you're going to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.660 
easier to drag in but if you're going to
get<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.440> tip<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.950> you're<00:02:16.250> just<00:02:16.310> gonna<00:02:16.430> have<00:02:16.550> to

get a tip and you're just gonna have to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.550 
get a tip and you're just gonna have to
push<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.090> down<00:02:17.240> with<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.690> tube<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.140> my

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
create the same four petals and it's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.220 
create the same four petals and it's
okay<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:34.940> overlaps<00:02:35.209> with<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.690> pink<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.080> like

okay if it overlaps with the pink I like

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.990 
okay if it overlaps with the pink I like
it<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.410> way<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.400> want<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.610> put<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.850> as

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
it that way so you want to put it as

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.699 
it that way so you want to put it as
close<00:02:38.180> as<00:02:38.390> possible<00:02:41.410> after<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.530> you'll

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
close as possible after that you'll

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.020 
close as possible after that you'll
follow<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.160> same<00:02:43.340> steps<00:02:43.640> you're<00:02:43.790> going<00:02:43.940> to

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
follow the same steps you're going to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.910 
follow the same steps you're going to
take<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.270> two<00:02:44.450> pick<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.959> bring<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.380> all<00:02:45.590> four

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
take the two pick and bring in all four

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.140 
take the two pick and bring in all four
corners<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.490> guys<00:02:46.610> it's<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:46.880> little<00:02:47.060> bit

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
corners you guys it's a little bit

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.430 
corners you guys it's a little bit
better<00:02:47.360> how<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:47.930> creates<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.260> line

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
better how it just creates a line

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.350 
better how it just creates a line
through<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.130> petal<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.940> does<00:02:50.060> create<00:02:50.270> a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
through the petal it does create a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.820 
through the petal it does create a
little<00:02:50.570> bit<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.810> bump<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.320> center<00:02:51.800> but

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
little bit of a bump in the center but

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.860 
little bit of a bump in the center but
you<00:02:52.070> just<00:02:52.190> want<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.400> push<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.670> down<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.330> then

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
you just want to push it down and then

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.110 
you just want to push it down and then
you'll<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.440> pedal<00:02:54.709> center<00:02:55.070> that's<00:02:55.940> it

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
you'll have the pedal center that's it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.699 
you'll have the pedal center that's it
so<00:02:56.270> now<00:02:56.360> we're<00:02:56.480> going<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.630> go<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.080> white<00:02:57.350> and

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
so now we're going to go on to white and

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.890 
so now we're going to go on to white and
this<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.970> typical<00:02:59.180> white<00:02:59.510> color<00:02:59.750> and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
this is just a typical white color and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.120 
this is just a typical white color and
just<00:03:00.050> going<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.230> put<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.470> underneath<00:03:00.770> the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
just going to put it underneath the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.699 
just going to put it underneath the
green<00:03:01.850> as<00:03:02.090> close<00:03:02.570> as<00:03:02.720> possible<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.350> kind<00:03:03.650> of

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
green as close as possible and kind of

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.440 
green as close as possible and kind of
underneath<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.220> pink<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.030> maybe<00:03:05.209> in<00:03:05.360> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
underneath the pink so maybe in the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.710 
underneath the pink so maybe in the
