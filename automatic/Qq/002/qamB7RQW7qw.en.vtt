I set the stick down on the snare I want

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
I set the stick down on the snare I want
my<00:01:06.689> fingers<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.439> wrapped<00:01:07.740> around<00:01:07.950> just

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
my fingers to be wrapped around just

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.340

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
enough that they hold the butt end of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.520 
enough that they hold the butt end of
the<00:01:10.470> stick<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> rim<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:13.140> here

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the stick off the rim you can see here

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.100 
the stick off the rim you can see here
when<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> press<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> stick<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.360> isn't

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
when I press on the stick it isn't

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.070 
when I press on the stick it isn't
resting<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> rim<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:24.150> point<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
resting on the rim the point here is to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.530 
resting on the rim the point here is to
ensure<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.890> stick<00:01:26.159> rebound<00:01:26.729> slightly<00:01:27.000> after

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
ensure the stick rebound slightly after

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.890 
ensure the stick rebound slightly after
each<00:01:28.140> stroke<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> snare<00:01:29.820> drum<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> able<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
each stroke so the snare drum is able to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.289 
each stroke so the snare drum is able to
get<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> better<00:01:31.320> tone<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.820> stick<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.119> just

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
get a better tone if the stick is just

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.170 
get a better tone if the stick is just
buried<00:01:34.020> into<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> rim<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.400> absorb<00:01:35.820> most

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
buried into the rim it would absorb most

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.069 
buried into the rim it would absorb most
of<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.450> sound

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
of that sound

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.230 
of that sound
let<00:01:37.799> me<00:01:37.950> demonstrate<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> difference<00:01:39.060> for

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
let me demonstrate the difference for

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.080 
let me demonstrate the difference for
you<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.619> I'll<00:01:40.619> first<00:01:41.040> play<00:01:41.340> four<00:01:41.700> strokes

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you now I'll first play four strokes

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
you now I'll first play four strokes
where<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> bury<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> stick<00:01:43.259> into<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> rim<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
where I bury the stick into the rim and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
where I bury the stick into the rim and
then<00:01:45.030> I'll<00:01:45.240> play<00:01:45.509> four<00:01:45.869> where<00:01:46.320> my<00:01:46.470> fingers<00:01:46.920> are

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
then I'll play four where my fingers are

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
then I'll play four where my fingers are
positioned<00:01:47.640> properly<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.630> allow<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> stick

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
positioned properly to allow the stick

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:02.630 
positioned properly to allow the stick
to<00:01:49.590> rebound<00:01:49.979> slightly

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640 

so<00:02:03.640> as<00:02:03.760> you<00:02:04.030> can<00:02:04.180> hear<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.900> snare<00:02:05.200> drum<00:02:05.410> gives

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
so as you can hear the snare drum gives

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.830 
so as you can hear the snare drum gives
a<00:02:05.770> cleaner<00:02:06.160> sound<00:02:06.520> when<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.000> stick<00:02:07.300> is<00:02:07.510> able

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
a cleaner sound when the stick is able

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.730 
a cleaner sound when the stick is able
to<00:02:07.930> rebound<00:02:08.350> away<00:02:08.830> from<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.430> snare<00:02:09.700> drum<00:02:09.970> rim

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
to rebound away from the snare drum rim

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.650 
to rebound away from the snare drum rim
now<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:12.190> first<00:02:12.460> thing<00:02:12.730> you'll<00:02:12.970> want<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.240> do<00:02:13.420> is

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790
