 ph with another video for you guys 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.360
 and as you asked me a lot in both 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.550
 last days I spent in 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.340
 channel yes I'm going to do the career mode 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.309
 You do not talk like you 15 but 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.630
 doubt is with the team start I already have 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.130
 a team in mind 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.350
 I honestly do not want to start with a 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.230
 team strong chelsea manchester 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.590
 united and real madrid and barcelona 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.070
 burn services we had to start at 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.290
 my head was going to start with a dowry 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.809
 said that the team of the second division of the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.360
 england that we can get well 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.420
 away with him I play you a match with 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.930
 he here against my cousin here in the game 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.670
 Friendly normal in the house was I picked it up 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.520
 be a good team to start the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.560
 carries the quality players to 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.740
 people try to climb to the first 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.310
 division of england and who knows 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.729
 I was playing until I got bigger flights 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.160
 huh 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.149
 so I'll leave it to you to decide I 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.520
 I'm leaving my opinion that I 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.590
 I would very much appreciate if you're 1.5 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.860
 would you agree if below and agree 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.650
 if not put in another team I start the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.909
 career mode reminding me that I never did 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.340
 career mode 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.320
 so I played at home here one 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.030
 I went to the swimsuit that was the furthest that I 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.190
 I started with the river plate does not have 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.270
 win monarchs still in monaco 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.159
 but it's just that I 've never done so. 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.130
 I played career mode here at home in 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.860
 international level, which is the last 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.830
 level I think I collect I do not know if I will 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.600
 we'll get more if we can play 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.850
 along the career mode so I can 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.010
 play in the deal so I can run in 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.320
 legendary way but you will be a 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.780
