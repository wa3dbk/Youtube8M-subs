00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.520
 that in principle it is necessary to have heart blood 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.650
 bring devotion and meticulousness and everyone 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.740
 try something new to do it better 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.740
 do 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.400
 You can always lure a drill 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.860
 ahead in this dangerous at the same time in 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.160
 its a machine for less cost 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.320
 components 50 less energy 40 percent 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.980
 less space in 4 percent more 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.489
 It's more efficient than anything 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.110
 other 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 it has been before 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.340
 behind 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.340
 behind 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.250
 We develop a lot of machines 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.560
 It is just about to try it out 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.690
 look like the result that then 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.690
 optimize again to start again 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.159
 technology pieper these are the people who 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.850
 technology 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.850
 dealing with process quality 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 employ 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.230
 the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.290
 sure of the success always schwaben 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.860
 again it convinces outwards 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.260
 bring 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.790
 to carry that into the world today is the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.620
 task we have and know about 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.890
 the last years more and more international 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.890
 become 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.940
 Do not be scared of the customer 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.810
 make the machine optimal 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.810
 use 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.440
 then have four good reasons for that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 we are on the way
