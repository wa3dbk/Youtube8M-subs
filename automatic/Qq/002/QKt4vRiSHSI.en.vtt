00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.779
 breakfast of these types those that are taken 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.160
 the Americans for the mornings when 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.110
 we get up with more hunger than 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.050
 normal or that can also serve us 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.640
 for a dinner or for a meal is 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.890
 easy we have tried it and it is 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.840
 I hope you like it 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 we have placed half slice of ham 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.839
 sweet going around the mold we have 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.000
 added a slice of bread that 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.910
 we will have previously cut this 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.239
 size the slice is not going to talcual but 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.070
 that is impregnated with a little honey 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.049
 here we have the honey we have added 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.710
 some droplets of oil to make it 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.190
 I can 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.879
 anoint better after here over let's go to 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.879
 add the egg 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.990
 now we add a little pepper 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.210
 and a little salt 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 and to give it a different touch I like it 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.700
 add nutmeg 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.520
 ham chips that we will have cut 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.520
 previously 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.300
 and that they're going to toast in the oven when 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.300
 the egg is also made 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.530
 preheating the oven where we are going to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 put about 10 or 15 minutes you will see that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 one is closed we will test how 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.470
 it goes out that way and so we can 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.030
 leave also our opinion let's 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.640
 see how it is and this has been the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.230
 result is a kind of petal made 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.030

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.740
