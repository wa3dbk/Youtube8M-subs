00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.480
 we have many possibilities of power 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.260
 qualify you can still give the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.020
 things and this good you just have to 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.300
 see it as a possibility 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
 be able to win at home to give a joy to 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.320
 people and at the same time be able to qualify 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.119
 liguilla I think it will be great for 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.400
 for everyone to close with dignity is what 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.059
 What do we want to do? 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.040
 things well give a great joy to this great 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.500
 hobby in being a university and good 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.710
 we simply have to work for 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.170
 to receive the best monterrey in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.059
 monterrey with all the headlines and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.329
 Well surely they are not going to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.270
 come to give anything to make us 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.130
 we already have the advantage of 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.710
 that day of knowing more about the results and 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.010
 the possibility whether or not I qualify 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.339
 I think that if there is a possibility that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.160
 we can qualify we're going to get out pretty 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.020
 motivated to the party and if not I think that 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.060
 we will try to do the same 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.390
 things well as we said now 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.800
 to give you a joy here at home to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.380
 our hobby 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.200
 not the truth that is a great first 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.189
 friend 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.189
 the sparkle velarde 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.580
 a player who wanted to want many this 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.369
 institution is a very player 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.830
 professional was a leader within this 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.540
 team and good surely will have 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.670
 feelings found next 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.110
 Sunday only you will like that cougars 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.940
 can access the liguilla 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.940
 simply good professional 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.290
 it is certainly always recent that a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.090
 player of that level then go away 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.729
 however equipment 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.399
 there have always been several players 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.740
 leaders in the pumas team and that has 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.590
 allowed not to suffer in a 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.560
 moment given to the low of some help 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.750
 from a teammate I do not think 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.790
 that pumas has leading games in all 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.800
 its lines and that's what has 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.140
 maintained we also keep strong 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.980
 and the truth is that this tournament has been 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.050
 not at home we have not given the result 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.440
 that more was expected however from 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.780
 visit does not look very good has not been a 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.170
 situation there a little atypical this 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.720
 tournament and good simply as we said 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.780
 you have to channel them the situation to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.760
 to be strong again 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.340
 and a hard team in tension 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.070
 university cougars is always a 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.470
 strong team in liguillas cougars always 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.960
 is a team that gives fight to 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.450
 anyone and that generally does not 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.090
 they want to face cougars then good 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.580
 I think it would be very interesting that 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.630
 we qualified and that we enter the 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.390
 liguilla and 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.090
 we could fully demonstrate what 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.950
 what this team has before 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.870
 complicated situations that are being 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.510
 living today because I think it is 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.269
 none none of us are strangers 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.790
 to this situation and good now from 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.010
 our 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.989
 I work from our place where 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.269
 we are the sport that is a 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.510
 noble sport soccer that is a 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.849
 sport that leaves many people to many 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.010
 children, we have more than we have left 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.769
 more than trying to give a good 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.359
 show try to give it a bit of 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.280
 joy to the people who forgot one 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.000
 little bit that complicated situation here 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.130
 these last days he has lived and I believe 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.060
 what would be some forms 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.060
 to collaborate
