00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
this stalled construction sites so the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.050 
this stalled construction sites so the
idea<00:00:15.530> from<00:00:15.769> day<00:00:15.920> one<00:00:16.099> was<00:00:16.250> to<00:00:16.279> be<00:00:16.730> able<00:00:16.790> to<00:00:16.939> do

idea from day one was to be able to do
something<00:00:17.090> that<00:00:17.330> was<00:00:17.450> highly<00:00:17.930> productive

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
something that was highly productive

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.720 
something that was highly productive
because<00:00:18.439> we<00:00:18.650> wanted<00:00:18.830> to<00:00:18.890> make<00:00:19.009> it<00:00:19.189> a<00:00:19.310> real<00:00:19.490> farm

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
because we wanted to make it a real farm

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.050 
because we wanted to make it a real farm
not<00:00:20.570> just<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.169> sort<00:00:21.470> of<00:00:21.560> herbs<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.100> easy

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
not just the sort of herbs and easy

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.540 
not just the sort of herbs and easy
stuff<00:00:23.359> to<00:00:23.390> grow<00:00:23.830> but<00:00:24.830> also<00:00:25.160> make<00:00:25.430> it

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
stuff to grow but also make it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.980 
stuff to grow but also make it
impermanent<00:00:26.240> something<00:00:26.539> that<00:00:26.630> we<00:00:26.689> can<00:00:26.810> move

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
impermanent something that we can move

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.109 
impermanent something that we can move
elsewhere<00:00:27.560> because<00:00:28.039> this<00:00:28.609> will<00:00:28.760> become<00:00:28.910> an

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
elsewhere because this will become an

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.609 
elsewhere because this will become an

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
make it happen and it was just a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.890 
make it happen and it was just a
function<00:01:03.769> of<00:01:03.949> finding<00:01:04.220> out<00:01:04.339> how<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:04.820> where<00:01:05.299> we

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
estate I think when we heard it it was

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.210 
estate I think when we heard it it was
like<00:01:08.869> absolutely<00:01:09.080> what<00:01:09.620> else<00:01:09.740> would<00:01:09.920> we<00:01:10.040> do

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
like absolutely what else would we do

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.100 
like absolutely what else would we do
with<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.850> know<00:01:10.970> 15,000<00:01:11.630> square<00:01:11.840> feet<00:01:11.930> in<00:01:12.020> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
with you know 15,000 square feet in the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.360 
with you know 15,000 square feet in the
middle<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.380> Manhattan<00:01:12.860> that's<00:01:13.010> just<00:01:13.220> sitting

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
middle of Manhattan that's just sitting

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.550 
middle of Manhattan that's just sitting
near<00:01:13.580> banket<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.990> think<00:01:15.170> looking<00:01:15.470> at

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
near banket and and I think looking at

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.430 
near banket and and I think looking at
it<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.830> see<00:01:15.860> such<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.880> large<00:01:17.000> space<00:01:17.540> transformed

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
it to see such a large space transformed

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.470 
it to see such a large space transformed
really<00:01:18.710> from<00:01:18.980> a<00:01:19.130> stalled<00:01:19.640> construction<00:01:20.240> site

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
really from a stalled construction site

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.150 
really from a stalled construction site
into<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.780> productive<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:21.500> innovative<00:01:21.920> farm

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
it's a dream for Alexandria it's a dream

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.800

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
partners working with us on this so it's

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.400
