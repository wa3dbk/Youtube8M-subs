00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.149
 the funds simply the comments 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.559
 of analysis below in the part of 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.260
 description has to leave to see the 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.450
 goals of the match where they were clashing 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.880
 the visiting team was 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.029
 advantage at 32 minutes and the both 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.779
 draw tie to lastra your you 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.399
 William arrived at 79 a game 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.130
 where there were many arrivals 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.439
 archer gordon and light were great 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.230
 protagonists of the meeting having 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.810
 between 4 and 5 saves each one so that 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.060
 there are no more celtic goals for me 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.240
 taste a little better had a little 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.340
 more the ball and they were very good very 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.470
 well generated the chances they had 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.240
 his players for his teammates is not 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.500
 that they had stacked individually 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.500
 but that 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.070
 they were mostly group plays the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.400
 first match of the match 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.780
 we said that the 32nd minute of 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.670
 Johansen and the equalizer was to 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.000
 william that now we will be 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.280
 reviewing the goals of the match where 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.830
 it usually ended a space that 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.550
 that it looks like it was just the equal draw for 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.550
 the number of arrivals 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.930
 and how they played both teams 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.060
 the celtic being a big one from europe 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.240
 I converted 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.130
 the tie convert the first goal of the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.189
 match where played as a starter 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.560
 scott brown the midfielder 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.320
 containment and creation because also 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.840
 is responsible for creating game 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.170
 as a holder next to wakaso the former goal 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.929
 villarreal and Spanish and in the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.810
 homeowner whole truth 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.420
 some quite complicated mark 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.060
 well-known player that really does not 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.789
 I know none of those who were neither 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.330
 in Luanco or as a starter what there is 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.600
 to note that william income 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.970
 the second part did not invest in the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.310
 first half time of departure 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.520
 we said it was coming 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.170
 thanks was an impeccable left foot 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.260
 spectacular really a great goal 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.989
 Esteban Johansen to the 32 minutes the nail 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.340
 the free-throw angle partner that 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.110
 hit the sweep and the bounce nor that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.370

 they put in the ball when there was 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.870
 pretty fog and finish the bow from 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.760
 the left sticks in the angle 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.250
