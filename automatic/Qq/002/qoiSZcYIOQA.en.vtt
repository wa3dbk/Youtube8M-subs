a<00:00:20.850> white<00:00:21.090> piece<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.359> paper<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:22.320> I've

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
a white piece of paper that I've

attached to cinch it forward and

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.599 
attached to cinch it forward and
hopefully<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.710> make<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> little<00:00:26.130> bit<00:00:26.279> easier

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.270 
see if I big in those ends up just
slightly<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.520> gives<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.090> room<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:31.009> lace<00:01:32.009> them

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
slightly it gives you room to lace them

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.480
