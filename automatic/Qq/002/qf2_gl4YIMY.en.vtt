00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.430
 Welcome to the cooking workshop 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.460
 the juli-pay barbecue time summer time 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 we are looking forward to it 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.939
 simpler and therefore we do not need to cook big 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.679
 but we take what is on the market make something out of it 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.749
 I did not even participate in that 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.529
 Once upon a time there are fish everywhere 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.299
 then the ship was the easiest, so we can get close by 

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:30.079
 Varieties of meat can be hotter more exciting from both sides 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.919
 turn around 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.890
 and the market is Dolberg, too 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.190
 but a fine a vegetable pan and to cool 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.610
 Vegetable potatoes 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.089
 Percent no matter what one finds on the Lüderich the vouchers and also 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.740
 while working in the distance Witten meanwhile have something 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.780
 very nice 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.080
 thyme 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.440
 For example, she is a detective and brush 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.850
 currently will also come in third track 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.229
 «Customers can every Clavister com the animals out quickly during the barbecue 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.300
 grainy 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.030
 Keys with the brush a purely the law applies the Rinchnacher normal 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.860
 in the moment 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.770
 Overath stayed to begin 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 there today is the topic for me 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.510
 the Gabelmann clothing we have two Fischer l because Waxweiler 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.760
 and a tour but no Karl just 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.440
 you recognize fresh fish 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.220
 a clear eye 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.650
 at the red bushes they would have to pay numbers then the fish is fresh 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.180
 here we are it is already cleaned 8 breaks soon he will really 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.700
 want 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.190
 Substitute leaves 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.280
 and here too 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.300
 is important that is not a farmed fish is possible 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.270
 but Hieber the Dorade 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.490
 a free-living fish 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.310
 The fish are relatively easy to prepare 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.160
 we want the greens today today's grilled fish 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.880
 with the herbs that nature is experiencing 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.300
 in Amiland lemon thyme is the founders 69 or hoses between 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.460
 200 and different children groups 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.940
 who also plunder drag through the paste Scott has to find the tours 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.940
 then you will have to do that to them 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.689
 We start the whole thing in there 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:25.839
 Euro since the Citi men could come out a military biobank 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.699
 SID takes for smelly creamy taste 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:30.889
 then something 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.889
 More since Ryan so that's very important 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:49.299
 the so-called Triberg am Mann is of course a big beast there but the 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.439
 Do not expect a long time on the grill as you will not pay so much 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:05.199
 that we have made the head of Switzerland as too long respectively, although the head 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.199
 this will 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.009
 because that's easier now 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:12.569
 not so big 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 important is that they are well washed 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.239
 Put in Uschi 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.329
 and also these numbers 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:40.139
 Walter Mayer 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.989
 try with the crickets 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.390
 including ten of these alone 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.949
 Halftime July time when the beautiful 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.949
 the fish we just want to put on it 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.709
 and here you have this brush 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.709
 or that even Chelsea can score for it 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.769
 takes old goods 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.119
 8 to 10 minutes 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.249
 yes we have 8 to 10 minutes now hectic on the grill 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:19.279
 he is in a contract workshop 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.139
 and how do we test now that they Gandalf at the 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.539
 Dorsal fin because the dorsal fin can easily pull out of it like here 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.210
 is the one for traffic jam 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.210
 So that means that is already existed 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.020
 then just stop very expensive the advantage of it until the 70th 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.020
 of the taste he got nice despite 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.669
 uq 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.990
 Quite similar criticism I said and that is the best there is if it is so 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.770
 smooth as made 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.770
 just top okay 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.389
 Reus is juicy 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.249
 a culprit finished 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.249
 can as a red stripe 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.599
 Again, you can do it again 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.800
 Uli Bühl percent argue with team that emphasizes that you can it
