00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:58.240 

everything<00:00:39.000> works<00:00:39.510> perfect

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.130 

the<00:00:59.250> guitar<00:00:59.610> was<00:00:59.760> recently<00:01:00.180> upgraded<00:01:00.360> with<00:01:00.900> a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the guitar was recently upgraded with a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.460 
the guitar was recently upgraded with a
switch<00:01:01.710> craft<00:01:02.100> output<00:01:02.670> Jack<00:01:03.170> much<00:01:04.170> better

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
switch craft output Jack much better

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.170 
switch craft output Jack much better
than<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.160> original<00:01:06.200> jack<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.440> was<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> there

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
than the original jack that was in there

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.990 
than the original jack that was in there
which<00:01:09.180> actually<00:01:09.360> ended<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.820> kicking<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
which actually ended up kicking the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.130 
which actually ended up kicking the
bucket<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:14.190> why<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.400> put<00:01:14.550> this<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.140> but

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
bucket so that's why we put this in but

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.430 
bucket so that's why we put this in but
I<00:01:16.200> think<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> sounds<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.920> lot<00:01:17.250> louder<00:01:18.200> now<00:01:19.200> that

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
I think it sounds a lot louder now that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.940
