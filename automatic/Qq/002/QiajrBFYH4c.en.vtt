00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.830
 there were really very few spins 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.110
 off able to leave satisfied 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.580
 the user probably this by virtue 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.440
 of the fact of this kind of titles 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.330
 tend to distort sometimes in ways 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.250
 radical the series of belonging 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.900
 going to fight with everyone 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.460
 those who consider it indispensable 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.140
 that their cult series maintain 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.680
 unaltered gaming system until 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.300
 eternity 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.010
 when it was announced in the middle of the a 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.570
 raiding is not therefore come into the waiting 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.340
 riot of infantryman of the brand 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.989
 vat coach owner who saw 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.640
 in the new metal gear the embodiment of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.200
 every worst past pace 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.670
 subsequently in the hands of platinum 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.199
 games the direction taken by the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.150
 project became that point which 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.350
 both the book and the action seemed 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.750
 take shape overwhelmingly 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.040
 compared to the stealth component for 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.809
 to convince then of the goodness of the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.309
 design their konami supporters 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.170
 Argentines on vacation a short demo of 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.150
 title within the area of aids hd 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.590
 collection and we are ready as always a 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.070
 give me our impressions we have it 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.070
 tried in preview 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.429
 the drama is introduced to us through 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.020
 a simple static screen via 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.700
 which we are made aware of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.499
 cyborg technology after four years 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.719
 since the collapse of the patriot it has become of use 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.459
 common in the war industry giving life 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.659
 a whole series of military corporations 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.740
 ready to do battle for 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.929
 territory control 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.969
 in this context , the chile rider enters 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.740
 united is a PMC dedicated to maintenance 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.420
 of peace has decided to end with 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.459
 every possible means at the birth of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.049
 further outbreaks of war during one 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.429
 simple escort operation the team 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.979
 of rydell is attacked and made to 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.629
 pieces of the dress will be dos enforcement 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.099
 led by the skilled swordsman sam che 

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:54.659
 before completing his mission a 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:56.879
 about the same ryden taking out a 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.079
 eye and less mandro of a living arm 

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:00.000
 by miracle our protagonist 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.950
 it is put back into shape by use 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.569
 of cyborg technology and thrown 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.920
 again in the brawl to fix up 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.009
 once and for all accounts left in 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.009
 suspended 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.890
 I have to allow us at this point to 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.780
 decide at what level of difficulty a 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.000
 play among the three available and if 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.470
 face or not the short tutorial 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.880
 quick training session 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.800
 infectious teaches us the basics of 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.810
 combinations with attacks divided between 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.459
 fast and powerful shots and the chance 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.990
 to enter a slow mode 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 thanks to which to make any slices 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.290
 what gets back on our path 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.270
 through the high frequency blade with 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.040
 we are equipped with the gameplay 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.750
 although extremely simple it requires 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.340
 a few moments of practice above all 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.959
 to be able to master with 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.520
 precision sword movements e 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.430
 concatenate como in rapid succession 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.930
 successfully mannequins and machines 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.820
 Watermelons in this sense do 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.260
 exactly in our case and after having 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.400
 reached the first jet and we will be ready 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.400
 to be serious 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.560
 here it is simple briefings that we come 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.030
 the assault was introduced to the first mission 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.370
 directed to the capital of sukhumi in 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.840
 Abkhazia to overturn the current regime 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.310
 the entrance to the scene could not but 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.390
 be spectacular and our new 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.890
 body allows us to be 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.959
 literally fired from an aircraft 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.459
 stealth towards the coast the presentation 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.930
 therefore of those exciting and between the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.610
 heavy rain waves and landing 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.860
 crowe reflected artists does nothing 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.299
 exalting player then just a little 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.400
 title to bring out the tamarraggine 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.440
 classic boost of platinum games e 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.420
 even less to throw us into combat 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.829
 in less than no time traversari si 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.269
 reveal in front of us face 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.970
 obviously to be torn to pieces in 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.110
 quick succession the tutorial was 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.609
 in fact more than enough to 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.470
 particular hand with the controls e 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.000
 move between enemy ranks and jump 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.370
 to tear your opponents to pieces is done with 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.019
 extreme ease the movements of Ryden 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.220
 they are fluid and fun 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.959
 well it can be quietly 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.459
 compared to the pieces of the cats that in 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.950
 a few minutes fill our screen 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.480
 the demo in this case leaves you alone 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.859
 mean different things like the 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.569
 possibility to make precise cuts 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.640
 on the opponent's arms to earn 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.560
 extra points to be exchanged then with doctor 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.209
 to get additional upgrades 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.799
 and new skills this at least in theory 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.160
 given that in this brief session of 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.780
 game 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.780
 none of this is explored 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.479
 what the demo however puts in 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.860
 field is the possibility to face the 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.419
 missions if with a more stealth approach 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.069
 killing sanborn instantly 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.810
 opponent of a series of sites both 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.460
 through a more violent making his way 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.800
 between enemies to the sound of blows and qt e 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.910
 in addition to the normal soldiers to reach the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.470
 our first goal we have 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.360
 also dealt with robotics companies 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.220
 enormously more dangerous than the troops 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.509
 base and able to stun raad and per 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.160
 a few seconds 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.289
 nothing too problematic once 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.729
 become familiar with the technical parade 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.259
 which will allow us to gather the shots 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.080
 opponents and to attack by slipping 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.039
 under their defenses the sword is not 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.050
 obviously the only weapon to ours 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.639
 provision even if it makes us do the 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.229
 nose think of having to replace one 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.610
 blade capable of cutting source palaces 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.240
 in favor of simple grenades and 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.380
 rocket launchers 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.090
 but probably these further 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.770
 equipment will come in handy in a 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.400
 second time to defeat botta 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.400
 to the latest specifications 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.860
 after a few minutes of the game 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.510
 demo brought us directly to the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.980
 final clash against a robotic dog 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.540
 previously seen numerous 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.670
 cold does not theoretically love for 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.290
 killing the boss revealed one 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.820
 discreet husband the attacks though 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.530
 concatenated in terms of specifications that 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.910
 once upon thousand t will allow you to 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.680
 defeat four-legged elections 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.680
 without having to pour too much sweat 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.200
 for us to melt 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.830
 a demo so brief lacking in how much 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.509
 apparently of all those finished or that 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.520
 they could make an action game riding 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.289
 the technical sector is very deep if 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.699
 sixth on good levels without being surprised 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.080
 and some basic inconsistencies e 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.520
 relating to the possibility of cutting 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.080
 only certain parts in the scenario 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.000
 leave room for some doubt 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.740
 surely you will see the furniture you will know 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.150
 amuse but that final late 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.150
 we will have to wait a few more months
