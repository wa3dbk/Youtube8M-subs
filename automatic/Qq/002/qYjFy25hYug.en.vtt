00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 native species and biodiversity 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.130
 of our waters are threatened by 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.309
 the presence of the lionfish 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.680
 depended on an invasive species or 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.960
 exotic that reaches the Caribbean seas 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.460
 through the aquarium trade in 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.529
 approximately the years 1991 92 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.259
 it was observed for the first time on the coasts 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.599
 from florida when you know that some 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.509
 people released several specimens of 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.399
 pelé or from their fish tanks to the passage of hurricane 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.559
 andrew in what they were left without 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.420
 electricity and to prevent their 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.980
 pets die by the sea 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.649
 view that you have until the 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.940
 moment and after that has begun its 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.940
 expansion throughout the Caribbean 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.190
 nowadays we have many settlers who 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 they are dependent on the sea and those are the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.690
 fishermen of our coasts and they 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.900
 are those who are suffering mostly 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.640
 for this invasion of the lionfish I just 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.650
 we can see a city well known as 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 the group help individual here in the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.390
 head commercial fish already at the level and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 how does life make the purchase of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.950
 get and I was happy I keep myself 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.130
 my family proclaims the serious problem of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.380
 the invasive alien species in the 3 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 lion is that they constitute a threat to 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.720
 the local biodiversity of fighting no no 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.720
 came with its predators and diseases 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.570
 so it is currently 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.910
 out of control their populations 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.190
 increase due to great effectiveness 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.740
 of its reproduction and lack of 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.500
 predation to be constituted in 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 a plague on all the reefs and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.280
 because they themselves are 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.430
 non-efficient predators reaching 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 reduce local biodiversity by 80% 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.130
 the movement of the human being helps 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.130
 control these invasive species 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.289
 steele or more than three years and I met him 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.469
 close the first time we did three 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.630
 threads the next time we take like 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:12.800
 four and the same thing also after the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:12.800
 next you will buy 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.489
 the other weights 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.640
 pérez léon decreases the abundance of 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.409
 ecologically important species 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.900
 example right here in the national park 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.930
 jaragua where we have started to see it in 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.120
 increasing numbers every day without 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.829
 However, we can help if we 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.170
 we involved a bit in the problem the 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.930
 better way is supporting through the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.120
 consumption of lionfish meat that 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.000
 is increasingly commercialized in more 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.099
 points of the country this meat is not only from 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.159
 excellent quality but also 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.069
 through consumption we are helping 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.700
 mitigate a bit the effect it has had 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.700
 about our
