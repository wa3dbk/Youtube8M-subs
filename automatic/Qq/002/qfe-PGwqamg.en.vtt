00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.030
 Japan for centuries was considered the birthplace 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.160
 best balls since samurai 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.800
 no one could argue with the Japanese 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.360
 in the manufacture of craftsmanship 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.019
 steel blades 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.609
 but on the south western island of Kuleshov alone 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.949
 the company decided to move away from the traditions and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.059
 began to release a revolutionary super 

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:22.070
 built the beast made did not 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.070
 have pottery 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.859
 how do they do it 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.480
 word times sushi bars 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.800
 can masterly handle knives and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.690
 until recently in these kitchens 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.550
 were used only for life from 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.060
 of stainless steel 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.060
 but now popovrov new pets 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.490
 Armenia is only stronger than steel 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.340
 get together 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.750
 but also stainless steel not covered 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.470
 stained and almost never intercede perfect 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.510
 for slicing and the finest slices 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.510
 sushi fish 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.010
 for making these unique knives 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.980
 used and pottery new 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.829
 generations 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.069
 which is inferior in strength only 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.069
 diamonds 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.130
 The problem is that for such ceramics as 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 hall Mazzy need to go to the ends of the world 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.150
 certainly not to the very edge we dwell on 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.310
 west australia around the city 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.260
 tartu 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.990
 where is the mine 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 Donato's punch 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.920
 Now 9 from the wounds of the ideologue Dr. Apollo 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.170
 about comfort 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.520
 which day is sent to 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 search 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.899
 she is not looking for gold or silver but a place 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.899
 rich in ores 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.530
 and 10 30 it looks like the gold mining I'm looking for 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.470
 where more than sold countries and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.630
 requested his area 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.680
 black sand contains backs colorless 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.460
 mineral circus he 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.710
 zircon is the main element of ceramic 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.710
 knives 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:13.949
 as soon as laura identified where necessary 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.739
 dig can connect 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.759
 excavator and transport land on 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.759
 the so-called roads and nerr 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:27.039
 with the beginning 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.649
 giant vibrating 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.439
 platform is thrown the most 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.709
 large stones 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.539
 then 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.459
 in a special cylinder material 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.169
 mixed with water 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.369
 so weed out the last 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.369
 unnecessary stones 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.539
 remaining sand rich in minerals 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.189
 pump the so-called and wet 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.099
 shop 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.379
 similar to the scenery of the old scientifically 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.239
 fantastic movie but these 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.659
 giant spirals do the same 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.859
 function as flushing tray 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.859
 lorain only in industrial 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.359
 the scale 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.219
 while the water with the sand runs in a spiral 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.349
 light sand grains are washed onto the walls 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.449
 pipes and then weed out 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.329
 and heavy grains of minerals remain in 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.329
 center, we need them 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.609
 the result is a thick boarding 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.609
 a layer of a mixture of different minerals 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.589
 they are separated by magnetic and 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.539
 static machine manifolds 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:34.849
 concentration became for wet 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.429
 enrichment 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.919
 and finally shake again 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.599
 almost 100% zircon is obtained 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.599
 ready for sale worldwide 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.159
 first zircon correct china where 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.510
 make it two cashier and zircon 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.879
 and then they take him to ancient Japanese 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.039
 Sendai city 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.829
 this plant belongs 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.400
 target world leading world 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 ceramic blade manufacturer 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.379
 for starters zirconia 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.209
 powder give the desired shape with 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.339
 using a high pressure press 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.569
 under pressure of almost 400 tons 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.549
 zircon grains pressed plate 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.549
 in the form of lithuania 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.449
 these plates are very fragile 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.309
 any awkward movement can 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:28.309
 break them 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.900
 so like all other ceramics 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.900
 they can be burned 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.199
 the temperature inside this furnace and reaches 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.789
 thousand four hundred degrees centigrade 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.719
 after forty-eight hours of such roasting 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.700
 brittle powder plates 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.250
 turn into pottery 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.659
 which is almost impossible to break 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.739
 the end product is unique climbed 

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:58.739
 which is harder than the strongest steel 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.099
 but cutting into sushi will not work as yet 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.099
 stupid as pieces soap 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.979
 to sharpen your blades kiev sir 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.979
 turned to the flow of old masters 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
 Meet the master master 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.879
 in a small building on the outskirts of the city 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.649
 master and his assistants and 

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.649
 finish knives by hand 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.960
 this job requires a firm hand 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.960
 and deep concentration 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.949
 using a reverse wheel covered 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.520
 diamond strait they slowly grind 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.099
 hardened zircon to get the edges with 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.099
 sharp criticism 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.189
 most of all in this job I like 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.099
 returning home in the evening I know what 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.259
 today it did a great show 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.169
 and although they call me master I need 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.520
 learn all my life 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.520
 before i become it really 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.080
 and now it's better to turn your eyes off 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.610
 if there are children at home do not try to repeat 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.119
 it's on yourself 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:16.969
 like a real samurai 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.639
 master of pain knife sharpness 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.639
 on myself 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.139
 probably this perfect knife should 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.099
 The flight segment is completely 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.509
 the master and his students bandage her hands she 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.189
 same and return to the factory where the laser 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:40.790
 they became a trademark 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.210
 ball body 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.090
 the Japanese government fears that 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.819
 ceramic blade carry potential 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.949
 threat to security so as terrorists in 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:51.999
 airports 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:53.659
 can easily carry them through 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.800
 metal detector 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.530
 to prevent this blade composition 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.860
 a small amount is added 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.659
 metal 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:03.460
 last two checks 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.460
 is there any other material 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:09.279
 and is it possible if necessary 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:12.279
 cut the telephone directory 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:19.550
 children 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.449
 everything is perfect 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.180
 but how to show yourself carry hands rustling 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.969
 restaurant times on land 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:27.389
 in the restaurant another batch of raw fish 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:30.580
 almost chopped 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.310
 like masters of sushi 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.460
 chronic our country for their 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.550
 celebrating klyuev 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.499
 Moreover 

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.499
 thanks to chemically neutral 

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:41.859
 top does not absorb the smell of fish oil 

00:07:41.859 --> 00:07:43.379
 different varieties 

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.379
 the taste of food remains very soon 

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:52.020
 hope in the period with him will not fall 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.159
 a piece of nails
