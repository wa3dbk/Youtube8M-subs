00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.660
 I 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.280
 everyone naturally knows what I have 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.850
 programs about how cool to drift 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.309
 forde 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.379
 and called on the school of drift caps all 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.260
 its on point and today we will 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.409
 break one myth that is present 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.750
 forza horizon 2 a mi fit is called 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.089
 Drift all-wheel drive 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.329
 especially for this i took my nissan 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:03.379
 skyline redid it and rear back to 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.570
 four-wheel drive and just downloaded from the showcase 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.800
 the setting that was called like that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.880
 type a v. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.190
 Drift best in general for a long time I'm not riding 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.140
 Understand why this is all you need but 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:21.229
 then arriving at an abandoned aero base I 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.470
 I understand why there is a drift on 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.420
 all-wheel drive forza horizon 2 a 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.909
 it exists very simply in order 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.869
 to shoot beautiful vidosiki 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.509
 do as beautiful drift as you see 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.319
 it turns out very smoothly very beautiful 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.670
 points and do not earn much on it 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:45.130
 but it will be very cool 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.350
 What is so interesting but 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.890
 interesting first is that it is made 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.659
 not for small configs of trails 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.810
 at least this config is made for 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.840
 very long configs of runs as you 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.210
 I see now I'm going through the base and just all 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.090
 I can say it is going to drift 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.000
 such on the rear wheel drive would just not 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.259
 make you either expand or you already 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.390
 type in the wall 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.050
 In general, something with you will be bad or 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.680
 good and all-wheel drive how are you 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.020
 you see 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:24.110
 you carry carries true you are direct wheels 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.020
 but none the less very beautiful 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.680
 looks and those who do not fumble drift or 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.780
 just newbies i highly recommend you for 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.690
 beauty at least 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.820
 any meetings you can do 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.450
 on all-wheel drive is it in the back 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.120
 very difficult therefore my recommendation 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.430
 friends are those who want a beautiful drift 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.530
 they for some reason do not like 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.860
 Drift on the rear wheel drive which by the way 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.260
 right kosher so to speak 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.019
 put such a nissan skyline 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.350
 he is called and this is drift 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.350
 and that's how you see i bump into it 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.110
 all sorts of rods but nevertheless it is real 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.840
 cool in second gear car already 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.760
 just carries like mad 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.650
 and for this you do not really need anything 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.150
 just pull the handbrake turn in 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.160
 side skidding machine carries like you 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.849
 see very pretty everything turns out 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.620
 and itâ€™s easy the only negative 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.480
 probably the biggest minus I 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.760
 noticed at least in this config 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.400
 maybe eat sweets others more 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.129
 interesting but it seemed to me that this 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.129
 for all-wheel drive the config is not correct 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.950
 we have a very large angle 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:44.380
 drift time is not quite but nonetheless 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.239
 you see you can even torture all sorts of tricks 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.110
 remember it is extremely cool damn yes 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.620
 enough for me to crash into these paths 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.599
 difficult to drive so beautiful and with 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.700
 this talk to you friends so 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.040
 do not pay attention to this when setting up 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.099
 sometimes I will 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.620
 because I'm talking to you as you see 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.530
 everything is very simple and easy 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.489
 I don't bother at all now 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.880
 What I will have 2 transfer 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.840
 eversion side skidding and went sometimes 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.419
 a little gazkom 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.979
 will need to do something there 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.960
 strengthen lower gas let go but it and 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.400
 everything is wrong here as difficult as 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.530
 those configs about which I tell you 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.419
 I suggest you see you wanted now 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.949
 beautiful straight along the wall do not drive 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.949
 it turned out to close up the arrow 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.060
 handbrake 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.750
 Friends in general here are the things here I Myth 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.480
 I think confirmed drift is obtained 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.180
 cool on all-wheel drive but not 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.150
 less he is still not kosher i call 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.430
 you do not do such a drift only in the most 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.730
 in extreme cases when there you are 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.730
 difficult so friends with you was dmitry 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.970
 you point, I told you about when at 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.130
 all-wheel drive forza horizon 2 hope 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.480
 you enjoyed this video and you will not 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.280
 abuse such settings in 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.870
 general likes and comments and not 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.210
 forget to subscribe to the channel if you 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.170
 it did not if you do it now 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.790
 it you will be at all
