00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
again I said I'm a bit bummed out that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.499 
again I said I'm a bit bummed out that
there's<00:01:58.229> nothing<00:01:58.469> announced<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.250> pc<00:01:59.820> beta

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.690 
there's nothing announced for pc beta
and<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.049> 3ds<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.009> hopefully<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.670> see

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and or 3ds but hopefully we see

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.069 
and or 3ds but hopefully we see
something<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.450> systems<00:02:03.840> maybe

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
something for the systems maybe

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.060 
something for the systems maybe
something<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> handheld's<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
something for the handheld's and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
something for the handheld's and
hopefully<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.880> comes<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> pc<00:02:06.780> because

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
hopefully this comes to the pc because

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.529 
hopefully this comes to the pc because
there's<00:02:07.560> already<00:02:08.069> some<00:02:08.459> yugioh<00:02:08.849> platforms<00:02:09.420> on

there's already some yugioh platforms on
the<00:02:09.750> pc<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.860> would<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.129> been<00:02:11.220> perfect

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the pc so this would have been perfect

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.430 
the pc so this would have been perfect
for<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.970> system<00:02:12.300> as<00:02:12.480> well<00:02:12.660> but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
for that system as well but

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.630
