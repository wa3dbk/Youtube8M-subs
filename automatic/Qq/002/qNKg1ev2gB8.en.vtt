00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
show you how to do it I imagine you guys
can<00:00:47.970> figure<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.570> use<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.900> half-inch<00:00:49.380> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
can figure that out I use a half-inch a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
can figure that out I use a half-inch a
3/8<00:00:50.310> ratchet<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.850> half-inch<00:00:51.150> socket<00:00:51.480> on

it to get those busted loose become up
pretty<00:00:53.760> easy<00:00:53.970> okay<00:00:55.250> okay

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
pretty easy okay okay

got those two bolts loose are downstairs
there<00:01:00.360> on<00:01:00.630> that<00:01:01.020> bottom<00:01:01.350> bracket<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:02.309> what

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
there on that bottom bracket now what

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700 
there on that bottom bracket now what
I've<00:01:02.610> got<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.510> best<00:01:03.870> combination<00:01:04.619> I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
I've got is this best combination I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.260 
I've got is this best combination I
found<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> works<00:01:05.159> best<00:01:05.339> you've<00:01:05.700> got<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> 15

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
found it works best you've got a 15

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.629 
found it works best you've got a 15
millimeter<00:01:06.570> socket<00:01:07.139> you<00:01:07.710> got<00:01:07.920> roughly<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:08.639 
millimeter socket you got roughly I

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.489 
millimeter socket you got roughly I
guess<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> 2<00:01:09.450> inch<00:01:09.479> extension<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.350> you

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:10.499 
guess about a 2 inch extension then you

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:12.349 
guess about a 2 inch extension then you
have<00:01:10.679> a<00:01:10.710> 4<00:01:11.249> inch<00:01:11.340> extension<00:01:11.819> right<00:01:11.969> here<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
have a 4 inch extension right here and

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:16.039 
have a 4 inch extension right here and
I'll<00:01:12.450> piggyback<00:01:12.899> those<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:14.850> use<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.630> 3/8

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
I'll piggyback those and a use of my 3/8

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.020 
I'll piggyback those and a use of my 3/8
ratchet<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.679> now<00:01:17.609> we're<00:01:17.789> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.969> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
ratchet and now we're going to be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120 
ratchet and now we're going to be
working<00:01:18.359> on<00:01:18.479> these<00:01:18.630> nuts<00:01:18.899> that<00:01:19.619> hold<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
working on these nuts that hold it to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.770 
working on these nuts that hold it to
the<00:01:20.219> front<00:01:20.429> case<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.999> got<00:01:21.149> studs<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> there

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the front case you got studs on there

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
the front case you got studs on there
and<00:01:21.899> these<00:01:21.990> nuts<00:01:22.229> thread<00:01:22.469> on<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.880> they're

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and these nuts thread on there they're

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.730 
and these nuts thread on there they're
sometimes<00:01:24.209> difficult<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.990> bust<00:01:25.289> loose<00:01:25.469> but

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
sometimes difficult to bust loose but

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.099 
sometimes difficult to bust loose but
usually<00:01:26.159> after<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.609> get<00:01:26.789> them<00:01:26.999> cracked<00:01:27.869> loose

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
usually after you get them cracked loose

lose one nut or something like that down
as<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.249> as<00:01:47.490> you're<00:01:47.520> loosening<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.569> vp

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
as you're as you're loosening up the vp

as you're as you're loosening up the vp
44<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.709> they're<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.789> hard<00:01:50.849> to<00:01:51.029> keep

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
44 and they're kind of hard to keep

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.769 
44 and they're kind of hard to keep
track<00:01:51.929> of<00:01:52.139> sometimes<00:01:52.789> one<00:01:53.789> drops<00:01:54.029> down<00:01:54.240> it's

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:54.779 
track of sometimes one drops down it's

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:55.969 
track of sometimes one drops down it's
alright<00:01:54.929> because<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.409> whole<00:01:55.529> units<00:01:55.889> going

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
alright because this whole units going

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.499 
alright because this whole units going
to<00:01:56.069> be<00:01:56.130> coming<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.459> and<00:01:56.639> you<00:01:57.209> can<00:01:57.359> usually

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
to be coming out and you can usually

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.449 
to be coming out and you can usually
find<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.139> they<00:01:58.289> usually<00:01:58.469> stop<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
find it because they usually stop and

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:00.800 
find it because they usually stop and
sit<00:01:59.669> up<00:01:59.849> underneath<00:02:00.209> one<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.539> these<00:02:00.659> little

brackets or on the vacuum pump or on the
insulation<00:02:08.099> underneath<00:02:08.610> there<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.270> need

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
insulation underneath there or you need

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.669 
insulation underneath there or you need
to<00:02:09.569> drop<00:02:09.780> all<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> way<00:02:10.080> down<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.410> ground<00:02:10.590> if

the very end I just kind of work it up

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.449 
the very end I just kind of work it up
by<00:02:21.300> hand<00:02:21.769> all<00:02:22.769> right<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.250> where<00:02:23.400> the

by hand all right this is where the
rubber<00:02:23.670> meets<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.000> road<00:02:24.060> here

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
rubber meets the road here

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.890 
rubber meets the road here
we<00:02:25.950> got<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.129> pump<00:02:26.400> puller<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.540> got<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> two

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
we got a pump puller and you got the two

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.080 
we got a pump puller and you got the two
bolts<00:02:28.230> now<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.099> basically<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:30.000> to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
bolts now you basically have to

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.460 
bolts now you basically have to
orientate<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.379> puller<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.920> find<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.459> two

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
orientate that puller and find your two

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.300 
orientate that puller and find your two
tap<00:02:34.849> holes<00:02:35.849> for<00:02:36.690> those<00:02:36.840> bolts<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.410> don't

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
tap holes for those bolts I don't

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.699 
tap holes for those bolts I don't
remember<00:02:38.569> what<00:02:39.569> specific<00:02:40.080> thread<00:02:40.290> size<00:02:40.500> they

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
remember what specific thread size they

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.440 
remember what specific thread size they
are<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:41.069> if<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.250> get<00:02:41.400> confused<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.420> can

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
are but if you get confused you can

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.970 
are but if you get confused you can
always<00:02:42.720> go<00:02:42.930> back<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.260> one<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.440> these<00:02:43.590> intake

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
always go back to one of these intake

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.580 
always go back to one of these intake
bolts<00:02:44.280> fuses<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.480> exact<00:02:45.840> same<00:02:46.019> pitch<00:02:46.319> is

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
bolts fuses in this exact same pitch is

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.650 
bolts fuses in this exact same pitch is
that<00:02:47.310> intake<00:02:47.640> bolt<00:02:47.849> there<00:02:48.030> man<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.390> suckers

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
that intake bolt there man that suckers

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.440 
that intake bolt there man that suckers
rusty<00:02:49.049> but<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.860> mean<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.400> exact<00:02:50.730> same<00:02:50.880> size<00:02:51.150> X

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
rusty but I mean it's exact same size X

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.789 
rusty but I mean it's exact same size X
ain't<00:02:51.690> pitch<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.079> you<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.319> use<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
ain't pitch so you can use one of the

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.130 
ain't pitch so you can use one of the
intake<00:02:53.040> bolts<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.519> air<00:02:53.670> horn<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.930> tell

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
intake bolts for the air horn to tell

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.080 
intake bolts for the air horn to tell
you<00:02:55.260> what<00:02:55.410> size<00:02:55.620> bolts<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.099> meet<00:02:56.220> again<00:02:56.519> or<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
you what size bolts to meet again or I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.650 
you what size bolts to meet again or I
actually<00:02:58.079> built<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.560> puller<00:02:58.799> one<00:02:59.040> time<00:02:59.310> that

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
actually built a puller one time that

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.150 
actually built a puller one time that
incorporated<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.110> intake<00:03:01.379> bolts<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.980> two

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
incorporated to the intake bolts the two

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.330 
incorporated to the intake bolts the two
short<00:03:02.489> ones<00:03:03.200> down<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.799> usually<00:03:05.160> take

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
short ones down here that usually take

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.270 
short ones down here that usually take
off<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:06.900> size<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.500> incorporated<00:03:07.980> pulling

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
off that size and I incorporated pulling

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.300 
off that size and I incorporated pulling
it<00:03:08.400> uses<00:03:08.760> most<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:10.709> but<00:03:10.890> it

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
it uses most I don't have a here but it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.770 
it uses most I don't have a here but it
is<00:03:11.519> basically<00:03:11.730> throwing<00:03:12.209> together<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.629> work

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
is basically throwing together and work

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.819 
is basically throwing together and work
real<00:03:13.200> well<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.310> had<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.519> Camino<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.829> if

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
real well and just had to Camino it's if

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.410 
real well and just had to Camino it's if
you<00:03:16.980> got<00:03:17.129> a<00:03:17.160> welder<00:03:17.370> an<00:03:17.610> imagination<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.269> can

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
you got a welder an imagination you can

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.050 
you got a welder an imagination you can
make<00:03:18.510> anything<00:03:18.780> work<00:03:19.019> but<00:03:19.860> anyway<00:03:20.220> this<00:03:20.760> pump

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
make anything work but anyway this pump

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.120 
make anything work but anyway this pump
puller<00:03:21.299> like<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.780> said<00:03:22.079> or<00:03:22.290> pump<00:03:22.620> press<00:03:22.920> I

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
puller like I said or pump press I

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.390 
puller like I said or pump press I
should<00:03:23.310> say<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:25.350> really<00:03:25.769> saves<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.069> lot<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.280> time

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
should say it really saves a lot of time

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.520 
should say it really saves a lot of time
and<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.450> can<00:03:27.600> get<00:03:27.720> them<00:03:27.840> at<00:03:27.900> any<00:03:27.989> 12<00:03:28.380> amp

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
and you can get them at any 12 amp

could probably get your money back out
of<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.310> basically<00:03:41.519> tighten<00:03:42.090> these

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
of it and you basically tighten these

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.979 
of it and you basically tighten these
things<00:03:42.420> ultimately<00:03:44.389> I'm<00:03:45.389> trying<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.720> keep<00:03:45.840> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
things ultimately I'm trying to keep it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.050 
things ultimately I'm trying to keep it
even<00:03:46.109> as<00:03:46.349> possible<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.489> we're<00:03:47.639> listening<00:03:47.790> for

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
even as possible and we're listening for

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.839 
even as possible and we're listening for
a<00:03:48.090> kind<00:03:48.329> of<00:03:48.389> a<00:03:48.450> snap<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.400> actually<00:03:50.400> then<00:03:50.579> snap

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
a kind of a snap and actually then snap

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.210 
a kind of a snap and actually then snap
but<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.269> can<00:03:51.450> kind<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.720> see<00:03:51.930> now<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.950> gear

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
but you can kind of see now the gear

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.140 
but you can kind of see now the gear
just<00:03:53.459> gave<00:03:53.700> up

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
just gave up

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.809 
just gave up
it's<00:03:54.720> loose<00:03:55.019> right<00:03:55.260> now<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:56.579> wouldn't

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
it's loose right now and I wouldn't

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.159 
it's loose right now and I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:56.910> doing<00:03:57.239> what<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.599> just<00:03:57.780> did<00:03:57.959> because

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
recommend doing what I just did because

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.599 
recommend doing what I just did because
you<00:03:58.440> may<00:03:58.560> have<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.739> possibility<00:03:59.280> throwing<00:03:59.519> the

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
you may have a possibility throwing the

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.819 
you may have a possibility throwing the
key<00:03:59.760> way<00:03:59.910> out<00:04:00.109> but<00:04:01.109> I'm<00:04:01.380> just<00:04:01.440> kind<00:04:01.769> of

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
key way out but I'm just kind of

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.550 
key way out but I'm just kind of
demonstrating<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:02.840> purposes<00:04:03.840> showing<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
demonstrating for purposes showing the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.339 
demonstrating for purposes showing the
gear<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.859> loose<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.900> don't<00:04:06.900> worry<00:04:07.139> about

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
gear is loose and don't worry about

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.569 
gear is loose and don't worry about
knocking<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.799> gear<00:04:07.980> out<00:04:08.099> of<00:04:08.130> time<00:04:08.370> because

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
knocking that gear out of time because

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.150 
knocking that gear out of time because
it's<00:04:08.730> impossible<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.530> put<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.620> case<00:04:10.799> in<00:04:10.980> there

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
it's impossible to put the case in there

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.229 
it's impossible to put the case in there
that<00:04:11.639> gear<00:04:11.849> will<00:04:12.030> stay<00:04:12.269> meshed<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.200> with<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.590> I

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
that gear will stay meshed in with the I

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.000 
that gear will stay meshed in with the I
believe<00:04:15.239> it's<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.450> cam<00:04:15.690> gear<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:16.859> won't

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
believe it's the cam gear and it won't

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.500 
believe it's the cam gear and it won't
lose<00:04:17.160> its<00:04:17.220> teeth<00:04:17.579> it<00:04:17.760> can't<00:04:17.940> come<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.150> clocked

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
lose its teeth it can't come on clocked

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.029 
lose its teeth it can't come on clocked
or<00:04:18.720> anything<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.260> can't<00:04:19.500> bump<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.799> out<00:04:19.919> of

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
or anything so you can't bump it out of

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.250 
or anything so you can't bump it out of
time<00:04:20.220> at<00:04:20.400> all<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.970> stays<00:04:21.209> pretty<00:04:21.419> good<00:04:21.720> but

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
time at all so it stays pretty good but

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.070 
time at all so it stays pretty good but
that's<00:04:22.470> why<00:04:23.070> this<00:04:23.370> tool<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:24.180> good<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.870> if

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
that's why this tool is so good and if

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.659 
that's why this tool is so good and if
you<00:04:25.320> have<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> machine<00:04:25.860> shop<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.340> can<00:04:26.490> easily

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
you have a machine shop you can easily

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.339 
you have a machine shop you can easily
make<00:04:26.940> one<00:04:27.180> it's<00:04:27.360> very<00:04:27.419> very<00:04:27.810> simple<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.320> just

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
make one it's very very simple you just

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:29.899 
make one it's very very simple you just
basically<00:04:28.830> get<00:04:29.039> on<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.219> lathe<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.610> turn<00:04:29.789> it

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:29.909 
basically get on the lathe and turn it

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:30.230 
basically get on the lathe and turn it
down

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
down

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.080 
down
so<00:04:30.930> okay<00:04:31.440> now<00:04:31.620> let<00:04:32.190> me<00:04:32.250> go<00:04:32.340> get<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> pry<00:04:32.850> bar<00:04:33.060> and

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
so okay now let me go get a pry bar and

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.180 
so okay now let me go get a pry bar and
we'll<00:04:33.330> pick<00:04:33.630> up<00:04:33.690> here<00:04:33.840> in<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.110> second<00:04:34.410> okay

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
we'll pick up here in a second okay

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.189 
we'll pick up here in a second okay
all<00:04:35.759> right<00:04:35.910> what<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:36.330> is<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.569> got<00:04:36.690> my<00:04:36.780> pry<00:04:36.990> bar

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
all right what I do is I got my pry bar

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.770 
all right what I do is I got my pry bar
here<00:04:37.819> tuck<00:04:38.819> that<00:04:38.940> back<00:04:39.000> either<00:04:39.270> way<00:04:39.389> we<00:04:39.630> got

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
here tuck that back either way we got

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.300 
here tuck that back either way we got
all<00:04:39.930> four<00:04:40.199> bolts<00:04:40.380> whenever<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.889> got<00:04:41.039> four

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
all four bolts whenever you got four

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.670 
all four bolts whenever you got four
case<00:04:41.580> bolts<00:04:41.940> here<00:04:42.120> got<00:04:42.630> studs<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.259> you<00:04:43.349> taking
