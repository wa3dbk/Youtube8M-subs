different<00:00:29.320> models<00:00:29.440> it's<00:00:30.310> one<00:00:30.460> in<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:30.670> same

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
different models it's one in the same

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.080 
different models it's one in the same
series<00:00:31.450> that<00:00:31.690> would<00:00:31.780> be<00:00:31.840> similar<00:00:32.169> to<00:00:32.200> this<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
series that would be similar to this and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.970 
series that would be similar to this and
work<00:00:34.300> about<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.720> same<00:00:34.900> way<00:00:35.110> so<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.829> will

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
work about the same way so this will

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
but also other ones that are similar as

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.940 
but also other ones that are similar as
well<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:48.250> this<00:00:48.910> is<00:00:48.970> a<00:00:49.649> cross-cut<00:00:50.649> paper

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
well so this is a cross-cut paper

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.600 
well so this is a cross-cut paper
shredder<00:00:51.430> so<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.630> cuts<00:00:52.930> in<00:00:53.079> such<00:00:53.260> a<00:00:53.290> way<00:00:53.530> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
shredder so it cuts in such a way that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.549 
shredder so it cuts in such a way that
makes<00:00:54.610> it<00:00:54.790> next<00:00:55.720> nearly<00:00:55.960> impossible<00:00:56.200> for

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
makes it next nearly impossible for

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.920 
makes it next nearly impossible for
someone<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.100> try<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:57.880> piece<00:00:58.420> those<00:00:58.660> things

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
someone to try to piece those things

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.350 
someone to try to piece those things
back<00:00:59.110> together<00:00:59.320> so<00:00:59.710> it's<00:00:59.860> really<00:01:00.070> secure<00:01:00.820> way

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
back together so it's really secure way

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.829 
back together so it's really secure way
to<00:01:01.410> shred<00:01:02.410> paper<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:03.670> does<00:01:03.820> have<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.570> fill

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
to shred paper it does have the fill

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.590 
to shred paper it does have the fill
basket<00:01:05.260> here<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.940> have<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:06.970> little<00:01:07.299> head<00:01:07.450> over

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
basket here and have a little head over

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.180 
basket here and have a little head over
here<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.900> just<00:01:08.080> pulls<00:01:08.290> out<00:01:08.440> really<00:01:08.650> easy<00:01:08.890> you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
here it just pulls out really easy you

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.190 
here it just pulls out really easy you
can<00:01:09.790> see<00:01:10.000> stuff<00:01:10.240> that's<00:01:10.299> been<00:01:10.690> shredded

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200

can see stuff that's been shredded
already<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.010> so<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.220> can<00:01:12.340> take<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.520> in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
already and so you can take that in

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.420 
already and so you can take that in
India<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.720> then<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:13.960> push<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.590> back<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:14.950> the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
India and then you push it back in the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.890 
India and then you push it back in the
handle<00:01:15.700> also<00:01:15.850> works<00:01:16.180> well<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.510> move<00:01:16.659> it<00:01:16.810> around

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
handle also works well to move it around

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.560 
handle also works well to move it around
it<00:01:17.650> does<00:01:17.860> have<00:01:18.130> wheels<00:01:18.369> it's<00:01:19.090> easy<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.390> roll

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
it does have wheels it's easy to roll

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.240 
it does have wheels it's easy to roll
around<00:01:19.659> if<00:01:20.049> you<00:01:20.140> need<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.440> move<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.799> around<00:01:20.860> to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
around if you need to move it around to

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.170 
around if you need to move it around to
a<00:01:21.700> different<00:01:21.790> desk<00:01:22.450> or<00:01:22.720> something<00:01:23.200> like<00:01:23.380> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
a different desk or something like that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.940 
a different desk or something like that
and<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.330> also<00:01:25.450> has<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.990> sort<00:01:26.560> of<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.740> mesh

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
and it also has the sort of the mesh

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.530 
and it also has the sort of the mesh
see-through<00:01:27.430> front<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:27.940> you<00:01:28.030> can<00:01:28.090> see<00:01:28.390> how

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
see-through front so you can see how

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.240 
see-through front so you can see how
cool<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.290> know<00:01:29.409> when<00:01:29.560> it's<00:01:29.710> timed<00:01:29.979> and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
cool it is and know when it's timed and

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.940 
cool it is and know when it's timed and
D<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.520> out<00:01:30.640> if<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.659> look<00:01:31.810> at<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.049> front<00:01:32.350> or<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
D it out if you look at the front or the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.399 
D it out if you look at the front or the
top<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.340> should<00:01:33.520> say<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:34.240> has<00:01:34.450> an<00:01:34.600> on/off<00:01:34.869> button

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
top I should say it has an on/off button

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.289 
top I should say it has an on/off button
so<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.830> can<00:01:35.860> switch<00:01:36.189> it<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.490> or<00:01:36.820> off<00:01:36.850> which<00:01:37.180> I

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
so you can switch it on or off which I

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.520 
so you can switch it on or off which I
like<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.780> can<00:01:37.900> leave<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.140> off<00:01:38.260> when<00:01:38.439> you're

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
like you can leave it off when you're

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.740 
like you can leave it off when you're
not<00:01:38.590> using<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.340> also<00:01:39.790> has<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.090> forward<00:01:40.659> and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
not using it it also has a forward and

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.160 
not using it it also has a forward and
reverse<00:01:40.840> button<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:42.040> if<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:43.509> example<00:01:43.570> if<00:01:44.020> you

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
reverse button so if for example if you

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.740 
reverse button so if for example if you
happen<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.740> get<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.100> jam<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.670> there<00:01:45.880> maybe<00:01:46.630> you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
happen to get a jam in there maybe you

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.960 
happen to get a jam in there maybe you
put<00:01:46.990> more<00:01:47.500> than<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:48.159> should<00:01:48.430> have<00:01:48.580> been<00:01:48.729> there

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
put more than you should have been there

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.499 
put more than you should have been there
it<00:01:49.659> handles<00:01:50.560> 14<00:01:51.009> sheets<00:01:51.310> at<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.490> time<00:01:51.729> but<00:01:52.000> maybe

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
it handles 14 sheets at a time but maybe

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.929
