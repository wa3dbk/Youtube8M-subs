about<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> hundred<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
about a hundred can be a little bit up a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.770 
about a hundred can be a little bit up a
little<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.130> lower<00:01:38.340> than<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.030> 100<00:01:39.659> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
little bit lower than that but 100 is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.600 
little bit lower than that but 100 is
pretty<00:01:40.200> much<00:01:40.350> bat<00:01:40.619> right<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.310> mark

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
pretty much bat right there on the mark

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.609 
pretty much bat right there on the mark
and<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:42.240> another<00:01:42.570> way<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.079> check<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.470> i

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and then another way you can check if i

define it is breathing this is very

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050 
define it is breathing this is very

breath<00:01:57.620> for<00:01:57.800> every<00:01:57.950> seconds<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:58.550> can<00:01:58.700> see

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
breath for every seconds and you can see

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.610 
breath for every seconds and you can see
why<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.090> nostrils<00:01:59.810> when<00:01:59.990> they're<00:02:00.110> flaring
