00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.890
 hello my name is tobias of display 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.420
 customs this is the first part of one 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.700
 video series with the name best in the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 castings what do you actually do? 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 background for the videos i will 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.690
 Quite often asked what I do so in performance 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.130
 offer then it is always relative 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 consuming to enumerate all this individually 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
 then you can imagine that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.619
 therefore, I have previously based on one 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.270
 For example, you may have already 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 asked why such a series naldo behind 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.390
 I can demonstrate what we are like 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.550
 a performance of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.160
 that is to say full adhesion writing 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.739
 sound deepening capable 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 Of course, a little something in the gate area 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.950
 I also want you a bit 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.700
 to be codecision that means we 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.260
 Be a bit beyond the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 commentary on youtube also at 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.149
 Just try facebook suggestions 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.290
 and then you can 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.070
 decide in which direction the whole 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.170
 should go 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.030
 yes we will cooperate with 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.710
 some larger partners are still 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.879
 Introduce the products and the whole 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.890
 then build on 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.329
 The goal of the conversion is not a vehicle too 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.190
 construct something with cup cars 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.329
 can keep up with 40 15,000 euros in it 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.519
 stuck but it is about the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.770
 to obtain useful value of the vehicle and 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.909
 to demonstrate which individual performances 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.740
 like in detail 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.100
 that thinks everything is small 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.179
 video series are looking forward to a nice 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.229
 before having a comparison 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.420
 look at the car again now 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.729
 shortly in detail 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.270
 So as I said that is a liter lupo 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.389
 Absolutely series the height of the chassis 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.069
 borderline state says relatively well 

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:31.319
 a few small scratches on that scratched 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.179
 cars ten years old so everything in the 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.770
 frame no big bumps that is it 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.709
 fits perfectly so could the vehicle 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.459
 well lose otherwise otherwise standard 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:43.409
 condition both in the front area at the 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.700
 side as well as in the back few 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.189
 kleinigkeiten they have been modified 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.039
 here somehow see a hat rest 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.539
 now what sound board 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.639
 otherwise the lupo is really relative 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.049
 series we will change shortly 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:57.869
 So do not get so used to that 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.549
 Appearance of this logo 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.530
 Video series will be divided into nine 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.180
 insist that interested in just now 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.159
 video if the parts of the car 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.049
 free those who are unnecessary 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.550
 in the second video we will be the slices 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.530
 and set stripes inwent and shine 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.240
 Rebuilt the fourth video then shows 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
 Chassis conversion and probably that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.319
 assemble a few aspire to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.690
 fifth video is then about rims and 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.100
 mature sixth video then a partial and 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.640
 full board of the body 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.739
 include slides and decors will be in the 7 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.270
 video will be mounted in the eighth part 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.950
 Let's go see the giant red ones 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.440
 make taillights and one 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.610
 Apply transparent film and apply one 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.260
 last video is about the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.060
 Water transport that means there would be then 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 interior parts with what that 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.650
 be coated 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.030
 this survey shows, for one thing in 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.620
 the next videos will be shown 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.690
 answered on the other side 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.239
 pretty precise the question West Berlin 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.110
 customs what do you actually do 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.700
 You should be interested in this small 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.920
 conversion series, I would be happy if 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.050
 you subscribe to the channel falls to you something 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.670
 on what is in need of improvement or 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.250
 do you have constructive criticism then 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.570
 write me your comment otherwise 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.020
 Of course you will find us too
