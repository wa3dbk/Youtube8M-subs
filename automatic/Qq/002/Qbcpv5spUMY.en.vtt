00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
ever seen so I felt very formulaic and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.090 
ever seen so I felt very formulaic and
cliched<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.140> can<00:02:47.290> kind<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.680> predict

what was going to happen before it

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.420 
what was going to happen before it
happened<00:02:50.080> because<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.800> pretty<00:02:50.980> sure<00:02:51.220> you've

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
happened because you pretty sure you've

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
just made it really really predictable

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.460 
just made it really really predictable
it<00:02:57.730> did<00:02:58.000> have<00:02:58.209> me<00:02:58.450> did<00:02:58.810> have<00:02:58.959> some<00:02:59.170> points<00:02:59.440> that

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
left me feel a little bit disturbed and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.640 
left me feel a little bit disturbed and
creeped<00:03:01.209> out<00:03:01.330> primarily<00:03:02.050> had<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.320> do<00:03:02.440> with<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
creeped out primarily had to do with the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.009 
creeped out primarily had to do with the
psychological<00:03:03.130> bits<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.000> book<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.630> moments

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
psychological bits the book the moments

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.530 
psychological bits the book the moments
where<00:03:05.170> Dan<00:03:05.410> was<00:03:05.709> feeling<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.310> little<00:03:06.489> bit<00:03:06.820> like

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
where Dan was feeling a little bit like

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.300 
where Dan was feeling a little bit like
he<00:03:07.780> himself<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.290> going<00:03:08.500> insane<00:03:08.800> who's<00:03:09.100> having

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
he himself is going insane who's having

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.949 
he himself is going insane who's having
lapses<00:03:09.850> in<00:03:09.970> his<00:03:10.090> memory<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.810> can't

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
lapses in his memory and you can't

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.060 
lapses in his memory and you can't
remember<00:03:11.140> doing<00:03:11.290> certain<00:03:11.530> things<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.950> stuff

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
remember doing certain things and stuff

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.410 
remember doing certain things and stuff
like<00:03:12.160> that's<00:03:12.370> always<00:03:12.519> creeped<00:03:12.850> me<00:03:12.880> out<00:03:13.030> anyway

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
like that's always creeped me out anyway

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.759 
like that's always creeped me out anyway
no<00:03:13.630> matter<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.230> book<00:03:14.440> or<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> movie

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
no matter if it's in a book or a movie

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.259 
no matter if it's in a book or a movie
so<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.220> part<00:03:15.430> was<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.610> little<00:03:15.940> bit<00:03:16.060> creepy

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
so that part was a little bit creepy

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.820 
so that part was a little bit creepy
that<00:03:16.959> part<00:03:17.140> left<00:03:17.290> me<00:03:17.380> feels<00:03:17.560> like<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.739> little

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
that part left me feels like a little

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.500 
that part left me feels like a little
bit<00:03:17.920> good<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.640> need<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.000> gonna<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.209> something

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
bit good I need you gonna be something

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.210 
bit good I need you gonna be something
happy<00:03:19.840> now<00:03:20.019> type<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.560> feeling<00:03:20.920> which<00:03:21.100> I

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
happy now type of a feeling which I

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.210 
happy now type of a feeling which I
suppose<00:03:21.660> it's<00:03:22.660> good<00:03:22.959> because<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.320> is<00:03:23.920> pretty

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
suppose it's good because that is pretty

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.710 
suppose it's good because that is pretty
much<00:03:24.400> what<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.640> book<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:25.030> driving<00:03:25.540> at<00:03:25.690> I

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
much what this book is driving at I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.270 
much what this book is driving at I
guess<00:03:26.049> is<00:03:26.230> making<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.590> feel<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.799> little<00:03:27.010> bit

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
guess is making you feel a little bit

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.080 
guess is making you feel a little bit
creeped<00:03:27.579> out

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
creeped out

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.729 
creeped out
overall<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.510> didn't<00:03:28.720> find<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:28.959> that<00:03:28.989> scary<00:03:29.380> and

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
overall I didn't find it that scary and

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.830 
overall I didn't find it that scary and
in<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.430> end<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.700> pretty<00:03:30.850> much<00:03:31.000> predicted<00:03:31.630> most

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
in the end I pretty much predicted most

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.210 
in the end I pretty much predicted most
of<00:03:31.959> what<00:03:32.049> happened<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.709> end<00:03:32.829> of<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.040> book

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
of what happened in the end of the book

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.020 
of what happened in the end of the book
which<00:03:33.400> is<00:03:33.430> always<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.730> little<00:03:33.820> bit

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
which is always a little bit

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.160 
which is always a little bit
disappointing<00:03:34.540> when<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.690> end<00:03:34.840> up<00:03:34.930> predicting

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
disappointing when you end up predicting

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.870 
disappointing when you end up predicting
something<00:03:35.709> that's<00:03:35.829> gonna<00:03:35.920> happen<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.459> mean<00:03:36.820> you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
something that's gonna happen I mean you

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.039 
something that's gonna happen I mean you
don't<00:03:36.940> even<00:03:37.060> do<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.360> consciously<00:03:37.570> you're<00:03:37.930> just

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
don't even do it consciously you're just

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.330 
don't even do it consciously you're just
kinda<00:03:38.200> like<00:03:38.260> oh<00:03:38.440> okay<00:03:38.739> this<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:39.010> gonna<00:03:39.130> happen

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
kinda like oh okay this is gonna happen

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.130 
kinda like oh okay this is gonna happen
next<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.850> bet<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.269> gonna<00:03:40.390> happen<00:03:40.630> but<00:03:41.110> Oh

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
next I bet this is gonna happen but Oh

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.590 
next I bet this is gonna happen but Oh
move<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.250> evitable<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.970> does<00:03:43.180> in<00:03:43.510> this

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
move on and evitable it does in this

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.400 
move on and evitable it does in this
case<00:03:43.660> inevitably<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.739> did<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.660> yeah<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:47.290> was

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
case inevitably it did so yeah that was

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.050 
case inevitably it did so yeah that was
kind<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.739> downside<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.310> book<00:03:48.430> for<00:03:48.640> me<00:03:48.700> as

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
kind of a downside to the book for me as

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.250 
kind of a downside to the book for me as
for<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.420> characters<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.959> feel<00:03:50.079> like<00:03:50.170> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
for the characters I feel like the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.660 
for the characters I feel like the
overall<00:03:50.560> character<00:03:50.890> development<00:03:51.250> was<00:03:51.459> pretty

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
overall character development was pretty

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.580 
overall character development was pretty
weak<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:52.090> felt<00:03:52.390> like<00:03:52.570> all<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.110> characters

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
weak I felt like all of the characters

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.449 
weak I felt like all of the characters
themselves<00:03:53.829> fell<00:03:54.400> into<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:55.360> typical<00:03:56.459> horror

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
themselves fell into the typical horror

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.720 
themselves fell into the typical horror
story<00:03:57.970> tropes<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.019> find<00:03:59.320> in<00:03:59.730> movies

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
story tropes that you find in movies

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.130 
story tropes that you find in movies
anyway<00:04:01.150> Nessa<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:01.480> don't<00:04:01.690> know<00:04:01.780> I'm<00:04:01.840> sure<00:04:01.900> you

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
anyway Nessa I don't know I'm sure you

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.390 
anyway Nessa I don't know I'm sure you
find<00:04:02.260> them<00:04:02.440> in<00:04:02.530> books<00:04:02.709> too<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.100> I<00:04:03.130> don't<00:04:03.190> read

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
find them in books too but I don't read

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.069 
find them in books too but I don't read
that<00:04:03.519> much<00:04:03.610> more<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.060> can't<00:04:04.269> really<00:04:04.450> speak

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
that much more so I can't really speak

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.020 
that much more so I can't really speak
for<00:04:05.470> books<00:04:05.709> but<00:04:05.980> in<00:04:06.100> terms<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.430> horror<00:04:06.670> movies

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
for books but in terms of horror movies

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.310 
for books but in terms of horror movies
I<00:04:07.239> felt<00:04:07.420> like<00:04:07.510> these<00:04:07.660> characters<00:04:07.810> fell<00:04:08.200> into

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
I felt like these characters fell into

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.100 
I felt like these characters fell into
those<00:04:08.470> categories<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.549> have<00:04:09.730> the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
those categories so you have the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.990 
those categories so you have the
conflicted<00:04:11.110> main<00:04:11.519> protagonist<00:04:12.519> with<00:04:12.760> this

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
conflicted main protagonist with this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.580 
conflicted main protagonist with this
sort<00:04:13.959> of<00:04:14.370> hairy<00:04:15.370> dark<00:04:15.880> past<00:04:16.449> like<00:04:16.989> things<00:04:17.410> have

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
sort of hairy dark past like things have

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.860 
sort of hairy dark past like things have
happened<00:04:17.739> in<00:04:18.010> his<00:04:18.160> path

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
happened in his path

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.230 
happened in his path
that<00:04:19.320> he<00:04:20.130> has<00:04:20.250> been<00:04:20.490> obviously<00:04:20.730> trying<00:04:21.150> to

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
you know I don't know it was just the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.660 
you know I don't know it was just the
way<00:06:01.440> he<00:06:01.470> was<00:06:01.680> acting<00:06:01.860> in<00:06:02.040> the<00:06:02.160> book<00:06:02.340> kind<00:06:02.580> of

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
way he was acting in the book kind of

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.280 
way he was acting in the book kind of
got<00:06:02.850> on<00:06:03.000> my<00:06:03.090> nerves<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:03.510> feel<00:06:03.690> like<00:06:03.840> even<00:06:04.110> for<00:06:04.260> a

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
got on my nerves I feel like even for a

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.480 
got on my nerves I feel like even for a
seventeen-year-old<00:06:04.860> he<00:06:05.100> was<00:06:05.250> pretty

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
seventeen-year-old he was pretty

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.490 
seventeen-year-old he was pretty
immature<00:06:06.060> I<00:06:06.510> feel<00:06:06.660> like<00:06:06.750> he's<00:06:06.870> acting<00:06:07.260> more

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
immature I feel like he's acting more

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.490 
immature I feel like he's acting more
like<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.770> 12<00:06:08.100> year<00:06:08.160> old<00:06:08.430> should<00:06:08.880> act<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.750> just<00:06:10.020> it

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
like a 12 year old should act it just it

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.630 
like a 12 year old should act it just it
was<00:06:10.620> something<00:06:10.890> I<00:06:10.950> really<00:06:11.130> got<00:06:11.280> on<00:06:11.430> my<00:06:11.580> nerves

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
throughout the whole book

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.480 
throughout the whole book
I<00:06:12.750> thought<00:06:13.170> the<00:06:13.290> parents<00:06:13.500> reactions<00:06:14.280> was<00:06:14.460> a

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
I thought the parents reactions was a

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.770 
I thought the parents reactions was a
little<00:06:14.790> bit<00:06:14.880> unrealistic<00:06:15.210> when<00:06:15.480> creepy

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
little bit unrealistic when creepy

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.900 
little bit unrealistic when creepy
things<00:06:16.020> started<00:06:16.290> happening<00:06:16.440> in<00:06:17.010> this<00:06:17.580> book

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
things started happening in this book

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.060 
things started happening in this book
and<00:06:18.150> people<00:06:18.240> were<00:06:18.480> becoming<00:06:18.840> harmed<00:06:19.350> the<00:06:19.800> fact

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
and people were becoming harmed the fact

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.530 
and people were becoming harmed the fact
that<00:06:20.280> his<00:06:20.430> parents<00:06:20.460> when<00:06:21.180> he<00:06:21.210> tells<00:06:21.450> his

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
that his parents when he tells his

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.000 
that his parents when he tells his
parents<00:06:21.630> know<00:06:21.930> I<00:06:21.960> want<00:06:22.320> to<00:06:22.380> stay<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:22.890> they're

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
parents know I want to stay and they're

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.550 
parents know I want to stay and they're

don't get killed I just thought it was a
little<00:06:27.840> bit<00:06:28.020> ridiculous<00:06:28.410> I<00:06:28.680> feel<00:06:28.860> like<00:06:29.070> if

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
their parents might have had a little

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.740 
their parents might have had a little
bit<00:06:33.100> more<00:06:33.220> say<00:06:33.760> about<00:06:34.210> whether<00:06:34.420> or<00:06:34.510> not<00:06:34.540> he

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
bit more say about whether or not he

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.420 
bit more say about whether or not he
should<00:06:34.930> stay<00:06:35.170> there<00:06:35.380> not<00:06:35.890> to<00:06:36.040> mention<00:06:36.190> the

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
should stay there not to mention the
