00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
I wasn't put together very well you know

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.900 
I wasn't put together very well you know
needed<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.210> tune-up<00:00:48.420> right<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.350> get-go

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
needed a tune-up right out of the get-go

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.709 
needed a tune-up right out of the get-go
yeah<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.120> kind<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.320> expect

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
yeah just kind of what you would expect

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.420 
yeah just kind of what you would expect
but<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.020> any<00:00:55.170> case<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.129> thought<00:00:56.280> I'd

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
but in any case for this I thought I'd

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.770 
but in any case for this I thought I'd
give<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.760> shot<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.140> there's<00:00:59.780> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
give it a shot you can see there's a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
give it a shot you can see there's a
little<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.530> damage<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.489> box

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
wheels and disc brakes because I have a

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.740 
wheels and disc brakes because I have a
have<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> 105<00:01:52.350> group<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.790> some<00:01:54.630> other

have a 105 group and some other

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.830 
have a 105 group and some other
components<00:01:55.409> sitting<00:01:55.740> around<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.369> basically<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
components sitting around so basically I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.270 
components sitting around so basically I
obviously<00:01:57.840> bought<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.409> strip<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
obviously bought it to strip all the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
obviously bought it to strip all the
parts<00:01:59.640> off<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> has<00:02:00.719> this

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
parts off you know I think it has this

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.060 
parts off you know I think it has this
has<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> tie<00:02:01.649> agri<00:02:02.040> or<00:02:02.219> Sora<00:02:02.810> drivetrain<00:02:04.070> but

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
has a tie agri or Sora drivetrain but

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.830 
has a tie agri or Sora drivetrain but
I'll<00:02:05.280> basically<00:02:05.490> take<00:02:05.909> out<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.360> off<00:02:06.570> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
I'll basically take out all that off and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.309 
I'll basically take out all that off and
put<00:02:06.899> my<00:02:07.740> 105<00:02:08.340> stuff<00:02:08.700> on

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
put my 105 stuff on

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.599 
put my 105 stuff on
so<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> figured<00:02:12.019> it'll<00:02:13.019> be<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> good<00:02:13.439> deal<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:14.250> the

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
so I figured it'll be a good deal in the

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.479 
so I figured it'll be a good deal in the
end<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.319> not<00:02:16.319> more<00:02:16.560> nicely<00:02:16.859> put<00:02:17.340> together

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
end and not more nicely put together

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:43.699 
end and not more nicely put together
than<00:02:35.870> alright<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:39.959> see<00:02:42.560> how<00:02:43.560> they

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
than alright so you can see how they

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.399 
than alright so you can see how they

well in any case so yeah I'm gonna
basically<00:03:13.139> rebuild<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.739> bike<00:03:14.209> with<00:03:15.229> 105

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:16.229 
basically rebuild this bike with 105

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:21.110 
basically rebuild this bike with 105
drivetrain<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:18.150> had<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.359> triple<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.340> think<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.400> ate

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
drivetrain it had a triple I think I ate

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.420 
drivetrain it had a triple I think I ate
in<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.510> back<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.680> I'll<00:03:22.769> put<00:03:22.949> a<00:03:22.979> nine<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
in the back so I'll put a nine on the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.119 
in the back so I'll put a nine on the
back<00:03:23.699> and<00:03:23.909> then<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.060> got<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.239> compact<00:03:24.750> double<00:03:25.169> so

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
back and then I got a compact double so

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.000 
back and then I got a compact double so
it'll<00:03:26.519> be<00:03:27.169> should<00:03:28.169> be<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> nice<00:03:28.470> little<00:03:28.739> you

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
oh yeah like I said I like that it had a

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.429 
oh yeah like I said I like that it had a
carbon<00:03:50.010> fork<00:03:52.790> cuz<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.819> lot<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.299> lower<00:03:55.199> end

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
carbon fork cuz a lot of the lower end

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.819 
carbon fork cuz a lot of the lower end
ones<00:03:55.620> just<00:03:55.769> have<00:03:55.949> a<00:03:55.979> steel<00:03:56.250> fork<00:03:56.609> but<00:03:57.829> carbon

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
ones just have a steel fork but carbon

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.069 
ones just have a steel fork but carbon
fork<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.280> it's<00:03:59.370> got<00:03:59.609> uh<00:04:02.299> yeah<00:04:03.299> it's<00:04:03.629> got<00:04:03.780> disc

fork and it's got uh yeah it's got disc

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.649 
fork and it's got uh yeah it's got disc
so<00:04:04.790> anyways<00:04:05.790> I'll<00:04:05.939> probably<00:04:06.120> post<00:04:06.359> some

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
so anyways I'll probably post some

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.439 
so anyways I'll probably post some
videos<00:04:06.989> about<00:04:07.019> my<00:04:07.530> process<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:08.340> stripping<00:04:09.269> the

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
videos about my process of stripping the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.770 
videos about my process of stripping the
parts<00:04:09.689> off<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.199> putting<00:04:10.669> the<00:04:11.669> new<00:04:12.299> parts<00:04:12.629> on

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
parts off and putting the new parts on

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.259 
parts off and putting the new parts on
and<00:04:13.049> building<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.409> bike<00:04:13.530> up<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.269> I'll

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
and building the bike up so I'll

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.670 
and building the bike up so I'll
probably<00:04:15.449> put<00:04:15.720> some<00:04:15.870> links<00:04:16.049> in<00:04:16.229> this<00:04:16.349> video

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
probably put some links in this video

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.609 
probably put some links in this video
for<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.039> sort<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.370> stuff
