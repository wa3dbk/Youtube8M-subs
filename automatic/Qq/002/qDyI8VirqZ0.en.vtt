 synonymous videos but which one on one and that's why 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.870

 Example music is not so 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.469
 the bad 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.450
 here that, for example, we had already open 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.300
 No you say okay 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.230
 Cold Kobe 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.430

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.120
 and if, for example, a once 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.200

 Proprietary trading or not even several 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.290
 with foundations class down 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.390
 in Coppito Pecina you will have to go around the places Rhodes next to it 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 to sort that again 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.439
 For example, selecting songs can be done here 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.479
 Linkin Park is received 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.619
 please more directness 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.319
 Title from Linkin Park 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.099

 SG Telgte Altort not be stronger 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.690
 the iPod to say goodbye in Switzerland is also about eject 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.510
 What it means is he is charged by electricity but Hall again 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.570
 then it can be served because if Shen te 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:13.259
 you can only dpa things here this was not really important 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.229
 and here the iPod can restore so if you already gave it there 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.229
 then you can make the iPod Touch iPod from it completely 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.469
 Create Unite Commander Playlists 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.119
 So for example 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.119
 yes not always in the cone of light 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.809
 the influential 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.809
 I call it a comparison here 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.479
 So I'm pushing 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.979
 Jonsson as synonymous with iTunes as synonymous push over 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.849

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.449

 Uli Statements Copy Photos to Pius XII 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.259
 but he does not avoid it differently 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.749
 At least you can see the photos like that 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:18.060
