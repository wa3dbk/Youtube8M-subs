00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
for a fairly good start there's a 3.2

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.229 
for a fairly good start there's a 3.2

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.880 
terms of stills quality on balance it's
probably<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> equal<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> n95
