00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:18.029
 It is full of bacteria and they are going to die 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.220
 but friends once again in this section 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.220
 he met empty stephany 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.309
 because it's good that we put several 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.899
 Little fish are all tropical fish 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.440
 but so that more or less they know the 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.070
 types classes there are vital records 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.100
 but what are these fish called 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.589
 well look if you notice this is good 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 orange and the biggest oranges together 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:57.969
 with that white are Japanese fish and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.949
 within them there are already varieties in 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.370
 As for the shape of the tail there is a tail 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:07.240
 mermaid bridal veil comet star 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.880
 butterfly and moore but they are 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.280
 Japanese is the gray landmarks that 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.720
 they look like little triangles are up there and 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.120
 the angel fish 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.990
 there are also in several shades the 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.300
 Most are silver-gray oral and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.970
 young children staying in the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.970
 surface of the fish tank are zebra weights 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.630
 they are another type of fish and areas and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.450
 little ones and all these fish 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.040
 tropical eat the same if everyone eats 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.870
 ojuela that is like a wafer that 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.800
 spread here on top of the fish tank and they 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.440
 nothing they eat it and more or less like when 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.360
 the fish come to live 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.360
 they live between 3 and 5 years 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.260
 that is important depending on the number 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.270
 of fish that have in their fish tank what 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.490
 ideal is to be given twice of 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.789
 eat in the morning and in the evening two 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.100
 months and two people good but sometimes 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.870
 what you blow bubbles this because this one 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.239
 does not have bubbles nothing happens to them or 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.790
 as I explained my good right now the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.040
 we put like that nothing else to present them 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.180
 but they carry the whole system of 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.120
 filtration that is a filter that goes here 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.230
 inside that produces bubbles that creates the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.650
 oxygen 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.720
 then it continues to oxygenate the water of the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.239
 which little fish take that oxygen 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.390
 to live and if they do not eat it it's going to 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.390
 die 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.310
 that we have fish of different 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.290
 species together if nothing else is 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.720
 important that when they acquire a 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.930
 fish tank ask the aquarium that 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.600
 fish can combine because there are 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.520
 that are aggressive and eat others and 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.170
 for example, if they ever reach 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.090
 have a big Japanese 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.420
 I assure you that those little ones are going to 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.220
 serve as food 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.920
 since they can vitamins to water or 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.990
 something is put in several droplets 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.760
 droplets that help neutralize the 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.860
 water chlorine heavy metals 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.770
 also that help the little fish 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.510
 always have your mucous membrane protected in 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:26.120
 body or question this fish also 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.030
 they get sick they also get sick 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.340
 parasitic bacterial diseases the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.900
 doctor and some recommendation that we 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.629
 I have passed 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.709
 then when they go to the aquarium to acquire 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.379
 your fish tank 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.989
 It is important that you test the temperature 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.120
 and in which the fish and 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.470
 prices that can be combined with the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.470
 type of food that you have to give 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:02.890
 also the system to continue in his 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.890
 Program 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.430
