00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.629
 there are many more goals 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.039
 and here we start to see it this is the first 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.219
 The p 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.309
 turned 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.309
 francisco dutari head after the center of carranza 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.210
 barrier garro 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.669
 the appointment will be against godoy cross 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.669
 let's see how many touches 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.610
 by seguiriya 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 its correlate in the second time especially 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.600
 this action 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.760
 that changed the game 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.980
 it was not tiger's goal 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.820
 and yet 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
 this gentleman norberto moyano assistant validated 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.250
 you are welcome 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.190
 efe 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.090
 the red cross project that can be advanced 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.090
 the one who decides 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.780
 the white side for tigers 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.150
 the first round 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 and the half-turn of lazarov inside 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.020
 again the action 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.020
 most discussed date 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.430
 but it was clearly seen that it equals follow time free shot carranza 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.500
 crossbar 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.040
 the ball will return to the area 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 and that is that Korrika is definitely Leonard Sigali 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.040
 God gave me one of the great figures of the afternoon 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.900
 so the person at the auction 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.260
 and another exit with the bow available 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.900
 sentenced the result 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 26 pointer of the drivers' championship 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.720
