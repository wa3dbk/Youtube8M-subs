00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.630
 hello to all friends of toms and just 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.300
 the zenbook ux31 has arrived in the editorial office 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.430
 new ultra thin asus to come 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.450
 officially presented in Italy at 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.360
 month of April 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.400
 you can see it here is one of the products 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.160
 thinner than there are in circulation 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.780
 the thickness at the highest point of the 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.360
 base is 12.3 mm is thinner 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.370
 still compared to the new macbook from 12 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.510
 inch announced by apple that instead 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.960
 the zenbook is 13.1 mm thick 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.070
 weeks 305 will be available in several 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.560
 configurations 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.350
 we currently don't have the 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.370
 detail of Italy from the evidence that 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.820
 our colleagues did 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.470
 US laptopmag we know that 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.030
 will be in circulation both in the version 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.330
 with 1900 20 x 1080 pixel display either 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.009
 in the one with 3200 display per thousand 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.630
 and 800 pixels 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.079
 the model we received as proof 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.170
 in this case it is precisely the 3200 for 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.950
 one thousand and 800 pixels opaque without functions 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.219
 touch 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.409
 the configuration we repeat we do not know 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.929
 if it will be one of those definitive ones 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.049
 will arrive in Italy in this case 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:33.369
 provides the intel core processor m da 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.189
 800 megahertz with 4GB of RAM e 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.200
 a ssd 128 gb 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.960
 one of the most interesting aspects of 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.439
 this notebook has the thickness is the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.509
 connectivity in fact contrary to 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.880
 other products that have a number 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.859
 lower than doors in this case 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.679
 we find two USB 3.0 connectors and the 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:00.009
 sd memory card reader on a 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.259
 side and on the other side a third 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.709
 usb 3.0 connector 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.189
 the power socket the mini hd e 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.610
 never 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.569
 and a combo jack for microphone and 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.970
 headset 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.060
 as you can see on the panel below 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.740
 there are no counters and you can't 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.470
 even remove the battery 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.680
 the only thing we find 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.620
 it's the two thanks for the speakers 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.720
 Finally, note the standard keyboard in 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.370
 this case to the US layout but 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.770
 we already know that the one that will arrive in 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.980
 Italy obviously will be Italian and 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.590
 the large touchpad one of the weak points 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.360
 of this product is the lack of 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.760
 keypad backlighting that 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.520
 probably it was an asus choice 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.500
 to keep the price low on amazon 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.140
 in fact they are already available 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.500
 import versions of this 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.980
 produced at prices around 870 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.160
 EUR 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.540
 for now it's all up to date 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.400
 very soon with the word product 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.400
 complete in the meantime we greet you
