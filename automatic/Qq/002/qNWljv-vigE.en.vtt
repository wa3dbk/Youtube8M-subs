more clearly what this notion of social
justice<00:01:50.370> education<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.450> about<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:53.990> think<00:01:54.990> when

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
justice education is about I think when

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.960 
justice education is about I think when
we<00:01:55.530> talk<00:01:55.560> about<00:01:55.740> academic<00:01:56.580> learning<00:01:56.880> in

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970

schools<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.510> academic<00:01:58.500> standards<00:01:58.950> in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
schools and academic standards in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
schools and academic standards in
schools<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.670> think<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> bottom

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
schools I think that's the bottom

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.690 
schools I think that's the bottom
threshold<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.130> our<00:02:02.280> students

threshold of what we want our students

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.120 
threshold of what we want our students
to<00:02:02.760> achieve<00:02:03.300> and<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.229> bottom<00:02:04.410> threshold

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
to achieve and at the bottom threshold

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550 
to achieve and at the bottom threshold
of<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.510> what<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:07.290> team

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
of what we want of what I want my team

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.889
