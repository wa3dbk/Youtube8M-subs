00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 in the 17th century robert hooke proposed to 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.210
 isaac newton the idea of â€‹â€‹building a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.059
 train that will go through the center 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.360
 planet earth a train that was capable 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.510
 to get from the extreme north to the extreme 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.480
 south today we're going to talk about this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.180
 idea because already in the 21st century we have 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.400
 the technologies needed to start 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.830
 to think about a project of this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 The truth is that the day of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.079
 today there are very powerful excavators 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.809
 but to be able to carry out this 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.480
 project in which a train would go through 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.040
 to the earth from the north pole to the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 South pole from north to south, let's say 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.559
 it would need to be part of 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.660
 the excavator many knowledge 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.989
 aerodynamic to start the only 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.130
 way to do it would be to remove extract 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.070
 all the air 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.340
 thing thing that would be obviously impossible 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.560
 extract all the air from that hole a 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.290
 hole that would measure thousands of 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.900
 kilometers after having eliminated the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.400
 air friction force the train 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.150
 could go down and up constantly in 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.430
 42 minutes that is from north to south 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.270
 it would take to cross the entire planet on 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.210
 diameter of our planet 42 minutes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 reaching speeds of up to 27,000 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.090
 kilometers per hour and hardly spending 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.790
 fuel only with the strength of 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.570
 the gravity if you have studied physics 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.040
 you will know that if you throw a good body in 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.400
 this same problem if you guys 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.290
 you throw a body from the most part 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.050
 in the afternoon from the northern part of the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.850
 planet to the southern part the most point 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.700
 away from the northern part to the most 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.210
 away from the southern part when it reaches 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.630
 center of gravity all that speed and 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.940
 The energy it carries will make it happen once 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.580
 the center go slower slower 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.610
 slower and repeat the 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.090
 travel all without spending anything of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.090
 Energy 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.920
 as you can see it is always attracted towards 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.349
 the center reaches the center and how it leads 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.930
 speed will slow down until it slows down 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.659
 completely fall again and returns to 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.599
 repeat the process over and over again a 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.640
 train on energy issues as 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.500
 the truth is that it would be 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.599
 impressive also would not that 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.700
 analyze what impact it would have on the 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.670
 terrestrial nucleus perform this type of 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.489
 perforations and if there is any kind of 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.490
 material that is capable of isolating thousands 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.830
 of degrees centigrade of heat 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.500
 after all it is only the 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.690
 hypothesis of robert hooke a man who 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.790
 He lived a few centuries ago but 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.460
 that you have not sown an idea of â€‹â€‹what 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.170
 that may be a future perhaps in a 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.690
 near future when we have more 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.000
 means and more knowledge we are 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.900
 able to cross the entire planet in 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.900
 42 minutes
