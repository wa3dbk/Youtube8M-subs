00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.140 
now we can start doing the second gym
and<00:00:06.170> this<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.890> first<00:00:07.919> Bachmann's<00:00:08.550> Metapod

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
and this is the first Bachmann's Metapod

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.070 
and this is the first Bachmann's Metapod
it<00:00:09.929> isn't<00:00:10.320> difficult<00:00:10.639> it<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:12.269> time<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.840> one

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
it isn't difficult it this time this one

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.599 
it isn't difficult it this time this one
does<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:14.009> tax<00:00:14.670> which<00:00:15.000> can<00:00:15.330> hurt<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.609> but

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
does have a tax which can hurt you but

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.109 
does have a tax which can hurt you but
even<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> difficult<00:00:18.960> battle<00:00:20.119> you

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
even so it's not a difficult battle you

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.540 
even so it's not a difficult battle you
can<00:00:21.359> put<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> sleep<00:00:22.160> speed<00:00:23.160> things<00:00:23.400> up

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
can put it to sleep speed things up

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.939 
can put it to sleep speed things up
because<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> uses<00:00:24.269> harden<00:00:24.810> then<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
because if it uses harden then the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.540 
because if it uses harden then the
battle<00:00:26.220> will<00:00:26.310> take<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.519> very<00:00:26.640> long<00:00:26.970> time<00:00:28.550> both

great<00:00:48.059> move<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> kill<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.559> difficult

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
great move to kill really difficult

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
great move to kill really difficult

trending now I didn't spend all my money
and<00:01:40.039> every<00:01:40.399> time<00:01:40.549> dying<00:01:40.909> I'm<00:01:41.539> losing<00:01:42.170> half<00:01:42.409> of

except look ghastly in one attack by
using<00:02:03.470> fury<00:02:04.010> attack<00:02:05.890> which<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.250> annoying

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
using fury attack which is the annoying

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.820 
using fury attack which is the annoying
thing<00:02:08.030> which<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.800> pokémon<00:02:10.280> improve<00:02:10.700> we<00:02:10.850> had

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.780 

I<00:02:14.540> am<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.870> only<00:02:16.020> balls<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:17.160> early<00:02:17.490> part

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
I am on the only balls in the early part

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.809 
I am on the only balls in the early part
last<00:02:18.390> part<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:20.070> was<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> Beedrill<00:02:20.520> we're<00:02:20.910> at<00:02:21.060> it

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.050 

now<00:02:26.420> what<00:02:27.290> curse<00:02:27.530> does<00:02:27.799> it<00:02:27.980> actually<00:02:28.689> half<00:02:29.689> CHP

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
now what curse does it actually half CHP

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.690 
now what curse does it actually half CHP
so<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.659> does<00:02:33.170> come<00:02:33.439> at<00:02:33.530> Valley<00:02:34.129> big<00:02:34.459> bright

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
so it does come at Valley big bright

train my ghastly this cord moment I'm
and<00:04:16.760> togepi<00:04:17.760> could<00:04:18.090> do<00:04:18.269> with<00:04:18.450> some<00:04:18.600> training

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
and togepi could do with some training

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.410 
and togepi could do with some training
which<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:22.400> attack<00:04:23.400> can<00:04:25.970> kill<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.120> for<00:04:27.360> me

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
which that attack can kill it for me

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.630 
which that attack can kill it for me
without<00:04:27.900> my<00:04:28.140> togepi<00:04:28.560> needed<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.980> do<00:04:29.130> anything

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
without my togepi needed to do anything

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.350 
without my togepi needed to do anything
um<00:04:32.960> now<00:04:33.960> strangely<00:04:34.710> enough<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.610> only<00:04:35.640> pokémon

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
um now strangely enough the only pokémon

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.420 
um now strangely enough the only pokémon
that<00:04:36.480> can<00:04:36.540> withstand<00:04:36.870> one<00:04:37.680> attack<00:04:38.010> from

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
that can withstand one attack from

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.500 
that can withstand one attack from
barely<00:04:40.910> except<00:04:41.910> for<00:04:41.940> maybe<00:04:42.300> ghastly<00:04:42.900> is

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
barely except for maybe ghastly is

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.890 
barely except for maybe ghastly is
totodile<00:04:45.510> even<00:04:46.140> though<00:04:46.820> onyx<00:04:47.820> has<00:04:48.090> far<00:04:48.870> more

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
totodile even though onyx has far more

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.580 
totodile even though onyx has far more
defense<00:04:50.390> at<00:04:51.390> least<00:04:51.630> probably<00:04:51.900> because<00:04:52.200> it<00:04:52.470> has

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
defense at least probably because it has

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.940 
defense at least probably because it has
higher<00:04:52.860> special<00:04:53.370> defense<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:55.290> think<00:04:55.560> that

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
higher special defense and I think that

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.330 
higher special defense and I think that
a<00:04:56.430> res<00:04:56.970> leaf<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:58.080> special<00:04:58.650> attack<00:04:59.190> I<00:05:01.340> don't

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
a res leaf is a special attack I don't

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.390 
a res leaf is a special attack I don't
think<00:05:02.510> onyx<00:05:03.510> has<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:04.050> high<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.860> special

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
think onyx has that high of a special

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.490 
think onyx has that high of a special
defense

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.910 

anyway<00:05:09.900> let's<00:05:10.900> take<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:12.040> out<00:05:12.220> I<00:05:13.770> put<00:05:14.770> me<00:05:14.860> to

anyway let's take it out I put me to
sleep<00:05:14.980> um<00:05:17.340> it<00:05:18.340> won't<00:05:18.640> really<00:05:18.820> affect<00:05:18.940> my<00:05:19.270> wake

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.830 
battle over I've just and one attack
which<00:05:48.490> I<00:05:48.700> said<00:05:48.940> previously<00:05:49.120> thought<00:05:49.450> I<00:05:49.660> could

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
which I said previously thought I could

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.530 
which I said previously thought I could
do<00:05:50.050> so<00:05:50.620> switching<00:05:51.400> up<00:05:51.520> citta<00:05:51.730> style<00:05:52.030> will<00:05:52.390> mean

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
do so switching up citta style will mean

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.600 
do so switching up citta style will mean
that<00:05:52.570> you<00:05:53.110> may<00:05:53.320> lose<00:05:53.530> a<00:05:53.590> lot<00:05:53.710> of<00:05:53.740> HP<00:05:53.919> but<00:05:54.250> didn't

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.450

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
attack even so it would have killed the

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:08.070 
attack even so it would have killed the
belly<00:06:01.110> um<00:06:03.150> now<00:06:04.770> that's<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:05.890> end<00:06:06.130> and<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.900> get
