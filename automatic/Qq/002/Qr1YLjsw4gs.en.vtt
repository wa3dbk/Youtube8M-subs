it's<00:04:46.210> really<00:04:46.510> hard<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:47.110> suppose<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.980> with

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
it's really hard but I suppose I with

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.010 
it's really hard but I suppose I with
the<00:04:48.280> supporters<00:04:48.760> taught<00:04:49.090> me<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.330> be<00:04:49.450> organized

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
the supporters taught me to be organized

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.250 
the supporters taught me to be organized
or<00:04:50.290> more<00:04:50.440> discipline<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.550> like<00:04:52.420> i<00:04:52.630> play<00:04:52.840> my<00:04:53.080> dad

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
or more discipline so like i play my dad

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.960 
or more discipline so like i play my dad
and<00:04:53.590> that's<00:04:53.800> how<00:04:54.040> I<00:04:54.070> gave<00:04:54.370> everything<00:04:54.460> done

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
and that's how I gave everything done

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.550 
and that's how I gave everything done
because<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.540> know<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.690> don't<00:04:55.840> have<00:04:56.050> any<00:04:56.290> extra

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
because I know I don't have any extra

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.950 
because I know I don't have any extra
time<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.860> do<00:04:56.980> it<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:57.370> ya<00:04:58.300> know<00:04:58.510> it's<00:04:58.750> definitely

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
time to do it so ya know it's definitely

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.840 
time to do it so ya know it's definitely
taught<00:04:59.350> me<00:04:59.380> discipline<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.250> that's<00:05:00.430> how<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.610> get

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
taught me discipline so that's how I get

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.880 
taught me discipline so that's how I get
everything<00:05:01.330> done<00:05:01.600> I<00:05:01.630> suppose<00:05:01.960> but<00:05:02.830> it's

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
everything done I suppose but it's

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.430 
everything done I suppose but it's
difficult<00:05:03.340> as<00:05:03.790> it<00:05:03.940> may<00:05:03.970> be<00:05:04.120> at<00:05:04.330> times<00:05:04.630> no<00:05:05.170> doubt

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
difficult as it may be at times no doubt

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.810 
difficult as it may be at times no doubt
these<00:05:05.650> girls<00:05:05.980> will<00:05:06.160> be<00:05:06.220> bending<00:05:06.670> over

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
these girls will be bending over

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.760 
these girls will be bending over
backwards<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.450> jumping<00:05:08.110> through<00:05:08.350> hoops<00:05:08.530> to

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
backwards and jumping through hoops to
