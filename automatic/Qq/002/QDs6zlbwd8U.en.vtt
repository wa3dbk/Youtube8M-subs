00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.970

 one side of the cliff 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.979
 hanging trees and on the other hand 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.949
 sea roads and look at these trees not 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.949
 totally incomprehensible where they take moisture 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:07.460
 how do they manage their roots 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.389
