00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.820
 hello to all 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.489
 I could give two situations 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.400
 I understand that it is a ship since life 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.360
 salcedo client 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.900
 it's even worth the state this simple 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.110
 touch restart the second is the real situation 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.880
 I understand that helmets 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.880
 although it is the one of the player 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 but not the parts of the armor 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.720
 that is not recorded in Hebrew and that is when you get to the monster 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.990
 that is impossible to kill 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.350
 if you are with one of the weapons 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.320
 shot of being 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.960
 will come out as miramar gun icon 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.220
 difference 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.070
 because it resides in if we leave the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 if we do not leave it 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.380
 the situations 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.670
 to take things to each 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.430
 make you get tired xp at the end of the level 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.430
 holbrooke and happy now we go to mario world 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.730
 here there are two ships using the object nor using their language and to take 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.260
 the object while you use it xp and the other one I can not explain
