the center you just went with barbarians

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.150 
the center you just went with barbarians
you'd<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> send<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.500> whole<00:01:01.890> lot<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
buildings and they go for the middle

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
buildings and they go for the middle
building<00:01:05.729> before<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.240> even<00:01:06.420> attempt<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> go

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cannons and we sent in you know just

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.399 
cannons and we sent in you know just
enough<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.280> an<00:01:20.610> army<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.270> take<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
enough of an army to take them out and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.359 
enough of an army to take them out and
we<00:01:22.710> ended<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.040> using<00:01:23.840> something<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.049> 16<00:01:25.619> 16

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
we ended up using something like 16 16

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.830 
we ended up using something like 16 16
barbarians<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.000> six<00:01:27.210> archers<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.659> something

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
like that we'll see that at the at the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.359 
like that we'll see that at the at the
end<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.840> total<00:01:31.110> elixir<00:01:31.829> cost<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
end here but the total elixir cost of

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.380 
end here but the total elixir cost of
our<00:01:32.490> army<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:33.710> 1680<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.460> over<00:01:35.759> half<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
our army was 1680 just over half of the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.969 
our army was 1680 just over half of the
Elector<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.930> we're<00:01:37.049> getting<00:01:37.140> back<00:01:37.290> at<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
Elector that we're getting back at at a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.219 
Elector that we're getting back at at a
total<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> three<00:01:38.970> thousand<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
total of three thousand and then the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.100 
total of three thousand and then the
three<00:01:40.439> thousand<00:01:40.920> gold<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.049> think

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
three thousand gold so you know I think

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
three thousand gold so you know I think
that's<00:01:43.439> probably<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.040> might<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.460> able<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> get

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that's probably you might be able to get

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.749 
that's probably you might be able to get
away<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> few<00:01:45.509> less<00:01:45.780> maybe<00:01:46.140> 14<00:01:46.770> barbarians

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
away with a few less maybe 14 barbarians

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.690 
away with a few less maybe 14 barbarians
like<00:01:47.850> let's<00:01:48.270> say<00:01:48.420> seven<00:01:48.780> per<00:01:48.960> side<00:01:49.229> maybe<00:01:50.189> one

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
like let's say seven per side maybe one

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.999 
like let's say seven per side maybe one
less<00:01:50.909> Archer<00:01:51.420> per<00:01:51.630> side<00:01:51.840> possibly<00:01:52.140> but

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
less Archer per side possibly but

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.969 
less Archer per side possibly but
definitely<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> smallest<00:01:55.470> armies

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
definitely one of the smallest armies

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.069 
definitely one of the smallest armies

outside of the balloon I mean when you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.209 
outside of the balloon I mean when you
talk<00:02:00.119> about<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.540> minimal<00:02:00.960> army<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.500> balloon<00:02:01.950> is

talk about a minimal army a balloon is

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.459 
talk about a minimal army a balloon is
only<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.880> unit<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.390> again<00:02:03.750> we're<00:02:04.320> also

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
only one unit but again we're also

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.139 
only one unit but again we're also

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
much elixir it does take to generate
