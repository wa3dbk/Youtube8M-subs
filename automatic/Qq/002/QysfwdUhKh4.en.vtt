00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
levels tales the levels are basically

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.980 
levels tales the levels are basically
almost<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.190> exact<00:02:31.640> same<00:02:31.760> as<00:02:32.150> Sonics<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.750> fact

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
almost the exact same as Sonics in fact

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.350 
almost the exact same as Sonics in fact
some<00:02:33.230> are<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.860> same<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.640> only<00:02:34.880> real<00:02:35.090> key

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
some are the same the only real key

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.880 
some are the same the only real key
difference<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:35.960> that<00:02:36.140> instead<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.800> just

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
difference is that instead of just

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.470 
difference is that instead of just
getting<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.580> end<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.880> collect<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.210> Chaos
