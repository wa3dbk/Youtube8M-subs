00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.299
 dynamo tv is presented by 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.669
 FeldschlÃ¶sschen 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.279
 It was a focus below the week 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.179
 that this opponent pressing 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.699
 to rehearse the opponent in principle 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.410
 not to play because they are 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.239
 even then dangerously before goal 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.309
 I think the team can come 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.300
 is superbly implemented as a whole 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:36.760
 team but offensive performance 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.710
 1a relatively early the opponent under pressure 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.600
 forced the errors to the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.890
 chances come I'll think even 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.750
 still many many possibilities had 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.239
 if we play the pass better then 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.760
 us clear the game running to 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.609
 but also work in a sum yourself 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.500
 the phase of half time where we then yes 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.570
 was forced to defend a while 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.920
 has where we have not came out so 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.629
 everybody joined in and it was 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.960
 simply exemplary yes as you have seen 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 Has 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.800
 we have blown away in every case 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.920
 pressed well forward yes we did 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.360
 have fought until the last minute 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.610
 i think deserved to win though 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.140
 a few chances but all chances 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.009
 can not be prevented we have that 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.810
 long waited and we are looking forward to it 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.530
 We are very very often mistaking them 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.340
 We are very proud of these documents 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.690
 year again your people with many 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.560
 people risked driving 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.550
 they are amazing that is very good 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.789
 to play for us here 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.380
 so that 8000 9000 or I know 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.099
 not how much but that was what that 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.950
 back wall we also played well well 

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:48.580
 fought and we are looking forward to it 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.140
 but this was more than away win 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.480
 these three points is we need 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 just score 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.280
 Today we drive these three points 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 back and yes we are very very 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.320
 happy 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.560
 jannis is perfect for it now 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.610
 work important three points 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.330
 now i think we are better me yes 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.970
 I have more confidence 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.410
 I think the study is very good for 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:23.190
 me 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:25.380
 but okay i hope i could do that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.820
 is good no matter the long ball cometh 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.930
 somehow there is demanded extended 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.370
 I see that I walked half 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.570
 Before that, I think I'll meet first 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.120
 piece down the leg and then he stops 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.020
 I'm still stuck on the arm and then I have 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.230
 thankfully accepted 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.270
 Well that was a bit 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.080
 crazy start this game ten 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.350
 minutes three gates meek now so 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.520
 the what, why, back country do not 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.070
 wait but the howoge press and 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.490
 but that is not done so badly 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.580
 and in an account we have these 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.360
 speed of mika well used and 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.569
 He has done great and that was the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.880
 was great for us his trust 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:14.440
 doing so early also Ludwig to shoot and 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.349
 so we have no so immediately 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.739
 then a goal but still good 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:25.120
 reacts regulated and that shows 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.280
 many communities to ours 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.780
 team yes to something that is quite 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.400
 Helpful if you are outside so early 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.989
 is in the lead in the good you get 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.599
 track 1 1 but does in return is 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.440
 was played despite minutes I had 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.050
 Do not even say so 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.299
 probably 21 okay but then 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.799
 we have yes I think that in food 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.959
 had run really well made ball 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.400
 leave second half then what with yes 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.850
 increasing pressure of the 60s bit 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.500
 a bit difficult sometimes but behind 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.019
 in the end he gave us then the end 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.209
 ramco helped and could decide 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.640
 audi ice cold live and has because of that 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.340
 turns well I said a season 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.810
 is long it can be us again and again 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.099
 it is important to catch up with us as we do 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.150
 evolve and I believe that 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.680
 the team now in the last 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.510
 a step forward for weeks 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.420
 because that's all we do 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.650
 strive for some stability and there 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.030
 helps a victory like here in Munich 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.079
 Of course, but next week 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.570
 we know ourselves again on 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.739
 program stands and that thinks that 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.049
 then be directed back view as well 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.210
 we have to want every game at home 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.669
 win now is a derby again 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.650
 next we want to play better than 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.820
 but important at the last derby 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.440
 of course, that we get the three points 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.210
 and at home 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.060
 I do not need anything to say to the fans 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.710
 was phenomenal again today 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.389
 terrific and that's why I'm happy 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.650
 anyway, that I will be next 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.930
 week to experience at home again 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.720
 I can number the number of 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.669
 fans but this is now third tooth 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.530
 here with the poor and it is 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.600
 sensational and you have also seen 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.020
 what it can do 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:05:01.240
 I'm a striker I need that 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:05.889
 have to have my suitcase and yes 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.889
 no longer trusted as we play 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.720
 play better so many 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:16.750
 make element for 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.750
 good game welcome
