hi<00:00:00.269> and<00:00:00.329> how<00:00:00.570> UFOs<00:00:00.960> are<00:00:01.500> moving<00:00:01.949> and<00:00:02.100> getting

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hi and how UFOs are moving and getting

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.090 
hi and how UFOs are moving and getting
here<00:00:02.639> then<00:00:03.330> it<00:00:03.449> really<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.870> game<00:00:04.140> over<00:00:04.170> but

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
here then it really is game over but

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.249 
here then it really is game over but
it's<00:00:05.220> not<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.670> it's<00:00:05.759> also<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.870> beginning<00:00:06.990> of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
it's not and it's also the beginning of

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.620 
it's not and it's also the beginning of
a<00:00:07.350> new<00:00:07.379> civilization<00:00:08.059> where<00:00:09.059> we<00:00:09.210> don't<00:00:09.420> have

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
a new civilization where we don't have

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.290 
a new civilization where we don't have
to<00:00:09.780> be<00:00:09.900> hooked<00:00:10.050> into<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.500> petrodollar<00:00:11.300> linear

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300

to be hooked into the petrodollar linear
energy<00:00:12.719> system<00:00:13.469> that's<00:00:13.679> cannibalizing<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
energy system that's cannibalizing and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.760 
energy system that's cannibalizing and
destroying<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.299> planet<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.230> that's

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
destroying the planet and and that's

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.410 
destroying the planet and and that's
really<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.520> honest<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.029> say<00:00:18.210> why<00:00:18.359> are

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
really to be honest with you say why are

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.480 
really to be honest with you say why are
you<00:00:18.570> doing<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:18.960> film<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.680> said<00:00:20.039> I'm<00:00:20.189> doing

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
you doing this film and I said I'm doing

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.920 
you doing this film and I said I'm doing
it<00:00:20.580> because<00:00:20.609> we've<00:00:21.090> got<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> mechanism

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it because we've got to have a mechanism

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.340 
it because we've got to have a mechanism
to<00:00:22.410> raise<00:00:22.890> awareness<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.580> also<00:00:24.180> raise<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
to raise awareness and also raise the

San Francisco spent over five million

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
San Francisco spent over five million
dollars<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.649> someone<00:00:46.920> study<00:00:47.430> how

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
dollars just to have someone study how

dollars just to have someone study how
to<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.300> energy<00:00:48.570> from<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.110> tide<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
to get energy from the tide going in and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.950 
to get energy from the tide going in and
out<00:00:50.219> through<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> Golden<00:00:50.879> Gate<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:51.780> for

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
out through the Golden Gate well for

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.209 
out through the Golden Gate well for
that<00:00:52.050> amount<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.410> money<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.770> could<00:00:52.920> build<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that amount of money we could build a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
that amount of money we could build a
lab<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.870> these<00:00:55.079> scientists<00:00:55.680> bring

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
lab and and have these scientists bring

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.060 
lab and and have these scientists bring
out<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.600> several<00:00:57.600> versions<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.170> these<00:00:58.350> new

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
out the several versions of these new

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
out the several versions of these new
energy<00:00:59.399> technologies<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
energy technologies is so as you know in

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.490 
energy technologies is so as you know in
the<00:01:01.739> 1800's<00:01:02.550> John<00:01:02.879> Keeley<00:01:03.329> invented<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the 1800's John Keeley invented a way to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.250 
the 1800's John Keeley invented a way to
use<00:01:04.769> frequencies<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.700> dissociate<00:01:06.450> hydrogen

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
use frequencies to dissociate hydrogen

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
use frequencies to dissociate hydrogen
and<00:01:07.350> oxygen<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> water<00:01:08.189> correct<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and oxygen out of water correct and of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
and oxygen out of water correct and of
course<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.630> did<00:01:09.780> Stan<00:01:09.960> Meyer<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:11.070> lot<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
course so did Stan Meyer and a lot of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.560 
course so did Stan Meyer and a lot of
people<00:01:11.400> don't<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.180> Stan<00:01:12.390> Meyer

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
people don't know that the Stan Meyer

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.240 
people don't know that the Stan Meyer
stuff<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.080> did<00:01:13.320> work<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.950> course<00:01:14.100> he

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
stuff really did work but of course he

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.950 
stuff really did work but of course he
dropped<00:01:14.580> dead<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.060> took<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> secrets<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
dropped dead and took the secrets to the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050 
dropped dead and took the secrets to the
grave<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.500> his<00:01:17.189> patents<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.759> full<00:01:17.939> of

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
grave because his patents are full of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.670 
grave because his patents are full of
false<00:01:18.270> information<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:19.259> he<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.500> too

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
false information because he was too

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.469 
false information because he was too
paranoid<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.549> that's<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> problems

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
paranoid and that's one of the problems

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
paranoid and that's one of the problems
with<00:01:21.720> these<00:01:21.930> inventors<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.799> they're

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
with these inventors is that they're

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.399 
with these inventors is that they're
they're<00:01:23.490> always<00:01:23.729> too<00:01:24.150> secretive<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.840> by<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
they're always too secretive and by the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.020 
they're always too secretive and by the
time<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.850> out

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
time they think they can get it out

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
time they think they can get it out
something<00:01:27.720> terrible<00:01:28.200> happens<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
something terrible happens and this is

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.640 
something terrible happens and this is
we<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.579> learn<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:31.140> best<00:01:31.470> just

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
we got to learn from this it's best just

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.410 
we got to learn from this it's best just
to<00:01:31.860> put<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.790> that's<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.299> we've

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to put it out there that's what we've

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.819 
to put it out there that's what we've
done<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.720> disclosure<00:01:34.079> witnesses<00:01:34.710> I'm

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
done with disclosure witnesses I'm

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.560 
done with disclosure witnesses I'm
documents<00:01:35.460> same<00:01:36.090> thing<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.390> these

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
documents same thing with these

to or if you just want to put the funds
back<00:04:20.430> into<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.969> new<00:04:21.120> energy<00:04:21.450> lab<00:04:21.659> we're

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
back into the new energy lab we're

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.690 
back into the new energy lab we're
proposing<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.500> build<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:23.159> can<00:04:23.310> do<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.550> either

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
proposing the build you can do it either

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.690 
proposing the build you can do it either
way<00:04:23.969> and

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
way and

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.140 
way and
I<00:04:24.730> think<00:04:25.030> this<00:04:25.210> is<00:04:25.450> how<00:04:25.660> we<00:04:25.720> can<00:04:26.020> really<00:04:26.380> build

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
I think this is how we can really build

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.780 
I think this is how we can really build
a<00:04:28.350> momentum<00:04:29.350> where<00:04:29.770> we<00:04:29.890> don't<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.580> go<00:04:30.610> to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
a momentum where we don't have to go to

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.090 
a momentum where we don't have to go to
corporations<00:04:31.480> government<00:04:32.230> or<00:04:32.440> even<00:04:33.070> just

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
corporations government or even just

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.520 
corporations government or even just
rich<00:04:33.430> individuals<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.690> fund<00:04:34.990> this<00:04:35.140> energy

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
rich individuals to fund this energy

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.010 
rich individuals to fund this energy
work<00:04:35.740> but<00:04:36.160> it's<00:04:36.280> done<00:04:36.490> by<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.120> people<00:04:37.690> for<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
work but it's done by the people for the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.740 
work but it's done by the people for the
people<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.740> will<00:04:39.640> be<00:04:39.790> just<00:04:40.330> like<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.540> film

needs to be done by the people in a way

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.500 
needs to be done by the people in a way
that<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:47.410> can't<00:04:47.650> be<00:04:47.800> taken<00:04:48.220> down<00:04:48.400> by<00:04:48.790> one<00:04:49.300> big

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
rest of us and I might add that you did

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.600 
rest of us and I might add that you did
it<00:07:04.720> during<00:07:04.930> an<00:07:05.170> era<00:07:05.350> where<00:07:05.680> the<00:07:06.370> haight<00:07:06.580> was

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
it during an era where the haight was

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.390 
it during an era where the haight was
much<00:07:07.090> worse<00:07:07.360> so<00:07:08.140> I<00:07:08.170> think<00:07:08.500> you<00:07:08.800> encountered<00:07:09.310> a

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 
much worse so I think you encountered a

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.920 
much worse so I think you encountered a
lot<00:07:09.610> more<00:07:09.850> BS<00:07:10.350> than<00:07:11.350> people<00:07:11.740> after<00:07:12.160> you<00:07:12.310> had<00:07:12.550> to

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
lot more BS than people after you had to

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.420 
lot more BS than people after you had to
because<00:07:13.930> now<00:07:14.140> it's<00:07:14.350> becoming<00:07:14.680> more<00:07:14.920> socially

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
because now it's becoming more socially

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.190 
because now it's becoming more socially
acceptable<00:07:15.520> but<00:07:16.210> back<00:07:16.480> in<00:07:16.510> the<00:07:16.750> day<00:07:16.780> you<00:07:16.960> were
