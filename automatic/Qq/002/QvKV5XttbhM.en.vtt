where<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> main<00:00:24.660> celestial

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
where we see the main celestial

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the Earth and the Sun and having a look

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.920 
the Earth and the Sun and having a look
we<00:00:31.710> also<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.309> Uranus<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.180> also<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:33.690> five

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
we also see that Uranus is also at five

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.350 
we also see that Uranus is also at five
degrees<00:00:34.110> during<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.040> timeframe<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.760> also

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
degrees during this timeframe and also

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.500 
degrees during this timeframe and also
may<00:00:36.540> play<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> role<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.170> these<00:00:37.710> days<00:00:38.420> we're<00:00:39.420> now

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
may play a role on these days we're now

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540 
may play a role on these days we're now
looking<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.870> solar<00:00:40.110> systems<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.710> where<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.399> see

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
looking at solar systems go where we see

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.580 
looking at solar systems go where we see
that<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> main<00:00:42.000> influence<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.600> these<00:00:42.780> days<00:00:43.020> is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
that the main influence on these days is

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.650 
that the main influence on these days is
the<00:00:43.649> earth<00:00:43.980> mercury<00:00:44.460> Sun<00:00:44.670> alignment<00:00:45.149> which<00:00:45.480> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the earth mercury Sun alignment which is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
the earth mercury Sun alignment which is
a<00:00:45.690> very<00:00:45.870> powerful<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.710> also<00:00:47.340> needs<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> be

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
a very powerful one and also needs to be

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.670 
a very powerful one and also needs to be
monitored<00:00:47.940> closely<00:00:48.410> looking<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.590> other

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
monitored closely looking for other

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
monitored closely looking for other
celestial<00:00:50.129> influences<00:00:50.760> there's<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.480> much<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
celestial influences there's not much to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.930 
celestial influences there's not much to
report<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.309> near<00:00:53.489> alignments

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
report we do have some near alignments

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.970 
report we do have some near alignments
but<00:00:54.210> nothing<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.629> significance<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.829> need

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
but nothing of significance so we need

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.319 
but nothing of significance so we need
to<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> look<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> chart<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
to have a look at a chart and have a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.910 
to have a look at a chart and have a
look<00:00:57.510> astrological<00:00:57.870> e<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.739> there's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
look astrological e to see if there's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.380 
look astrological e to see if there's
any<00:00:59.039> other<00:00:59.129> influences<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.820> may<00:01:00.030> enhance

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
any other influences that may enhance

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
any other influences that may enhance
and<00:01:00.629> contribute<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> energies<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.219> this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and contribute to the energies on this

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.270 
and contribute to the energies on this
day<00:01:03.379> we're<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.470> looking<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.100> get

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
day we're now looking to see if we get

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.429 
day we're now looking to see if we get
more<00:01:05.460> information<00:01:05.659> looking<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> chart<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
more information looking at a chart and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
more information looking at a chart and
having<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.799> look<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.130> astrologically<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
having a look at this astrologically and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
having a look at this astrologically and
we<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> twenty-ninth<00:01:11.070> when

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we do see that on the twenty-ninth when

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
we do see that on the twenty-ninth when
mercury<00:01:12.000> makes<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> alignment<00:01:13.020> between<00:01:13.110> Sun

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
mercury makes the alignment between Sun

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.710 
mercury makes the alignment between Sun
and<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> earth<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.580> also<00:01:14.820> trains<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> moon

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and the earth it also trains the moon

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.830 
and the earth it also trains the moon
and<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.530> Uranus<00:01:17.040> which<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> significant<00:01:18.299> now

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and also Uranus which is significant now

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
Jupiter and the moon during the day will

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740 
Jupiter and the moon during the day will
cross<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> North<00:01:26.130> node<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> feel<00:01:27.390> these
