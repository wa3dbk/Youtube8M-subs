00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.510
 this is the spike point that is made in 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.369
 two needles I will teach them how to make 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.170
 for example for some rugs 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.480
 individual for the dining room table 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:30.810
 it's divine because on the perfect side 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.350
 the first line when they ride it is 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.239
 divinely has setbacks in fact this 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.320
 is the right where all the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.890
 ears 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.290
 to the width of the stitch for the reverse and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.550
 I show them is as if it were done 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.620
 machine is a beauty is very easy not 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.309
 has but two careers one for the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.110
 right and another for three I give them the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.410
 next advice when you want to do 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.280
 this death first they use a 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:09.490
 thick needle this needle that I used 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.880
 it's a 9 millimeter or 13 american like 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.830
 they see is pretty the pretty besides the wool 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.619
 that they use that is not so so so 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.990
 thick as one would use with 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.399
 a needle so fat that it's a little 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.100
 thinnest 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:32.070
 The sample did with 14 points 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 the width does not yield much is to say if 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.560
 you see here 14 points because it looks 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.399
 narrow but not for what remains 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.500
 completely thick and thick the fabric 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.049
 let's start with career number 1 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.149
 what is done in the following way is 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.950
 a new way that you are going to 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.950
 learn to make two points together 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.710
 then two points together at one point 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.990
 right with the following variation do not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.420
 I do introducing the needle here 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.420
 sir, I put the needle in here 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.560
 and I do the two points together 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.400
 and took out 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.640
 Until then nothing has happened I do not take the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.370
 two points if I do not just take one and what 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.180
 loose 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.610
 the whole race continued the same 2.2 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.670
 points together right 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.600
 saco I have here a point so that I do not know 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.100
 I'm going to let this out 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.170
 two stitches together in right stitch 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.500
 I loose one point and I save the other 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.500
 two points together at a right point 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.630
 I loose the first 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.360
 and the other I leave on the needle 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.590
 the whole race from this has no 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.010
 edge or anything from the beginning to the end it 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.220
 does exactly the same thing I did in a 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.100
 line in a 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.690
 wool that has several colors what is 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.160
 see the spike point even more beautiful 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.490
 two points together 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.760
 in right point 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.319
 I loose one and left the other on the needle 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.400
 two stitches together in right stitch 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.460
 I loose one and I stay with the other 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.750
 two points together at a right point 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:39.170
 I loose one and I stay with the other 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.490
 two stitches together in right stitch 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.980
 I loose one and I stay with the other 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.340
 the whole race does it exactly 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.860
 Like you have provided to not have 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.640
 no doubt anyway I give the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.850
 explanations written on my page as 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.220
 knit dotcom but in this case what 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.610
 important is that they see very well the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.710
 video two points together at a point 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:12.640
 right took it step by step and left the 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.120
 another two points together at one point 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.120
 straight 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.870
 there I have the thread that remains loose 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.870
 the other 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.110
 and the last point goes on a right point 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.650
 we go for race number two in this 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.460
 reverse of the fabric we do everything in a 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.300
 upside down with the new technique 2 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.300
 points together 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:48.389
 in a reverse point passed the two points 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:51.690
 I do not loose it but loose one and I stay 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.360
 with the other on the needle ok you know 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.760
 this new technique 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.660
 two points in a reverse point 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.720
 He passed 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.090
 I loose one and I stay with the other in the 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.860
 needle and this is a matter of practice 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.910
 when you already have the practice 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.150
 they do it to the race two points together 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.450
 in a backhand step one and left the 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.450
 other 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.510
 this is mounted has the 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.220
 characteristic that remains tight then 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:29.260
 obviously so that you explain them that 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.750
 come che quotes the whole career look at 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.260
 beginning to end is exactly 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.350
 same loose and I'm left with one to 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.390
 how will two points be left together in a 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.710
 point networks I enter the needle by the 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.500
 half of the two points my thread passed 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.320
 took the strand 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.230
 and the sac between the two points loose 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.770
 the first and I'll take the second 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:01.479
 two points together in a backhand 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:03.529
 I take out the thread I prefer a highlighted 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.969
 the other 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.969
 two points together 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.590
 how well small stall 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.120
 in the reverse points 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.510
 step 1 and I leave the other 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.810
 two points together 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.240
 in reverse 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.670
 I loose one point and I leave the other in the 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.790
 left hand needle 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.790
 two points together in backhand 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:39.290
 I loose one and wake up 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:42.020
 this is how it looks good, two points 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.199
 together in a backhand 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:48.680
 I loose one and I stay with the other and 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:52.580
 we reached the end of the race with two 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:56.270
 points together in a loose backhand 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.800
 I stay with the other I make two points 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.319
 together that are the last ones that I 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.830
 they stayed on the needle just like I did 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:06.919
 others loose one I stay with the other and 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.880
 I do not have to make a point that is in a 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.900
 backhand point 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.250
 and the loose when they reach this point 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.020
 you always have to go back to 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.700
 start the number one race that are 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:23.160
 the two points together in right point 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:26.580
 step one and I stay with the other always 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:31.080
 they have to major or mount points 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:34.129
 multiple of two or pairs so that the 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.739
 stitch them perfect 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:39.319
 anything go to my page as 

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:43.629
 knit puntocom and you will see it very many 

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:43.629
 videos as beautiful as this one
