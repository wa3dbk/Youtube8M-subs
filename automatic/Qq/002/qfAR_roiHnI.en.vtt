right now something he's doing a lot of
this<00:01:12.430> is<00:01:12.729> early<00:01:13.330> implementation<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.110> what

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
this is early implementation so what

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.920 
this is early implementation so what
you're<00:01:14.380> seeing<00:01:14.590> we<00:01:14.830> have<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:16.210> broader<00:01:16.570> plans

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
you're seeing we have much broader plans

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.700 
you're seeing we have much broader plans
for<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:17.320> what<00:01:17.410> you're<00:01:17.530> saying<00:01:17.649> right

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
this moment we want to show off what we

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.550 
this moment we want to show off what we
have<00:01:19.030> in<00:01:19.149> game<00:01:19.330> currently<00:01:19.690> we<00:01:20.229> talk<00:01:20.380> about<00:01:20.440> the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
have in game currently we talk about the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.080 
have in game currently we talk about the
socketing<00:01:20.950> system<00:01:21.280> there'll<00:01:21.520> be<00:01:21.549> rules<00:01:21.880> and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
socketing system there'll be rules and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.430 
socketing system there'll be rules and
how<00:01:22.150> you<00:01:22.210> can<00:01:22.390> place<00:01:22.630> these<00:01:22.840> things<00:01:23.110> we're

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
how you can place these things we're

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.750 
how you can place these things we're
obviously<00:01:23.979> you'll<00:01:24.280> have<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.490> find<00:01:24.670> the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
obviously you'll have to find the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.100 
obviously you'll have to find the
materials<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.270> craft<00:01:25.510> them<00:01:25.659> that<00:01:25.840> will<00:01:25.990> be

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
materials to craft them that will be

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.020 
materials to craft them that will be
difficult<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:27.340> will<00:01:27.460> be<00:01:27.580> fairly<00:01:27.790> difficult

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
difficult that will be fairly difficult

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.490 
difficult that will be fairly difficult
to<00:01:28.420> do<00:01:28.570> for<00:01:28.900> sure<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:31.750> brave<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.080> snipe

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
to do for sure and be brave and snipe

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.820 
to do for sure and be brave and snipe
the<00:01:32.939> zombie<00:01:33.939> I<00:01:34.060> must<00:01:34.240> like<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.689> debt<00:01:35.619> they're

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
the zombie I must like that debt they're

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.380 
the zombie I must like that debt they're
stuck<00:01:36.130> zombie<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.790> past<00:01:36.970> we've<00:01:37.119> talked<00:01:37.330> a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
stuck zombie the past we've talked a

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.520 
stuck zombie the past we've talked a
little<00:01:37.540> bit<00:01:37.659> how<00:01:37.900> we're<00:01:38.080> dealing<00:01:38.380> with<00:01:38.470> this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
little bit how we're dealing with this

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.870 
little bit how we're dealing with this
AI<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.010> our<00:01:39.070> planes<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.610> how<00:01:39.700> they<00:01:39.820> will

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
AI and our planes and how they will

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.670 
AI and our planes and how they will
interact<00:01:39.970> with<00:01:40.270> players<00:01:40.600> in<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.900> world<00:01:41.140> we<00:01:41.560> do

interact with players in the world we do

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.679 
interact with players in the world we do
have<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.830> circle<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.400> life<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.850> place<00:01:43.119> it's

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
have a circle of life in place it's

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:44.969 
have a circle of life in place it's
constantly<00:01:44.049> being<00:01:44.200> tuned<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.560> behaviors<00:01:44.920> of

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
constantly being tuned the behaviors of

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.200 
constantly being tuned the behaviors of
all<00:01:45.100> these<00:01:45.189> are<00:01:45.369> being<00:01:45.549> tuned<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.880> lot<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.119> it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
all these are being tuned a lot of it

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.640 
all these are being tuned a lot of it
we're<00:01:46.570> very<00:01:46.750> much<00:01:46.869> focused<00:01:46.930> on<00:01:47.350> having<00:01:47.439> a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
we're very much focused on having a

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.170 
we're very much focused on having a
merger<00:01:47.950> like<00:01:48.100> AI<00:01:48.250> where<00:01:48.549> they<00:01:48.700> will<00:01:48.790> be<00:01:48.939> able
