00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.760
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.230
 look at the settings of the guys from the 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.820
 ghost of the guys setting is 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.590
 something quite subjective about a 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.570
 drone like the ghost 2 since everyone 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.369
 can adjust the values ​​according to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.199
 its expectations but also according to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.119
 the equipment of the drone indeed the simple 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.039
 adding a nacelle or changes 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.240
 lists may suffice for all 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.690
 modified and you are good for a 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.029
 new setting olivier life isler 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.210
 complicated earnings you explain to me a 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.760
 little for materials already there are two 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.679
 types of earnings the basic earnings says the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.929
 base gains on the front line and 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.760
 attitude gains on the second 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.050
 line here let's start with his 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.999
 seconds that are easier to 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.409
 understand and explain the gains 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:50.030
 of attitude so are the gains that 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.920
 allow to control the way in 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.359
 the drone will react to the demands of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.039
 the order ie how it goes 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.609
 react to the movements of the joysticks of the 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.979
 radio control they are adjustable from 40 to 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.319
 4 cents plus we are getting closer to the 500 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.180
 the more he will have a quick responsiveness a 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:08.840
 quick reaction and the closer we get 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.430
 from zero the more he will react slowly on 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.740
 can make an analogy with the middle 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.660
 saying that the more we get 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.190
 close to 0.20 at least 40% 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.920
 we had a way of driving rather 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.650
 economic and when we are towards the 400 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.590
 we are more on a default sport mode 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.600
 these gains are at 260 which corresponds to 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.240
 a value pretty much milian launches the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.259
 video I understand then little 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.720
 to show the bonds of affection 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.729
 of advanced reaction to the command so 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.700
 if we are going to yell low enough gain by 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.830
 example at 80 this is what we get 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.840
 scratching the drone leans very little and 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.539
 which he reacts relatively slowly to 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.490
 the order carried the wars 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.909
 recommended by tracks to say 260 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.289
 allow a lot more inclination 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.710
 doors of the drone is so a reaction 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.710
 faster 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.570
 for basic guys or basic earnings 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.640
 it's about how the drone is going 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.869
 stabilize by itself following a 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.179
 solicitation of the levers 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.129
 then there are more settings at the level 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.750
 basic earnings since each 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.290
 movement can be adjust 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.640
 independently to fit the reaction 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.150
 of the drone in relation to the solicitation 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.470
 so of the pitch of the role of you or the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.930
 vertical you even if what she stings I 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.440
 you have prepared a little picture you go 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.440
 explain to you 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.739
 in clear the drone finger after 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.930
 we eat them from the remote control 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.829
 return to a stationary position if the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.569
 guys are too weak 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.489
 the drone will take time to get 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.680
 stabilize and will drift slowly to 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.019
 against six leaders are too strong the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.400
 drone will become nervous and could 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.959
 even will also put them ie 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.920
 that he will never be satisfied with his 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.989
 own stability 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.430
 he will make permanent corrections and 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.569
 its permanent collections can 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.569
 result in a loss of control 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:10.100
 so let's start with 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.390
 at the level of the height of which only one 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.819
 quick quote Sunday that's it 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.330
 the drone stabilizes does not move 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.830
 no vibration no oscillations the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.250
 gain seems to be not bad we try in 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.250
 December 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.170
 all the same the drone is back in place 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.720
 to the nerves quite quickly from 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.610
 quite fast way 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.680
 in the era of goods stage fhb ​​oscillations 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.350
 in your guys go up and down to 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.490
 edges 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.290
 now guys have to move forward 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.040
 this is during a solicitation we see 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.290
 immediately back up the drone reacts 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.430
 perfectly well stabilizes almost 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.349
 immediately in no vibration no 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.360
 oscillations so the guys look 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.550
 to be 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.040
 relatively get there 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.060
 acceptable 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.099
 for me 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.180
 shareholder and perfumes after a strong 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.670
 Sunday solicitation 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.660
 so what's not bad at all we're going 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.660
 then test on the right 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.780
 spotless on the left 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.060
 good ah too 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.450
 northeast get me the rotation so the same 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.400
 a shot of gas left or right 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.720
 here we are on the contrary 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.870
 that there is a big problem of setting 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.680
 gain in rotation level since the drone 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.470
 away completely do not stay 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.180
 stationary we then see that he 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.720
 back he'll come back pretty much the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.889
 position of paris 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.479
 but we should aim 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.479
 that there is a big variation of 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.169
 yeah 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.070
 a video level will definitely be 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.780
 give a good account of the advanced drone 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.550
 differently at the author level a 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.930
 variation there is mostly a big 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.610
 variation 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.900
 two positions before he returns 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.729
 all the same at his position 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.480
 departure but then we realize 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.040
 that the gain them 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.020
 at the level of rotation is not good 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.600
 at all is not strong enough since 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.340
 so if we go back here the link is not 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.580
 not this time since the drone is changing 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.370
 completely 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.660
 two positions 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.660
 before going back on 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:23.030
 which will stabilize again here is 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.160
 but this movement 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.870
 and not at all not logical not 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.450
 all normal as can be 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.990
 redo here 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.190
 right or left 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.320
 there is no problem if we do 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.180
 back almost immediately stabilizes 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.440
 there is no problem with these 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.650
 this guy this is really the link of 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.590
 rotation here that poses a problem that the 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.790
 imbalance completely so there 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.540
 then you have to play with the guys 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.610
 until the drone has either the most 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.040
 regular as possible as we just 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.570
 see on the ground for rhone world the 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.540
 default settings are pretty ok 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.090
 do not touch yourself except for the rotation 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.850
 or where you saw that the gain 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.270
 was far too weak for 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.000
 settings 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.640
 be careful not to put values 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.560
 Another low speed is too fast 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.740
 advises settings 10 years 10 and then 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.340
 tests and until we find the 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.340
 best possible setting 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.690
 words come to an end I hope 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.630
 that it will have been useful to you and I will 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:59.850
 you were more and more my videos etc to 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:02.850
 thank you thank you thank you thank you 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.850
 finally
