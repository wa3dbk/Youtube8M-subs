00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.460
 Hello everyone in my hands headphones 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.669
 philips fidelio l2 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.589
 I bought them for my wife 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:23.519
 but I want to take this course 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:26.529
 form your own opinion about her 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.079
 let's see what they are and 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.910
 most importantly how good they are 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:36.300
 sounded and so the headphones are packed here in 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.310
 such a box 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.150
 Immediately worth noting that here we are 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:47.290
 promises a high certainty sound for sure 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.130
 as well as on the boxes beats company code 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.300
 magnetic latch used here 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:58.420
 which are not incredibly comfortable here under 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.140
 such a film is immediately clearly visible 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.239
 headphones 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.219
 without ever even revealing the packaging 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.829
 concerns the characteristics if this is to someone 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:13.479
 interesting, I will show a close-up can 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:16.600
 never read me 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.179
 various numbers I was not particularly interested 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.310
 always prefer to check everything on my 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:27.939
 taste and most importantly hearing also from above 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.289
 here itâ€™s written that headphones for me 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.240
 incredible accuracy 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.310
 semi-closed design and location 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.679
 alignment holes ahead 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.249
 sound pressure 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.439
 provide natural 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.670
 balanced sound with more 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.270
 rich bass 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.639
 and this is how I love me 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.639
 like when you are a little saturated 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.750
 open the box itself 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.869
 here again the magnetic latch and here 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.759
 what we see inside 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.470
 I am the way I have never seen so many such 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.470
 large selection of different nozzles 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:26.810
 little book yes i think my spouse will 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:31.060
 very satisfied such here such 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.060
 convenient baxik for transportation 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.930
 so it looks inside 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.100
 is soft touch material used 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:22.830
 while the side will show you again six 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.670
 pairs apart from these extra 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.300
 baits 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.790
 and they are not only of different size but 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.250
 how to see is still used is different 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.180
 material is some more porous 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.840
 some kind of foam rubber silicone and 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.150
 so then I really see it for the first time 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.690
 to use such a pretty one 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.080
 still 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.860
 extensive kit now let's 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.910
 take a look at the headphones themselves I'll start with 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.380
 the bottom of the connector is three and a half 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.590
 minijack by the way it's not just that 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.650
 interesting design but still myself 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.980
 the metal here is already going like this 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.160
 Here is the rubber part that protects 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.810
 break wire in the places where it is 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:18.650
 subjected to stress the wire itself as you 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.769
 see two-color here he is white and 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.870
 smooth 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.400
 and from the inside he has 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.430
 such a texture and such a brownish 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.430
 Colour 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.420
 goes further here is such a jumper 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.960
 after which one cord turns already 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.590
 in 2 cords that diverge and that's such 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.680
 here's a design that again 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:50.930
 moves and can combine two laces 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:55.370
 in one next moment here is such 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.910
 ult with a single button she 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.800
 rubberized well felt and 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.310
 conveniently pressed here with the reverse 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.290
 parties 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:10.850
 the microphone is now the headphones themselves by the way 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.630
 Headphones are here are pretty 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.990
 heavy 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.650
 all this because they are completely 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.590
 made of metal 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.360
 here again in places of load wire 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.720
 protected from such rubberized 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.720
 part 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.319
 I brought as close as possible to you 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.280
 could 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:42.250
 scrutinize all the elements 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.509
 designs inscription philips fidelio 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:49.940
 Here is such an interesting 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:53.830
 golden net goes inside and here 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:57.880
 this coating is something resembling enamel 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:01.310
 deposited on the metal case 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.389
 there is no such thing inside 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:09.680
 no cover 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:12.160
 so here I understand something like that 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.160
 on copper 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.330
 headphones go as you go under such 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.780
 by the corner 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:24.159
 probably in order to make it was more 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.159
 convenient and use 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.910
 the appearance of them is of course cool and 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.620
 they themselves make that impression 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.990
 very high quality product 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:47.660
 now it remains to connect to the smartphone and 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:53.690
 check out the most important thing how well 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:56.780
 they sound and so i tested these 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:07:00.470
 headphones with different music that 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:03.080
 I actually love to listen and ready 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:07.220
 tell you your opinion about these 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.170
 headphones i will say so the sound of these 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.050
 Headphones do not like so much 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.070
 that I decided to order myself exactly the same 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.740
 only 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.840
 Naturally more masculine color is necessary 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.130
 will pick up if there are any 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.970
 similar 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:25.690
 colors they definitely play better 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.800
 those headphones that I used before 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.400
 which undoubtedly pleases 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.400
 what recommendations can i give you 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.480
 it as always take your musical 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.500
 device 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:42.530
 whether it is a smartphone or any player 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:45.740
 go to the store to make your 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:49.970
 own opinion before buying because 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:54.169
 that my opinion is not a file that matches 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:58.210
 Yours on this, actually, thank you all 

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:58.210
 all for your attention bye bye
