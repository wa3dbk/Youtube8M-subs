00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.650 
through there in verse and so we have
the<00:02:29.420> four<00:02:29.780> video<00:02:30.320> layers<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.540> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
the four video layers and then on the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.560 
the four video layers and then on the
right<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.410> layer<00:02:33.680> for<00:02:34.070> live<00:02:34.910> camera

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
right we have a layer for live camera

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.320 
right we have a layer for live camera
which<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.870> be<00:02:36.230> connected<00:02:36.920> via<00:02:37.160> USB<00:02:37.460> or

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
which can be connected via USB or

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.820 
which can be connected via USB or
firewire<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.240> layer<00:02:41.240> for<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.900> 3d<00:02:42.530> file

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
firewire we have a layer for a 3d file

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.090 
firewire we have a layer for a 3d file
and<00:02:43.280> then<00:02:44.150> we<00:02:44.330> can<00:02:44.480> change<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.140> beats<00:02:45.860> per

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
and then we can change the beats per

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.830 
and then we can change the beats per
minute<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.700> rotation<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:48.410> size<00:02:49.570> as<00:02:50.570> well

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
minute for the rotation the size as well

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.920 
minute for the rotation the size as well
as<00:02:50.990> changing<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.530> color<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.690> we<00:02:53.690> have<00:02:53.900> a

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
as changing the color and we have a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.830 
as changing the color and we have a
layer<00:02:54.380> for<00:02:54.920> still<00:02:55.370> images<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:56.390> can<00:02:56.570> change

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
layer for still images you can change

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.050 
layer for still images you can change
the<00:02:57.110> image<00:02:57.230> here<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.340> can<00:02:58.520> also<00:02:58.700> use

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
the image here and you can also use

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.160 
the image here and you can also use
images<00:02:59.750> with<00:03:00.400> alpha<00:03:01.400> channel<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:02.989> can

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
images with alpha channel and we can

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.940 
images with alpha channel and we can
change<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:04.450> color<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.989> layer<00:03:06.170> based<00:03:06.620> on

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
change the color of the layer based on

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.820 
change the color of the layer based on
beats<00:03:07.190> per<00:03:07.430> minute<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.650> video

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
beats per minute just like the video

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.690 
beats per minute just like the video
layers<00:03:10.400> turn<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.420> off<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.260> we<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.700> later

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
layers turn this off and we have a later

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.020 
layers turn this off and we have a later

just for text on which you can type the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.070 
just for text on which you can type the
text<00:03:17.450> here<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.980> goes<00:03:19.120> live<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.660> output

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.360 
text here and it goes live to the output
and<00:03:21.950> we<00:03:22.519> can<00:03:22.730> also<00:03:23.000> change<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.570> font<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370

also have the a slider for a fade out
the<00:04:08.030> fades<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.480> output<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:10.670> we<00:04:10.910> here<00:04:11.209> we<00:04:11.450> are

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
the fades the output and we here we are

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.050 
the fades the output and we here we are
using<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.110> main<00:04:12.320> module<00:04:12.829> now<00:04:13.549> we<00:04:13.610> going<00:04:13.940> to

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
using the main module now we going to

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.860 
using the main module now we going to
the<00:04:14.180> live<00:04:14.360> cinema<00:04:14.690> module<00:04:15.400> which<00:04:16.400> has<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:17.450> base

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
the live cinema module which has a base

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.819 
the live cinema module which has a base
video<00:04:18.500> later<00:04:19.720> overlay<00:04:20.720> feature<00:04:21.140> later<00:04:21.410> and

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
video later overlay feature later and

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.790 
video later overlay feature later and
two<00:04:22.070> outer<00:04:22.310> layers<00:04:22.840> always<00:04:23.840> individual

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
two outer layers always individual

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.830 
two outer layers always individual
volume<00:04:25.160> control

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
volume control

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:34.030 
volume control
so<00:04:26.840> if<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.230> put<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.500> video<00:04:28.270> file<00:04:32.260> on<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.980> the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
so if you put a video file on the on the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.450 
so if you put a video file on the on the
first<00:04:34.430> column<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:35.840> starts<00:04:36.230> playing<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.860> on

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
first column it starts playing and on

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.060 
first column it starts playing and on
the<00:04:37.580> second<00:04:37.970> column<00:04:38.240> we<00:04:38.600> make<00:04:38.810> two<00:04:39.380> choices<00:04:42.070> on

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
the second column we make two choices on

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.930 
the second column we make two choices on
the<00:04:43.220> second<00:04:43.670> we<00:04:43.760> put<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.150> video<00:04:44.480> here

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
the second we put this video here

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.850 
the second we put this video here
somewhere<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.060> video<00:04:47.360> is<00:04:47.480> over<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.440> jumps<00:04:48.770> to

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
somewhere the video is over it jumps to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.340 
somewhere the video is over it jumps to
the<00:04:48.950> next<00:04:48.980> column<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.850> randomly<00:04:50.600> chooses<00:04:51.320> a

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
the next column and randomly chooses a
