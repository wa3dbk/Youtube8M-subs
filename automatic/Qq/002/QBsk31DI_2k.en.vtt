00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.450
 welcome ladies not to a new campaign to achieve that said dnb ago 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.809
 maybe a little longer the last time i desk again with october 17 and that 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.519
 is two weeks ago 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.809
 that is telleman example but i can all speak it is usually dry 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 then per month 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.119
 in recent times a lot to do the residents are taken care of 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.949
 and of course I am very happy with that I am also very grateful for that of course 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.529
 also work after delivery 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.599
 the stage was in great demand for ICT 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.719
 a on a large open I want moment just because pretty positive 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.240
 but the score achieved 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.650
 does not always go so positively in the beginning I have made a lot of fun 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.540
 because I have lost next to delivery 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.390
 the trip 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.810
 we played a draw 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.310
 and looking forward to being much better now the game is not very good yet and i'm going there 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.210
 a lot of chance that you can see 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.440
 well i have that i power again it is just fifteen minutes 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.570
 paul ricard i touch everything cards 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.420
 goalkeeper grabs defenders 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.980
 I just don't go the back of the net and I think that's a bit 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.860
 annoying a bit of preston times as many bernard van der luit hall it 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.140
 offer for some typical ben arfa fantastic moment 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.960
 but luckily the ball does not enter then you still have animal tnt luckily TNT 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.799
 don't shoot and the ball goes wide 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.130
 that results in a stable it is shooting he can be very hard there are cards 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.819
 but actually don't know but you will have vocalists even though the body has it 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.090
 gives some support sterling thought option were so short gives the ball back 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.620
 where transfers go in has a lot of space but 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.870
 curl 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.160
 and that is a bit of marco world the keeper was in lievelde 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.950
 also found again 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.390
 three months after the game 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.960
 but how bad can you be a woodsman I mean come on 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.890
 it's almost ridiculous about this 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.520
 herman second team at the internal borders distrusted 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.700
 it is almost incredible that we naturally have a small number of member states 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.030
 below the sprint 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.160
 I nevertheless enter that sphere anyway 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.270
 from so close but he passes again 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.650
 it's just bad luck 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.770
 it is pure bad luck considering the statistics 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.190
 four shots in the corner as on a call for ours to rest 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.020
 I had shot 5 on target 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.980
 that's pure finishing 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.200
 so bad at the afm artists that is my fault 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.929
 and i don't know what i know what i can change i don't feel 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.219
 that there is a lot wrong with it rika i just got it so i can't touch it 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:12.019
 to lay 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.949
 And yes that is a statement to start talking 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:19.189
 when case to which have been adjusted and second in standard peasant field the striker 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.729
 and this chocolate incredible nonsense 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.899
 I do not legally I also want to go towards the ball 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.989
 the opta to go on and on 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.399
 I don't have a penalty against you, a bit stupid 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.229
 on that field then happens 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:37.249
 it was monetary minutes and also an internet good luck bad ball good 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.180
 so slow that I do run reign 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.180
 luckily I knew I am not that passionate about it of course 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.709
 with a little luck good time trial behind my desk here a show 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.240
 the ball 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.420
 do not light the fire that was set up by unpacking 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.159
 moderate reason for my son 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.879
 gives a cross on the head of jacob and jacobs even though we play horst 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.089
 first goal scored 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:00.399
 and with this he scores another brother against me 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:04.129
 and i missions from guys who is happy continuing fantastic shore 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.189
 setup that tries to know people 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.909
 i get a little bullshit no i finally got something here not 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.809
 in my favor by a ball prof 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.109
 scores an own goal and this is quite a hiding place 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:20.249
 but this looks great with this I just stay 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.519
 we are not willing, but never that does not make me so happy 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.959
 really not very happy of what I just perform dredging 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.469
 and I see it also works but that will happen to some people so that happens 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.509
 also not yet prosecuted 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.149
 I said the sons and daughters-in-law have done it in the neighborhood 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.169
 and the question maybe that i have closely by ing 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.149
 the card another question idea 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.529
 and I think you probably because the porridge we have way too much money 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.359
 but I can 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.209
 the rb star 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.239
 50 million a 90,000 in wages per week 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.859
 and i am also going to other cities and youth player myhrvold i am not going how 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:57.999
 buy londers 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.519
 but I thought it's not going to be not according to something like that you just see 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.459
 I had won three games 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.769
 four matches become intensive 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.089
 You know the debate is a sign to me this is not going to work 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.959
 and I get I am not going to make announcements because it is not working 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.329
 so i thought on you know this wasn't an option 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.409
 together with existing one 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.299
 the further fell 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.009
 after a little bit then 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.599
 this is certainly not a bad choice 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.979
 i mean look there ten tips to sand old 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.650
 because then to press us alberto is 32 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.930
 he can take photos 34 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.120
 Stitzinger's youngest team 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.790
 margin it is a number of talents 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.319
 the studio 100 players in cash for example at the Land Registry 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.389
 for the first time a year, it is of course completely in agreement with you 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.090
 just be from colombia 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.270
 but I am right I am just going to do it 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.210
 and i hope to support people i hear i hope the right country is everything 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.689
 possibly a problem 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:00.489
 but I'm just going to do it and I'm already what you think of it I want to be sure 

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:02.110
 do not make standard purchases 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.180
 but it seems nice to me I don't see anyone doing the French competition and I like it 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.810
 itself a very interesting one so I am fully behind my choice 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.259
 the right choice and I hope you also think that this video 5 is right 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.630
 Could catch up or hopefully more Paul's development that two tomorrow 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:17.710
 videos full again 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.349
 that is just being watched by it
