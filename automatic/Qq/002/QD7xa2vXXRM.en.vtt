new<00:00:25.949> circuit<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.849> Americas<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.689> Austin<00:00:28.349> Texas

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.549 

well<00:00:42.160> I've<00:00:42.340> basically<00:00:43.079> tested<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.199> new<00:00:44.320> game

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
well I've basically tested the new game

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.130 
well I've basically tested the new game
specifically<00:00:45.370> as<00:00:45.760> well<00:00:45.910> on<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.180> new<00:00:46.329> Austin

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
specifically as well on the new Austin

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.319 
specifically as well on the new Austin
Texas<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.250> circuit<00:00:48.670> this<00:00:48.820> year<00:00:49.030> which<00:00:49.180> was

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
Texas and circuit this year which was

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.970 
Texas and circuit this year which was
only<00:00:49.570> 2<00:00:49.750> which<00:00:49.930> was<00:00:50.050> very<00:00:50.320> interesting

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
only 2 which was very interesting

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.889 
only 2 which was very interesting
I've<00:00:51.339> used<00:00:51.610> it<00:00:51.760> assimilated<00:00:52.420> therefore<00:00:52.750> which

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
I've used it assimilated therefore which

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.259 
I've used it assimilated therefore which
I<00:00:53.050> have<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.260> say<00:00:53.440> was<00:00:53.649> good<00:00:54.640> fun<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.089> you<00:00:55.210> know

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
I have to say was good fun and you know

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.639 
I have to say was good fun and you know
quite<00:00:55.540> realistic<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.140> I<00:00:56.199> enjoyed<00:00:56.470> it

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
quite realistic and I enjoyed it

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.790 
quite realistic and I enjoyed it
no<00:00:57.430> to<00:00:57.489> be<00:00:57.699> honest<00:00:57.940> not<00:00:58.120> I<00:00:58.149> don't<00:00:58.479> have<00:00:58.690> a

no to be honest not I don't have a

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
hardly ever you know older a PlayStation

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.560 
hardly ever you know older a PlayStation
Xbox<00:01:02.140> or<00:01:02.739> when<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.670> was<00:01:03.820> little<00:01:04.149> still<00:01:04.479> in

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
Xbox or when I was little still in

Xbox or when I was little still in
karting<00:01:04.960> I<00:01:05.050> played<00:01:05.320> on<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.800> computer<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.280> little

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
karting I played on a computer a little

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.880 
karting I played on a computer a little
bit<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.729> Formula<00:01:06.970> One<00:01:07.119> but<00:01:07.780> now<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.590> haven't

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
bit of Formula One but now I haven't

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.770 
bit of Formula One but now I haven't
played<00:01:09.190> in<00:01:09.399> years<00:01:09.580> but<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.390> be<00:01:10.450> honest<00:01:10.659> that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
played in years but to be honest that

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.600 
played in years but to be honest that
was<00:01:10.840> quite<00:01:11.170> good<00:01:11.290> fun<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.710> especially<00:01:12.550> you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
was quite good fun and especially you

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.160 
was quite good fun and especially you
know<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.789> special<00:01:13.210> installation<00:01:13.539> made<00:01:14.050> it

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
know the special installation made it

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.930 
know the special installation made it
even<00:01:14.289> more<00:01:14.410> fun<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:14.950> we're<00:01:15.160> yeah<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.670> was<00:01:15.789> good

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
even more fun so we're yeah it was good

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.130 
even more fun so we're yeah it was good
I<00:01:16.210> think<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.710> for<00:01:18.070> for<00:01:18.399> a<00:01:19.020> simulation<00:01:20.020> you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
I think it is for for a simulation you

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.870 
I think it is for for a simulation you
know<00:01:20.259> which<00:01:20.410> every<00:01:20.830> normal<00:01:21.130> human<00:01:21.190> being<00:01:21.610> can

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
know which every normal human being can

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.609 
know which every normal human being can
buy<00:01:22.030> from<00:01:22.300> a<00:01:22.420> store<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.780> is<00:01:22.899> it<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.440> a<00:01:23.470> good

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
buy from a store it is it is a good

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.639 
buy from a store it is it is a good
product<00:01:24.479> close<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:26.080> reality<00:01:26.470> obviously

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
product close to the reality obviously

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.510 
product close to the reality obviously
some<00:01:27.369> things<00:01:27.789> are<00:01:27.970> missing<00:01:28.149> forces<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.110> wind

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
some things are missing forces the wind

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.090 
some things are missing forces the wind
stuff<00:01:30.520> like<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.880> but<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.119> know<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:31.569> think

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
stuff like that but you know I think

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.859 
stuff like that but you know I think
there's<00:01:33.100> no<00:01:33.280> chance<00:01:33.819> you<00:01:34.000> can<00:01:34.210> simulate<00:01:34.690> that

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
there's no chance you can simulate that

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.830 
there's no chance you can simulate that
but<00:01:35.409> um<00:01:35.560> in<00:01:35.830> terms<00:01:35.860> of<00:01:36.190> graphics<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.330> circuits

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
but um in terms of graphics the circuits

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.649 
but um in terms of graphics the circuits
the<00:01:38.080> detail<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.740> attention<00:01:39.149> it's<00:01:40.149> been<00:01:40.330> very

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
the detail to attention it's been very

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.719 
the detail to attention it's been very
impressive<00:01:40.929> I<00:01:41.319> definitely<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.069> know<00:01:42.190> have<00:01:42.700> a

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
impressive I definitely you know have a

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.279 
impressive I definitely you know have a
good<00:01:42.940> impression<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.599> the<00:01:43.869> layout<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.140> the

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
good impression of the layout of the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.839 
good impression of the layout of the
circuit<00:01:44.619> now<00:01:44.739> you<00:01:44.800> know<00:01:45.039> what<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.399> know<00:01:45.520> which

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
circuit now you know what I know which

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.669 
circuit now you know what I know which
which<00:01:46.420> corner<00:01:46.660> is<00:01:46.840> going<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> come<00:01:47.229> next<00:01:47.380> which

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
which corner is going to come next which

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.150 
which corner is going to come next which
is<00:01:47.709> obviously<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:50.619> intention<00:01:51.099> of

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
is obviously the one intention of

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.010 
is obviously the one intention of
simulators<00:01:51.550> so<00:01:51.910> that<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.179> is<00:01:52.509> a<00:01:52.569> good<00:01:52.840> point

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
simulators so that is a is a good point

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.580 
simulators so that is a is a good point
and<00:01:53.429> on<00:01:54.429> top<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.910> I<00:01:54.970> think<00:01:55.060> yeah<00:01:55.479> as<00:01:56.410> far

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
and on top of that I think yeah as far

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.290 
and on top of that I think yeah as far
as<00:01:56.649> I<00:01:56.770> can<00:01:56.830> see<00:01:57.129> we<00:01:57.160> had<00:01:57.429> a<00:01:57.640> different<00:01:57.970> circuit

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
as I can see we had a different circuit

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.820 
as I can see we had a different circuit
in<00:01:58.390> there<00:01:58.539> as<00:01:58.629> well<00:01:58.810> which<00:01:58.989> proved<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.739> be

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
in there as well which proved to be

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.499 
in there as well which proved to be
quite<00:02:00.160> accurate<00:02:00.459> because<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:01.000> know<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.390> on

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
quite accurate because I know that on

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.540 
quite accurate because I know that on
the<00:02:01.599> circuit<00:02:01.959> and<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.349> haven't<00:02:03.190> raced<00:02:03.369> an

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
the circuit and I haven't raced an

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.880 
the circuit and I haven't raced an
Austin<00:02:03.849> yet<00:02:04.000> obviously<00:02:04.360> but<00:02:04.629> it<00:02:05.080> looks<00:02:05.289> to<00:02:05.470> to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
Austin yet obviously but it looks to to

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.559 
Austin yet obviously but it looks to to
be<00:02:06.009> quite<00:02:06.280> unrealistic

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.220 

so<00:02:14.569> here<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:14.870> go

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
so here we go

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.589 
so here we go
new<00:02:15.560> Austin<00:02:16.550> Texas<00:02:16.970> circuit<00:02:17.360> across

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
new Austin Texas circuit across

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.930 
new Austin Texas circuit across
start/finish<00:02:18.260> straight<00:02:18.290> up<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.190> hill<00:02:19.370> I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
start/finish straight up the hill I

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.699 
start/finish straight up the hill I
think<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.629> quite<00:02:20.720> steep<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.349> then<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
think it's quite steep and then the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.710 
think it's quite steep and then the
track<00:02:21.920> opens<00:02:22.099> up<00:02:22.430> which<00:02:22.879> is<00:02:22.970> very<00:02:23.150> similar<00:02:23.390> to

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
track opens up which is very similar to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.630 
track opens up which is very similar to
what<00:02:23.959> we<00:02:24.080> have<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.260> India<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.830> very<00:02:25.370> tight

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
what we have in India a very tight

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.309 
what we have in India a very tight
hairpin<00:02:26.030> corner<00:02:26.209> here<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> wide<00:02:26.930> exit

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
hairpin corner here with a wide exit

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.250 
hairpin corner here with a wide exit
wide<00:02:27.560> entry<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:29.000> downhill<00:02:29.209> through<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.989> very

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
wide entry going downhill through a very

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.949 
wide entry going downhill through a very
fast<00:02:30.590> right-hander<00:02:31.220> with<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:32.030> RS<00:02:32.239> open<00:02:32.660> fifth

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
fast right-hander with the RS open fifth

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.680 
fast right-hander with the RS open fifth

sixth gear even into seventh gear for

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.589 
sixth gear even into seventh gear for
these<00:02:35.810> kind<00:02:36.049> of<00:02:36.110> corners<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.830> bit<00:02:36.980> like

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
these kind of corners it's a bit like

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.420 
these kind of corners it's a bit like
like<00:02:38.599> Silverstone<00:02:39.470> here<00:02:39.709> where<00:02:39.860> mecodes<00:02:40.250> and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
like Silverstone here where mecodes and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.009 
like Silverstone here where mecodes and
Beckett's<00:02:40.760> at<00:02:40.910> all<00:02:41.000> these<00:02:41.150> series<00:02:41.599> of<00:02:41.690> corner

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
Beckett's at all these series of corner

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.199 
Beckett's at all these series of corner
stay<00:02:42.769> on<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.040> inside<00:02:43.370> here<00:02:43.610> come<00:02:43.970> back<00:02:44.180> a

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
stay on the inside here come back a

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.449 
stay on the inside here come back a
little<00:02:44.569> bit<00:02:44.690> for<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:44.980> tricky<00:02:45.980> left-hand

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
little bit for that tricky left-hand

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.900 
little bit for that tricky left-hand
kink<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:48.500> we're<00:02:49.099> almost<00:02:49.280> through<00:02:49.640> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
kink and then we're almost through the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.470 
kink and then we're almost through the
infield

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
infield

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.509 
infield
this<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.230> right-left<00:02:51.650> combination<00:02:51.920> again

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
this is a right-left combination again

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.610 
this is a right-left combination again
and<00:02:52.790> then<00:02:52.940> we're<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.140> back<00:02:54.290> straight

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
and then we're on to the back straight

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.280 
and then we're on to the back straight
I'm<00:02:55.370> going<00:02:55.670> downhill<00:02:55.940> quite<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.450> bit<00:02:56.629> all<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
I'm going downhill quite a bit all the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.479 
I'm going downhill quite a bit all the
way<00:02:57.560> up<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.860> seventh<00:02:58.190> gear<00:02:58.430> fire<00:02:59.120> down<00:02:59.450> here

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
way up to seventh gear fire down here

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.309 
way up to seventh gear fire down here
approaching<00:03:01.489> another<00:03:01.700> hairpin<00:03:02.660> corner<00:03:02.870> again

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
approaching another hairpin corner again

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.050 
approaching another hairpin corner again
very<00:03:03.620> wide<00:03:03.860> on<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.519> entry<00:03:04.849> which

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
very wide on the on the entry which

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.140 
very wide on the on the entry which
allows<00:03:05.720> different<00:03:06.200> lines<00:03:06.620> yeah<00:03:07.459> important<00:03:08.120> to

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
allows different lines yeah important to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.420 
allows different lines yeah important to
get<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.360> good<00:03:08.510> exit<00:03:08.720> early<00:03:09.230> on<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.769> DRS<00:03:10.129> again<00:03:10.400> I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
get a good exit early on the DRS again I

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.819 
get a good exit early on the DRS again I
think<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:10.879> is<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.180> longest<00:03:11.900> straight<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.319> of

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
think this is the longest straight of of

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.009 
think this is the longest straight of of
the<00:03:13.010> circuit<00:03:13.489> I'm<00:03:14.239> sure<00:03:14.450> there<00:03:14.599> will<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.840> lot

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
the circuit I'm sure there will be a lot

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.979 
the circuit I'm sure there will be a lot
of<00:03:15.069> overtaking<00:03:16.069> action<00:03:16.880> down<00:03:17.030> here<00:03:17.329> very

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
of overtaking action down here very

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.509 
of overtaking action down here very
important<00:03:18.470> now<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.620> get<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:19.010> right<00:03:19.160> braking

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
important now to get the right braking

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.210 
important now to get the right braking
spots<00:03:19.819> in<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.989> brake<00:03:21.200> about<00:03:21.530> 150

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
spots in here I have to brake about 150

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.400 
spots in here I have to brake about 150
meters<00:03:22.579> again<00:03:23.359> a<00:03:23.389> very<00:03:23.690> tight<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.200> slow

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
meters again a very tight and slow

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.199 
meters again a very tight and slow
hairpin<00:03:24.769> corner<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.370> should<00:03:25.819> be<00:03:25.850> good<00:03:25.970> for

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
hairpin corner so should be good for

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.080 
hairpin corner so should be good for
overtaking<00:03:27.609> accelerating<00:03:28.609> up<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.849> fourth

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
overtaking accelerating up to fourth

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.449 
overtaking accelerating up to fourth
gear<00:03:29.329> back<00:03:29.660> down<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.019> second<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:31.069> is<00:03:31.190> quite

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
gear back down to second this is quite

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.009 
gear back down to second this is quite
an<00:03:31.579> interesting<00:03:31.700> corner<00:03:32.329> here<00:03:32.450> double<00:03:32.840> rides

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
an interesting corner here double rides

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.680 
an interesting corner here double rides
and<00:03:33.380> then<00:03:33.620> some<00:03:34.190> banking<00:03:34.670> into<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.209> left<00:03:35.480> one

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
and then some banking into a left one

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.900 
and then some banking into a left one
but<00:03:35.959> with<00:03:36.079> a<00:03:36.109> late<00:03:36.319> apex<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:37.519> important

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
but with a late apex so it's important

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.360 
but with a late apex so it's important
to<00:03:37.940> clip<00:03:38.209> this<00:03:38.359> one<00:03:38.709> early<00:03:39.709> on<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.889> power<00:03:40.099> and

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
to clip this one early on the power and

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.270 
to clip this one early on the power and
now<00:03:40.970> we<00:03:41.030> come<00:03:41.269> into<00:03:41.739> what<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:42.889> basically

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
now we come into what is basically

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.949 
now we come into what is basically
turkey<00:03:43.849> turn<00:03:44.030> eight<00:03:44.269> but<00:03:44.510> not<00:03:44.720> left

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
turkey turn eight but not left

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.470 
turkey turn eight but not left
right-handed<00:03:45.950> very<00:03:46.519> quick<00:03:46.849> full<00:03:47.269> throttle

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
right-handed very quick full throttle

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.159 
right-handed very quick full throttle

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
through here 250 kph second last corner

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.069 
through here 250 kph second last corner
medium<00:03:51.709> speed<00:03:51.980> left<00:03:52.250> hander<00:03:52.609> quite<00:03:53.150> nice<00:03:53.329> get

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
medium speed left hander quite nice get

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.259 
medium speed left hander quite nice get
a<00:03:54.109> good<00:03:54.290> rhythm<00:03:54.380> through<00:03:54.709> here<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.090> is
