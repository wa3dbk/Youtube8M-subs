00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.869 

I've<00:00:00.510> installed<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.290> solar<00:00:01.530> panel<00:00:01.860> array<00:00:02.310> in

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
I've installed a solar panel array in

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.150 
I've installed a solar panel array in
order<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.480> reduce<00:00:03.840> our<00:00:04.110> reliance<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:04.710> the

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
order to reduce our reliance on the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.730 
order to reduce our reliance on the
petrol<00:00:05.520> generator<00:00:06.109> so<00:00:07.109> here's<00:00:07.350> what<00:00:07.529> we've

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
petrol generator so here's what we've

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.790 
petrol generator so here's what we've
done<00:00:08.570> my<00:00:09.570> initial<00:00:09.960> plans<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.620> white

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
done my initial plans the white

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.249 
done my initial plans the white
container<00:00:11.309> was<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.389> producing<00:00:13.019> most

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
container was to have it producing most

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.890 
container was to have it producing most
of<00:00:13.469> our<00:00:13.590> power<00:00:13.940> this<00:00:14.940> would<00:00:15.150> be<00:00:15.299> achieved<00:00:15.660> by

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
of our power this would be achieved by

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.140 
of our power this would be achieved by
putting<00:00:16.080> panels<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> roof<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.520> batteries

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
putting panels on the roof and batteries

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.380 
putting panels on the roof and batteries
in<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.390> generator<00:00:18.869> inside<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:20.000> thought<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
in a generator inside I thought that the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.390 
in a generator inside I thought that the
performance<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.199> was<00:00:22.320> getting<00:00:22.769> from<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> two

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
performance I was getting from the two

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.580 
performance I was getting from the two
panels<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> white<00:00:24.330> container<00:00:24.869> was

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
panels on the white container was

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.099 
panels on the white container was
nowhere<00:00:25.859> near<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.400> good<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.449> single<00:00:27.810> panel

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
nowhere near as good as the single panel

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.009 
nowhere near as good as the single panel
running<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> lighting<00:00:29.599> when<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> came<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
running the lighting when I came to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.650 
running the lighting when I came to
installing<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.890> panels<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.430> an<00:00:32.550> angle<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.210> the

installing the panels at an angle on the
white<00:00:33.840> container<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.880> started<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.000> notice<00:00:36.210> some

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
white container I started to notice some

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.350 
white container I started to notice some
more<00:00:36.870> details<00:00:37.850> there<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.000> trees<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
more details there are trees that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.869 
more details there are trees that
obscure<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> light<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.040> I've<00:00:41.129> got<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> rethink

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
obscure the light so I've got to rethink

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.229 
obscure the light so I've got to rethink
my<00:00:42.090> plans<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:43.829> most<00:00:44.040> obvious<00:00:44.489> solution<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
my plans the most obvious solution to

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
my plans the most obvious solution to
solve<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.750> issue<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.860> put<00:00:47.039> solar<00:00:47.340> panels

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
solve this issue is to put solar panels

why<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> white<00:00:51.120> container<00:00:51.570> isn't<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.140> very

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
why the white container isn't a very

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.650 
why the white container isn't a very
good<00:00:52.410> place<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> panel's<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
good place for the panel's in the

built a prototype frame and I'm going to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.660 
built a prototype frame and I'm going to
see<00:01:19.619> how<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.040> works<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.890> frame<00:01:23.189> uses<00:01:23.640> a

see how this works out the frame uses a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.810 
see how this works out the frame uses a
minimum<00:01:24.180> amount<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.659> welding<00:01:25.200> I've<00:01:25.580> used<00:01:26.580> lots

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
minimum amount of welding I've used lots

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
minimum amount of welding I've used lots
of<00:01:26.970> nuts<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> bolts<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> order<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> make<00:01:28.500> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
of nuts and bolts in order to make it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.800 
of nuts and bolts in order to make it
modular<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> easy<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:30.000> me<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.780> my

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.860 

a<00:01:51.800> single<00:01:52.800> panel<00:01:53.190> makes<00:01:53.670> fabrication<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
a single panel makes fabrication and

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.420 
a single panel makes fabrication and
roof<00:01:55.080> access<00:01:55.650> very<00:01:55.950> easy

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.310 

however<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.670> double<00:02:00.000> panel<00:02:00.240> gives<00:02:00.930> me<00:02:01.110> more

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
however the double panel gives me more

happy with the way this is turned out so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410 
happy with the way this is turned out so
I'm<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.190> roll<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.149> rest<00:02:09.330> of

I'm going to roll it out to the rest of
the<00:02:09.539> container<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.320> I'll<00:02:10.800> show<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.070> how<00:02:11.310> I've

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
the container and I'll show you how I've

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.840 
the container and I'll show you how I've
done<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.650> panel's<00:02:14.070> will<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.640> roof

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
done it the panel's will go on the roof

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.390 
done it the panel's will go on the roof
in<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.180> sawtooth<00:02:15.450> arrangement<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.130> means

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
in a sawtooth arrangement but this means

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.699 
in a sawtooth arrangement but this means
that<00:02:17.580> they're<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.000> cast<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.510> shadow

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
that they're going to cast a shadow

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.220 
that they're going to cast a shadow
potentially<00:02:19.709> on<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.890> panel<00:02:20.430> behind<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:21.230> so

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
potentially on the panel behind it so

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.020 
potentially on the panel behind it so

photo<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.220> see<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.760> times<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.420> where

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
photo you can see the times and where

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.040 
photo you can see the times and where
the<00:02:30.690> shadow<00:02:30.720> comes<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:32.360> 1610<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.600> my<00:02:33.810> latest

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
the shadow comes to 1610 is my latest

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.800 
the shadow comes to 1610 is my latest
shadow<00:02:34.520> so<00:02:35.520> now<00:02:35.700> I'll<00:02:35.880> show<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.180> how<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> put

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
shadow so now I'll show you how I put

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.770 
shadow so now I'll show you how I put
the<00:02:36.989> rest<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> panel's<00:02:37.800> up<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.630> used<00:02:39.630> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
the rest of the panel's up I used a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.690 
the rest of the panel's up I used a
flapper<00:02:40.050> disc<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.590> grind<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> paint<00:02:41.250> off<00:02:41.520> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
flapper disc to grind the paint off the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.300
