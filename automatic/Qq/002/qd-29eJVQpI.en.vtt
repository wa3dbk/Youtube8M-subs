00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.700
 listen son 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.330
 While I say this, you're lying down. 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.920
 sleeping a little hand sent under the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.980
 his face 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.190
 the blond dips wet with sweat 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.340
 glued on the forehead between 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.610
 sneak in your room 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.480
 a few minutes ago while I 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.850
 I was sitting reading in the newspaper in the living room. 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.870
 was assaulted by a suffocating wave of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.530
 remorse and feeling guilty comes to me 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.969
 stand by your bed 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.210
 Son, I've been thinking about some 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.079
 things have been uncompromising with 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 you when it was time to go to 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.289
 school to the law with you for not judging 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.030
 Straight face with towel 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.740
 I called the attention for not clearing 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.140
 shoes 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.220
 I screamed at you for taking 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.250
 some of their belongings on the floor during 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.940
 the breakfast also involved 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.209
 some things you spilled coffee outside 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.979
 cup did not chew the food because the 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:29.729
 elbow on the table 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.069
 He spent too much bread and butter when 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.590
 started to play i was already leaving 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:38.069
 to catch the train 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.000
 you turned around, he waved his hand and said 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:44.520
 Dad and I are already doing 100 in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.900
 answer he said in law these 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.240
 numbers 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:54.240
 It all started late in the afternoon. 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.520
 I came back when I reached home I saw 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.790
 you kneel playing marbles 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.880
 with her friends and her socks were 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.010
 I humbled him before his 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.970
 little friends getting into my 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.119
 front 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.460
 socks are expensive if you buy them 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.200
 I'd take more care of them 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.980
 imagine if the son tito by a father more 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.140
 late when I read in the library 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.630
 Remember how you came to me. 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.260
 shyly a kind of hurt 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.540
 imprinted in your eyes when I left 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.130
 in the newspaper look angry with the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.430
 interruption 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.820
 You stopped at the door what you want. 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.459
 I asked ruthlessly 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.480
 You said nothing but ran away. 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.930
 mipibu in my direction passed his 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.980
 arms around my neck and me 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.370
 kissed his arms were tightening the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.610
 with a pure feature that God made 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:06.360
 grow in your heart and that none 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.640
 I was able to remove the indifference to follow 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.890
 she scrambled up the stairs 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.530
 of the stairs in my son did not happen much 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.530
 time and my fingers loosened the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.380
 newspaper slipped between them and a 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.700
 dreadful and nauseating fear took hold of 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.209
 me that was the habit of making me 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.600
 the habit of finding mistakes to make 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.500
 reprimand was in this way that the 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.590
 was rewarding for being a child. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.970
 not that I did not love the fact that I 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.250
 I was expecting too much from youth and I 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.870
 evaluated by the standards of my own 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.930
 life and there was so much of belle 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.330
 true to your character your 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.930
 Little heart was as big as the sun. 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.200
 that rose behind the hills and this 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.980
 I noticed by his spontaneous gesture of 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.100
 run and give her a good night kiss 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.530
 Nothing else matters to me tonight, son. 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.370
 I entered the gloom of your room and 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.040
 I knelt beside his bed. 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.460
 I confess ashamed it is an atonement 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.490
 useless 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.600
 I know that if you were awake, I would not 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.370
 I would understand these things but tomorrow I 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.780
 I will be a real father would be your friend. 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.140
 I will suffer when you suffer. 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.479
 I took you when you smile, I can 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.060
 language when words in patients 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.490
 they want to leave by mouth 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.570
 I will say and repeat as if it were a 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.470
 ritual 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.620
 he's just a boy 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.500
 and I know what I 've seen so far with 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.720
 a man made but looking now son 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.350
 shrunken and frightened in its nest 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.830
 I certify that a baby still yesterday 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:14.780
 was in the arms of his mother 's head 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:19.330
 lying on her son's shoulder requires a lot 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.790
 How much you require from you. 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:27.940
 I promise that from now on I will 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.940
 remind me he's just a boy
