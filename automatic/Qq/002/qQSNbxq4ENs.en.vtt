00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.929
 if you like spending time in the kitchen 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.340
 experimenting with recipes 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.660
 you will surely like the following idea 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.580
 Today I am going to modify 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.180
 popular high-calorie snack 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.310
 spinach cheese sauce when on 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 try to remake the recipe first 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 should focus on the most 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.000
 calorie ingredients that are like 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.309
 usually contain a lot of fat then 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.200
 you should consider whether you want to reduce 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.079
 their number or replaced by more 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.059
 useful alternatives then try 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 increase the number of some of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.350
 useful components 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.450
 for example vegetables or even add 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.059
 some useful ingredients which 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.160
 not in the original recipe this 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.500
 Spinach sauce is traditionally prepared with 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.989
 cream cheese and sour cream and mayonnaise 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.050
 Parmesan cheese and very little 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.940
 amount of spinach 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.789
 this sauce contains almost one 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.330
 Thousands of 400 calories and more than half 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.460
 cups of fat and that's not counting the calories and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.510
 fat in bread or chips that you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 I dunk him about my version 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.520
 changed three things i replaced the ingredients 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 high fat less 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 fatty alternatives increased the amount 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.080
 spinach and reduced amount of cheese 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.909
 parmesan and so that's what we'll do 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.920
 take plain low fat yogurt 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.369
 which will replace us well with sour cream 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.170
 used in the original recipe 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.840
 then I'm going to add low-fat cheese 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.790
 ricotta which I chose because he 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 soft and creamy and therefore 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.189
 great replace us with cream cheese and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.189
 mayonnaise 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.450
 then i mix all the ingredients 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.979
 adding some lemon juice 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.869
 lemon juice can replace 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.880
 piquancy and tangy flavor 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.829
 mayonnaise now just mix 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 ingredients and season with small 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.619
 amount of salt and fresh pepper 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.450
 taste and finally add fresh garlic 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.030
 or if you don't want to use 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.810
 fresh then you can add garlic either 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.770
 sly powder and the last thing i 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.650
 did 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.420
 I reduced the amount of Parmesan cheese with 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.460
 full cup according to the recipe 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.070
 up to a quarter cup of this will be quite 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.080
 enough since Parmesan cheese has 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.500
 pronounced and persistent taste 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.750
 now it's time to add spinach i 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.510
 I use sliced â€‹â€‹frozen spinach 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.790
 giving him a pre on that and squeezing 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.710
 it on the net with a spoon to remove 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.840
 the bulk of the liquid now i'm 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.450
 gently mix the resulting mixture 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.380
 because my drinking bowl is a bit small and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.600
 it's all you probably noticed that the volume 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.520
 The resulting sauce is much more than 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.450
 the original version that allowed me 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.190
 further reduce calorie 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.300
 the most important thing is that this recipe contains 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.610
 no more than 500 calories instead of 1400 besides 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.740
 thanks to the increased volume now 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.380
 less calories like a tablespoon so 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.270
 and per serving another difference is 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.760
 that I'm not going to serve it with 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.250
 chips or bread I will serve it in the form 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.500
 dipping raw carrots and 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.660
 fresh cucumbers I will be frank with you 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.670
 he is certainly not so creamy and 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.190
 cheesy like the original but it tastes 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.690
 excellent and sure to spare you 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.520
 extra calories keep in mind that the goal 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.650
 this modification was not a creation 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.390
 new recipe indistinguishable from 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.340
 of the original we just tried 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.680
 reduce your calorie calorie 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.900
 dishes and make it more useful 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.910
 so you can enjoy it with less 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.190
 guilt and don't be surprised if 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.180
 you will like the new version even more 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.180
 than old
