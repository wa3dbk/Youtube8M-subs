00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
position was then we recommend that you

reset option you will then have to

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.049 
reset option you will then have to
follow<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.739> picture-perfect<00:00:53.489> steps

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
follow all the picture-perfect steps

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.340 
follow all the picture-perfect steps
again<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.559> point<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.199> we

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
again up to this point and that's all we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.720 
again up to this point and that's all we
need<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> color<00:00:59.579> control<00:01:01.519> in<00:01:02.519> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
need to do with the color control in the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.700 
need to do with the color control in the
past<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.300> recommended<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> use

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
past it was recommended that you use

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.520 
past it was recommended that you use
blue<00:01:05.250> filter<00:01:05.640> glasses<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.630> these<00:01:06.870> thx

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
blue filter glasses like these thx

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.760 
blue filter glasses like these thx
glasses<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.670> set<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> color<00:01:09.210> control<00:01:09.770> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
glasses to set the color control the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.200 
glasses to set the color control the
problem<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.280> approach<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.910> that<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
problem with this approach is that the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
problem with this approach is that the
blue<00:01:12.480> filter<00:01:12.720> material<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.680> matches<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
blue filter material really matches the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940 
blue filter material really matches the
blue<00:01:14.580> color<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.420> TV<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.620> there's<00:01:16.830> no

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
blue color of the TV so there's no

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
blue color of the TV so there's no
guarantee<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.880> results<00:01:18.300> are<00:01:18.420> accurate

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
guarantee that the results are accurate

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
guarantee that the results are accurate
we<00:01:19.380> therefore<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:19.920> recommend<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
we therefore do not recommend that you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
we therefore do not recommend that you
use<00:01:21.330> blue<00:01:21.810> filter<00:01:22.200> glasses<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.890> set<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.430 
TVs you may find a color filter option
in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> picture<00:01:29.790> menu<00:01:30.030> which<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> more

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
that blue and white areas of the pattern

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.670 
that blue and white areas of the pattern
and<00:02:12.290> now<00:02:12.800> both<00:02:13.130> blue<00:02:13.990> if<00:02:14.990> there<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> slight

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and now both blue if there is a slight

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.250 
and now both blue if there is a slight
difference<00:02:16.130> between<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.550> blue<00:02:16.850> areas<00:02:17.360> adjust

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
difference between the blue areas adjust

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.080 
difference between the blue areas adjust
the<00:02:18.380> color<00:02:18.620> control<00:02:19.100> until<00:02:19.550> they<00:02:19.700> look<00:02:19.880> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
the color control until they look the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.470 
the color control until they look the
same<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:21.530> should<00:02:21.800> only<00:02:22.010> require<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.850> couple

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
same this should only require a couple

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.510 
same this should only require a couple
of<00:02:23.570> steps<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:24.110> either<00:02:24.470> direction<00:02:24.739> with<00:02:25.370> the

of steps in either direction with the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.420 
of steps in either direction with the
control<00:02:25.970> when<00:02:26.930> both<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.230> blue<00:02:27.530> areas<00:02:27.920> look<00:02:28.250> the

control when both of blue areas look the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.610 
control when both of blue areas look the
