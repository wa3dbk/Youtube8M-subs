00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.320
 No 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 but there I am again and you can already see it 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.140
 the italian bride does this is the look 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.190
 I am going to make nathalie like him 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.570
 is getting married 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.250
 you still have no idea about it 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.830
 have a look at our personal 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.869
 update number 5 because want me goes too 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.210
 self confidence and I am now going to do cup at 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.790
 my cousin who is getting married and his wife 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.080
 on him I have almost lightly asked 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
 mainly apple 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.650
 I thought he was very honored and well this 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.989
 has thus become the look 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.379
 maybe it does n't seem that exciting 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.809
 formulas look a little bit and 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 that's the green brown golden smokey 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.290
 eyes look but many branches go 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 usually very soft and natural 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.190
 so on the other hand I am very sorry 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.110
 glad that after not like a little something 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.690
 wanted darker and besides this whole 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 beautiful brown eyes in your hazel domain name 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.049
 because of the gold and she also has pretty well 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.909
 with your more large a large beautiful 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.320
 At a glance, she wants smaller doors 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.479
 lips so it's in her for right 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.110
 incredibly beautiful to emphasize a name 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.030
 to lay 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.619
 so it's a hair just right 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.150
 incredibly beautiful to emphasize 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.100
 was in her eyes and her lips 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.900
 hence there are smokey eyes for it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.250
 chosen and there I am like him 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.750
 first video shows the job 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.979
 very happy with it because that is completely 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.719
 my street 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.149
 so look at an already google can 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.500
 make the basics first 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.439
 I already did because you are 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.210
 meanwhile, there are so good 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.770
 eye shadow base of too faced find yes 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.299
 that remains a favorite 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 These days eyebrows always do with 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.200
 this pennsylvania masca and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.429
 these colors call my influence then 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.079
 Do you also know me every time 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.780
 mean in my articles that is the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.490
 Dises this green color left in gravy 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.820
 with your kind of mustard green that goes on 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.820
 the eyelid 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.799
 this color sometimes gives a lot of pleasure 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.960
 glitter from bee comes from too faced 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.460
 return or sexy tent 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.840
 I'm worried I hear it a little 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.819
 bit off it is different to help 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.159
 on your face with this urban pencil 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.200
 decay those bombs I go under my eye 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.520
 this is brown with golden shimmers and whatever 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.469
 the shimmer's in it is not very 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.210
 nice to wear it on the waterline 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.240
 so in the waterline than i an aunt 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.430
 brown eyeliner to 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.450
 om adsense this is like my dog 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.770
 chocolate 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.180
 yes well then go the bottom line 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.980
 I blended a bit with this little 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.980
 short tassel of front cover 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.450
 so this rose absolutely nothing on the brush 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.240
 is just a clean brush 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.100
 too faced natural eye palette mine and the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.020
 golden color of that pot that goes in 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.300
 the arcade arch and the brown color 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.970
 also off to my head 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.220
 I believe that goes in the outer 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.290
 corner of the eye 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.580
 I am also a 125 of sigma and 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.050
 consequences on the line of the eyebrows 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.050
 on making you around 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.440
 then I grab with this pencil brush 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.450
 sigma so the color behind the sale 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.000
 brown with golden shimmers and now I am 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.270
 first a kind of v-shape in the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.050
 outer corner of eye to next line 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.050
 the bottom of my eye 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.080
 then i need an occasional one with you 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.030
 compare with the other eye 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.010
 so there i am going to touch up like that 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.510
 the wind eyeliner leads the will and lead 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.130
 the end 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.130
 I am wearing it in the arcade arch 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.380
 you will be completely in line with it 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.380
 see you soon 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.050
 and finally you are done with you 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.820
 partner and card 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.700
 and then you mix it a little 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.110
 has on TV with a clean brush or 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.750
 at least just a trainer and I like it 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.340
 ordinary have been applied and will still be 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.130
 a little brown on this blending brush 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.130
 less good at things 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.349
 now i had is dead pixel in most 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.349
 corner of the eye 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.850
 tidus to the eye look he is not whole 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.830
 difficult we are now busy with the 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.420
 highlighter likes and anne's these 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.730
 upper highlighter on my implant 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.230
 peeling 10 little orange sound the camera 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.850
 which goes in the inner corner of the eye and 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.140
 under the eyebrow bone 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.790
 he seems very ugly but is real 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.650
 beautiful and just the color 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.780
 so dati her dress is really kind 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.970
 very nice white in front wood 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.800
 you are going to see it in one 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.720
 inner corner of the eye I do it a whole 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.720
 delicious bevel brush to love 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.690
 their presence always a bit 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.340
 further say dare and others in one 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.750
 bit through all the way to the inside 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.130
 corner of the eye 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.010
 then this is the look in between 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.910
 maybe a very simple look but it 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.380
 is just 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.870
 yes of course just want to ever smokey 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.940
 eye and the color of her dress is full 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.140
 processed and once said someone treaty 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.540
 until now a black line on an eye 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.680
 nothing else you can do you can 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.570
 maybe imagine if you have that 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.520
 I think that is really fantastic 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.720
 it's just very beautiful dark smokey 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.820
 look may not be very special 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.350
 but I certainly think in the without that 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.940
 will shine beautifully 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.130
 time for mascara so this is actually 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.390
 the eye looks batteries are rather simple but 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.310
 I think he is really beautiful 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.110
 for the italian wedding i see 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.090
 but completely green my a4 to white 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.370
 enter golden dress and do so pretty 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.230
 now you smokey the rest 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.730
 last time with her because it is such 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.230
 powdery eye shadows are falling it 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.600
 actually completely up here 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.310
 and I got her from this later 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.270
 done that is very beautiful 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.770
 because that means you can still say with 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.170
 tighten it completely and concealer 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.490
 england foundation of things heaven can 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.930
 me 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.820
 that is not going to do now because I have 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.500
 miraculously not tampered with 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.990
 I would normally now have foundation 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.730
 do i now faithfully test his bibi cream 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.350
 may not yet be from which so he 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.710
 to be candy again 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.010
 what did i let myself be done 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.890
 I have we have shaped with this mix bluff 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.510
 sidewalk and she left her cheeks 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.910
 because she finds that very beautiful in condition 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.310
 also very nice with these mac strether's and 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.570
 if he suffers, I think so 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.240
 maybe you can already guess 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.430
 what a highlighter I have worked for 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.390
 yes indeed kim k is a rose 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.950
 beauty pallet 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.840
 he said that also goes on the cheeks and 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.400
 that is just super nice 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.410
 counters almost then I also efficient 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.210
 with the kitchen paper trick so take a look 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.960
 to pretty basic ships blush and 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.750
 highlighter 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.710
 because that is it to just finish where i am doing 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.710
 now it 's the loose wrist 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.450
 made fun now for him I have to 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.450
 gamble 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.320
 the lips on the lips are kind of now 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.450
 color because you are going without going 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.550
 nevertheless a man off I use a mix of 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.410
 the lip tar loops but that blood one 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.820
 bit like saying so that withdraws 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.860
 in the lips in this van rimmel 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.210
 apocalips this is Finnish man it's one 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.500
 now sort it up with very good climbing 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.500
 so that's why I don't like it 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.190
 Well this is the final look I 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.690
 may suggest you 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.420
 think again not very special 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.250
 for a wedding but yes i know in this 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.410
 case it is something else if you are not 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.520
 very often you can instruct heavy 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.320
 maybe imagine this though 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.360
 very special so I think it's so beautiful 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.040
 I can't attack in any case 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.380
 and Italy later because it is simple 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.700
 no complicated things and I find him 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.350
 definitely wants to be suitable for uv else 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.730
 wedding in which of course goes on 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.060
 travel with me like it when i go there 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.410

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.290
