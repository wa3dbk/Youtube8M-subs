fly the original black fly i think is a

but<00:05:01.819> I'm<00:05:01.999> thinking<00:05:02.539> of<00:05:02.659> taking<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.080> off<00:05:03.199> the

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
but I'm thinking of taking it off the

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.980 
but I'm thinking of taking it off the
site<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.370> either<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.629> are<00:05:05.810> just

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
site but either that are just

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.779 
site but either that are just
designating<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.770> as<00:05:06.889> a<00:05:06.949> stove<00:05:07.339> to<00:05:07.520> bake<00:05:07.759> with

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
designating it as a stove to bake with

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.790 
designating it as a stove to bake with
because<00:05:08.270> it's<00:05:08.419> really<00:05:08.839> perfect<00:05:09.080> for<00:05:09.409> baking

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
because it's really perfect for baking

because it's really perfect for baking
although<00:05:10.669> i<00:05:11.020> know<00:05:12.020> that<00:05:12.199> i<00:05:12.259> think<00:05:12.319> about<00:05:12.499> i

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
although i know that i think about i

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.050 
although i know that i think about i
think<00:05:12.949> i<00:05:13.039> would<00:05:13.159> rather<00:05:13.310> have<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.610> black<00:05:13.819> fly

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
think i would rather have the black fly

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.420 
think i would rather have the black fly
too<00:05:14.120> well<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:15.110> ice<00:05:15.259> will<00:05:15.469> fly<00:05:15.650> pull<00:05:16.009> one<00:05:16.219> wake

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
too well the ice will fly pull one wake

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.800 
too well the ice will fly pull one wake
