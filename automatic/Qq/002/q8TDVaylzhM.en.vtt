uplink<00:00:16.049> spot<00:00:16.379> series<00:00:16.940> basically<00:00:17.940> uplink<00:00:18.810> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
uplink spot series basically uplink is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.960 
uplink spot series basically uplink is
getting<00:00:19.170> taken<00:00:19.500> out<00:00:19.590> apparently<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.490> I'm

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
getting taken out apparently so I'm

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.230 
getting taken out apparently so I'm
gonna<00:00:21.900> drop<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.490> you<00:00:23.490> know<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.880> getting

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
gonna drop that you know it's getting

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.540 
gonna drop that you know it's getting
taken<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.990> MLG<00:00:25.380> rotation<00:00:25.980> MLG

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
taken out of the MLG rotation MLG

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.339 
taken out of the MLG rotation MLG
variant<00:00:26.849> rotation<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.900> kind<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.199> useless

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
variant rotation so it's kind of useless

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.130 
variant rotation so it's kind of useless
to<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.800> those<00:00:29.010> spots<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.269> instead<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.019> I'm

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290 
objective and you'll see what I mean in
a<00:00:40.590> second<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.070> don't<00:00:41.250> already<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.579> so

a second if you don't already know so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
a second if you don't already know so
this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.079> bio<00:00:43.260> lab<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.710> course<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.280> i'm

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
this is on bio lab of course and i'm

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.310 
this is on bio lab of course and i'm
going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> show<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.180> first<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.989> over

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
going to show you the first one over

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.619 
going to show you the first one over
here<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.649> B<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.300> this

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
here at B now as you can see this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.600 
here at B now as you can see this
big-ass<00:00:48.930> yellow<00:00:49.350> billing<00:00:49.829> building<00:00:50.399> here

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
big-ass yellow billing building here

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.610 
big-ass yellow billing building here
there's<00:00:51.090> an<00:00:51.239> airplane<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.780> comes<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.410> then

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
there's an airplane that comes with then

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.459 
there's an airplane that comes with then
drops<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.719> periodically<00:00:54.719> through<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
drops it down periodically through the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.529 
drops it down periodically through the
map<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.010> think<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.699> after<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.090> second

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
map I think it's like after the second

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.290 
map I think it's like after the second
and<00:00:57.660> third<00:00:57.690> round<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.140> snd<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.000> drops<00:01:00.000> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and third round of snd it drops this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
and third round of snd it drops this
big-ass<00:01:00.539> yellow<00:01:00.989> building<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.739> there's<00:01:02.070> two

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
big-ass yellow building so there's two

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.830 
big-ass yellow building so there's two
variants<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.000> spot<00:01:03.300> i'm<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> show

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
variants of this spot i'm going to show

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.440 
variants of this spot i'm going to show
you<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.739> first<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.760> building<00:01:06.150> here

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you the first one with the building here

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
you the first one with the building here
and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.320> i'm<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.770> I'm

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and then what i'm going to do is I'm

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.859 
and then what i'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> go<00:01:08.670> end<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> game<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> show<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
going to go end the game and show you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230 
going to go end the game and show you
what<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.950> without<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.670> building<00:01:12.030> here

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
what it's like without the building here

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.100 
what it's like without the building here
so<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.400> most<00:01:14.700> important<00:01:15.210> thing<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.630> all

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
so the very most important thing of all

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570 
so the very most important thing of all
of<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.619> make<00:01:16.799> sure<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.189> plant<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of these is make sure that you plant the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.850 
of these is make sure that you plant the
bomb<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.970> correct<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.500> don't<00:01:19.650> plant

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
bomb the correct way if you don't plant

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
bomb the correct way if you don't plant
the<00:01:20.009> bomb<00:01:20.159> correctly<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.090> any<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.450> these<00:01:21.540> spots

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the bomb correctly on any of these spots

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.090 
the bomb correctly on any of these spots
it's<00:01:22.020> basically<00:01:22.350> pointless<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:22.920> they

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's basically pointless because they

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.710 
it's basically pointless because they
can<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.430> diffuse<00:01:23.790> from<00:01:23.909> another<00:01:24.180> angle<00:01:24.390> so

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
can just diffuse from another angle so

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.140 
can just diffuse from another angle so
make<00:01:24.900> sure<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.170> plant<00:01:25.439> facing<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
make sure you plant facing this way just

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.450 
make sure you plant facing this way just
like<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:28.590> want<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> throw<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.310> bomb

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
was the third side of s and because I

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.180 
was the third side of s and because I
can<00:03:23.660> hear<00:03:23.959> this<00:03:24.140> helicopter<00:03:24.380> that's<00:03:25.040> gonna

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
this for more

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.470 
this for more
ideal<00:03:33.140> way<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:33.920> can<00:03:34.220> pull<00:03:34.700> back<00:03:34.970> as<00:03:35.180> far<00:03:35.330> as

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
ideal way you can pull back as far as

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.660 
ideal way you can pull back as far as
you<00:03:35.630> can<00:03:35.870> when<00:03:36.140> planting<00:03:36.590> like<00:03:36.860> over<00:03:37.250> here<00:03:37.490> if

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
you can when planting like over here if

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.610 
you can when planting like over here if
you<00:03:37.790> can<00:03:38.000> that'll<00:03:38.930> just<00:03:39.050> make<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.470> little

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
you can that'll just make it a little

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.410 
you can that'll just make it a little
bit<00:03:39.920> easier<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.820> doesn't<00:03:41.120> really<00:03:41.180> matter

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
bit easier but it doesn't really matter
