 information of this video so come 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.040
 let's start with this map that this 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.769
 map really is a minigame I shit 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.540
 in the sea with the mini camera ja 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.930
 survive a minute and a half start 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.730
 Well, here he has not put who has 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.990
 but I'm going to tell you a moment 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.860
 expect that I have it here to point 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.550
 is the creator of this map see see if what 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.550
 I have here 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.300
 is 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.190
 jirito 101 so a greeting for you and 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.379
 thank you very much for making me 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.880
 this map so come on let's give it to 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:10.500
 start this map or this map this 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.590
 minigame is that they do not give you the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.570
 you're the worms so to speak or 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.670
 I have to survive like this for a 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.580
 minute and a half so the truth is 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.490
 original the truth from minimal this 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.300
 Subscriber map is super original since 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.360
 that is always sent as well as you lose and 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.550
 like you lose and you have not given me this is 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 what fails a little bit that sometimes as 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.660
 that rubs a little and does not give me but today 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.929
 he says that like that he fails but good not 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.700
 nothing is quite cool and it is very 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.210
 original because it's printing like this 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.789
 fucking adventure that if I have to 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.800
 Rescue someone you do not want or parkour 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.810
 or whatever, but come, come on, let's go 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.570
 to focus on the minigame and see if 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.330
 I get it in a minute and a half I will 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.330
 there it comes very well dodging 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.220
 come on come on let's go another one and a half 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.580
 all right 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.590
 it comes out now I do not know why they come from 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.590
 suddenly it stops 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:25.600
 this is the one I can get is the one from 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:31.930
 get through the blue 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.910
 I do not know if God has given me a lama that 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.750
 come another try to see if to see if 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.880
 I get a little 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.330
 a little more scoring to see if I 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.310
 I pass it 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.770
 and it's a little bit crappy when they come 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.020
 thus two you put yourself in the middle and still 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.390
 it gives you as an error I do not know why 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.840
 and that now comes a world 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.840
 ah 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.360
 ok we are going well we are going well on the baby 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.260
 a minute and a half I do not know how much air 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.620
 but this shit to medium but but well 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.250
 bad but well you cachis the sea come 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.020
 down last try we go there so what 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.880
 I can see if I can get it or we can 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.400
 we are here until see if I get it 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.190
 because the truth is that this guy is cool 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.770
 that is, you get hooked to blur is not that 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.750
 I'm in the yellow and I still 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.520
 says to try again 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.250
 I'm right in the yellow and it goes through 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.980
 both sides 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.750
 so that's a little bit a little 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.100
 Something is wrong or I do not know if I do not 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.430
 I place well 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.080
 omar or rubs me or I do not know what I know 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.340
 I know we're going to put on a little bit like that 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.730
 the camera to see what happens 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.240
 OK OK 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.540

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.010
