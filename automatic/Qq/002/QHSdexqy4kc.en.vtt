00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
however you have to be lucky to have a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.630 
however you have to be lucky to have a
certain<00:00:35.760> build<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:37.129> finally<00:00:38.129> found<00:00:38.309> out

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
certain build and I finally found out

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.810 
certain build and I finally found out
which<00:00:39.290> are<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> better<00:00:40.710> ones<00:00:40.980> because<00:00:41.640> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
which are the better ones because you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.250 
which are the better ones because you
also<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.800> called<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.460> PC<00:00:45.260> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
also have like one called a PC and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.389 
also have like one called a PC and
probably<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.980> VC<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.090> best<00:00:48.710> brand<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:50.100> them

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
probably a VC is the best brand of them

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.740 
probably a VC is the best brand of them
all<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.570> version<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.469> now<00:00:52.649> using<00:00:52.710> is

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
all because the version I'm now using is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
all because the version I'm now using is
also<00:00:54.750> branded<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.739> Bolin<00:00:56.219> however<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.820> can

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
also branded with Bolin however you can

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.920 
also branded with Bolin however you can
see<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.399> marginal<00:00:59.399> difference<00:00:59.930> in

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
see there is a marginal difference in

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.820 
see there is a marginal difference in
the<00:01:01.760> kind<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> materials<00:01:03.690> used<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:04.619> how

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the kind of materials used and also how

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.289 
the kind of materials used and also how

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
it the logo is printed on the

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.300 
it the logo is printed on the
transmitter<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:10.439> also<00:01:10.770> there's<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
transmitter and also there's like a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.929 
transmitter and also there's like a
small<00:01:11.790> mark<00:01:12.150> saying<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.930> an<00:01:13.320> AVC<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.189> while

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
small mark saying it's an AVC and while

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.649 
small mark saying it's an AVC and while
the<00:01:15.090> others<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.659> miss<00:01:16.549> having<00:01:17.549> such<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> mark

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the others just miss having such a mark

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.429 
the others just miss having such a mark
on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.170> product<00:01:19.650> itself<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.990> actually<00:01:21.990> this

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
on the product itself and actually this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
one is actually working the best without

the sound on the microphone quite good

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.289 
the sound on the microphone quite good
because<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:53.879> also<00:02:55.639> yeah<00:02:56.639> that's<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.269> a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
small amp actually on the transmitter

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.309 
small amp actually on the transmitter
itself<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.250> actually<00:03:05.659> have<00:03:06.659> actually

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
itself you can actually have actually

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.759 
itself you can actually have actually
the<00:03:07.650> what<00:03:08.609> it's<00:03:08.790> now<00:03:08.969> recording<00:03:09.180> or<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.290> setting

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
the what it's now recording or a setting

of<00:03:10.859> magic<00:03:11.250> lantern<00:03:11.579> on<00:03:11.969> my<00:03:12.629> t2i

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
of magic lantern on my t2i

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.680 
of magic lantern on my t2i
is<00:03:13.680> now<00:03:13.949> on<00:03:14.690> 17<00:03:16.099> DB<00:03:17.099> analog<00:03:17.549> gain<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.150> not

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
is now on 17 DB analog gain and not

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.979 
is now on 17 DB analog gain and not
really<00:03:19.109> like<00:03:19.500> need<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.340> go<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.669> 32<00:03:21.209> at<00:03:21.540> all

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
really like need to go to 32 at all

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.770 
really like need to go to 32 at all
because<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.889> microphone<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.609> this<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.120> very

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
because the microphone on this is very

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.780 
because the microphone on this is very
loud<00:03:25.079> enough<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.909> also<00:03:26.909> you<00:03:26.970> don't<00:03:27.239> want<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
loud enough and also you don't want to

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.819 
loud enough and also you don't want to
over<00:03:29.790> amp<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.479> the<00:03:30.810> transmitter<00:03:31.409> because

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
over amp it on the transmitter because

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.909 
over amp it on the transmitter because
otherwise<00:03:32.189> you<00:03:33.000> will<00:03:33.329> hear<00:03:34.169> a<00:03:34.199> bit<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.769> a

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
otherwise you will hear a bit of a

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.589 
otherwise you will hear a bit of a
distortion<00:03:35.489> sound<00:03:37.009> however<00:03:38.009> I'm<00:03:38.430> now<00:03:39.359> waiting

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
for things to actually change this

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.309
