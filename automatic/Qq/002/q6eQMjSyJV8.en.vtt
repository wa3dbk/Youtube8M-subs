00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and NPCs you want to right click on them

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.719 
and NPCs you want to right click on them

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
so if you're a completionist like me

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.929 
so if you're a completionist like me

you're definitely going to want to click

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.350 
you're definitely going to want to click
on<00:01:54.180> those<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.700> when<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> come<00:01:57.119> over<00:01:57.240> here

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
on those so when you come over here

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.830 
on those so when you come over here

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
obviously here is the new flashpoint

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
obviously here is the new flashpoint
mission<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.869> enter<00:02:03.869> phase<00:02:04.700> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700

then they also put a new pet in but yeah
that's<00:05:12.890> pretty<00:05:13.160> much<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.430> for<00:05:13.810> 2.6<00:05:15.220> not<00:05:16.220> a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
that's pretty much it for 2.6 not a

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.980 
that's pretty much it for 2.6 not a
whole<00:05:16.520> lot<00:05:16.700> at<00:05:16.910> it<00:05:17.090> but<00:05:17.300> you<00:05:17.450> know<00:05:17.480> there<00:05:17.810> was

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
whole lot at it but you know there was

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.370 
whole lot at it but you know there was
some<00:05:18.200> nice<00:05:18.410> features<00:05:18.880> I<00:05:19.880> like<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:20.990> new<00:05:21.110> flash

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
some nice features I like the new flash

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.680 
some nice features I like the new flash
point<00:05:21.710> it's<00:05:21.919> actually<00:05:22.280> pretty<00:05:22.430> fun<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.030> it's

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
point it's actually pretty fun and it's

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.650 
point it's actually pretty fun and it's
also<00:05:23.870> pretty<00:05:24.110> quick<00:05:24.440> too<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:25.070> it's<00:05:25.760> mine<00:05:26.300> I

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
also pretty quick too so it's mine I

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.060 
also pretty quick too so it's mine I
don't<00:05:27.050> think<00:05:27.110> it's<00:05:27.320> going<00:05:27.440> to<00:05:27.500> be<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.830> day<00:05:28.010> of

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
don't think it's going to be that day of

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.390 
don't think it's going to be that day of
grinding<00:05:28.550> up<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.910> new<00:05:29.060> rep<00:05:29.270> points<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:30.400> think

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
grinding up the new rep points I think

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.930 
grinding up the new rep points I think
it's<00:05:31.520> totally<00:05:31.820> worth<00:05:32.210> it<00:05:32.360> for<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:32.630> new<00:05:32.750> mount

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940
