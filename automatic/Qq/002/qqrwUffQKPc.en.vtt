Namaskar
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.133
Pulses are always nutritious.

00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:17.155
If we mix some green leaves to the pulses they become more nutritious.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.368
Today we will make cholaai moong dal.

00:00:20.584 --> 00:00:26.410
Let’s see what ingredients are required to make cholaai moong dal.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.480
Cholaai (brassiere) - 250 grams

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:37.074
There are two types of cholaai one is green and second one is reddish green.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:41.942
We are using red cholaai.

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:48.436
Remove the stalk and use only the leaves.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:53.606
Wash them nicely before bringing in use.

00:00:57.178 --> 00:01:07.683
Moong dal - 100 grams (½ cup) (washed and soaked in water for ½ hour)

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:13.057
Desi ghee- 2 tbsp

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.787
2 Tomatoes, ½ inch ginger piece and 2 green chilies - finely grinned and turned into paste

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.649
Green coriander leaves - 2-3 tbsp

00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:26.827
Asafoetida - 2 pinch

00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:29.534
Cumin seeds - ½ tsp

00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:32.229
Turmeric powder - ½ tsp

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:37.033
Salt - 1 tsp

00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:40.356
Red chilly powder- ¼ tsp

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:50.372
Firstly finely chop the cholaai leaves.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:03.791
Make a bunch and chop with knife or chopping blade which ever is easy.

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:17.249
Now we will make cholaai moong dal.

00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:45.846
Add the leaves, moong dal, 3 cup water and salt in pressure cooker.

00:02:49.504 --> 00:03:05.247
Mix all ingredients well. Cover
with lid and cook for one simmer.

00:03:05.248 --> 00:03:16.219
Turn off the gas and let
all the steam escape.

00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:22.152
Meanwhile prepare tadka for the dal.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:04:09.965
Preheat a pan; add 1.5 tbsp or less ghee, cumin seeds, asafoetida, turmeric powder and tomato-ginger and green chilly paste.

00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:17.395
Cook the masala until oil floats on the surface. Add dal in the masala when it’s ready.

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:51.178
We can directly make tadka in the
cooker by adding all ingredients

00:04:51.179 --> 00:05:02.450
in the similar manner before
adding the dal and cholaai leaves.

00:05:06.912 --> 00:05:18.170
Making tadka separately is
much easier as it consumes

00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:29.845
less time as both things can
be prepared simultaneously.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.898
We have used tomato and ginger but if we
give asafoetida and cumin seeds tadka

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:41.206
then too this dal turns out to be delicious.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.298
Mix some green chilies as well.

00:05:49.678 --> 00:05:58.784
If you like eating garlic and onion then
add 3-4 finely chopped garlic cloves

00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:07.890
and 1 finely chopped onion in the pan and
cook till it becomes little pinkish.

00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:13.778
Like wise add spices in the similar manner.

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:23.601
Now add red chilly powder and salt in the masala.

00:06:30.704 --> 00:06:43.595
Masala is ready. Now mix the dal in the tadka.

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:50.558
If you wish to have thin consistency, add more water in the dal.

00:06:50.878 --> 00:07:01.393
Add coriander leaves and take out dal in a bowl.

00:07:09.088 --> 00:07:10.644
Sprinkle desi ghee on top of the dal.

00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:19.308
Ghee added on the top gives a good aroma and enhances the taste as well.

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:22.938
Garnish with coriander leaves.

00:07:23.984 --> 00:07:31.186
Moong dal cholaai is ready and this much recipe can be served to 4 family members.

00:07:31.564 --> 00:07:37.979
Serve with chapatti, rice parantha or naan.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:44.453
