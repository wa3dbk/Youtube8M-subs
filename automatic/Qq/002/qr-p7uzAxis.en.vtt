00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
little groups this will grooves right

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.920 
little groups this will grooves right
here<00:02:50.470> what<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.220> uses<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.640> use<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.269> little<00:02:52.599> creepy

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
and it had you scrape all the thermal

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.349 
and it had you scrape all the thermal
compound<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.680> will<00:02:56.829> stuck<00:02:57.040> inside<00:02:57.220> clean<00:02:58.180> it

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
compound that will stuck inside clean it

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.869 
compound that will stuck inside clean it
out<00:02:58.480> spray<00:02:59.019> clean<00:02:59.409> it<00:02:59.560> out<00:02:59.650> blew<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.459> out<00:03:00.549> did

some little hair in it now to the

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.530 
some little hair in it now to the
thermal<00:03:31.150> compound<00:03:32.669> do<00:03:33.669> you're<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.329> going<00:03:34.480> to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
thermal compound do you're just going to

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.420 
thermal compound do you're just going to
put

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
put

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.589 
put
remember<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.299> out<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.689> side<00:03:39.450> when<00:03:40.450> do

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
remember this out of the side when do

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:46.339 
remember this out of the side when do
this<00:03:40.780> first<00:03:41.909> doing<00:03:42.909> this<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.209> i<00:03:43.239> could<00:03:44.400> get

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
this first doing this so i could get

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.349 
this first doing this so i could get
inside<00:03:47.349> those<00:03:47.530> little<00:03:47.769> grooves<00:03:48.010> from<00:03:48.609> thermal

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
inside those little grooves from thermal

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.940 
inside those little grooves from thermal
compound<00:03:49.569> inside<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.260> little<00:03:50.560> grooves<00:03:50.769> and

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
compound inside the little grooves and

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.640 
compound inside the little grooves and
I'm<00:03:51.069> spread<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.549> with<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:52.439> plastic<00:03:55.200> bag

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.710 

and<00:03:59.220> I'm<00:03:59.310> going<00:03:59.579> around<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.819> circle<00:04:00.060> come

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
and I'm going around the circle come

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.289 
and I'm going around the circle come
inside<00:04:01.019> out<00:04:01.230> just<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:05.040> be<00:04:05.189> easier<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.670> spread

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
inside out just to be easier to spread

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:43.200 
inside out just to be easier to spread
around

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:51.490 

make<00:04:43.900> sure<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.139> get<00:04:44.289> most<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.800> there

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.010 

do<00:04:52.130> this<00:04:52.370> because<00:04:52.610> uh<00:04:52.850> got<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> lot<00:04:54.080> when<00:04:54.590> they

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
do this because uh got a lot when they

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.480 
do this because uh got a lot when they
actually<00:04:57.020> follow<00:04:57.560> these<00:04:57.710> down<00:04:57.920> with<00:04:58.100> sanding

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
actually follow these down with sanding

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.260 
actually follow these down with sanding
down<00:04:58.640> Ohio<00:04:59.060> every<00:04:59.420> day<00:04:59.540> off<00:05:00.700> get<00:05:01.700> them<00:05:01.850> down<00:05:02.000> B

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
down Ohio every day off get them down B

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.520 
down Ohio every day off get them down B
flat<00:05:02.800> still<00:05:04.120> have<00:05:05.120> little<00:05:05.480> groove<00:05:05.930> inside<00:05:06.170> of

flat still have little groove inside of

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.510 
flat still have little groove inside of
them<00:05:07.720> it's<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.900> side<00:05:12.040> I'm<00:05:13.040> going<00:05:13.220> to<00:05:13.280> do<00:05:13.400> the

them it's the side I'm going to do the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.170 
them it's the side I'm going to do the
same<00:05:13.700> thing<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:15.670> put<00:05:16.670> a<00:05:16.700> little<00:05:16.820> bit<00:05:17.030> in

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
same thing to this put a little bit in

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:43.860 
same thing to this put a little bit in

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
spreading it out spread it out there

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.980 
spreading it out spread it out there
first

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.130

may you guys post a you don't do that
just<00:05:58.140> put<00:05:58.350> it<00:05:58.380> on<00:05:58.560> there<00:05:58.800> it'll<00:05:58.980> spread<00:05:59.280> out

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
just put it on there it'll spread out

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.840 
just put it on there it'll spread out
this<00:06:00.450> is<00:06:00.630> just<00:06:03.440> for<00:06:04.440> me<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:05.190> make<00:06:05.370> sure<00:06:05.400> that<00:06:05.820> i

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
this is just for me to make sure that i

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:13.629 
this is just for me to make sure that i
knows<00:06:06.150> all<00:06:06.620> spread<00:06:07.620> out<00:06:07.680> all<00:06:08.040> the<00:06:08.190> way

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:33.360 

then<00:06:16.879> more<00:06:17.879> of<00:06:18.419> it<00:06:18.629> in<00:06:18.809> middle<00:06:19.199> a<00:06:20.959> lot<00:06:21.959> more

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.310 

it's<00:06:34.000> a<00:06:34.120> little<00:06:34.300> more<00:06:34.570> than<00:06:34.810> a<00:06:34.840> pea<00:06:35.080> size

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
it's a little more than a pea size

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.510 
it's a little more than a pea size
because<00:06:35.770> our<00:06:37.440> it<00:06:38.440> has<00:06:38.650> to<00:06:38.800> spread<00:06:39.070> out<00:06:39.220> has<00:06:39.430> to

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
because our it has to spread out has to

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.399 
because our it has to spread out has to
be<00:06:39.610> thick<00:06:39.910> on<00:06:40.120> there

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:51.100 

turn<00:06:46.009> this<00:06:46.129> back<00:06:46.369> around<00:06:46.399> and<00:06:49.719> I'm<00:06:50.719> just<00:06:50.959> going

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
turn this back around and I'm just going

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.499 
turn this back around and I'm just going
to<00:06:51.139> set<00:06:51.409> this<00:06:51.559> on<00:06:51.830> here<00:06:52.179> make<00:06:53.179> sure<00:06:53.209> those

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:53.509 
to set this on here make sure those

00:06:53.509 --> 00:07:01.719 
to set this on here make sure those
whose<00:06:53.839> line<00:06:54.139> up<00:06:54.319> to<00:06:54.559> those<00:07:00.729> nothing

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.180 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.780 

I'll<00:07:50.180> be<00:07:50.360> where<00:07:50.540> then
