00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.470 
so to start off with on the mixer I'm

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.110 
so to start off with on the mixer I'm
going<00:00:08.590> to<00:00:08.680> look<00:00:08.860> at<00:00:09.070> the<00:00:09.340> color<00:00:09.550> effects<00:00:09.940> or

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
going to look at the color effects or

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.959 
going to look at the color effects or
what<00:00:10.300> we<00:00:10.420> like<00:00:10.450> to<00:00:10.630> call<00:00:10.750> it<00:00:10.930> the<00:00:11.080> CFX<00:00:11.799> for<00:00:12.730> new

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
what we like to call it the CFX for new

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.640 
what we like to call it the CFX for new
effects<00:00:13.330> that<00:00:13.480> pioneer<00:00:13.870> have<00:00:13.990> brought<00:00:14.230> into

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
effects that pioneer have brought into

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.780 
effects that pioneer have brought into
the<00:00:14.740> mixer<00:00:15.070> that<00:00:15.190> you<00:00:15.280> can<00:00:15.430> use<00:00:15.639> in

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
the mixer that you can use in

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.940 
the mixer that you can use in
conjunction<00:00:15.970> with<00:00:16.570> all<00:00:17.110> your<00:00:17.260> other<00:00:17.380> existing

conjunction with all your other existing
effects<00:00:18.279> that<00:00:18.520> we're<00:00:18.670> going<00:00:18.790> to<00:00:18.849> go<00:00:18.910> into

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
effects that we're going to go into

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.749 
effects that we're going to go into
later<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:20.500> all<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.770> color<00:00:20.980> effects<00:00:21.369> or<00:00:21.670> the

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
later now all the color effects or the

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.850 
later now all the color effects or the
CFX<00:00:22.300> are<00:00:22.689> controlled<00:00:23.140> by<00:00:23.230> these<00:00:23.380> four

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
CFX are controlled by these four

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.460 
CFX are controlled by these four
individual<00:00:24.430> rotary<00:00:24.910> pots<00:00:25.150> based<00:00:25.869> just<00:00:26.200> above

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
individual rotary pots based just above

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.300 
individual rotary pots based just above
the<00:00:26.739> channel<00:00:27.460> faders<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.960> for<00:00:29.140> example<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:30.279> a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
the channel faders so for example got a

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.600 
the channel faders so for example got a
track<00:00:30.610> playing<00:00:31.200> we've<00:00:32.200> got<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.380> filter<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:33.130> bit

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
track playing we've got a filter a bit

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.170 
track playing we've got a filter a bit
crusher<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.239> harmonic<00:00:35.110> or<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.350> sweep<00:00:36.070> as<00:00:36.850> you<00:00:37.030> can

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
crusher a harmonic or a sweep as you can

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.860 
crusher a harmonic or a sweep as you can
see<00:00:37.329> my<00:00:37.480> pot<00:00:37.840> now<00:00:38.020> he's<00:00:38.170> down<00:00:38.380> at<00:00:38.530> low<00:00:42.870> that's

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
see my pot now he's down at low that's

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.970 
see my pot now he's down at low that's
literally<00:00:44.140> just<00:00:44.320> gone<00:00:44.500> straight<00:00:44.620> from<00:00:44.949> a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
literally just gone straight from a

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.099 
literally just gone straight from a
high-pass<00:00:45.339> filter<00:00:45.760> into<00:00:46.089> a<00:00:46.329> low-pass<00:00:46.660> filter

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
high-pass filter into a low-pass filter

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:59.220 
high-pass filter into a low-pass filter
so<00:00:47.410> down<00:00:47.620> again<00:00:57.059> another<00:00:58.059> new<00:00:58.300> effect<00:00:58.690> on<00:00:58.929> the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
so down again another new effect on the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.750 
so down again another new effect on the
color<00:00:59.409> effects<00:00:59.800> is<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.129> of<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.309> bit<00:01:00.489> crusher

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
color effects is that of the bit crusher

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.640 
color effects is that of the bit crusher
so<00:01:01.239> if<00:01:01.329> I<00:01:01.420> fresh<00:01:01.690> crush<00:01:07.470> background<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.500> other

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
so if I fresh crush background the other

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:17.940 
so if I fresh crush background the other
way<00:01:15.869> another<00:01:16.869> one<00:01:17.049> is<00:01:17.079> out<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.530> sweep

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
way another one is out of the sweep

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.889 
way another one is out of the sweep
similar<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.880> filter<00:01:19.149> but<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:19.689> time

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
similar to the filter but this time

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.780 
similar to the filter but this time
instead<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.290> going<00:01:20.649> high<00:01:20.829> pass<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.310> low<00:01:21.460> past

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
instead of going high pass the low past

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.149 
instead of going high pass the low past
it's<00:01:22.420> more<00:01:22.659> of<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.810> notch<00:01:23.049> pass<00:01:23.290> filter<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.009> this

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
it's more of a notch pass filter so this

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.350 
it's more of a notch pass filter so this
time<00:01:25.710> more<00:01:26.710> emphasis<00:01:27.219> on<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.610> snare<00:01:27.850> drum<00:01:28.149> or

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
time more emphasis on the snare drum or

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.420 
time more emphasis on the snare drum or
the<00:01:28.540> mid-range<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.380> then<00:01:29.829> background<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.369> the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
the mid-range and then background of the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.609 
the mid-range and then background of the
way<00:01:30.549> we'll<00:01:30.759> take<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.090> mid-range<00:01:31.420> out<00:01:31.750> she

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
way we'll take the mid-range out she

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.200 
way we'll take the mid-range out she
just<00:01:32.829> left<00:01:33.040> with<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.310> top<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.610> frequencies

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
just left with the top and frequencies

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.420 
just left with the top and frequencies
and<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:35.140> low<00:01:35.289> end<00:01:35.469> so<00:01:35.710> your<00:01:35.860> kicks<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.399> your

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
and the low end so your kicks and your

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.140 
and the low end so your kicks and your
snares<00:01:36.850> or<00:01:37.119> your<00:01:37.329> hats

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.670 

now<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.240> final<00:01:44.509> effect<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.470> color

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
now the final effect on the color

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.590 
now the final effect on the color
effects<00:01:46.070> is<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.700> harmonic<00:01:47.119> mixing

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
effects is that of the harmonic mixing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.190 
effects is that of the harmonic mixing
feature<00:01:47.900> i<00:01:48.790> put<00:01:49.790> this<00:01:49.880> effect<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.869> can<00:01:51.020> see

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
feature i put this effect on you can see

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.990 
feature i put this effect on you can see
how<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.439> light<00:01:51.710> above<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.310> rotary<00:01:52.700> parts

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
how the light above the rotary parts

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.179 
how the light above the rotary parts
turns<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.479> read<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:54.860> basically

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
turns to read this is basically

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.219 
turns to read this is basically
indicating<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.390> track<00:01:56.630> i<00:01:56.810> want<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.080> mix

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
indicating that the track i want to mix

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.120 
indicating that the track i want to mix
into<00:01:57.700> when<00:01:58.700> those<00:01:58.909> two<00:01:59.149> lights<00:01:59.360> go<00:01:59.659> green<00:02:00.130> that

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
into when those two lights go green that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.800 
into when those two lights go green that
basically<00:02:01.310> means<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.970> two<00:02:02.180> tracks<00:02:02.539> will

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
basically means that the two tracks will

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.410 
basically means that the two tracks will
be<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.110> same<00:02:03.320> pitch<00:02:03.680> as<00:02:03.979> well<00:02:04.909> as<00:02:05.030> using<00:02:05.240> it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
be in the same pitch as well as using it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.859 
be in the same pitch as well as using it
like<00:02:05.539> that<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.930> can<00:02:06.080> also<00:02:06.229> use<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:08.630> quite

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
like that you can also use it it's quite

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.600 
like that you can also use it it's quite
an<00:02:08.989> interesting<00:02:09.289> effect<00:02:12.190> it's<00:02:13.190> more<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.430> a

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
an interesting effect it's more of a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.199 
an interesting effect it's more of a
pitch<00:02:13.849> shift<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.459> keep<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> tempo

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
pitch shift but it just keep the tempo

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.059 
pitch shift but it just keep the tempo
locked<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.840> see<00:02:21.049> still<00:02:21.440> 0<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.890> beach

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
locked just see still 0 is on the beach

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.400 
locked just see still 0 is on the beach
but<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.610> tempo<00:02:23.150> or<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.810> pitch<00:02:23.989> sorry<00:02:24.260> will

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
but the tempo or the pitch sorry will

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.210 
but the tempo or the pitch sorry will
drop<00:02:29.110> another<00:02:30.110> nice<00:02:30.319> feature<00:02:30.350> what<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.069> can

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
drop another nice feature what you can
