stem cells are a huge next step for

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.549 
stem cells are a huge next step for
medicine<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:09.599> they're<00:00:10.230> mired<00:00:10.440> in

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
medicine but they're mired in

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.770 
medicine but they're mired in
controversy<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.639> what<00:00:12.360> if<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.540> could<00:00:12.660> have

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
controversy so what if you could have

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.879 
controversy so what if you could have
all<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> benefits<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.559> regenerative

dnews there's been a huge breakthrough
in<00:00:27.480> medicine<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.050> week<00:00:28.289> induced

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
in medicine this week induced

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.009 
in medicine this week induced
pluripotent<00:00:29.250> stem<00:00:29.760> cells<00:00:30.269> were<00:00:30.480> used<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
pluripotent stem cells were used in the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.600 
pluripotent stem cells were used in the
tissue<00:00:31.230> transplant<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> first<00:00:32.340> time

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
tissue transplant for the first time

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.680 
tissue transplant for the first time
ever<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.660> did<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> yeah<00:00:34.950> I'm<00:00:35.730> gonna<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.600> to

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
ever we did it yeah I'm gonna have to

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.819 
ever we did it yeah I'm gonna have to
explain<00:00:36.989> all<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> aren't<00:00:37.530> I

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
explain all that aren't I

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.250 
explain all that aren't I
okay<00:00:38.309> first<00:00:39.239> let's<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.690> everybody<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
okay first let's get everybody up to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
okay first let's get everybody up to
speed<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.620> stem<00:00:41.219> cells<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.270> more

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
speed on stem cells this is more

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.430 
speed on stem cells this is more
important<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.140> than<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> realize

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
important to you than you realize

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.560 
important to you than you realize
because<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.789> some<00:00:45.059> point<00:00:45.300> nothing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
because you are at some point nothing

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.410 
because you are at some point nothing
more<00:00:45.960> than<00:00:46.140> 50<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.800> 150<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.910> them<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.270> probably

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
more than 50 to 150 of them you probably

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.029 
more than 50 to 150 of them you probably
don't<00:00:48.780> remember<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.440> only<00:00:49.649> four<00:00:49.890> days

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
don't remember it was only four days

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.229 
don't remember it was only four days
after<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.520> were<00:00:50.550> conceived

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
after you were conceived

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.049 
after you were conceived
what<00:00:51.629> makes<00:00:51.870> embryonic<00:00:52.590> stem<00:00:52.920> cells<00:00:53.250> amazing

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
what makes embryonic stem cells amazing

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
what makes embryonic stem cells amazing
is<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.690> pluripotent<00:00:55.590> meaning

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
is that they are pluripotent meaning

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.160 
is that they are pluripotent meaning
they<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> become<00:00:56.760> almost<00:00:57.149> any<00:00:57.420> type<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> cell

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
they can become almost any type of cell

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.840 
they can become almost any type of cell
this<00:00:58.410> means<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:59.010> used<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.550> replace

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this means they can be used to replace

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
this means they can be used to replace
damaged<00:01:00.270> tissue<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.750> may<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.500> day<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.859> an

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
damaged tissue and may one day be an

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
damaged tissue and may one day be an
alternative<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.520> organ<00:01:02.850> transplants<00:01:03.449> now

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
alternative to organ transplants now

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
alternative to organ transplants now
this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.960> huge<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> United<00:01:05.129> States<00:01:05.369> an

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
this is huge in the United States an

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
this is huge in the United States an
average<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.119> 79<00:01:06.600> people<00:01:06.960> receive<00:01:07.439> an<00:01:07.560> organ

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
average of 79 people receive an organ

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.280 
average of 79 people receive an organ
transplant<00:01:08.130> every<00:01:08.909> day<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.479> another<00:01:09.720> 18

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290

people<00:01:10.500> die<00:01:10.890> waiting<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> transplant<00:01:12.030> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
people die waiting for a transplant that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
people die waiting for a transplant that
will<00:01:12.540> never<00:01:12.689> come<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.200> 79<00:01:13.619> who<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
will never come the 79 who do get a

prevent transplant rejection for the
rest<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.939> their<00:01:18.060> lives<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.570> even<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
rest of their lives but even then the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
rest of their lives but even then the
risk<00:01:19.619> remains<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.460> problem<00:01:20.759> doesn't<00:01:20.939> exist

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
risk remains the problem doesn't exist

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.660 
risk remains the problem doesn't exist
with<00:01:21.630> embryonic<00:01:21.869> stem<00:01:22.350> cells<00:01:22.619> though<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.280> we

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
with embryonic stem cells though so we

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
with embryonic stem cells though so we
can<00:01:23.790> save<00:01:24.000> thousands<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.570> people<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.960> year<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
can save thousands of people a year and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.410 
can save thousands of people a year and
improve<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> quality<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.369> life<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.700> lifespan

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
improve the quality of life and lifespan

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
improve the quality of life and lifespan
of<00:01:27.450> tens<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.110> thousands<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:28.829> what's<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
of tens of thousands more what's the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
of tens of thousands more what's the
problem<00:01:29.579> well<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.720> only<00:01:30.869> way<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> get

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
problem well the only way to get

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.280 
problem well the only way to get
pluripotent<00:01:32.220> cells<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:33.060> from<00:01:33.479> embryos<00:01:33.960> which

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
pluripotent cells is from embryos which

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.160 
pluripotent cells is from embryos which
are<00:01:34.560> pre<00:01:35.460> people<00:01:35.909> or<00:01:36.150> current<00:01:36.930> people

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
are pre people or current people

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870 
are pre people or current people
depending<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.950> where<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.340> stand<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
depending on where you stand on the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
depending on where you stand on the
issue<00:01:39.030> obviously<00:01:39.299> there's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> heated
