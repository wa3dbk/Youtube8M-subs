00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.520
 good morning everyone goodbye 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.790
 now let's run time and let's go 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.790
 further on 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.170
 here we are at 3 thousand and 900 million 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.920
 millions of millions of years ago 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.509
 I'm 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.730
 the earth is a meteor shower 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.199
 cut from a snow cane is the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.300
 unite period they call you 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.520
 land earth china if these were 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.080
 addresses as has been possible that 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.210
 what we see now is 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.320
 transformed and what we see now now 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.300
 we'll find out our journey begins 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.130
 almost 5 billion billion billions 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.489
 from years ago 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.750
 but maybe we were wrong there are not 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.690
 traces of our beautiful blue planet 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 just a star like a whore our sun 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.290
 we arrived too early 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.300
 but let's go ahead and see the gravity 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.300
 gravitate the dust in small gravity 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.840
 one thing seems almost impossible 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.800
 complex as a planet is born of 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.900
 nothing but dust and dust 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.690
 gravity over millions of years 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.479
 mass these rocks to form the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.790
 French fries on our planet 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.610
 seems to be more in hell than 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.590
 still stationary 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.470
 there is not only carbon monoxide air 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.110
 zone skeleton and water vapor is like this 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 hot so toxic that you cut it with a 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.510
 breadstick 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 the newborn planet is a sphere 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.860
 boiling of liquid rock in practice 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 there are no liquid rock surfaces 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.540
 a young planet called planet yes 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.979
 heads straight for us 20 times more 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.979
 fast of a chemical broth 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.570
 and thousands of billions of thousands of 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.880
 billions of debris come but around 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.130
 only a thousand years the gravity does his 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.760
 magic turning the heap of debris 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.860
 in an ass that orbits the earth 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.870
 we are witnessing the birth of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.410
 snowball is much closer than the 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.390
 moon we know has only 400 thousand 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.180
 miles away 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.740
 instead of about 5,000 days pass 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.300
 fast but the earth changes quickly 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.070
 to understand how par a 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.070
 ferno we have to go on in time 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.620
 and a shower of fries 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.290
 we are under the attack of debris 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.360
 left by the formation of the system 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.400
 anal 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.010
 look at these strange meteorites inside 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.140
 the crystals look like large grains of 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.510
 sas the same salt that we put in 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:57.280
 coffee prepared to receive the big bang 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:59.530
 attacked on the launch from scratch it seems that 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.260
 these deadly missiles contain missiles 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.060
 deadly for life on earth sex there is 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.060
 only a small amount of water in 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.370
 each pitch the water collects 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.600
 on the water but the temperature of the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.210
 surface has fallen to 70 80 degrees 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.830
 enough to form a crust the 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.030
 very young land and water and soil 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.860
 begins to resemble the planet that 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.770
 let's call it fucking but the atmosphere is toxic 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.900
 and the temperature error 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.050
 nothing could live on the chips 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.050
 fried
