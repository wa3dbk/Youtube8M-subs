organizes<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.900> all<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.459> anyways<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.120> changes

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
organizes it all so anyways you changes

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.230 
organizes it all so anyways you changes

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:53.410 

save<00:03:44.990> it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.100 

then<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.050> go<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.200> serve

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
then you go to serve

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:04.000 
then you go to serve
start<00:03:56.890> mysql<00:03:57.880> already<00:03:58.480> go

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.350 

all<00:04:04.459> right<00:04:04.849> this<00:04:05.540> is<00:04:06.140> all<00:04:06.349> depends

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
all right this is all depends

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.770 
all right this is all depends
on<00:04:08.840> earth<00:04:09.110> your<00:04:09.320> computer<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.710> 32<00:04:10.100> or<00:04:10.310> 64<00:04:10.760> bit

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.160 

so<00:04:14.380> then<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.650> start<00:04:14.920> off<00:04:15.040> server<00:04:16.049> what's<00:04:17.049> this

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
so then you start off server what's this

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.140 
so then you start off server what's this
and<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.799> should<00:04:17.980> look<00:04:18.100> like<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.370> pencil<00:04:18.579> and

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
and it should look like a pencil and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.409 
and it should look like a pencil and
this<00:04:20.139> world<00:04:21.130> server<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.000> low<00:04:22.090> like<00:04:22.240> this

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
this world server in the low like this

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.030 
this world server in the low like this
so<00:04:22.630> when<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.230> the<00:04:23.290> Lord<00:04:23.380> fell<00:04:23.650> down<00:04:23.830> when

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
so when you and the Lord fell down when

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.820 
so when you and the Lord fell down when
it<00:04:24.160> says<00:04:24.720> skype<00:04:25.720> fighter<00:04:26.020> max<00:04:26.530> allowed

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
it says skype fighter max allowed

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.970 
it says skype fighter max allowed
psychic<00:04:27.250> connections<00:04:28.710> that's<00:04:29.710> pretty<00:04:29.800> much

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
psychic connections that's pretty much

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.060 
psychic connections that's pretty much
it<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.400> then<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.880> can<00:04:31.530> make<00:04:32.530> sure<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.800> create

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
it and then you can make sure you create

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.690 
it and then you can make sure you create
a<00:04:34.110> shortcut<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.380> your<00:04:35.620> wall<00:04:35.800> dial<00:04:36.040> you<00:04:36.190> see<00:04:36.430> and

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
put it into your desktop because you

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.760
