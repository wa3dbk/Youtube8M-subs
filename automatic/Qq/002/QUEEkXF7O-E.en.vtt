00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.660 
follow-up from our 308 shot here this is
one<00:03:21.609> of<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.790> two<00:03:21.940> plates<00:03:22.180> we<00:03:22.420> hit<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:23.079> can<00:03:23.260> see

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
one of the two plates we hit you can see

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.550 
one of the two plates we hit you can see
how<00:03:24.670> close<00:03:24.910> we<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.180> get<00:03:25.329> in<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:26.019> see<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.319> depth

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
how close we can get in to see the depth

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.449 
how close we can get in to see the depth
of<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:26.859> hit<00:03:27.100> into<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> steel<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.250> did

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
of that hit into the steel but it did

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.309 
of that hit into the steel but it did
quite<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.180> little<00:03:31.329> bit<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.569> damage<00:03:31.720> when<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:32.109> hit

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
quite a little bit of damage when it hit

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.160 
quite a little bit of damage when it hit
so<00:03:33.090> we'll<00:03:34.090> see<00:03:34.269> what<00:03:34.389> we<00:03:34.450> can<00:03:34.569> do<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.959> think

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
so we'll see what we can do I think

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.629 
so we'll see what we can do I think
we're<00:03:35.290> going<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.470> set<00:03:35.650> up<00:03:35.799> for<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:36.069> five<00:03:36.430> five

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
we're going to set up for a five five

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.660 
we're going to set up for a five five
six<00:03:36.910> drill<00:03:37.269> we<00:03:37.810> were<00:03:37.930> kind<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.230> hoping<00:03:38.380> that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
six drill we were kind of hoping that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.449 
six drill we were kind of hoping that
this<00:03:39.670> lower<00:03:40.030> carbon<00:03:40.600> steel<00:03:40.900> would<00:03:41.889> work<00:03:42.130> in

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
this lower carbon steel would work in

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.300 
this lower carbon steel would work in
place<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.480> going<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.989> like<00:03:44.109> an<00:03:44.230> AR<00:03:44.380> 500<00:03:44.709> steel

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
place of going to like an AR 500 steel

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.870 
place of going to like an AR 500 steel
which<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.239> little<00:03:46.420> bit<00:03:46.510> more<00:03:46.660> expensive<00:03:46.930> but

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
which is a little bit more expensive but

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.740 
which is a little bit more expensive but
these<00:03:48.880> didn't<00:03:49.060> cost<00:03:49.239> us<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.479> whole<00:03:49.600> lot<00:03:49.720> of

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
these didn't cost us a whole lot of

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.750 
these didn't cost us a whole lot of
money<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.739> kind<00:03:50.889> of<00:03:50.949> throw<00:03:51.190> away<00:03:51.340> tests

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
money so that kind of throw away tests

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.449 
money so that kind of throw away tests
anyway<00:03:52.060> it's<00:03:52.540> again<00:03:52.780> there's<00:03:53.049> what<00:03:53.229> the<00:03:53.410> three

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
anyway it's again there's what the three

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.410 
anyway it's again there's what the three
FMJ<00:03:55.239> does<00:03:55.629> 150<00:03:56.349> grain<00:03:56.560> pretty<00:03:57.459> substantial

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
FMJ does 150 grain pretty substantial

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.890 
FMJ does 150 grain pretty substantial
dents<00:03:59.079> into<00:03:59.859> a<00:03:59.890> steel<00:04:00.159> plate<00:04:00.400> so<00:04:01.030> I'll<00:04:01.719> go

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
dents into a steel plate so I'll go

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.789 
dents into a steel plate so I'll go
shoot<00:04:02.109> another<00:04:02.260> gun<00:04:02.439> right<00:04:02.560> now

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
shoot another gun right now

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.219 
shoot another gun right now
Thanks
