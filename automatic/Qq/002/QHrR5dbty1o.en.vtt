00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello I'm re mini let's learn to 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.460
 play the song an exception of 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.349
 paraguay though and let's see how it 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.349
 listen to our verse and chorus 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.050
 and it would not be all for our verse and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.830
 I think it's exactly the same as we go 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.990
 to start with a greater yes in the seventh 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.710
 fret after we're going to put fakes 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.120
 I have a minor on the ninth fret 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:44.590
 and my oldest on the seventh fret 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.170
 ok well that's it and our radio does not 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.579
 it's simple we're just going to make two down 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.579
 two up because 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.710
 it would be all until we got to the part 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 from our second verse we are going to play 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.950
 The same is progress and when you 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.230
 we are in me let's give a few 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.090
 just strum down on me 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.090
 and we continue with our choir 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.560
 or not 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.890
 we are going to play in the first 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.180
 cc16 rope to the fret 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.950
 after 14 the first string 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.740
 on the second rope that is again 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.550
 now he offers us 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.290
 and the 14 back 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.080
 14 let's be what 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.830
 on the first string 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.830
 so 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.130
 we repeat that part 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.920
 when we arrive again to pass the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.410
 14 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.110
 instead of playing in the 14 we played in a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.620
 back on the rope third eleventh fret 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.620
 then I heard like that 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.740
 ok that we repeat twice after 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.930
 that we're going to move on to our source in the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.930
 which are we going to play C sharp minor 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.740
 yes greater and for sustained greater 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.930
 then it's going to rain like this 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.090
 That is repeated twice and after 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.110
 second time we repeat it we are going to 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.110
 touch my biggest 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.959
 and we went from our choir 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.450
 after that to finish for 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.840
 finish our occasion we are going to play 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.840
 the biggest 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.430
 my greatest 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.950
 and if greater 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.260
 and that's all our song I hope that 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.030

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.770
