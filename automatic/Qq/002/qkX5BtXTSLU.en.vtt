00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
actually sealed but the micro SD and SIM

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.249 
actually sealed but the micro SD and SIM
card<00:01:17.859> slots<00:01:18.159> are<00:01:18.369> open<00:01:18.850> there<00:01:19.569> are<00:01:19.600> holes<00:01:19.990> in

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
card slots are open there are holes in

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.469 
card slots are open there are holes in
here<00:01:20.560> as<00:01:20.770> well<00:01:21.069> so<00:01:21.399> while<00:01:21.639> attaching<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.270> back

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
here as well so while attaching the back

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.599 
here as well so while attaching the back
cover<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:23.229> should<00:01:23.499> actually<00:01:23.740> press<00:01:24.310> this

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
cover you should actually press this

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.330 
cover you should actually press this
part<00:01:24.969> as<00:01:25.179> well<00:01:25.770> enough<00:01:26.770> with<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:26.979> talking

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
part as well enough with the talking

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.609 
part as well enough with the talking
let's<00:01:27.789> get<00:01:28.060> started<00:01:28.479> with<00:01:28.719> the<00:01:28.929> water<00:01:29.170> test

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.840 

I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.290> sealed<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.979> back<00:01:36.220> over<00:01:36.430> quite

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
I think I sealed the back over quite

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.510 
I think I sealed the back over quite
well<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.329> you<00:01:38.229> might<00:01:38.500> know<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.799> did<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.189> water

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
well and you might know I did a water

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.639 
well and you might know I did a water
test<00:01:39.820> on<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.240> mortal<00:01:40.630> II<00:01:40.750> as<00:01:40.990> well<00:01:41.049> which

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
test on the mortal II as well which

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.399 
test on the mortal II as well which
dramatically<00:01:42.490> failed<00:01:42.909> but<00:01:43.539> that<00:01:43.869> wasn't<00:01:44.289> a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
dramatically failed but that wasn't a

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.410 
dramatically failed but that wasn't a
certified<00:01:44.979> water-resistant<00:01:45.820> model<00:01:46.210> this

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
certified water-resistant model this

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.710 
certified water-resistant model this
model<00:01:46.810> g3<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:47.920> let's<00:01:48.549> pour<00:01:48.820> some<00:01:49.060> water<00:01:49.330> and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
model g3 is so let's pour some water and

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.060 
model g3 is so let's pour some water and
check<00:01:50.140> what<00:01:50.439> happens

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
check what happens

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.340 
check what happens
I'm<00:01:51.130> also<00:01:51.850> shooting<00:01:52.179> this<00:01:52.450> video<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:52.990> slow

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
I'm also shooting this video in slow

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.319 
I'm also shooting this video in slow
motion<00:01:53.619> at<00:01:53.950> 240<00:01:54.759> FPS<00:01:54.880> on<00:01:55.390> my<00:01:55.600> iPhone<00:01:55.990> 6<00:01:56.670> well<00:01:57.670> so

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
motion at 240 FPS on my iPhone 6 well so

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.080 
motion at 240 FPS on my iPhone 6 well so
far<00:01:58.630> there<00:01:59.079> is<00:01:59.259> no<00:01:59.289> screen<00:02:00.159> blackout<00:02:00.700> it's

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
far there is no screen blackout it's

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.050 
far there is no screen blackout it's
working<00:02:01.810> nice<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.200> think<00:02:02.259> but<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.429> water<00:02:03.759> is

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
working nice I think but the water is

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.539 
working nice I think but the water is
touch<00:02:04.630> sensitive<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.950> notification

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
touch sensitive so the notification

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:28.199 
touch sensitive so the notification
window<00:02:06.700> has<00:02:07.060> come<00:02:07.360> down

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.360 

the<00:02:29.209> screen<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> motto<00:02:30.020> j3<00:02:30.500> has<00:02:30.680> got<00:02:30.950> good

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
the screen of the motto j3 has got good

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.160 
the screen of the motto j3 has got good
or<00:02:31.550> Fe<00:02:31.819> with<00:02:31.940> coating<00:02:32.270> that's<00:02:32.510> why<00:02:32.750> there<00:02:33.020> is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
or Fe with coating that's why there is

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.070 
or Fe with coating that's why there is
no<00:02:33.560> water<00:02:33.800> standing<00:02:34.340> on<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> class<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.209> it's

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
no water standing on the class and it's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.949 
no water standing on the class and it's
clean<00:02:36.740> actually<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.270> way<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.540> can

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
clean actually so in this way you can

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.010 
clean actually so in this way you can
clean<00:02:39.260> your<00:02:39.470> motor<00:02:39.800> j-3<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.600> screen<00:02:41.900> is

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
clean your motor j-3 and the screen is

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.440 
clean your motor j-3 and the screen is
working<00:02:42.290> nice<00:02:42.680> there<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.070> no<00:02:43.670> issue<00:02:43.970> at<00:02:44.240> all

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
working nice there is no issue at all

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.090 
working nice there is no issue at all
the<00:02:44.750> back<00:02:44.900> cover<00:02:45.110> has<00:02:45.380> got<00:02:45.620> some<00:02:45.830> water

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
the back cover has got some water

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.330 
the back cover has got some water
droplets<00:02:46.400> but<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.540> can<00:02:47.780> clean<00:02:48.050> this<00:02:48.200> off<00:02:48.470> so

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
droplets but you can clean this off so

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.550 
droplets but you can clean this off so
seems<00:02:49.640> like<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.060> moto<00:02:50.390> g3<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.080> handling

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
seems like this moto g3 is handling

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.110 
seems like this moto g3 is handling
water<00:02:51.920> splash<00:02:52.310> quite<00:02:52.670> well

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
water splash quite well

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.570 
water splash quite well
now<00:02:53.570> let's<00:02:53.870> fully<00:02:54.290> immerse<00:02:54.709> this<00:02:54.980> phone<00:02:55.220> into

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
now let's fully immerse this phone into

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:16.470 
now let's fully immerse this phone into
water

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.910 

well<00:03:17.480> modern<00:03:17.930> combat<00:03:18.170> has<00:03:18.500> started

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
well modern combat has started

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.220 
well modern combat has started
automatically<00:03:19.490> because<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.540> water<00:03:20.840> so

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
automatically because of the water so

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.470 
automatically because of the water so
you<00:03:21.290> might<00:03:21.650> probably<00:03:21.920> do<00:03:22.910> some<00:03:23.150> underwater

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
you might probably do some underwater

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.680 
you might probably do some underwater
gaming<00:03:24.140> but<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.860> display<00:03:25.400> owned<00:03:25.610> works<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:26.390> at

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
gaming but the display owned works so at

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.510 
gaming but the display owned works so at
least<00:03:26.960> you<00:03:27.200> can<00:03:27.380> watch<00:03:27.410> some<00:03:28.010> movies

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
least you can watch some movies

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.850 
least you can watch some movies
underwater<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.450> don't<00:03:30.140> know<00:03:30.230> whether<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.680> can

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
underwater I don't know whether you can

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.949 
underwater I don't know whether you can
hear<00:03:31.130> or<00:03:31.250> not<00:03:31.400> but<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.970> sound<00:03:32.300> is<00:03:32.450> coming<00:03:32.840> out

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
hear or not but the sound is coming out

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.040 
hear or not but the sound is coming out
as<00:03:33.170> well<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.709> it's<00:03:34.700> actually<00:03:35.030> quite<00:03:35.450> low<00:03:35.810> but

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
as well and it's actually quite low but

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.920 
as well and it's actually quite low but
still<00:03:36.560> audible<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:38.180> game<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.540> running

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
still audible and the game is running

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.350 
still audible and the game is running
just<00:03:39.140> fine<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:39.800> moto<00:03:40.040> g3<00:03:40.520> has<00:03:40.550> passed<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
just fine so moto g3 has passed the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.960 
just fine so moto g3 has passed the
water<00:03:41.570> immersion<00:03:42.020> test<00:03:42.470> let's<00:03:43.430> check<00:03:43.700> whether

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
water immersion test let's check whether

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.780 
water immersion test let's check whether
I<00:03:44.120> can<00:03:44.390> receive<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.900> call<00:03:45.200> underwater<00:03:45.830> the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
I can receive a call underwater the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.300 
I can receive a call underwater the
display<00:03:47.209> probably<00:03:47.750> won't<00:03:48.050> work<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.709> there<00:03:49.280> is

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
display probably won't work and there is

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.229 
display probably won't work and there is
the<00:03:49.670> hard<00:03:49.970> key<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.450> ends<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.840> recall<00:03:52.239> the

the hard key to ends I recall the

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.170 
the hard key to ends I recall the
display<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.870> not<00:03:54.380> working<00:03:54.890> now<00:03:55.100> I<00:03:55.550> shall<00:03:55.940> throw

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
display is not working now I shall throw

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.240 
display is not working now I shall throw
this<00:03:56.420> device<00:03:56.720> into<00:03:57.140> water<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.620> check<00:03:57.950> whether

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
this device into water and check whether

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.820 
this device into water and check whether
this<00:03:58.730> phone<00:03:58.970> can<00:03:59.180> survive<00:03:59.600> drop<00:04:00.320> into<00:04:00.590> water

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
this phone can survive drop into water

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.070 
this phone can survive drop into water
as<00:04:01.130> well<00:04:01.420> well<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.660> can<00:04:02.840> capture

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
as well well you can capture

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.740 
as well well you can capture
high-quality<00:04:03.470> videos<00:04:04.250> underwater<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.540> need

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
high-quality videos underwater you need

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.420 
high-quality videos underwater you need
to<00:04:05.930> launch<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.380> camera<00:04:06.560> before<00:04:06.890> submerging

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
to launch the camera before submerging

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.850 
to launch the camera before submerging
and<00:04:07.850> though<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.810> display<00:04:09.200> own<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.620> work

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
and though the display own to work

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.040 
and though the display own to work
underwater<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.760> can<00:04:10.790> use<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.450> volume<00:04:11.810> rocker

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
underwater you can use the volume rocker

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.860 
underwater you can use the volume rocker
or<00:04:12.440> just<00:04:13.340> start<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.030> shooting<00:04:14.360> before<00:04:14.540> the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
or just start the shooting before the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.590 
or just start the shooting before the
