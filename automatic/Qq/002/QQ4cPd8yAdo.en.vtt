00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hi guys from sevilla motorcycle from public 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.820
 and well, today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.120
 make a small school compacted tree 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.230
 all school rings and bracelets and 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.230
 you know 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.980
 Y 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.039
 and good for this craft we are going to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.750
 need our saplings that already 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.449
 they sell in the lands of crafts 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 made today you can do it by buying 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.649
 the wooden base that is a stick and already 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.680
 It also comes and they sell it to you in stores 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.680
 good haberdashery where you buy all those 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.800
 barbarities and we also sell you 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.129
 wires and anything harder you accommodate 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.070
 and you wrap it with tape because it can be 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.070
 to isolate to give it more strength or in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.400
 this case as is a common type tape 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.379
 come out but in white in this 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.019
 case and the purchase made to do it more 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.260
 easy we will also need a 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.820
 Brush 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.960
 and good they are going to need glue 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.560
 diamond techniques to save me 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.159
 glue 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.320
 it is called shines sticks then also 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.450
 to save if it happens we have to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.149
 visit our sponge that if not stop 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.310
 fit things and in this case we're going to 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.590
 occupy to keep on fixing me when 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.110
 fixed to our little tree we are also going to 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.880
 need many milestones to decorate in 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.840
 this case I cut accounts 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:44.189
 or of little balls twigs and also accounts 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:46.950
 of butterflies and well then in my room 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.350
 we are also going to need a base where 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 that you see that pacto arbolito this that 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.729
 also that the purchase already decorated but 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.039
 you know you can buy the new 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.200
 Pure maderita way and decorate it with 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.329
 mousse and well then let's start 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.369
 see how it is done and well then these 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.979
 saplings usually come well 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.049
 marites but they are straight and you are going 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.060
 separating I already gave me a little and 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.670
 then separating and arranging so that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.530
 distribute and make it easier 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.860
 paint them once you have already 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.830
 separate you are going to put the painting and I 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.110
 I will leave white and you will put the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.580
 paint on the brush and you're going to start 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.580
 paint all your little tree 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.220
 and good once you're finished 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.350
 to paint your little tree then let it dry and 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.870
 you wait until it is perfectly 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.870
 dry and good because it is dry 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.549
 two 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.180
 and does not need then it will not continue 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.730
 pulling hidden 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.260
 and we are going to accommodate them so 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.260
 trigger more stars 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:19.320
 and since you finish doing all the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:23.400
 twigs you're going to use each account in this 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:27.209
 case like this 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.370
 and you know that fits and 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.580
 the case of the butterflies for example 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.810
 let's record a butterfly we're going 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.030
 upwards 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.030
 and we are going to put the butterfly 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.030
 so they do not fall down superbly 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.499
 and it is 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.560
 and it is precisely where to make holes 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:04:01.380
 with glue 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.380
 so you can leave it 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.610
 and well, let's continue doing it 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.690
 so that we can see at the end how it is 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.170
 and now you see that you finished folding the 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.130
 games and put some figures 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.230
 bills 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.549
 you are going to grab your sponge and with a 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.549
 knife of that 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.460
 we add to give more firmness to 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:47.669
 base and good because nothing else is missing 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.990
 put it with paper, the truth is 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:54.110
 lost I did not find it then this one 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.460
 you put it with paper so that it is covered 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.639
 the whole base and you're ready 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.770
 and more later we'll see each other in the next 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.160
 video do not forget to open like to the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.199
 page of the radio viewpoint and bonijol 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.199
