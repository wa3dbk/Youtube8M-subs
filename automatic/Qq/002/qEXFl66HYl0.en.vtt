 Hello everyone

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.010
 a peasant message box 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:20.330
 first of all adriano the program e 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.330
 we have a new project 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.940
 well now let's position ourselves on the hot with 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 player command text you need to create mon 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.320
 command to display the window of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.320
 regulations of our server 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.890
 to create the dialogue we will write show 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.170
 player dialogues followed by yesterday on 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.329
 dialogue number to identify them is 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.890
 the type of window that in this case 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.890
 will be put style box 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.479
 now we continue with the titling 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.940
 which will have our window still after 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.430
 continue roma writing the content that 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.030
 will have to have our dialogue or 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.030
 all the rules 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.640

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.580
 the other instead refuses the dialogue is 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.050

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.720
 let's position ourselves on a response dialog 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.220
 here we will write if the number dialogues 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.069
 1 previously chosen to the answer which 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:45.020
 one means that the user has clicked 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:47.720

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.460
 that the user has accepted the rules i 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.460

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.070
 voila 0 the user refused 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.980
 at this point if the user clicks on 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:27.540
 refuses we will proceed with a command 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:29.640
