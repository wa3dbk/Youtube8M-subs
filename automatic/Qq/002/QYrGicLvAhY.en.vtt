00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.700
 greetings are expires tutorial and they 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.480
 I will teach 10 applications to decode 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.900
 good wi-fi networks the first one is retro 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.900
 keygen 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.140
 this app is pretty good because you 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.000
 decrypts most wi-fi networks 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.160
 eye for it to work is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.950
 what you have to do after 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.130
 to install it is to download the dictionaries 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.130
 just here 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.980
 Of course I have it downloaded 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.980
 obviously 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.150
 the second is a apt webkit 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.650
 is good at deciphering the passwords of 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.380
 factory with web security 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.590
 plus 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.110
 Well it was a locker this is good 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.650
 deciphering web web although it's something 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.650
 delayed 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.460
 they saw it 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.719
 4 whole 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.270
 This is also good as the others 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:14.020
 but sometimes it is without taking the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 keys that others could not take it out 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.509
 some that could not also be there if the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.509
 pulls out 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.250
 5 web tester 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.420
 let's say it's good but it's almost the same 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.439
 than the others so 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.439
 there is you 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.910
 6 wifi is like map 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.020
 this time with a web apt that only only 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.020
 take out factory web 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.729
 I do not remember 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.680
 7 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.630
 well and audit this one is pretty pretty 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.130
 in terms of design but in terms of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.130
 a lot of time is the same 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.810
 is the same 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.850
 8 and the best the key is wifi 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.060
 and this is the best of the fairies because 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.740
 is in some cases it takes but to 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.470
 end always gives the key always 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.370
 forever 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 they give me like here 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.280
 I'm going to take 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.849
 something but final will not end up giving 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.849
 the key 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.160
 if it says it 's slow but when 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.460
 you need an urgent wifi this is very 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.460
 good 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.580
 ready I have it 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.290
 Now we just click and start 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.290
 connect directly 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.200
 begging for the right key 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.540
 finally wifi passwords this is me 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.020
 it's too good especially when 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.170
 flash be this your cel and you need the 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.280
 passwords that you give to networks that you've 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.870
 connected 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.310
 eye must be root user 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.720
 to know if you are user routines that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.610
 have this icon 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.610
 this conduit that says super user 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.730
 good you have to have s 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.080
 and already be able to enjoy these benefits 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.239
 same as changing roles 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.639
 it's not just teaching the tutorial 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.389
 good thanks for giving like and subscribe 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.389
 until next time
