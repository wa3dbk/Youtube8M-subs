materials all I remember back then is we
took<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.439> steel<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.340> steel<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:17.939> carbon

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330

took the steel like this steel or carbon
steel<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.290> put<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.770> volts<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.580> say

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
steel and you put it in volts of say

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
steel and you put it in volts of say
zinc<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.619> leave<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.009> there<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
zinc and you leave it in there for a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.820 
zinc and you leave it in there for a
short<00:01:24.030> time<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> does<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.650> it

short time and what it does is it

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.359 
short time and what it does is it
galvanizes<00:01:26.430> these<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.860> don't<00:01:28.979> rust

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
galvanizes these so that they don't rust

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.700 
galvanizes these so that they don't rust
of<00:01:29.729> course<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.360> pull<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> trial<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.530> or

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
of course if you pull a trial on this or

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
of course if you pull a trial on this or
on<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> corner<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> remove<00:01:33.299> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
on a corner it's going to remove that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.630 
on a corner it's going to remove that
zinc<00:01:33.900> coating<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:34.500> galvanized<00:01:35.070> coating<00:01:35.340> and

zinc coating or galvanized coating and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.600 
zinc coating or galvanized coating and
it<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.360> rust<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.799> remember<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.579> when

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it can rust what I do remember back when

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.330 
it can rust what I do remember back when
I<00:01:38.880> was<00:01:38.909> 15<00:01:39.450> working<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.140> place<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.799> all

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
I was 15 working at this place is all

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.090 
I was 15 working at this place is all
those<00:01:41.729> youngsters<00:01:42.060> had<00:01:42.869> spots<00:01:43.320> all<00:01:43.590> over<00:01:43.619> us

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
those youngsters had spots all over us

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520 
those youngsters had spots all over us
because<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:44.970> about<00:01:45.180> 120<00:01:45.899> degrees<00:01:46.259> in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
because it was about 120 degrees in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
because it was about 120 degrees in
there<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.950> would<00:01:47.130> take<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.460> shirts<00:01:47.759> off

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
there so we would take our shirts off

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.510 
there so we would take our shirts off
and<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.840> metal<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.500> heavy<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.189> put<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and the metal was so heavy we put it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.310 
and the metal was so heavy we put it
into<00:01:50.759> volts<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.270> would<00:01:51.360> splash<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.930> over

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
into volts and it would splash all over

put it on it always sticks you make it

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.420 
put it on it always sticks you make it
look<00:03:43.360> easy<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.900> depends<00:03:44.470> on<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.799> mixers<00:03:45.250> now

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
look easy that depends on the mixers now

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.880 
look easy that depends on the mixers now
J<00:03:45.700> mix<00:03:45.940> me<00:03:46.120> up<00:03:46.209> somebody<00:03:46.420> three<00:03:47.290> kinds<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.709> mud

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
J mix me up somebody three kinds of mud

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.860 
J mix me up somebody three kinds of mud
there's<00:03:48.100> soupy<00:03:48.459> mud<00:03:48.640> there's<00:03:49.390> normal<00:03:49.690> mud

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
there's soupy mud there's normal mud

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.960 
there's soupy mud there's normal mud
then<00:03:50.290> there's<00:03:50.470> really<00:03:50.680> stiff<00:03:51.070> mud<00:03:51.280> depending

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
then there's really stiff mud depending

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.390 
then there's really stiff mud depending
on<00:03:52.090> what<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.360> got<00:03:52.660> here<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.079> how<00:03:53.290> improvise<00:03:54.100> with

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
on what I got here is how improvise with

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.240 
on what I got here is how improvise with
this<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.570> tendency<00:03:55.959> guys<00:03:56.410> depending

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
this in I have a tendency guys depending

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.680 
this in I have a tendency guys depending
on<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.489> wire<00:03:57.700> if<00:03:57.970> there's<00:03:58.180> if<00:03:58.360> they<00:03:58.540> got

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
on the wire if there's if they got

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.350 
on the wire if there's if they got
suffered<00:03:59.350> nails<00:04:00.070> in<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.430> I'll<00:04:00.640> improvise<00:04:00.940> I'll

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
suffered nails in it I'll improvise I'll

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.130 
suffered nails in it I'll improvise I'll
push<00:04:01.600> harder

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
push harder

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.620 
push harder
I'll<00:04:02.200> pull<00:04:02.739> less<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:03.459> that<00:04:03.850> stuff<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.329> can't

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
I'll pull less and that stuff I can't

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.600 
I'll pull less and that stuff I can't
really<00:04:04.930> show<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.320> but<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:05.650> can<00:04:05.890> tell<00:04:06.070> you<00:04:06.250> right

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
really show you but I can tell you right

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.569 
really show you but I can tell you right
now<00:04:06.670> I'm<00:04:06.910> using<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.299> mud<00:04:07.510> that's<00:04:07.780> uh<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:11.579> it's

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
now I'm using a mud that's uh it's it's

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.409 
now I'm using a mud that's uh it's it's
a<00:04:12.790> perfect<00:04:13.209> mud<00:04:13.420> for<00:04:13.660> scratching<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:16.000> okay

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
a perfect mud for scratching so okay

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.800 
a perfect mud for scratching so okay
let's<00:04:16.630> let's<00:04:17.229> do<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.560> again

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
let's let's do this again

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.650 
let's let's do this again
now<00:04:20.930> with<00:04:21.930> flat<00:04:22.230> wire<00:04:22.470> like<00:04:22.920> this<00:04:23.389> there's<00:04:24.389> one

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
now with flat wire like this there's one

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.550 
now with flat wire like this there's one
coat<00:04:24.960> now<00:04:25.830> if<00:04:25.920> I<00:04:25.980> put<00:04:26.190> another<00:04:26.430> coat

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
coat now if I put another coat

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.659 
coat now if I put another coat
technically<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:29.490> supposed<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:30.000> fall<00:04:30.270> off

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
technically it's supposed to fall off

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.980 
technically it's supposed to fall off
technically<00:04:32.669> because<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.210> wire<00:04:33.450> is<00:04:33.660> flat

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
technically because this wire is flat

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.300 
technically because this wire is flat
but<00:04:34.590> again<00:04:34.919> I'm<00:04:35.360> improvising<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:37.230> see<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.070> and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
but again I'm improvising I see it and

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.500 
but again I'm improvising I see it and
my<00:04:38.639> natural<00:04:40.460> ability<00:04:41.460> wants<00:04:41.760> me<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:41.970> push<00:04:42.210> here

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
my natural ability wants me to push here

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.940 
my natural ability wants me to push here
and<00:04:42.540> push<00:04:42.840> here<00:04:43.139> so<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.470> doesn't<00:04:43.500> have<00:04:43.919> a

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
and push here so it doesn't have a

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.210 
and push here so it doesn't have a
chance<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.490> fall<00:04:44.730> it's<00:04:45.450> hard<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.990> just<00:04:46.830> do<00:04:47.070> it

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
chance to fall it's hard to just do it

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.890 
chance to fall it's hard to just do it
to<00:04:48.060> prove<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.110> point<00:04:49.350> well<00:04:50.330> this<00:04:51.330> will<00:04:51.630> come<00:04:51.870> off

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
to prove a point well this will come off

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.670 
to prove a point well this will come off
right<00:04:52.410> here<00:04:52.860> all<00:04:53.700> right<00:04:54.260> I'm<00:04:55.260> going<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.470> go

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
right here all right I'm going to go

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.310 
right here all right I'm going to go
here<00:04:55.980> this<00:04:56.220> is<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> normal<00:04:56.990> normal<00:04:57.990> fur<00:04:58.700> now<00:04:59.700> I

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.730 

made<00:05:04.320> this<00:05:04.530> work<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:05.130> if<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.240> wasn't<00:05:06.590> trying<00:05:07.590> to

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
made this work and if I wasn't trying to

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.390 
made this work and if I wasn't trying to
prove<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:08.040> point

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
prove a point

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.670 
prove a point
I<00:05:08.490> would<00:05:08.669> push<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.210> in<00:05:09.450> here<00:05:09.690> here<00:05:09.930> here<00:05:10.440> so

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
I would push this in here here here so

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.010 
I would push this in here here here so
it<00:05:10.770> can't<00:05:11.070> come<00:05:11.280> off<00:05:11.430> but<00:05:11.700> I<00:05:11.940> don't<00:05:12.750> want<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:12.930> do

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
it can't come off but I don't want to do

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.420 
it can't come off but I don't want to do
that<00:05:13.169> because<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.590> idea<00:05:13.710> is<00:05:13.979> to<00:05:14.160> show<00:05:14.370> you

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
that because the idea is to show you

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.030 
that because the idea is to show you
that<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:15.150> wire<00:05:15.419> does<00:05:16.380> make<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.650> huge

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
that the wire does make a huge

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.420 
that the wire does make a huge
difference<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:19.340> two<00:05:20.340> guys<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.860> applicator

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
difference and two guys the applicator

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.100 
difference and two guys the applicator
and<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:24.060> mud<00:05:24.530> see<00:05:25.820> see<00:05:26.820> that'll<00:05:27.479> that'll<00:05:27.720> hold

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
and the mud see see that'll that'll hold

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.980 
and the mud see see that'll that'll hold
that's<00:05:28.380> thicker<00:05:28.680> than<00:05:28.919> this<00:05:29.070> here<00:05:29.660> this<00:05:30.660> is

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
that's thicker than this here this is

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.310 
that's thicker than this here this is
going<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.470> come<00:05:32.250> down<00:05:32.660> soon<00:05:33.660> I<00:05:33.900> can<00:05:34.110> tell

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
going to come down soon I can tell

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.850 
going to come down soon I can tell
already<00:05:34.560> what<00:05:36.020> let's<00:05:37.020> go<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.470> deeper

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
already what let's go to the deeper

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.980 
already what let's go to the deeper
furred<00:05:38.130> one<00:05:38.430> now<00:05:40.610> deeper<00:05:41.610> furred<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.840> is

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
furred one now deeper furred and this is

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.070 
furred one now deeper furred and this is
sort<00:05:43.289> of<00:05:43.380> like<00:05:43.940> having<00:05:44.940> furry<00:05:45.479> nails<00:05:45.870> the

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
sort of like having furry nails the

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.320 
sort of like having furry nails the
furry<00:05:46.289> nails<00:05:46.620> pushes<00:05:47.550> it<00:05:47.669> away<00:05:47.910> from<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.300> wall

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
furry nails pushes it away from the wall

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.740 
furry nails pushes it away from the wall
about<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.500> quarter-inch<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:51.390> way<00:05:51.570> it's

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
about a quarter-inch that way it's

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.490 
about a quarter-inch that way it's
embedded<00:05:52.400> now<00:05:53.400> this<00:05:53.669> one<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:54.240> can<00:05:54.870> put<00:05:55.050> a<00:05:55.200> lot

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
embedded now this one I can put a lot

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.330 
embedded now this one I can put a lot
thicker<00:05:55.890> because<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:59.550> wire<00:05:59.820> is<00:06:00.800> it<00:06:01.800> come<00:06:02.250> out

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
thicker because the wire is it come out

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.820 
thicker because the wire is it come out
about<00:06:02.729> Oh<00:06:03.919> almost<00:06:04.919> a<00:06:05.100> half<00:06:05.310> inch<00:06:06.620> see<00:06:07.620> that's

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
about Oh almost a half inch see that's

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.640 
about Oh almost a half inch see that's
got<00:06:08.010> almost<00:06:08.370> two<00:06:08.550> inches<00:06:08.729> on<00:06:09.030> it<00:06:09.180> right<00:06:09.390> now

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
got almost two inches on it right now

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.180 
got almost two inches on it right now
see<00:06:10.650> how<00:06:10.860> much<00:06:10.979> more<00:06:11.250> it<00:06:11.370> will<00:06:11.430> take<00:06:13.190> that's

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
see how much more it will take that's

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.360 
see how much more it will take that's
about<00:06:14.690> three<00:06:15.690> inches<00:06:16.080> now<00:06:16.740> this<00:06:16.950> one<00:06:17.190> here

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
about three inches now this one here

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.180 
about three inches now this one here
just<00:06:17.400> to<00:06:17.729> prove<00:06:17.910> a<00:06:18.060> point<00:06:18.090> since<00:06:19.010> since<00:06:20.010> I'm

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
just to prove a point since since I'm

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.529 
just to prove a point since since I'm
killing<00:06:20.550> time<00:06:20.820> and<00:06:21.800> having<00:06:22.800> fun<00:06:23.070> this<00:06:24.000> is<00:06:24.270> flat

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
killing time and having fun this is flat

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.170 
killing time and having fun this is flat
wire<00:06:24.810> now<00:06:25.650> normally<00:06:26.070> if<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.220> wanted<00:06:26.550> to<00:06:26.700> adhere

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
wire now normally if I wanted to adhere

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.650 
wire now normally if I wanted to adhere
I'd<00:06:27.539> push<00:06:27.870> here<00:06:28.169> push<00:06:28.320> here<00:06:28.770> there<00:06:29.099> there

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
I'd push here push here there there

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.740 
I'd push here push here there there
but<00:06:30.410> let's<00:06:30.710> see<00:06:30.920> that's<00:06:31.910> already<00:06:32.240> got<00:06:32.420> an<00:06:32.600> inch

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
but let's see that's already got an inch

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.970 
but let's see that's already got an inch
and<00:06:32.960> a<00:06:32.990> half<00:06:33.190> see<00:06:34.190> how<00:06:34.250> much<00:06:34.370> more<00:06:35.620> well<00:06:36.620> that's

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
and a half see how much more well that's

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.250 
and a half see how much more well that's
the<00:06:37.100> point<00:06:37.250> I<00:06:37.370> was<00:06:37.460> trying<00:06:37.520> to<00:06:37.730> make<00:06:37.850> guys<00:06:38.260> you

I'm trying to make is the wires too flat
anyway<00:07:05.870> we're<00:07:06.740> about<00:07:06.920> three<00:07:07.280> inches<00:07:07.610> here<00:07:07.880> the

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
anyway we're about three inches here the

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.820 
anyway we're about three inches here the
point<00:07:08.300> has<00:07:08.480> been<00:07:08.510> made<00:07:08.690> if<00:07:09.080> the<00:07:09.230> wire<00:07:09.440> is<00:07:09.470> too

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
point has been made if the wire is too

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.160 
point has been made if the wire is too
flat<00:07:10.100> it's<00:07:10.580> going<00:07:10.970> to<00:07:11.090> come<00:07:11.300> off<00:07:11.330> doesn't

put fibers in it or you mix it too stiff
this<00:07:17.270> is<00:07:17.660> for<00:07:18.140> what<00:07:18.320> Jay<00:07:18.560> and<00:07:18.590> I<00:07:18.800> do<00:07:18.860> a<00:07:19.010> lot<00:07:19.220> of

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
this is for what Jay and I do a lot of

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.390 
this is for what Jay and I do a lot of
patchwork<00:07:19.550> because<00:07:20.150> it<00:07:20.660> will<00:07:20.840> adhere<00:07:21.400> longer

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
patchwork because it will adhere longer

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.280 
patchwork because it will adhere longer
and<00:07:22.610> does<00:07:23.030> it<00:07:23.180> matter<00:07:23.360> for<00:07:23.630> this<00:07:23.750> little<00:07:23.960> stuff

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.290 
and does it matter for this little stuff

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.290 
and does it matter for this little stuff
not<00:07:24.920> really<00:07:24.950> but<00:07:25.700> when<00:07:25.820> you're<00:07:25.940> doing<00:07:26.120> a<00:07:26.180> whole

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300 
not really but when you're doing a whole

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.390 
not really but when you're doing a whole
house<00:07:26.540> and<00:07:26.930> you're<00:07:27.080> you're<00:07:27.560> putting<00:07:27.770> tons<00:07:28.100> on

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
house and you're you're putting tons on

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.480 
house and you're you're putting tons on
at<00:07:28.610> a<00:07:28.640> time<00:07:28.700> last<00:07:29.450> thing<00:07:29.660> you<00:07:29.780> want<00:07:29.990> to<00:07:30.050> hear<00:07:30.290> is

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490 
at a time last thing you want to hear is

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.340 
at a time last thing you want to hear is
stucco<00:07:31.490> fallin<00:07:32.240> behind<00:07:32.420> you<00:07:32.870> and<00:07:33.020> I've<00:07:33.140> heard

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.350 
stucco fallin behind you and I've heard

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.710 
stucco fallin behind you and I've heard
that<00:07:33.530> sound<00:07:33.800> many<00:07:34.130> many<00:07:34.400> times<00:07:34.730> so<00:07:35.000> I<00:07:35.240> thought

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
that sound many many times so I thought

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.390 
that sound many many times so I thought
I'd<00:07:35.870> make<00:07:36.080> it<00:07:36.290> a<00:07:36.440> point<00:07:36.650> to<00:07:36.800> show<00:07:36.980> this<00:07:37.190> deep

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.400 
I'd make it a point to show this deep

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.790 
I'd make it a point to show this deep
furred<00:07:37.700> wire<00:07:38.000> anyway<00:07:38.810> I<00:07:38.900> hope<00:07:39.050> that<00:07:39.110> proved<00:07:39.650> a

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 
furred wire anyway I hope that proved a

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.980 
furred wire anyway I hope that proved a
point<00:07:40.010> and<00:07:40.280> if<00:07:40.460> the<00:07:40.580> wire<00:07:40.790> is<00:07:40.820> too<00:07:41.450> tight<00:07:41.750> guys

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990 
point and if the wire is too tight guys

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.860 
point and if the wire is too tight guys
like<00:07:42.320> I<00:07:42.500> say<00:07:42.740> take<00:07:42.980> a<00:07:43.010> hammer<00:07:43.340> take<00:07:44.030> pliers<00:07:44.540> and

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:44.870 
like I say take a hammer take pliers and

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.580 
like I say take a hammer take pliers and
pull<00:07:45.230> it<00:07:45.320> away<00:07:45.440> pull<00:07:46.400> it<00:07:46.460> away<00:07:46.580> that's<00:07:47.590> that's

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.590 
pull it away pull it away that's that's
