00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.190 
and as most everything in here is humans
that<00:01:29.039> that<00:01:29.279> is<00:01:29.369> why<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> cut<00:01:29.969> the<00:01:30.359> red<00:01:30.569> down<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that that is why I cut the red down to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.019 
that that is why I cut the red down to
just<00:01:31.679> the<00:01:31.799> stone<00:01:32.039> rights<00:01:32.279> and<00:01:32.429> vexing<00:01:32.729> devils

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:33.029 
just the stone rights and vexing devils

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:40.249 
just the stone rights and vexing devils
and<00:01:33.179> not<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:35.149> nobles<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.109> I<00:01:40.170> could

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and not the the nobles just so I could

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719 
and not the the nobles just so I could
have<00:01:40.409> more<00:01:40.619> things<00:01:40.859> trigger<00:01:41.099> this<00:01:41.310> champion

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729

of<00:01:41.819> parish<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.359> whole<00:01:42.509> idea<00:01:42.539> of<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.959> is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
of parish so the whole idea of this is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.359 
of parish so the whole idea of this is
to<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.349> a<00:01:43.380> bunch<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.709> ones<00:01:43.920> into<00:01:44.219> your

drops<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.180> guess<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.750> could<00:02:12.959> go<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.440> replace<00:02:13.650> if

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
drops I guess I could go and replace if

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.199 
drops I guess I could go and replace if
it<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.069> reckless<00:02:14.430> way<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:14.940> another

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
it go reckless way if it is another

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.250 
it go reckless way if it is another
human<00:02:16.099> but<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> 11<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
human but this is a 11 and this is a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.630 
human but this is a 11 and this is a
guaranteed<00:02:19.650> 22<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> mean<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.340> yes<00:02:20.460> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
guaranteed 22 I mean that yes the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.700 
guaranteed 22 I mean that yes the
reckless<00:02:20.910> way<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.060> could<00:02:21.210> become<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> 32<00:02:21.960> that's

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
reckless way it could become a 32 that's

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.840 
reckless way it could become a 32 that's
something<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.040> could<00:02:23.190> definitely<00:02:23.430> mess

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
something I could definitely mess

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.160 
something I could definitely mess
out<00:02:23.940> with<00:02:24.090> maybe<00:02:24.330> instead<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.630> stone<00:02:24.930> right

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
out with maybe instead of stone right

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.120 
out with maybe instead of stone right
and<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.850> no<00:02:27.060> no<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.360> human<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:27.780> well<00:02:28.130> I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and this no no it's a human as well I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.130 
and this no no it's a human as well I
could<00:02:29.760> do<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:29.910> instead<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.270> judges<00:02:30.660> familiar

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
could do that instead of judges familiar

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.780 
could do that instead of judges familiar
the<00:02:31.320> reason<00:02:31.560> why<00:02:31.650> i<00:02:31.710> put<00:02:31.920> judges<00:02:32.250> familiar<00:02:32.700> in

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the reason why i put judges familiar in

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.890 
the reason why i put judges familiar in
here<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.060> i<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.210> think<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.570> there<00:02:33.780> but

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
here is i do think that there but

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.270 
here is i do think that there but
they're<00:02:34.050> quite<00:02:34.170> powerful<00:02:34.770> with<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:34.950> sack

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
they're quite powerful with the sack

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.310 
they're quite powerful with the sack
ability<00:02:35.820> as<00:02:35.970> i<00:02:36.330> am<00:02:36.450> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:36.960> them<00:02:37.110> back

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
ability as i am going to get them back

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.430 
ability as i am going to get them back
with<00:02:37.560> your<00:02:37.680> mortal<00:02:37.890> servitude<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.990> could<00:02:40.230> I

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
over and over and over I guess this this

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.790 
over and over and over I guess this this
hand<00:02:57.210> is<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.510> mean<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.170> deck<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
hand is I mean this this deck is a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.410 
hand is I mean this this deck is a
little<00:02:59.040> bit<00:02:59.160> weak<00:02:59.310> because<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.790> does<00:02:59.970> have<00:03:00.240> to

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
little bit weak because it does have to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.180 
little bit weak because it does have to
have<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> moral<00:03:00.870> servitude<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.470> work<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.070> it's

have a moral servitude to work and it's

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.300 
have a moral servitude to work and it's
just<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.490> for<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> deck<00:03:03.530> but<00:03:04.530> with

faithless looting Xandra forces soul I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.860 
faithless looting Xandra forces soul I
