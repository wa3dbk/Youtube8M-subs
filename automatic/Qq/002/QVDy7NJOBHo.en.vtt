the second folder of the CD object
studio<00:00:08.010> library<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.849> called<00:00:09.179> pavement

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
studio library is called pavement

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.129 
studio library is called pavement
modular<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.059> this<00:00:12.059> folder<00:00:12.360> contains<00:00:12.690> two

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
modular and this folder contains two

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.039 
modular and this folder contains two
different<00:00:13.530> objects<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.849> first<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.599> called

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
different objects the first is called

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.920 
different objects the first is called
pavement<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.640> more<00:00:18.119> complex<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
pavement it's a more complex and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.050 
pavement it's a more complex and
detailed<00:00:19.170> object<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.100> particular<00:00:20.369> use<00:00:20.760> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
detailed object for particular use and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.779 
detailed object for particular use and
the<00:00:21.869> second<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.289> called<00:00:22.380> simple<00:00:23.340> pavement

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the second is called simple pavement

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.330 
the second is called simple pavement
breakable<00:00:24.300> object<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.470> let's<00:00:25.680> start<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
breakable object so let's start with the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
breakable object so let's start with the
second<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.359> simpler<00:00:27.779> object<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.619> will

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
second it's a simpler object and it will

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.540 
second it's a simpler object and it will
make<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.220> primary<00:00:29.490> description<00:00:30.269> easier<00:00:30.599> so

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
make the primary description easier so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.110 
make the primary description easier so
create<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.380> object<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.620> certain<00:00:35.550> object<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
create the object a certain object and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.270 
create the object a certain object and
unfold<00:00:36.899> its<00:00:37.079> hierarchy<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.680> contains<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
unfold its hierarchy it contains a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.360 
unfold its hierarchy it contains a
mograph<00:00:38.610> cloner<00:00:39.000> object<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.620> key<00:00:40.860> object

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
mograph cloner object is the key object

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.459 
mograph cloner object is the key object
of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> wreck<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.840> uses<00:00:43.230> two<00:00:43.440> different

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
of the wreck and it uses two different

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.910 
of the wreck and it uses two different
effectors<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.430> well<00:00:45.230> don't<00:00:46.230> delete<00:00:46.530> them<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
effectors as well don't delete them and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.000 
effectors as well don't delete them and
don't<00:00:47.760> change<00:00:48.120> them<00:00:48.390> please<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
don't change them please just use the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.000 
don't change them please just use the
route<00:00:50.190> object<00:00:51.110> set<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> simple<00:00:52.620> pavement

route object set the simple pavement

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.450 
route object set the simple pavement
break<00:00:53.190> wall<00:00:53.460> object<00:00:54.170> again<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> use<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.160> user

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
break wall object again and use the user

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.220 
break wall object again and use the user
data<00:00:56.670> tab<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.989> contains<00:00:58.890> all<00:01:00.230> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
data tab here it contains all the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
data tab here it contains all the
settings<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.829> parameters<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.699> wreck

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
settings and parameters of the wreck

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.469 
settings and parameters of the wreck
as<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.650> Derek<00:01:05.549> uses<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> special

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
as you can see Derek uses a special

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.649 
as you can see Derek uses a special
material<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.960> well<00:01:07.340> demet<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.490> used<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
material as well demet are used by the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.070 
material as well demet are used by the
shadow<00:01:09.990> effector<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:11.070> saw<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:12.600> material

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
shadow effector we saw the material

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.969 
shadow effector we saw the material
controls<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:14.250> lines<00:01:15.090> movement<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
controls got lines movement is here so

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.240 
controls got lines movement is here so
you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.280> shift<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:21.140> outlines<00:01:22.140> within<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you can shift all outlines within the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
you can shift all outlines within the
volume<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:26.330> let's<00:01:27.330> change<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.439> object

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
volume here let's change the object

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.660 
volume here let's change the object
orientation<00:01:29.720> let's<00:01:30.720> say<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.470> break<00:01:32.369> work

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
orientation let's say it's a break work

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.620 
orientation let's say it's a break work
the<00:01:33.150> moment<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.430> we<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.610> adjust<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.390> brief

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the moment and we can adjust the brief

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
the moment and we can adjust the brief
size<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:38.189> these<00:01:38.880> elements<00:01:40.220> we<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.400> use<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
size of all these elements we can use a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.120 
size of all these elements we can use a
bit<00:01:42.119> more<00:01:42.720> common<00:01:43.290> dimension<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.880> break

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
bit more common dimension of a break

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.370 
bit more common dimension of a break
let's<00:01:47.130> say<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.579> break<00:01:47.820> width<00:01:48.060> should<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.570> 30

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
let's say the break width should be 30

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.980 
let's say the break width should be 30
brig<00:01:50.070> head<00:01:50.310> should<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.970> soon<00:01:51.119> at<00:01:51.299> 5<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
brig head should be soon at 5 and the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.399 
brig head should be soon at 5 and the
debt<00:01:52.229> should<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.920> 15<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:54.540> looks<00:01:54.840> much<00:01:55.049> better<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
debt should be 15 it looks much better I

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.249 
debt should be 15 it looks much better I
guess<00:01:55.680> let's<00:01:56.460> say<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.479> make<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.049> wall

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
guess let's say we have to make the wall

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.010 
guess let's say we have to make the wall
a<00:01:58.530> bit<00:01:58.590> longer<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.460> use<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.329> total<00:02:00.719> width<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
a bit longer so use the total width a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.889 
a bit longer so use the total width a
proxy<00:02:01.530> volume<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.880> set<00:02:03.119> approximate<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
proxy volume we can set approximate the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
proxy volume we can set approximate the
values<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:04.439> only<00:02:04.829> because<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.790> real

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
values here only because the real

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.300 
values here only because the real
dimension<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.780> affected<00:02:07.200> by<00:02:07.380> break<00:02:07.740> size<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
dimension is affected by break size and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.910 
dimension is affected by break size and
the<00:02:08.849> gap<00:02:09.149> size<00:02:09.420> between<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.470> bricks<00:02:10.739> in

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the gap size between all the bricks in

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.720 
the gap size between all the bricks in
the<00:02:11.250> wall

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
the wall

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.820 
the wall
so<00:02:12.879> let's<00:02:13.270> play<00:02:13.599> with<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.989> game<00:02:14.200> volume<00:02:14.590> and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
so let's play with the game volume and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.460 
so let's play with the game volume and
it<00:02:15.190> will<00:02:15.280> change<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.120> look<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.900> wall<00:02:17.080> but

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
it will change the look of the wall but

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.500 
it will change the look of the wall but
it<00:02:17.620> doesn't<00:02:17.890> affect<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.640> total<00:02:19.030> width<00:02:19.239> and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it doesn't affect the total width and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.559 
it doesn't affect the total width and
health<00:02:19.900> settings<00:02:20.440> he<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.489> check<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.819> real

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
health settings he can check the real

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.690 
health settings he can check the real
dimension<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.410> wall<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.190> info<00:02:24.489> box

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
dimension of the wall in the info box

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.910 
dimension of the wall in the info box
group<00:02:25.060> okay<00:02:25.629> so<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.959> give<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> look<00:02:26.379> to<00:02:26.440> one<00:02:26.680> for

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
group okay so the give a look to one for
