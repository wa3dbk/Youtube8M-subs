there<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.609> cannot<00:01:03.270> drive<00:01:03.600> around

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
there I know you cannot drive around

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.370 
there I know you cannot drive around
DirectX<00:01:04.470> 11<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.220> whatever<00:01:06.119> say<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.780> drive

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

around rocket x9 for most of the
computers<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.830> can't<00:01:11.159> drive<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.670> data

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
computers if you can't drive it on data

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.260 
computers if you can't drive it on data
drive<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.260> beam<00:01:13.500> XP

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
drive it on beam XP

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.950 
drive it on beam XP
now<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> say<00:01:15.960> win<00:01:16.439> XP<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.720> see

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
now when I say win XP here and you see

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.030 
now when I say win XP here and you see
that<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.770> does<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.070> mean<00:01:20.310> Windows<00:01:21.270> XP<00:01:22.259> do

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that that does not mean Windows XP do

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
that that does not mean Windows XP do
not<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.000> windows<00:01:24.390> XP<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
not think that it's windows XP that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.710 
not think that it's windows XP that
means<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:27.090> either<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:29.310> DirectX<00:01:29.909> 7<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.659> it's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
means it's either in DirectX 7 or it's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
means it's either in DirectX 7 or it's
either<00:01:31.079> DirectX<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:33.530> DirectX<00:01:34.530> 5

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
either DirectX and DirectX 5

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.810 
either DirectX and DirectX 5
I<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.420> wrecked<00:01:36.659> x7<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.460> another

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
I think it's wrecked x7 so it's another

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.480 
I think it's wrecked x7 so it's another
DirectX<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.590> another<00:01:41.280> name

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
DirectX it just to have another name

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.410 
DirectX it just to have another name
here<00:01:42.590> OpenGL<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:44.630> extremely<00:01:45.630> bad<00:01:46.670> as<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:48.030> render

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
here OpenGL is extremely bad as a render

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.600 
here OpenGL is extremely bad as a render
setting<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> should<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.290> play<00:01:49.560> about<00:01:50.340> any

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
setting you should not play about any

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.170 
setting you should not play about any
game<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.350> OpenGL<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.520> completely

game in OpenGL if it's not completely

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.499 
game in OpenGL if it's not completely
optimized<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:56.430> as<00:01:57.149> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
optimized for it it's just as a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.630 
optimized for it it's just as a
experimental<00:01:58.409> feeling<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> developers

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
experimental feeling for the developers

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.690 
experimental feeling for the developers
and<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.840> left<00:02:01.799> OpenGL

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and I think they actually left OpenGL

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.120 
and I think they actually left OpenGL
off<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.890> old

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
off but if you have a really old

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.570 
off but if you have a really old
computer<00:02:06.290> then<00:02:07.290> maybe<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.160> should<00:02:08.340> drive<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
computer then maybe you should drive it

computer then maybe you should drive it
an<00:02:08.970> a/d<00:02:09.679> OpenGL<00:02:11.300> now<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.540> not<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
an a/d OpenGL now I do not know the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.520 
an a/d OpenGL now I do not know the

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
the newest OpenGL it actually so not the

not a horrible first OpenGL that in if

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.899 
not a horrible first OpenGL that in if
you're<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> developer<00:02:25.860> or<00:02:26.190> something<00:02:26.790> like

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
you're a developer or something like

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.380 
you're a developer or something like
that<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:27.780> would<00:02:27.959> know<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:29.329> but<00:02:30.329> I

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that it that you would know and but I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.899 
that it that you would know and but I
would<00:02:30.569> say<00:02:30.750> if<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.290> want<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.560> play<00:02:31.890> at<00:02:32.220> movie

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
would say if you want to play at movie

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.619 
would say if you want to play at movie
or<00:02:33.329> at<00:02:33.540> max<00:02:33.959> take<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.769> down<00:02:35.069> at<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> win<00:02:35.640> XP<00:02:36.060> like

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
or at max take it down at a win XP like

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.319 
or at max take it down at a win XP like
it<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:37.079> will<00:02:37.319> really<00:02:37.739> improve<00:02:38.129> your<00:02:38.640> framerate

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
it it will really improve your framerate

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.180 
it it will really improve your framerate
had<00:02:39.840> definitely<00:02:40.500> improved<00:02:40.829> your<00:02:40.950> framerate

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
had definitely improved your framerate

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.699 
had definitely improved your framerate
you<00:02:41.549> can<00:02:41.700> play<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.879> better<00:02:42.209> graphic<00:02:42.750> than<00:02:42.959> you

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
you can play a better graphic than you

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.289 
you can play a better graphic than you
would<00:02:43.829> would<00:02:44.310> otherwise<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.150> better

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
would would otherwise and better

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.180 
would would otherwise and better
framerate<00:02:45.629> so<00:02:45.989> definitely<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.129> is

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
framerate so definitely this is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.130 
framerate so definitely this is
extremely<00:02:48.030> important<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.690> pick<00:02:48.900> the
