00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.620
 head and other feet 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.030
 We started asking for help. 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.580
 young people who were there in the corner 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.440
 that there is a workshop and they help us 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.870

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.490
 They determined that amelia flores madrid

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.760
 the victim who suffers from diabetes lost 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.390
 the knowledge and its recovery is 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.390
 complicated 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.700
 if you are worried because we have had 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.720
 several cases of this during the month 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.230
 approximately three have been registered 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.000
 cases is alarming because it is not very 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.400
 frequent that dogs attack so 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.940
 constant 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.950
 this was attacked by four dogs 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.890
 approximately and according to the report of 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.960
 unnerving and rannikko 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.310
 it's alarming because the four dogs 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.600
 They attacked both foot and head back 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.600
 as if it were trying to devour 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.920
 the aggression that is not the first 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.190
 confronted the residents of the streets 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.160
 armed forces of Mexico and air force demand 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.619
 that the animals are slaughtered on 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.890
 it was an accident and he will assume the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.890

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.660
 happen and I have to face things 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.660
