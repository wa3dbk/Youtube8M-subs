00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
retention nut and you'll want to have it

at about the halfway point so you start

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.600 
at about the halfway point so you start

to feel pressure at the halfway point

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.600 
to feel pressure at the halfway point
and<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:38.290> your<00:02:38.470> quick<00:02:38.680> release<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.160> tight<00:02:39.370> now
