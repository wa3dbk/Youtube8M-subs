00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.910
 today we go to one 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:15.059
 treasure hunt set treasure finds the chest 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.850
 her to a stranded ship in the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:26.359
 near sacred harbor in this bustle 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:31.439
 you will find several hints or 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:35.520
 Notes card has been shot 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.170
 Note card or no idea how 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 I should call the first note 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:49.170
 get on the star of 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.180
 bring holy port so it lasts 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.199
 stand on the star of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.469
 heiligenhafen 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:00.030
 this is a lighthouse north of 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.920
 holy harbor is there he is you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.570
 certainly also met if 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.700
 you already played near 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 After that, we should go to a guard 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:21.119
 over and the warrior is the warrior 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.040
 I come to an old house like that 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:29.610
 find it that an altar of bidding 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.220
 I'll show you then only after that 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.250
 must take 45 steps from this statue of 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.110
 kriegers direction south and then have to 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.740
 you can see her on the left side 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.890
 a few palm trees and there is an island 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.799
 framed by the palms and on the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.840
 island is the last hint of the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.480
 direction stone ship shows the finds 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:09.510
 you too 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:12.660
 Also , this is the lighthouse is white 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:19.920
 I am also very beautiful all over 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:25.790
 textures on the elder scrolls online 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:30.900
 a bit oriental or 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.850
 Occident so in the direction you should 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.360
 but watchers actually watch it 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:41.030
 14 I with words on the card you stand 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:47.910
 it is north of us so poop measures 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:52.530
 damn I'm smart and in the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:57.120
 desert northwest of us at this 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:04.220
 a waypoint is the statue of 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.220
 warrior, then I run out quickly 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.700
 now she has a bit similarities 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.700
 from Pirates of the Caribbean find it 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:25.190
 there is the statue of the warrior 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:29.000
 Just in the middle of the desert in there and 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:33.740
 that is also a nice place there 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.620
 somehow no violence mark all trouble 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.540
 from his mother gets there go now 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.540
 45 steps south 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.330
 That's about the side of the road 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.510
 that should also be a heaven's splitter 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:07.209
 and between the palm trees aim these 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.209
 island on which the next note is 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:23.960
 The island is framed by the palm trees 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:31.340
 so now a round swim so the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:32.860
 second goal is probably on the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.720
 island we get the next note 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:41.479
 We should get our hands off the judge 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.080
 decomposed by the broken schiff 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.789
 ship leads and behind these 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.520
 broken or disassembled ship 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.520
 the keystone ship 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.390
 funny there is now the stone in front of us 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.710
 ship einstein ship i find you 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.830
 not like a ship that is 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.290
 absolutely no ship here now 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.400
 Several piles of earth under the palms and 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:52.720
 then he would have to dig something 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:52.720
 so start manuela again back 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:05.669
 there definitely pushes the thumb 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.669
 yes yes yes found wonderful 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.289
 so that
