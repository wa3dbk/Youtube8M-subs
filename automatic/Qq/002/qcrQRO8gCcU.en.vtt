00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
fragile than the fedex envelope so you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.770 
fragile than the fedex envelope so you
just<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:42.120> more<00:00:42.300> careful

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
trim up to the shortest edges because

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
trim up to the shortest edges because
that's<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.680> largest<00:01:22.890> size<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.729> petals<00:01:24.060> can

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
it up to get rid of the fold lines and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.340 
it up to get rid of the fold lines and
repeat<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.490> same<00:01:32.670> process<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.930> second
