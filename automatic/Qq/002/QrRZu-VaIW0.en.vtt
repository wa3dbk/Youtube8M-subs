00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 I'm here for you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.560
 make a quick video for 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.980
 answer some personal questions anda 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.000
 doing there about how it got ipi 3 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.160
 thousand after that little nano beat and 30 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.840
 there ne 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 So I'll answer to you. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.740
 they explain it quickly because it took me 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.949
 to make this video because the car is 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.579
 some days 34 days after the fateful 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 had he gone to the repair right? 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.410
 and that's what happened, I got a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.329
 Lighthouse 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.760
 it is an original headlight gm arteb gm 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.680
 I got a part of the lighthouse as it already 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.140
 is said in another video is another part 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.559
 I bought it from fernando 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 I bought the front frizzo is the chrome 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.079
 I already bought the complete kit and the car was 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.559
 taken to chapeação who reminds 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.830
 The only beat that got was was 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.750
 done got 100% do not have to complain 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.510
 was pulled ball show 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.850
 under the hood did not look very well painted 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 spent a few days and I took the car and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 We took the car home was not good 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.020
 It was a hot car. 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.060
 I sent the car back to be painted 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.509
 of an agenda problem 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.729
 the car was ready this week someone 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.049
 ask me was 100% rafael did not stay 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.470
 100% 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.750
 It's not 100% It's 80% 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.180
 reality got better than it was 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.100
 It's still bad It has to be 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.970
 close to understanding here so the car 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.040
 still lacking in brightness or is a 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 Pick up service, no use. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.530
 I recommend not recommend it and I spent one 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.810
 money to do something and I did not have 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.880
 I had a return, but the car is 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.770
 aligned as you can see the rubber washer 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.550
 Then everything is fine. 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 frizzo new frieze is parallel is not 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.500
 original but he has an appearance 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.500
 very good 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.060
 has some problems like for example 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.800
 the corner here 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.400
 he kind of comes off of there has to 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.130
 to put it in the new place is more 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.440
 car is aligned to the front aligned 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.470
 all finishes aligned lines do not 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.390
 It was 100% painting and maybe in 30 or 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.450
 40 days it will be taken in a 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.010
 authorized in a store very well 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.700
 conceptualized and that I achieved with a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.830
 very strong contact and we'll leave it 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.290
 to resolve all these details and 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.670
 including small cat lines 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.860
 have in it, do not you? 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.239
 here on this side there are two doors that 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.550
 the expense line on the other hand has 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.980
 two more doors and we'll solve 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.320
 some future micro service 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.500
 maybe we'll solve this problem and here 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.230
 because it was not 100% but so in general 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.830
 the car is lined up ahead 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.830
 perfect 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.290
 the front was extremely aligned there 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.080
 huh 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.700
 but who won was the derly we took the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.290
 bumper put the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.569
 Termination close rubbers were 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.730
 OK 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.470
 and that's it from there after he leaves again 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.290
 when he is going to solve these 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.450
 detail he has already got news there 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:40.250
 which will come for example the blinkers gm 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.799
 get with a facebook face 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.260
 Original gm I enjoyed and already ordered 3 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.410
 because how do I have three at home? 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.870
 I use the new ones in this one and stay 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.140
 everything jewelry this novelty maybe a 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.829
 cleaning the flashlights there never 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.840
 to bother but maybe a cleaning is 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.870
 cool to do but there the video was only 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.340
 to show that the car is at home and 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.790
 Tomorrow he goes to the workshop, he told people . 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.790
 thanks
