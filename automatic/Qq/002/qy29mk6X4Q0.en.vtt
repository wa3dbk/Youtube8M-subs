00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 thanks for that act which is a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 pride for me he did us the favor of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.699
 hold on Mr. André Bustamante the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.160
 güiri güiri I looked for it because always 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.940
 what is admired is a great great great 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.890
 humorist 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.230
 the comedian I say always says that 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.710
 those for me the two greatest in life 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.739
 they are polo and andrés bustamante polo polo 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.350
 for those who came in re justly and 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.730
 I love fascinates me the idea that 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.009
 can be on the stage standing with 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.560
 ponchito do not think any 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.299
 Mexican would love to meet 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.299
 ponchito and hug him 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.100
 I believe that this eye show is for me a 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.580
 very important because it is the lunario and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.050
 I'm good I'm excited and happy 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.600
 but 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.580
 I want to think that there is a long way to go 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 travel to get here 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.660
 all my life 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.550
 hoffman shared with us what is 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.350
 the process that he carries out during his 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.080
 preparation before going on stage 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:49.450
 I tell you, it takes me a while 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:51.640
 comb your hair sorry this is not makeup 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.170
 a little bit I really do not know artist 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.960
 to make up a lot almost what is more 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.149
 almost nothing is the truth almost nothing if 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.750
 I have a big ring something for the 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.159
 imperfection 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.960
 if I maquillo option or I will not spend 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.210
 well I comb my eyebrows is all that 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.340
 I defend because I go and I do it for 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.140
 despair because it's the only thing that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.869
 propende in life 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.550
 that yes it was quite simple because 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.800
 we discovered during a secret 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.709
 infection in his dressing room there was no more 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.080
 that the essential thing I do not ask for anything more 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.940
 that water because if I am very thirsty and 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.819

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.819
