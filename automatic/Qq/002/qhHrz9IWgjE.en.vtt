as<00:01:18.869> coverage<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> simple

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
as coverage it is going to be the simple

it's<00:04:08.850> very<00:04:08.970> very<00:04:09.750> smooth<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.710> find<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:12.710> I'll

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
it's very very smooth I find that I'll

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.030 
it's very very smooth I find that I'll
put<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:13.950> swatch<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.550> right<00:04:14.850> here<00:04:15.150> as<00:04:15.300> well<00:04:15.510> I

put a swatch in right here as well I

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.930 
put a swatch in right here as well I
find<00:04:17.040> that<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.489> Mac<00:04:17.790> one<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.560> chalky<00:04:19.940> this

find that the Mac one is chalky this

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.880 
find that the Mac one is chalky this
does<00:04:21.210> not<00:04:21.359> have<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.900> feel<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.680> is

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
does not have that feel to it this is

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.750 
does not have that feel to it this is
very<00:04:23.490> very<00:04:23.850> smooth<00:04:24.240> very<00:04:24.960> very<00:04:25.290> nice<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.890> just

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
very very smooth very very nice and just

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.070 
very very smooth very very nice and just
has

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
has

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.379 
has
really<00:04:27.470> really<00:04:27.680> nice<00:04:28.009> silky<00:04:28.610> texture<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.360> it

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
really really nice silky texture to it

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.290 
really really nice silky texture to it
so<00:04:29.479> texture<00:04:30.050> is<00:04:30.139> a<00:04:30.169> good<00:04:30.379> five<00:04:30.620> out<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.860> five

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
so texture is a good five out of five

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.119 
so texture is a good five out of five
longevity<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.539> stayed<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.199> me<00:04:33.379> all<00:04:33.590> day<00:04:33.620> it

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129 
longevity this stayed on me all day it

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.610 
longevity this stayed on me all day it
didn't<00:04:34.490> move<00:04:34.729> it<00:04:35.120> didn't<00:04:35.449> cake<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:36.169> didn't

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
didn't move it didn't cake it didn't

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.330 
didn't move it didn't cake it didn't
crack<00:04:36.949> it<00:04:37.699> stayed<00:04:38.389> exactly<00:04:38.810> how<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:39.770> looked<00:04:40.039> in

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
crack it stayed exactly how it looked in

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.550 
crack it stayed exactly how it looked in
the<00:04:40.699> beginning<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.270> longevity<00:04:41.900> is<00:04:41.990> great<00:04:42.259> five

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
the beginning so longevity is great five

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.129 
the beginning so longevity is great five
out<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.800> five<00:04:43.240> application<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.449> find<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:44.960> easy

sponge I'm not a sponge person because
as<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.419> said<00:05:05.479> I'm<00:05:05.780> using<00:05:05.840> this<00:05:06.229> more<00:05:06.590> as<00:05:06.680> a

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
as I said I'm using this more as a

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.580 
as I said I'm using this more as a
setting<00:05:07.219> powder<00:05:07.250> than<00:05:07.789> as<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.060> foundation<00:05:08.930> but

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
setting powder than as a foundation but

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.209 
setting powder than as a foundation but
the<00:05:09.650> sponge<00:05:10.069> you<00:05:10.430> can<00:05:10.699> dampen<00:05:11.389> it<00:05:11.479> and<00:05:11.870> get<00:05:12.139> a

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
the sponge you can dampen it and get a

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.680 
the sponge you can dampen it and get a
very<00:05:13.219> very<00:05:13.490> full<00:05:13.669> coverage<00:05:13.729> or<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:14.360> can<00:05:14.509> use

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
very very full coverage or you can use

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.170 
very very full coverage or you can use
it<00:05:14.919> dry<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.219> just<00:05:16.280> use<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:16.610> as<00:05:16.789> a<00:05:16.819> little<00:05:17.030> bit

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
it dry and just use that as a little bit

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.029 
it dry and just use that as a little bit
of<00:05:17.300> kind<00:05:17.780> of<00:05:17.900> a<00:05:17.990> setting<00:05:18.349> powder<00:05:18.379> that<00:05:18.830> way<00:05:18.979> too

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
of kind of a setting powder that way too

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.129 
of kind of a setting powder that way too
so<00:05:19.460> application<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.150> think<00:05:20.360> is<00:05:20.449> easy<00:05:20.629> always

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
so application I think is easy always

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.010 
so application I think is easy always
around<00:05:21.500> so<00:05:21.680> it's<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.889> good<00:05:22.099> 5<00:05:22.370> out<00:05:22.580> of<00:05:22.610> 5

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
around so it's a good 5 out of 5

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.420 
around so it's a good 5 out of 5
packaging<00:05:24.020> now<00:05:24.560> here's<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.860> thing<00:05:25.039> I<00:05:25.159> really

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
packaging now here's the thing I really

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.159 
packaging now here's the thing I really
like<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:26.090> look<00:05:26.270> of<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:26.539> packaging<00:05:26.659> my

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
like the look of the packaging my

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.869 
like the look of the packaging my
problem<00:05:27.680> is<00:05:27.830> this<00:05:28.159> one<00:05:28.340> for<00:05:28.699> some<00:05:28.849> reason

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
problem is this one for some reason

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.119 
problem is this one for some reason
every<00:05:29.539> time<00:05:29.569> I<00:05:29.779> open<00:05:30.169> it<00:05:30.259> it<00:05:30.439> opens<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:31.099> the

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
every time I open it it opens to the

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.089 
every time I open it it opens to the
bottom<00:05:31.729> not<00:05:32.659> to<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.169> product<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:33.830> always

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
bottom not to the product so I always

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.769 
bottom not to the product so I always
have<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.430> flip<00:05:34.759> it<00:05:34.849> over<00:05:35.000> that's<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.509> silly

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 
have to flip it over that's a silly

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.990 
have to flip it over that's a silly

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
little thing but I find it a little

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.570 
little thing but I find it a little
annoying<00:05:38.409> the<00:05:39.409> package<00:05:39.740> is<00:05:39.860> fairly<00:05:40.190> easy<00:05:40.310> to

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
annoying the package is fairly easy to

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.689 
annoying the package is fairly easy to
open<00:05:40.729> it<00:05:40.969> just<00:05:41.000> has<00:05:41.270> a<00:05:41.300> snap<00:05:41.659> clap<00:05:42.259> snap<00:05:42.919> clasp

closure<00:05:44.979> easy<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.190> open<00:05:46.310> but<00:05:46.610> as<00:05:46.729> I<00:05:46.879> said<00:05:46.940> it

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
closure easy to open but as I said it

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.149 
closure easy to open but as I said it
just<00:05:47.449> kind<00:05:47.930> of<00:05:48.020> moves<00:05:48.289> around<00:05:48.469> a<00:05:48.800> little<00:05:48.919> bit

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
just kind of moves around a little bit

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.740 
just kind of moves around a little bit
like<00:05:49.339> that

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
like that

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.230 
like that

where<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:09.830> just<00:06:09.979> want<00:06:10.190> to<00:06:10.279> use<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.610> you<00:06:10.849> know

where you just want to use it you know

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.040 
where you just want to use it you know
you<00:06:11.180> don't<00:06:11.389> want<00:06:11.539> to<00:06:11.599> do<00:06:11.719> a<00:06:11.750> bunch<00:06:11.960> of

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
you don't want to do a bunch of

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.689 
you don't want to do a bunch of
different<00:06:12.379> you<00:06:12.680> know<00:06:12.740> layers<00:06:13.069> you<00:06:13.339> just<00:06:13.550> want

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
different you know layers you just want

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.579 
different you know layers you just want
to<00:06:13.759> do<00:06:13.849> a<00:06:13.879> quick<00:06:14.180> foundation<00:06:15.110> this<00:06:15.259> can<00:06:15.469> be

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:15.589 
to do a quick foundation this can be

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:17.320 
to do a quick foundation this can be
used<00:06:15.770> for<00:06:16.009> that<00:06:16.219> so<00:06:16.520> I<00:06:16.550> think<00:06:16.669> it<00:06:16.879> has<00:06:17.000> a<00:06:17.060> lot<00:06:17.300> of

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
used for that so I think it has a lot of

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.649 
used for that so I think it has a lot of
different<00:06:17.569> per<00:06:17.870> hour<00:06:18.229> purposes<00:06:19.219> so<00:06:19.940> price<00:06:20.419> I'm

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659 
different per hour purposes so price I'm

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.180 
different per hour purposes so price I'm
going<00:06:20.839> to<00:06:20.930> say<00:06:21.050> is<00:06:21.169> kind<00:06:21.500> of<00:06:21.710> a<00:06:21.800> three<00:06:22.009> and<00:06:22.159> a

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
going to say is kind of a three and a

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.059 
going to say is kind of a three and a
half<00:06:22.370> out<00:06:22.610> of<00:06:22.669> five<00:06:23.349> it's<00:06:24.349> not<00:06:24.529> great<00:06:24.800> but<00:06:24.830> it's

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
half out of five it's not great but it's

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.670 
half out of five it's not great but it's
not<00:06:25.339> cheap<00:06:25.580> so<00:06:25.960> product<00:06:26.960> overall<00:06:27.259> this<00:06:27.469> is<00:06:27.529> a

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
not cheap so product overall this is a
