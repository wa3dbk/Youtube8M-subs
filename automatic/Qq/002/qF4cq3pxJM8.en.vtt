gonna<00:06:02.390> put<00:06:02.480> on<00:06:02.750> quite<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.110> bit<00:06:03.440> as<00:06:03.680> she<00:06:04.460> always

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
gonna put on quite a bit as she always

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.900 
gonna put on quite a bit as she always
has<00:06:05.840> these<00:06:06.380> eyelashes<00:06:07.190> that<00:06:07.370> stand<00:06:07.700> out
