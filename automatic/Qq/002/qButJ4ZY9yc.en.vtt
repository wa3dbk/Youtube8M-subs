00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.630 
than the Doritos Locos with peanut
butter<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.579> would<00:01:48.180> say<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:49.439> cheesy<00:01:49.829> burrito

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
butter I would say the cheesy burrito

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.280 
butter I would say the cheesy burrito
one<00:01:52.250> with<00:01:53.250> peanut<00:01:53.579> butter<00:01:53.610> I'd<00:01:54.479> give<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.990> 4

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
one with peanut butter I'd give it a 4

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.380 
one with peanut butter I'd give it a 4
out<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> 5<00:01:55.590> Matt<00:01:55.799> faces<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.700> really

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
out of 5 Matt faces that was really

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880 
out of 5 Matt faces that was really
really<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.350> was<00:01:58.439> quite<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.680> surprise

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
really good that was quite the surprise

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.850 
really good that was quite the surprise
but<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> guess<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:01.110> taco<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> only

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
but I guess because with taco the only

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.940 
but I guess because with taco the only
problem<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.280> had<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:03.570> literally<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
problem I had with it was literally the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
problem I had with it was literally the
shell<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.579> Dorito<00:02:05.880> flavoring<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.899> know

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
shell the Dorito flavoring so you know

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.419 
shell the Dorito flavoring so you know
the<00:02:07.320> ingredients<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> inside<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> did<00:02:08.250> like

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the ingredients on the inside I did like

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.740 
the ingredients on the inside I did like
so<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.670> guess<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.970> makes<00:02:09.119> sense<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.569> this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
so I guess it makes sense that this

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.870 
so I guess it makes sense that this
would<00:02:09.810> work<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> guys

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
would work so what do you guys

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.810 
would work so what do you guys
about<00:02:12.210> more<00:02:13.110> peanut<00:02:13.920> butters<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:14.460> stuff

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820

from like Taco Bell McDonald's we're
thinking<00:02:16.710> about<00:02:16.890> instead<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.090> doing

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
thinking about instead of just doing

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.660 
thinking about instead of just doing
stuff<00:02:18.630> from<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.990> past<00:02:19.200> we're<00:02:20.190> gonna<00:02:20.280> start

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
branching out and start doing it with

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.750 
branching out and start doing it with
more<00:02:22.410> things<00:02:22.650> from<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:22.950> fast-food<00:02:23.490> places
