00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 and if to retrain with victory well, victory 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.620
 stood out very nervous it is worthy 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.750
 the result is two checks or 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 I wanted something more but I wanted to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.299
 something more so judging by the game 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.660
 surely 30 enter miss victory in 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.060
 principle with a team that 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.920
 showed in the last game enough of them 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.080
 indecent bad sense of the word 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.210
 result but my attitude and of course 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 right now they say the league is dense 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.529
 so it all depends on the nuances and each 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.360
 match can be a new way 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.489
 that is, it is impossible to predict how everything 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.440
 will but again on the game and I think we 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.250
 owned an advantage of 30 have or had to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 bring calm and victory how would that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.360
 interesting after three feet this is a minute on 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.920
 35 there was a change 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.870
 the main reason for this fracture 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.680
 psychology yes yes it is in principle 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.739
 psychologically often this happens 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.550
 when 3050 lead and somehow 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.160
 subconsciously you start already 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.600
 calm down think about the next match 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.659
 it is clear that all professionals of this 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.369
 cannot be allowed 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.070
 just did not have to allow poison mashiba 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.140
 some ridiculous bosses or something else 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.560
 she was working out all defense from 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.900
 of the moment they will always be as if 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.229
 it says everything is normal to make beating 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.970
 angle and here's the command despite being removed 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.250
 in overtime showed very, very such 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.689
 good activity why it was impossible 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 well before 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.340
 in a row played by the game watched 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.000
 felt that is, first we had to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.880
 by popl remain in the minority but then 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.729
 already 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.750
 all the same already played and I think it is 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.829
 pride realized that after all we 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.600
 must have enough at home with their 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.720
 fans to win even twists 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.570
 or bullet no matter how you rate the game 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.259
 I can't do this 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.579
 if you can say so but nonetheless 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:06.069
 Well, of course it is necessary to score goals 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.869
 quite experienced and a link I think that but 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.950
 gray with time everything will come it only 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.450
 first matches and still some 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.650
 some other combinations 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.200
 don't work yet 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.019
 after which the goals are scored now 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.660
 only working on the system games 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.200
 let's say all the same I like the centerpiece 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.120
 I try to play more on defense goals I 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.329
 I think that during the season it's all 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.849
 In principle, there is no experience. 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.260
 yours will come from such a position 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.329
 an experienced hitter somewhere 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.160
 tell the young guys in the team 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.670
 the fact that this season a lot of young 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.950
 and not such experienced boilers of course 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.680
 will reduce the workflow in training 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.380
 discussion of some working moments 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.870
 there are enough of us in the team of experienced guys 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.410
 which you played very much and therefore 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.569
 I think that not only am I there very much 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.600
 and Oleg came out of the captain now Alexander 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.040
 glories it can be counted a lot and 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.260
 Deniska is only a tanos many defenders 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.109
 experienced who 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.109
 dialogue is ongoing dialogue at the level 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.109
 professionals
