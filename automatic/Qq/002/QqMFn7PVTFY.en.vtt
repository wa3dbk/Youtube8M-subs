 stupid and repulsed school players 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.579
 age in the game counter strike global 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:02.940
 offencive you can not wait to see 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:04.140
 then we start like this so let's 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 reconnoiter the situation 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.520
 today's video of our patient 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.250
 called as about shoot 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.890
 beginners vks goal I have a question right away 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.610
 what the fuck is it to show an approximate 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.159
 shooting 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.229
 we need accurate information and generally on 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.750
 who is this guide for servers 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.130
 because every silver can shoot 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.130
 well, about 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.860
 of course you play with bots and with whom 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.870
 still developers have created single-celled 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.870
 for single-celled here everything is logical 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.400
 no 7 lags 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.690
 backwards 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.690
 yellow so lags 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.310
 this butterfly 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.080
 you saw it saw immediately felt 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.840
 hand global or then i have an idea a 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.640
 let's read under his video I think 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.640
 one hundred percent forest comments 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.870
 Our little ring is playing with harmless bots 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.850
 I certainly understand that I wanted to remove the guide 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:45.540
 but so far there is not even a smell here 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:47.940
 i can you understand yes what's the salt he's not 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.350
 figured out the game myself but is already trying 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.290
 teach others something 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.680
 just didn't see this beam better 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.340
 only one man comes to mind 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.340
 there is a question 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:15.820
 just the beginning of summer houses to from hunger and cursing 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:18.720
 on the tips of the testament but from here 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.180
 look yes we shoot 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.840
 just like that let's say on the middle 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.620
 distances 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.620
 let's compress 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.840
 that 's what we get some 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.830
 another but to fix it look but not 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.830
 be sure to read 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.080
 so what 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:48.730
 well, what about the war 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.400
 look here if yes then we would immediately 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.880
 yes understand that no matter how well, that's because there is a 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.240
 what 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:02.740
 but what about them ? 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.750
 so as a lover of picking on trifles I 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.090
 could not help but notice that our patient 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.490

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.890

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.300
 by the way about how to shoot me 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.400
 for some reason I got the impression that I 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.400
 I look at the guide for killing harmless bots 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:08.350

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.480

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.490
 showed a maximum of one or two 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.980
 to friends because I was ashamed of that 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.620
