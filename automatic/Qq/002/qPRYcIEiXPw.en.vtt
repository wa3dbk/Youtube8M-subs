00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.799
 welcome to new zealand the only 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.740
 country in the world where we cross over 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.349
 sheep than inhabitants and yes they do 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.750
 50 million against only 4 million 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.490
 of New Zealand's emblem of the country 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.410
 sheep are essential to her 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.359
 economy the grounds are so 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.100
 vast that the farmers would be incapable 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.100
 to drive their flocks alone 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.070
 so to support them New Zealanders 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.239
 make use of two breeds of dogs of 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.379
 shepherds the border collie and ottawa 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.899
 these are dogs that work in 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.570
 team first gives direction 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.970
 the second very enduring gives the pace 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.649
 Too beautiful so it makes the job easier 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.780
 farmers like lloyds imagine going 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:57.379
 so far down foot you not 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.159
 really to teach these dogs 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.290
 how to guide 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.970
 lloyd has come up with a whole series of 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.009
 whistles each whistle indicates 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.280
 a command a different order for the 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.729
 his there he starts well 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.060
 understand 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.509
 for example the stop is his mission 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.250
 the dog stops on the side 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:27.020
 it's sure the left on the right 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:30.140
 Hence these markets there is when it should 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.040
 run towards the sheep yes each 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.040
 whistling has a meaning 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.890
 there he barks to introduce himself or early 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.970
 so they know which dog is going to care 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.970
 from them and guide them 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.030
 a little demonstration with this 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.890
 exercise the dogs must oblige the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.920
 struggles we borrowed the little bridge of 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.920
 wood 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:10.090
 more than a job 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:12.310
 of great art here is the star of animals 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.570
 New Zealander a big ball of feathers 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.110
 with a long beak 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.940
 the kiwi is the emblem of the country the kiwi 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.280
 is a bird that does not fly its wings 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.350
 are atrophied this family come from 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.390
 French Polynesia is delighted with the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.790
 meet saleh to be a calm animal 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.230
 as usual we see it we see it 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.880
 drawings of the pictures of 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.980
 silt representations of the kiwi so we 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.420
 do not know we do not know how to swim 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.560
 his clip we do not know how they are 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.500
 include if they run in all 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 meaning like the lucid pessey kagou of 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.810
 also steal the cost of living sweet it is 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.410
 hiding there we see a little bit 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.300
 how he behaves in his 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.900
 environment is selectable 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.900
 mistreated 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.650
 kiwis also have a bad eyesight 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.940
 but they have a keen sense of smell that 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.599
 which allows them to detect the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.489
 food with its long beak it goes 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.250
 look for the greens deep in the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.959
 soil we suck them eat them 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.430
 also like small invertebrates that 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.160
 are in the sheets of leaves 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.540
 it is estimated that there will be only 70 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.220
 kiwi miles in new zealand 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.349
 these birds are therefore threatened 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.299
 of extinction and yes as he does not fly 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.549
 difficult for them to defend themselves against 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.170
 predators 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.180
 their only defense is to give 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.440
 kicking you see their feet they 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.150
 have big claws of this size 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.130
 he kicks forward 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.959
 so they can hurt a lot but 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.690
 you can imagine that facing a dog 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.099
 they can not do much 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.209
 so they can run away 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.860
 it's really their defense room there 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.819
 ensures this great island many more 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.819
 extraordinary friends 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.640
 animals from the icy waters of 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.640
 south pole because new zealand is 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.260
 located near Antarctica 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.450
 suddenly thousands of penguins its 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.570
 penguins from the southern hemisphere landed at 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.980
 nightfall on the beaches 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.810
 every night tourists from around the world 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.460
 whole come to observe this colony 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.060
 of penguins 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.930
 some even made the move 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.850
 since paris it changes what we can 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.350
 see the habit of seeing them in a zoo 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.940
 it's really nice to sell them 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.650
 in boredom and natural ascension 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.230
 that they actually do every day to the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.340
 same time we wonder why 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.510
 how do they have a 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.530
 biological clock how do they know 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.350
 that they have to come back here every 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:38.640
 days they are packed by the sea 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.180
 it's these penguins are the smallest 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.550
 of the world 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.230
 they are barely thirty centimeters 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.120
 call them besides the penguins 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.530
 pygmy and if these little creatures 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.540
 withstands icy water 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.910
 it's thanks to their plumage that form 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.740
 a real carapace you can 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.680
 meet penguin colonies on 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.790
 most of New Zealand's coasts 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.410
 unfortunately the closeness with 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.480
 the man is sometimes very dangerous 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.820
 some are injured by propellers 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.270
 boat cars or even animals 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.270
 household 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.820
 their greatest protector lives in 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.169
 this pretty bay it will aca 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.169
 is called chagrine lpth 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.700
 the pygmy penguins 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.960
 naturally nestled on his property 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.960
 built by the sea 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.560
 there is in his game 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.570
 you may be able to see it there 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.830
 at 20 years old has noticed that the 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.290
 penguins was less and less 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.090
 many in his bay the reason the 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.190
 presence of many predators like 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.800
 ermines ferrets and opossums 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.390
 that it is decimated by thousands for us 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.700
 this place would not be the same without 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.680
 them this noise at night it's true that it 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.380
 sometimes prevents us from sleeping but this 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.300
 are so cute birds they deserve 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.300
 really all our protection
