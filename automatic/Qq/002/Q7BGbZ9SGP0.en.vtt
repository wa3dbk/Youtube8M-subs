00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:10.700
 hello today we are again in 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:14.870
 my YouTube channel is that I used to 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.910
 to give some class tutorials that 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.369
 before there was sugar 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.779
 decorations in tulle but today is something very 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.130
 simple 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.730
 I have friends who have their grandchildren and their 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 daughters take their children to daycare 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.500
 and the issue is that I saw that you do not let go 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.510
 my chocolates 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 or very elaborate cakes because there 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.829
 little ones who can not eat then they 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:49.219
 It happened that would go to make a 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:51.829
 a very simple job with clouds or a 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.010
 hype as they say in other countries and 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.729
 Well, it's very simple, I hope you 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.799
 like and that can take it to the 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.600
 daycare with more tranquility and that what 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.530
 enjoy doing with the same lines 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.689
 we are going to work 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.689
 [Applause] 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.509
 these are the chocolate clouds 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.189
 and in this case I have white and pink 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.530
 they can be all white or 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.409
 colors but what are we going to try 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.399
 do to also save a little bit 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.250
 it's when we buy the white clouds 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.679
 dye the different colors by 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.209
 example in this case I have yellow 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:40.710
 green pink and light blue the colors that 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:43.650
 I use myself in this case they are pasta 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.030
 used from wilton but they could also 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.240
 to use them from 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.159
 which also dilutes much better 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:57.700
 in water a few small skewers or 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.840
 big and just to dye the me 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.950
 I do not know if you see here some are new 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.950
 stained and dry 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.500
 they are multiple you will see that this rose 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.830
 constipated we are also going to do the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.180
 try and see it as we're practically going 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.970
 to catch a skewer always before 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.690
 introduce it in the cloud we are going to wet it 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.690
 with water 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:33.130
 in this way it is not going to break 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.150
 and the one that gives directly inserted then 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.150
 we will take a color 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.459
 the color that we want in this green case 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.750
 we will give you color 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.750
 we drain a little 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.470
 At the beginning, it's going to look like it has 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.530
 painted much notice that this is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.280
 Green we have spent here one 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.190
 once now it is already dry if we want a 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.450
 more intense color what we do is 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.450
 pass it again 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.160
 for its color and when the color dries 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.550
 will be much much firmer 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.370
 and more intense 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.610
 this is one of the ways we can 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.670
 decorate a cake for the little ones that 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.750
 they can not carry 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.230
 a lot of chocolate and sweet salt save it or 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.680
 at school and another interesting thing is 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.750
 that when we put our cakes on 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.739
 sweets 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.670
 in this case of clouds what is brocheta 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:50.069
 It is extremely dangerous for children 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.069
 what do we do in this case for example 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.160
 we will see 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.140
 a cloud we put a white light a cloud 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.560
 pink 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.100
 We will try to paste it as using the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.870
 cbc what good many people use it 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.280
 for do 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.190
 that lasers are more flexible or for 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.880
 I know it's faster we're going to dilute 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.280
 in a little bit of water only one 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.250
 little bit of smc 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.860
 we're going to beat it and I do not know if they can 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.040
 reach to see there that remains as a 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.040
 jelly 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.060
 this gelatin is going to make it stick 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.130
 and we're not going to take the risk that the 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.140
 time for children to take them 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.210
 jelly beans or just when they prepare 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.389
 a 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.729
 once to sweet at home and want to do 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.470
 an ornament that in another entry I will 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:55.360
 show them some 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.360
 skewers of a very nice bunny 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.240
 this sticks we're going to need some 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.790
 Minutitos so that it stays well and 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.440
 we do not need what is this that can 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:12.340
 harm children who can 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:16.570
 is to remove badly from the mouth and hurt 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.600
 for now this is what was something that 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.850
 it was interesting that you knew and that 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.610
 could apply with the little ones and 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:28.150
 by way of dyeing clouds 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.180
 see you in another tutorial where I'm going 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.340
 to explain how we are going to decorate them 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.770
 thank you for following us and see you in the 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.820
 Flower Art 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.820
 [Applause]
