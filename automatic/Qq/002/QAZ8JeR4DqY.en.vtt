00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi everyone today I you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.180
 present a small video that will 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.710
 allow access exo in dofus 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.880
 so this is a first on youtube and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.380
 This is why the software is c 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 free for the moment because it's 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.549
 a beta so for the world for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.549
 begin open dofus and login 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.359
 connect to the person who said m 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.900
 it is necessary that the person said m 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900
 only once 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.290
 once connected you can see that 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.190
 my name is beautiful, so it's a 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.910
 funny name I do generated I have a 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.310
 janot everything simple with go you can 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.920
 see here but this stage for example but 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:53.630
 forfend xp too so there you see 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.750
 that for me I have absolutely nothing to 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.410
 I share fire neck makes that worse 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:04.010
 so go on google went on 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.010
 the website www.virbac.com services 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.080
 in flash a welcome for html 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.690
 once on his sites so you can 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.900
 to see that it's a small fact fast and 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.010
 so here would have a video here the link of 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.229
 my youtube channel or do you 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.520
 can ask me questions and the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.050
 link of ace case where do you 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.840
 can also ask questions about 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.729
 on the software is everything so that's 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.830
 why did I do that so 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.509
 you click on download so there 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.460
 you can about contact for 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.960
 get my style all the way down the drain yet 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.590
 this remains so you click on 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.850
 Download 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.130
 so you see that I just made a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.550
 test to see if the software had been 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.020
 loaded well we click here and there 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.270
 you see that you have a folder 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.950
 in it so you put it on the desk 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.000
 opens to the controls on the desktop yes 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.130
 overtake replace place them in place 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.539
 and moved replace so here is 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.210
 now we can do but it pays a 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.500
 dropped it could see that the record 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.520
 is there normally you will have nothing to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.660
 overtaken in place and that's it 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.090
 simply because the goal is what 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.950
 I had done I was going to look if it's 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.149
 put well I tested the software there 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.220
 walk 3 % etc 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.170
 you open the software and there you see 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.160
 there are three things in it so that and that 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.580
 will not have to touch it 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.230
 and that's the software in question you 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.550
 see that it has a pretty basic design 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.620
 that you can put it in France and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.840
 is there and in English so these softwares 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.640
 and in English so I was saying why this 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.680
 than connect directly to the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.569
 account on the character or what to 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.880
 dawn I simply because they 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.140
 ask for the account name so 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.760
 normally they will make a bet 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.080
 day and will ask where do they go anymore 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.450
 asked for the account name but they will 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.170
 ask the character and the server 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.940
 but everyone counts 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.860
 I will not why they could not 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.300
 to do otherwise in my opinion so where 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.860
 you mark your world against me he 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.260
 will be blurred go to blur also on 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.590
 dofus for not that you see my account 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.599
 or if you want to do it again I'll do it 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.940
 not like you want me I do not care 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.170
 a bit just because it's 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.830
 a tale like that so you walk 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.110
 your account you choose it 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.700
 exhale you want so it has to be 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.319
 yoshi I forgot to specify in 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.080
 first line so this has to be 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.670
 he the first object of your inventory 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.709
 because he will select this object and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.050
 panels so there is another object he's going 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.760
 effect of the other others so I have that 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.220
 can be a friend a headdress a fear 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.739
 et cetera you can also put this 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.620
 perf is worried peace so there we see 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.840
 how the pm and just now I you 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.230
 will make a video for akyÃ© insolent 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.790
 defeated so absolutely clear the jets 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.230
 are at random when we created papn 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.790
 breath for young water or 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.840
 case caps the kama sutra friends and that's 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.670
 so once you click on 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.720
 hackett your account log you off the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.670
 loading time and you can 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.540
 still connected right after that so we 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.220
 will compel on worried you see well 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.370
 that the tale disconnects 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.370
 automatically 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.650
 and writes that he is disconnected 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.650
 unexpectedly so the loading time 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.020
 you see that it's a bit long when 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.910
 even simply because he is in 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.590
 train of which the gil to the water so I 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.110
 will explain later that we want 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.730
 so against your gelannes or from 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.070
 base you will no longer have by 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.330
 eg young and now the pap m 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.310
 so it's almost done so 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:31.170
 still a little bit I think a two 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:33.390
 three or three loads 2 bah I 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.920
 think it's good here are three classes 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:42.660
 you close software and you will 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:46.730
 reconnect once connected you go 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.730
 on your server your character 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.169
 you look in your engine and there 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:01.180
 you travel the noted m so this life 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.560
 short video is already over I'm going 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.939
 surely still do a fair 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:11.110
 appreciate the only one to miss rpm on the 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:13.270
 soil so and with ousse could also do 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.040
 on an i'm no 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.660
 I have plenty we can do 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.970
 anything so but when I 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.700
 absolutely only on my other character 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.750
 I will show you on the character so 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.090
 I'll see you soon 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.210
 do not forget that this is the cycle and 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.620
 only this site that offers 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.900
 software so there will be full full 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.880
 written everywhere the name of the site for not 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.730
 I'm stung video so it's dave 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.780
 mc point alter vista points bang 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.980
 flash html how developed so design 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.840
 it will be changed simply because 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.860
 that here he is going to see the video that is going to be 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.620
