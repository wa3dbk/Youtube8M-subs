most of my cooking life and I started

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.290 
most of my cooking life and I started
cooking<00:00:21.270> pretty<00:00:21.480> young<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.020> why<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> feel<00:00:23.609> it's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
cooking pretty young and why I feel it's

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.269

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
so important to me is that I feel it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.370 
so important to me is that I feel it
reflects<00:00:26.910> real<00:00:27.210> life<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> kitchen<00:00:28.230> which

reflect that so there are recipes that I

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
reflect that so there are recipes that I
cook<00:01:17.549> particularly<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:18.780> children<00:01:19.350> and

my mother and also that I cook with my
sisters<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> very

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
sisters and all of this is very

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.060 
sisters and all of this is very
important<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.990> way<00:01:31.020> how<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.650> cook

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
important because in a way how we cook

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.940 
important because in a way how we cook
is<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.579> are<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.240> how<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.390> live<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> what's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
is how we are and how we live and what's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920 
is how we are and how we live and what's
really<00:01:35.369> central<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.299> think<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.900> that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
really central to that I think is that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.770 
really central to that I think is that
real<00:01:37.619> cooking<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.220> home<00:01:38.430> life<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> kitchen

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
real cooking at home life in the kitchen

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
real cooking at home life in the kitchen
is<00:01:39.930> about<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> leftover<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.400> wherever

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
is about the leftover so wherever

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420 
is about the leftover so wherever
appropriate<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.530> got<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> little<00:01:43.950> note<00:01:44.250> at

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
appropriate I have got a little note at

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.980 
appropriate I have got a little note at
the<00:01:44.520> end<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> recipe<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.720> called
