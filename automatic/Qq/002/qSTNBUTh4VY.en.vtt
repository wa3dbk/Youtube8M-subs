00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.400 

with<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.730> quick<00:02:37.940> walk<00:02:38.209> around

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.830 

I<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.250> my<00:02:45.400> video<00:02:45.760> camera<00:02:46.150> equipment<00:02:46.810> in

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
I do have my video camera equipment in

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.300 
I do have my video camera equipment in
the<00:02:46.960> back<00:02:47.200> but<00:02:47.530> we'll<00:02:47.740> give<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.010> quick<00:02:48.160> look

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
the back but we'll give you a quick look

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.400 
the back but we'll give you a quick look
at<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.520> interior<00:02:48.900> what<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:49.930> thought<00:02:50.170> might<00:02:50.380> be

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
at the interior what I thought might be

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.380 
at the interior what I thought might be
interesting<00:02:50.530> would<00:02:51.430> be<00:02:51.460> to<00:02:51.670> put<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.940> top<00:02:52.150> up

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
interesting would be to put the top up

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.480 
interesting would be to put the top up
and<00:02:52.510> down<00:02:52.750> since<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.260> does<00:02:53.470> its<00:02:53.680> job<00:02:53.800> really

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
and down since it does its job really

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.510 
and down since it does its job really
really<00:02:54.700> well<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.710> we'll<00:02:56.710> do<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.860> quick<00:02:57.070> video<00:02:57.220> of

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
really well so we'll do a quick video of

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:17.710 
really well so we'll do a quick video of
that

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.540 

the<00:03:18.200> top<00:03:18.410> has<00:03:18.620> been

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.430 

down<00:03:22.180> for<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.540> while<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:22.930> that's<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.230> little

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
down for a while so that's a little

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.010 
down for a while so that's a little
wrinkles<00:03:23.770> on<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.190> when<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.780> when<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.900> is

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
wrinkles on it but when the when it is

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.360 
wrinkles on it but when the when it is
up<00:03:26.230> in<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.470> Sun<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.830> says<00:03:26.980> straighten<00:03:27.220> out

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
up in the Sun it says straighten out

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.650 
up in the Sun it says straighten out
this<00:03:27.520> doesn't<00:03:27.820> have<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:27.970> very<00:03:28.240> desirable

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
this doesn't have the very desirable

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.770 
this doesn't have the very desirable
glass<00:03:28.990> window<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.770> this<00:03:29.980> was<00:03:30.250> done<00:03:30.780> very

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
glass window in it this was done very

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.720 
glass window in it this was done very
very<00:03:32.110> few<00:03:32.320> miles<00:03:32.560> ago<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.070> top<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.550> very

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
very few miles ago the top is in very

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.650 
very few miles ago the top is in very
nice<00:03:33.970> shape

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
nice shape

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.450 
nice shape
we're<00:03:35.650> not<00:03:35.740> even<00:03:35.890> we're<00:03:36.040> not<00:03:36.130> going<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.340> bother

we're not even we're not going to bother

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.580 
we're not even we're not going to bother
to<00:03:36.760> latch<00:03:37.360> this<00:03:37.600> but<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.900> does<00:03:38.050> latch<00:03:38.260> very

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
to latch this but it does latch very

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.880
