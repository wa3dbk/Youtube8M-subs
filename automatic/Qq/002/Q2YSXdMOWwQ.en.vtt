00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.560
 of course yes children let me tell you the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.440
 history was finishing naming 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.350
 all the animals of creation and the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.200
 beautiful birds of our god when 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 I suddenly noticed something very special every 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.740
 animal was with his partner the cow 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.500
 I was with the bull the rooster was with 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.610
 the hen even the burrito could 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.340
 be with a donkey 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.970
 everyone seemed to have a partner and they were very 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.120
 happy but for me there was no 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.580
 partner there was not a creature or a being 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.910
 with characteristics similar to those 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.780
 mine whom I could love and from whom 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.110
 I could feel loved then I started 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.300
 to feel a deep sleep so deep 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.300
 that I was falling asleep 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.900
 It is not good that the man should be alone you 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.320
 I'm going to make someone who is a help 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.320
 right for him 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.720
 Man was not created to live 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.530
 in solitude he had to have a 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.450
 sociable nature without company 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.080
 beautiful scenes and the lovely ones 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.540
 occupations of Eden could not have 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.850
 provide you with perfect happiness even the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.220
 communion with the angels would not have 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.819
 been able to satisfy his desire for sympathy and 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.819
 company 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.849

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.729
 We will spend our family in love and 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:22.520
 in the happiness that comes from God already 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.490

 so that we share all this love that 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.539
 he has given us our days in 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.940
 our earth will be full of 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.940
 happiness of joy and love 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:53.930

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:57.860
 from you the way she will be your partner 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.650
 collaborator your ideal help will be the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:06.240
 mother of all your descendants 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.509

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.860

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:19.639
 joy that you long for I like your father 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.639
 and your god I give you as your wife 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.930
 God himself solemnly celebrated the 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.139
 first marriage eba as daughter of god 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.770
 and how her father brought her to Adam and the 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.159
 presented therefore the marriage is 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.470
 appropriately called the union of God 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.860
 this teaches us that god was the author of 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.229
 that sacred institution the marriage 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.659
 children what do you think if we go to the 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.220
 hill that special hill from where 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.889
 you see the whole garden of Eden 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.169
 I promise to show you the specific place 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.449
 where our god united us in 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:00.240
 marriage to his mother and to me they think 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.240
 they 're going to get revenge over here 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:16.029
 look children there was where I met his 

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:19.509
 father we fell in love and his father promised 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:22.989
 love me for life from that one 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:25.509
 moment children we decided to be together by 

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:27.960
 always until the lord calls us at 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:31.740
 break 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:35.039
 and when I grow up I'm hunting in a 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.500
 place as beautiful as that and your father who 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.060
 you felt when you first saw 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.580
 Havana 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.860
 that's when I understood the great 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.960
 love of our god who had 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.810
 contemplated all the details of his 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.050
 creation and I knew when it was time 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:56.550
 precise to give me the best gift of 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:07:00.080
 all a tender loving wife and very 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:04.280
 beautiful and next to her you and me 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.280
 We will be very happy
