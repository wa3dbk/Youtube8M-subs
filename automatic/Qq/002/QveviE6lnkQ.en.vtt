a story this time I'm not making this up
I<00:01:01.440> heard<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.010> know<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.430> alpha<00:01:02.699> TV<00:01:03.030> he

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
I heard this you know from alpha TV he

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.640 
I heard this you know from alpha TV he
pushed<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.320> frozen<00:01:05.280> car<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> fight<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.500> he

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
pushed the frozen car to a fight so he

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.120 
pushed the frozen car to a fight so he
had<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> fight<00:01:08.159> come<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> will

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
had a fight come on go get in the will

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.240 
had a fight come on go get in the will
the<00:01:11.130> gas<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:12.060> frozen<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.619> guess<00:01:13.950> he

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the gas is this frozen so I guess he

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.820 
the gas is this frozen so I guess he
just<00:01:14.280> takes<00:01:14.640> his<00:01:14.729> gear<00:01:15.060> officer<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.229> I'm

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
just takes his gear officer and I'm

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
just takes his gear officer and I'm
thinking<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.909> he<00:01:17.970> make<00:01:18.240> any<00:01:18.270> sense<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.049> then

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
thinking as he make any sense but then

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
thinking as he make any sense but then
again<00:01:19.430> would<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> look<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:20.939> the
