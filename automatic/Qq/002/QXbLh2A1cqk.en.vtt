00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello welcome to mayday 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.389
 I'm mine and we're going in today 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.190
 lemon moni muffins are wonderful 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.719
 nice for the hot weather out there 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.250
 refreshing and delicious 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 you may know one or the other 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.140
 even from starbucks I personally only 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.170
 you totally and I have a wonderful 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.730
 recipe for that maybe even more 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.240
 a bit longer than that of 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.949
 starbucks 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.910
 For that we take the sugar first 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.410
 details as always below in the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.590
 infobox and writing of 2 organic lemons 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 The peel down and knead that then 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.460
 too much sugar together 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.090
 and the shell that smells good 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.570
 developed and it mixed so well 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.570
 zuzulangen 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.710
 when rubbing not too long on one 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.690
 stay put because the white under the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.130
 peel is very bitter and we want 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.130
 really only have the top layer 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.860
 it smells so good the sugar now has 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.780
 wonderful that customers of the lemons 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.600
 seemingly accepted and now we can 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.700
 continue and now take the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.260
 other dry ingredients and do that 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.260
 and mix it all together 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.960
 ready mix we put now short 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.880
 on the side and take us the liquid 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.040
 ingredients 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:43.070
 For that we take the butter first 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:46.190
 and beat the nice creamy slow 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.530
 the eggs to the lemon juice and the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.830
 my exact and of course the sour 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.830
 say 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.590
 Now we take our liquid 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.930
 mix and do the slow to the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.760
 Mix and stir 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.470
 lower level and not too long 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.050
 stir like the others after the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.640
 Recipes too that is just everything 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.450
 is noted otherwise that will be enough 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.450
 muffins namely hard 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.990
 the dough is finished so delicious 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.900
 Lemon and now I take with two 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.920
 always double up dough and do that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.340
 problem in my power so it does not 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.340
 very rich 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.030
 I hope you have the oven before 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.770
 the hai 280 degrees 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.460
 now that's all for 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.920
 about 18 minutes in there even products 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.200
 as always with the wooden footbridge here 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.090
 then right up to the muffins and ready 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.890
 and now ready made cool 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.350
 we have a little ice on top 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.900
 that makes it perfect for that 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.050
 Let's just live brother sugar and brother 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.180
 lemon juice and stir it up like that 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:40.440
 the consistency and hectic and one 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:42.810
 not only play around a bit now 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.020
 a spoon and that does not spit you 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.400
 is full and then I welcome that 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.400
 Ice cream then now about the muffins 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.530
 so the whole thing looks finished from that 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.230
 then, of course, one gets stuck 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.760
 in a few minutes but find it completely 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.250
 nice, even if it is one way 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.900
 you want to run down a bit 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.480
 Now you can sprinkle the moon on it 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.120
 to decorate or you just can 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.979
