 friends hello in this review we 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.290
 Consider a compact motherboard 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.420
 mini-itx format with integrated 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.550
 continuing acquaintance with maternal 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.050
 boards with integrated 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.300
 intel quad core processor 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.750
 celeron jay 1900 we talk about 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.180
 compact model asus jay 1907 format 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 Mini IT x In addition to the dimensions, it is profitable 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 different set of ports 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.550

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.399
 voltage of 135 volts and the ability 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.270
 work in dual channel mode 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 maximum volume should not 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.170
 exceed 8 gigabytes dynamic 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 the frequency of the integrated graphics core and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 in finishing the schedule is 854 megahertz 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.950
 The composition of this jeep and enters 4 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.240

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.560
 made to match the device itself 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.030
 very compact dimensions however 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.799
 it is very deep 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.930

 on opposite sides of the radiator 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.740
 the remaining connectors and ports are located 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.149
 closer to the edges of the PCB as a result

 following temperature readings 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.920
 demonstrated results say 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.600
 to us about what is preinstalled 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.769
 passive cooling system is great 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.959

 are carried out on 2 wet scheme for 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.330
 computational cores and additional 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.680
 nodes to extend functionality 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.600
 models have users in 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.330
 only two slots available

 11g 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.290
 and the audio subsystem is based on 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.230
 8-channel wait codecs 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.720
 realtek alc887 which supports 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.310
 audio systems up to 71

 the port 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.450
 the possibility of organizing cooling 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.700
 inside the payment system case is quite 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.440
 standard for format change x to 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.299
 2 4-pin connectors available for 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.160
 fan connections one of which 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.630
 used for the processor cooling system 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.500
 while the second is for 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.500
 system turntables 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.950
 We are considering a motherboard 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.930
 used times before loader on 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.490
 GUI based uefi 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.380
 make settings in which you can 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.540
 with the mouse he offers two 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.710
 main usage scenario and z mod 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.750
 which all the necessary settings 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.700
 grouped on one screen either 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.440
 the usual advance mod where all the settings 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.210
 must be made manually on 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.739
 dns tab located tools 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.570
 which are designed to optimize 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.250
 main component performance 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.900
 systems can also choose volume 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.760
 RAM and allocated for 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.250
 need a graphics subsystem down to 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.750
 512 megabytes by test results 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.420
 integrated intel celeron processor 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.980
 j 1900 demonstrate far from record 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.300
 performance however indicators 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.130
 will be quite comfortable for 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.870
 everyday work of course he 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.250
 inferior to low-voltage intel core 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.540
 however, do not forget that this 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.310
 model and not positioned as 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.200
 super powerful solution so you can 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.760
 make a very clear conclusion if you 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.800
 plan to pass the time though 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.540
 over the centuries either by the modern power game 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.260
 This processor for this will be clearly 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.850
 not enough 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.200
 however for multimedia system 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.180
 whose key task will be 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.160
 video playback new 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.870
 will be a very worthy choice 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.610
 same advantages asus motherboard 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.230
 jay 1906 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.490
 is energy efficiency when 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.320
 maximum load using 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.330
 stress tests the whole system consumed not 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.260
 more than 30 its which is one of 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.260
 best results 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.590
 motherboard asus j 1907 is 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.150
 well balanced device 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.830
 which is perfect for solving 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.270
 a series of defined tasks key 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.590
 advantage is the presence 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.440
 integrated quad 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.210
 intel celeron j 1900 processor it 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.770
 stands out for high foot efficiency and 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.780
 no need for active 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.720
 the whole cooling system is maternal 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.160
 the asus jay 1907 board is very 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.690
 interesting and really good 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
