pushed out from this nice square but at
the<00:02:45.530> same<00:02:45.740> time<00:02:46.720> why<00:02:47.720> does<00:02:48.100> plenty<00:02:49.100> of<00:02:49.190> ideas

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the same time why does plenty of ideas

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.630 
the same time why does plenty of ideas
to<00:02:49.610> get<00:02:50.390> through<00:02:50.690> so<00:02:51.680> it's<00:02:51.890> better<00:02:52.070> if<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.430> keep

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
to get through so it's better if I keep

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.520

the<00:02:52.790> works<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.209> course<00:02:53.450> but<00:02:53.810> even<00:02:54.200> if<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.470> don't

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the works of course but even if I don't

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.550 
the works of course but even if I don't
I<00:02:54.980> might<00:02:55.310> push<00:02:55.670> my<00:02:56.450> pawns<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.080> Kings<00:02:57.319> side

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
I might push my pawns on the Kings side

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.080 
I might push my pawns on the Kings side
and<00:02:57.950> someone<00:02:58.880> get<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> break<00:02:59.630> school<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.910> of

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
and someone get a break school but of

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.570 
and someone get a break school but of
course<00:03:02.300> my<00:03:02.360> first<00:03:02.690> plan<00:03:02.930> was<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:04.190> keep<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
course my first plan was to keep the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.410 
course my first plan was to keep the
hopes<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.000> keep<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.570> pressure<00:03:05.810> going

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
hopes and keep the pressure going

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.130 
hopes and keep the pressure going
because<00:03:08.420> for<00:03:08.600> instance<00:03:08.630> say<00:03:09.350> if<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.590> play<00:03:09.830> ok<00:03:10.820> 8

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
because for instance say if I play ok 8

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.949 
because for instance say if I play ok 8
the<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.620> we<00:03:12.739> get<00:03:13.180> exactly<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:15.590> position

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
the that we get exactly this position

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.530 
the that we get exactly this position
where<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:19.519> might<00:03:19.550> wonder<00:03:19.970> if<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.360> a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
where you might wonder if it's a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.920 
where you might wonder if it's a
fortress<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:22.900> critical<00:03:23.900> position

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
fortress so this is a critical position

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.290 
fortress so this is a critical position
like<00:03:26.930> i<00:03:27.110> said<00:03:27.170> no<00:03:27.800> i<00:03:28.100> will<00:03:28.370> just<00:03:28.550> pull<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.030> pond

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
like i said no i will just pull the pond

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.840 
like i said no i will just pull the pond
on<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.510> king<00:03:29.840> site<00:03:30.080> but<00:03:30.410> at<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.459> same<00:03:31.640> time

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
on the king site but at the same time

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.449 
on the king site but at the same time
making<00:03:32.510> cannot<00:03:33.160> coerce<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:35.690> III<00:03:36.200> or<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:37.040> v<00:03:37.250> or

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
making cannot coerce so III or this v or

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.770 
making cannot coerce so III or this v or
c<00:03:37.489> 3<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:39.010> then<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.220> four<00:03:40.700> also<00:03:41.000> is<00:03:41.540> not

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
c 3 and then a four also is not

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.470 
c 3 and then a four also is not
available<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:42.620> they<00:03:42.650> can<00:03:42.950> cannot<00:03:43.280> go<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.239> the

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
available so they can cannot go to the

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.289 
available so they can cannot go to the
Queen<00:03:44.780> side<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:46.250> my<00:03:46.489> only<00:03:46.670> plan<00:03:46.970> will<00:03:47.120> be<00:03:47.180> to

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
Queen side so my only plan will be to

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.470 
Queen side so my only plan will be to
put<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.750> ponds<00:03:47.989> but<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:49.310> definitely<00:03:50.030> not

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
put the ponds but it's definitely not

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.870 
put the ponds but it's definitely not
sure<00:03:50.690> it's<00:03:50.930> enough<00:03:51.079> for<00:03:51.260> one

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.750 

but<00:03:55.280> him<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.700> thought<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:58.080> know<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:59.280> not<00:03:59.490> so

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
but him I thought you know it's not so

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.230 
but him I thought you know it's not so
easy<00:03:59.790> to<00:04:00.330> make<00:04:00.630> a<00:04:00.960> move<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.550> at<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
easy to make a move because and at the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.110 
easy to make a move because and at the
same<00:04:03.390> time<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.660> will<00:04:03.930> just<00:04:04.580> add<00:04:05.580> some<00:04:05.640> point

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
same time I will just add some point

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.060 
same time I will just add some point
push<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.570> King<00:04:06.870> side<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.440> create<00:04:07.860> some

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
time and this another thing is that I

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.800 
time and this another thing is that I
can't<00:05:26.790> wait<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.000> h5<00:05:27.570> in<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:28.020> case<00:05:28.260> and

our<00:07:03.469> running<00:07:03.919> it's<00:07:04.460> not<00:07:04.639> time<00:07:04.820> for<00:07:04.849> a<00:07:05.360> definite

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900

conclusion<00:07:06.530> in<00:07:07.099> this<00:07:07.340> position<00:07:07.849> but<00:07:08.120> i<00:07:08.500> would

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
conclusion in this position but i would

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.820 
conclusion in this position but i would
definitely<00:07:09.770> feel<00:07:10.070> fancy<00:07:10.310> my<00:07:10.580> chances<00:07:10.610> and<00:07:11.830> but

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
definitely feel fancy my chances and but

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.709 
definitely feel fancy my chances and but
now<00:07:13.070> of<00:07:13.099> course<00:07:13.490> I'm<00:07:13.789> not<00:07:14.000> going<00:07:14.240> upon<00:07:14.509> them

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:14.719
