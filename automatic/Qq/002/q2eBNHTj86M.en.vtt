00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
migrate the database to in our case we

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.610 
migrate the database to in our case we
will<00:00:50.110> be<00:00:50.140> migrating<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.800> SQL<00:00:51.280> Server<00:00:51.610> 2008

will be migrating to SQL Server 2008
with<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:53.830> done<00:00:54.070> you<00:00:54.220> have<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.520> add<00:00:54.640> the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
with that done you have to add the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.000 
with that done you have to add the
database<00:00:55.090> which<00:00:55.420> has<00:00:55.630> to<00:00:55.780> be<00:00:55.900> converted<00:00:56.379> click

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
to continue with the process in the next

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.580 
to continue with the process in the next
step<00:01:04.150> you<00:01:04.510> can<00:01:04.540> select<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.050> objects<00:01:05.500> to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
step you can select the objects to

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.770 
step you can select the objects to
migrate<00:01:05.950> for<00:01:06.520> this<00:01:06.640> tutorial<00:01:07.150> let's<00:01:07.570> leave

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
migrate for this tutorial let's leave

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780 
migrate for this tutorial let's leave
this<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.020> default<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:08.710> hit<00:01:08.950> next<00:01:09.130> since<00:01:09.670> we

this to default and hit next since we

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.490 
this to default and hit next since we
will<00:01:09.880> be<00:01:09.940> migrating<00:01:10.480> the<00:01:10.570> whole<00:01:10.750> database<00:01:11.140> in

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
will be migrating the whole database in

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.649 
will be migrating the whole database in
the<00:01:12.310> next<00:01:12.520> window<00:01:12.730> we<00:01:12.850> will<00:01:13.060> have<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.360> create<00:01:13.540> a

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
the next window we will have to create a

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.080 
the next window we will have to create a
connection<00:01:14.050> with<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.440> SQL<00:01:14.950> Server<00:01:15.220> provide

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
connection with the SQL Server provide

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.610 
connection with the SQL Server provide
the<00:01:16.270> server's<00:01:16.600> name<00:01:16.810> which<00:01:17.200> in<00:01:17.350> this<00:01:17.440> case

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
the server's name which in this case

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.440 
the server's name which in this case
will<00:01:17.800> be<00:01:17.860> local<00:01:18.310> since<00:01:18.640> it<00:01:18.760> is<00:01:18.850> installed<00:01:19.330> on

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
will be local since it is installed on

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.210 
will be local since it is installed on
the<00:01:19.570> same<00:01:19.750> machine<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.320> specified<00:01:21.100> the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
the same machine and specified the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.250 
the same machine and specified the
database<00:01:21.610> name<00:01:21.880> if<00:01:22.120> you<00:01:22.720> want<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.960> create<00:01:23.170> a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
database name if you want to create a

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.290 
database name if you want to create a
new<00:01:23.470> database<00:01:23.650> just<00:01:24.430> type<00:01:24.670> its<00:01:24.880> name<00:01:24.940> over

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
new database just type its name over

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.760 
new database just type its name over
here<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.870> wizard<00:01:26.140> will<00:01:26.260> automatically

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
here and the wizard will automatically

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.190 
here and the wizard will automatically
create<00:01:27.010> it<00:01:27.340> with<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:28.030> done<00:01:28.300> simply<00:01:28.870> click<00:01:29.080> on

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
create it with that done simply click on

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.650 
create it with that done simply click on
next<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.400> conversion<00:01:30.760> process<00:01:30.910> will<00:01:31.420> begin

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
next the conversion process will begin

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.150 
next the conversion process will begin
after<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.620> will<00:01:32.710> take<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> few

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
after that and it will take a few

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.880 
after that and it will take a few
seconds<00:01:33.610> for<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.760> process<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.330> complete

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
seconds for the process to complete

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.250 
seconds for the process to complete
once<00:01:36.580> done<00:01:36.820> simply<00:01:37.450> close<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.810> migration

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
once done simply close the migration

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.800 
once done simply close the migration
wizard<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.710> open<00:01:38.980> up<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.280> SQL<00:01:39.790> Server<00:01:40.090> now

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
wizard and open up the SQL Server now

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.150 
wizard and open up the SQL Server now
you<00:01:40.870> will<00:01:41.050> notice<00:01:41.230> a<00:01:41.410> new<00:01:41.590> database<00:01:41.860> has

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
you will notice a new database has
