00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 for alice lovers in the land of the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.319
 wonders 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.319
 I created a cut out of my mind 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.670
 ideal for carnival 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.460
 if someone usually gets lasagna 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.150
 ideal because almost immediately after June 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.150
 now sachs 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.509
 crazy heart I called you see here 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.640
 it seems that this is what happened 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.010
 but it is a heart that is practically a heart up 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.949
 a head in the sense here we leave the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.960
 length of the hair and we cut it into 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:47.059
 to form a heart and a heart 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.949
 because usually the press room man is 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.230
 more roxy in reverse and we must 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:57.160
 let the length leave first 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.160
 then and a half 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:06.410
 let's leave hair that 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:11.390
 there were in the sense we do the part 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:14.119
 of the initial heart no that does so and so 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.580
 to contract it looks like an ass but you see 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.759
 that there is hair under these 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.470
 lyre hair we were also from 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.340
 these parts neither without drawing 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.429
 practically a heart you also see 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:35.060
 behind this final part of the heart 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:42.349
 this is longer it is then shaved here 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:50.090
 however, with a length of 15 mm e 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:53.239
 so if we do a 25 mm we can 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.420
 do it very well even machine in 

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:59.750
 sense or even ford yes why 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.599
 capable then here important than behind 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.849
 must follow one here has not been done 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:07.099
 at best, however , the design follows 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.440
 above ok so it must end 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:14.360
 still practically even the head here 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:20.650
 the color as I did intense red 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:24.050
 above decolored under ok that is a bit 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.520
 that white but not platinum white 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.000
 maximum of white pro 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.560
 a little yellow ok so there is the yellow red 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.020
 makes the dish much more carnival 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.670
 here is the alice cut of the cards 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.540
 of alice in wonderland 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.810
 here it is difficult I want to say that it is here 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.430
 difficult because you have to leave this 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.080
 length then blend here in the middle 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.450
 so be careful because it could also 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.810
 do not even take into account the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.630
 retrosi not come to the best but must 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.020
 in short, to commit oneself with one's own cut 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.020
 crazy and achievable
