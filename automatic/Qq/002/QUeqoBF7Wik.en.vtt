00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.859 
stage so it makes sense yeah you have to
dip<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.400> time<00:02:01.579> up<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:02.000> dear<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.390> are<00:02:02.420> timing

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
dip is to time up you dear we are timing

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.270 
dip is to time up you dear we are timing
here

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.840

recovery<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.519> incredibly<00:02:49.769> see<00:02:50.769> that's<00:02:51.280> one<00:02:51.430> of

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
recovery is incredibly see that's one of

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.880 
recovery is incredibly see that's one of
those<00:02:51.550> classic<00:02:51.760> like<00:02:52.330> off<00:02:53.050> for<00:02:53.440> stalking<00:02:53.680> you

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
those classic like off for stalking you

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.220 
those classic like off for stalking you
but<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> kind<00:02:54.550> let<00:02:54.790> up<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.120> then<00:02:55.390> somehow

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
but then a kind let up and then somehow

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.270 
but then a kind let up and then somehow
it<00:02:56.680> becomes<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.519> sock<00:02:57.760> some<00:02:58.030> say<00:02:58.900> face<00:02:59.280> yeah

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
it becomes a to sock some say face yeah

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.160 
it becomes a to sock some say face yeah
I<00:03:00.580> guess<00:03:01.180> it's<00:03:01.390> good<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> he<00:03:01.750> let<00:03:01.930> off<00:03:01.959> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
I guess it's good that he let off the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.660 
I guess it's good that he let off the
steam<00:03:02.440> right<00:03:02.680> there<00:03:02.920> instead<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.430> the
