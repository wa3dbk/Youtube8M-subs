00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
maybe I'll do that maybe I won't maybe

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.860 
maybe I'll do that maybe I won't maybe
I'll<00:02:28.550> try<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.820> may<00:02:29.180> be<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.420> one<00:02:29.540> may<00:02:29.810> be

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
I'll try this may be the one may be

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.630 
I'll try this may be the one may be
alone<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.380> quite<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.620> long<00:02:30.740> but<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.160> wanted
