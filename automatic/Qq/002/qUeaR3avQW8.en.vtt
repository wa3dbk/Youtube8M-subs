00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.620
 hello youtube friends today in this video 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.510
 we'll talk about the subtlety rogue 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.850
 warning is only a guide for the 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.840
 glyphs talents and skills that should 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.340
 have according to my good looks let's start 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.530
 first of all the guide is based on 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.780
 level 90 on the private server of the 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.969
 pandas and 5.0 point 5 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.309
 well first let's start with why 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.289
 we choose the specialization of subtlety 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.480
 with our character and the reasons are 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.399
 because the rogue of subtlety is the only 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.039
 that does not require payments to use their 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.769
 attacks that is to say we could equip the 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.780
 swords axes clubs fist weapons and 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.909
 daggers and we could continue to use all 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.699
 our attacks except for one single 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.739
 attack that would be stabbed that's a 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.019
 advantage because the daggers is the weapon that 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.790
 less damage does it even though they all have the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.780
 same attack speed and I think the 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.420
 same durability 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.369
 next we will observe that our 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.500
 Stab attack requires pay for 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.330
 can use it against our goal 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.009
 enemy but let's look at our first 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.229
 attack and we will see that it does not put us 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.240
 conditions for use that is is 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.479
 usable with any type of weapon of a 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.479
 hand 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.870
 now let's continue with the talents that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.880
 we must have for the rogue of subtlety 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.040
 our first talent should be 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 Focus on the shadows as it reduces us 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.970
 the total energy cost of our 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.160
 stealth skills while the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.380
 two other options one allows us 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.510
 increase our speed by 20% 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.490
 being in stealth and the other makes 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.290
 our stealth breaks three seconds 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.740
 after making our first attack 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740
 in stealth 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.280
 then I will make a proof that if 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.350
 it reduces our energy cost in 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.630
 our skills in stealth first 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.179
 let's look at our energy this lights 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.130
 100 now I'll set a goal 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.049
 we will also see that he does not ask for cost of 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.030
 energy to use this skill on 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.630
 an enemy objective to which we want 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.630
 attack him 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.790
 well I have killed him in one stroke for 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.840
 the level difference between him 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.840
 and I xdddd 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.540
 or what a pity his booty has not given me a 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.420
 xdddd fuck we see that our energy 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.860
 still intact well let's continue with the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.590
 guide of our talents 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.599
 character our second talent 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.640
 should be a blow to the nerve because if 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.409
 we hit a blow to the kidneys or a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.560
 low blow we reduce the attack of 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.120
 our enemy goal 50% this we 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.829
 It will be very useful when it comes to fighting 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.599
 against an enemy of the faction 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.750
 contrary to us or in a duel 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.750
 friendly 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.250
 in the third talent of our 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.110
 character we should have poison for 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.090
 Yes, because as we all know, 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.340
 rogue only heals with our spell 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.650
 recover and we need combos points 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.930
 to use it this talent will serve 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.630
 to heal 10% of what we remove 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.790
 to our enemy 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.500
 next we will use our 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.350
 If tante poison to see what 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.420
 that we are all cured we know that 10% 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.070
 It's not crap but something serves us 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.810
 to keep us in combat against 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.140
 our enemy as it covers little or 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.120
 much will serve as something okay sorry 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.800
 that is that the server fell and it touched me 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.720
 pause the video and hope that what 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.300
 open to continue with the video of 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.370
 our rogue guide as you said 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.490
 we will use poison for it to 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.650
 to see what cures while xdddd 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.720
 I am fighting with the enemy you will notice 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.500
 that I start to heal as you see is not 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.420
 a lot so it's 10% xdddd as already 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.340
 They saw me healing, it has not been that much 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.080
 For these reasons, in my opinion, it is a 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.730
 talent since it will serve us well to the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.950
 time to fight against enemies 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.450
 difficult and it will also be annoying to 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.640
 them because they can not kill us 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.640
 quickly as they want hahahaha 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.760
 our next talent would recommend 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.790
 speed burst because it increases us 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.280
 the speed 70% for 4 seconds 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.650
 It has a cost of 60 energy points 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.450
 but if we are in stealth and we use it not 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.820
 it will cost us energy but the consequence 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.890
 it will be that stealth will fade away and not 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.750
 we can use our attacks in stealth 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.550
 right away, we would have to 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.410
 wait for stealth to recharge 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.320
 again to use a skill in 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.060
 stealth also this skill is very 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.070
 useful because it takes away the effects of 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.050
 movement reduction that we put a 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.820
 enemy and it would also be another spell of 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.650
 speed that we would use to make 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.510
 battlefields or in catches of 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.360
 flags to get to a faster 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.070
 place the two speed hits that 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.900
 has the rogue would be burst of 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.030
 speed and sprint I have three 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.950
 spells of speed for being of the race 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.870
 worgen I get the momentum spell 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.440
 dark and I benefit more from this guy 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.440
 of spells 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.380
 well our next talent would be 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.780
 Play this talent gives us another bonus 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.790
 to reduce 100% of the cost of energy 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.830
 of our attacks rain and blindness 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.780
 this will help us a lot since the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.210
 rogue needs to save all the energy 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.780
 possible to use the vast majority of 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.780
 his attacks 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.639
 our last talent that they grant us 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.159
 to the precious level 90 to which all 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.229
 we want to get there sometime 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.090
 I would highly recommend launching 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.400
 shuriken since it replaces us throwing 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.439
 this spell is instantaneous and is not a 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.039
 spell with launch bar and only 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:36.439
 it costs us 20 energy points ie 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.479
 we could use it 5 times in a row each 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:42.590
 attack if the memory does not fail me removes 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.569
 between 3000 and about 5,700 as you can see 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.300
 of used launch of shuriken he 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.250
 removed 5000 10 I have not killed the target 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.319
 but if I have taken away the great part of 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.400
 his life is still much lower in level 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.400
 compared with me 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.210
 good let's continue with the glyphs of our 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.370
 character here in this I'll just say that the 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.890
 what would be more useful are like glyphs 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.770
 sublime whack glyph that increases the 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.810
 gouge duration gully glyph 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.870
 allows us to pull gouge from any 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.090
 side of the ambush glyph objective that 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.300
 it increases 5 meters the reach of the 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.300
 ambush 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.139
 as glyphs minor glyph vanish 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.139
 that leaves a kind of shadow to the 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.150
 fade disguise glyph that makes us 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.819
 take on the appearance of an enemy when 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.879
 we use steal in this effect just happens 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.499
 with the humanoid monsters glyph of 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.210
 blurred speed that allows us 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:36.800
 walk on the water when we use 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.930
 sprint 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.699
 these minor glyphs are more aesthetic 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.319
 so these can make them to your 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:45.110
 seem since they go to the taste of each 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.360
 good player that was all for today 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.080
 I hope you like it subscribe if you 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.080
 liked the video
