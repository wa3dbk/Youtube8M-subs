00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
recommend to change the spring of the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.330 
recommend to change the spring of the
tappet<00:02:49.680> plate<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:51.540> parts<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.260> part<00:02:52.340> you

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
tappet plate this parts this part you

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.170 
tappet plate this parts this part you
should<00:02:53.370> change<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> custom<00:02:55.769> one

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
should change it for a custom one

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.619 
should change it for a custom one
because<00:02:57.180> normal<00:02:57.870> made<00:02:58.859> us<00:02:59.099> this<00:02:59.879> spring<00:03:00.269> is

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
because normal made us this spring is

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.670 
because normal made us this spring is
not<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.200> strong<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.060> put<00:03:03.389> do<00:03:04.230> sector

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
not so strong so if you put do sector

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.539 
not so strong so if you put do sector
gear<00:03:04.889> in<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.609> gearbox<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.920> makes<00:03:08.280> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
gear in the gearbox and it makes the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.509 
gear in the gearbox and it makes the
rate<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.909> high<00:03:09.120> rate<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.540> fire<00:03:09.870> high<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:11.159> the

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
rate of high rate of fire high so the

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.440 
rate of high rate of fire high so the
disc<00:03:11.790> spring<00:03:12.359> will<00:03:12.720> broken<00:03:13.459> cause<00:03:14.459> our<00:03:14.909> snow

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
disc spring will broken cause our snow

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.199 
disc spring will broken cause our snow
no<00:03:15.510> spring<00:03:16.139> is<00:03:16.290> not<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.739> strong<00:03:17.189> it<00:03:18.000> will

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
no spring is not so strong it will

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.140 
no spring is not so strong it will
broken<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.410> should<00:03:19.829> change<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.790> spring

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
broken so you should change this spring

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.210 
broken so you should change this spring
to<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:21.569> strong<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.139> okay<00:03:23.900> next<00:03:24.949> the<00:03:25.949> most

so<00:04:58.889> this<00:04:59.129> is<00:04:59.279> a<00:04:59.310> semi-auto<00:04:59.900> this<00:05:00.900> makes<00:05:01.349> the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
so this is a semi-auto this makes the

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.540 
so this is a semi-auto this makes the
semi-auto<00:05:01.889> okay

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
semi-auto okay

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.550 
semi-auto okay
so<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.330> must<00:05:03.750> put<00:05:04.650> some<00:05:04.680> magnets<00:05:05.460> okay<00:05:06.560> when

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
so you must put some magnets okay when

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.189 
so you must put some magnets okay when

I<00:06:02.879> can't<00:06:03.089> understand<00:06:03.479> where<00:06:03.599> is<00:06:03.719> a<00:06:03.750> magnet<00:06:04.169> so

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:04.379 
I can't understand where is a magnet so

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:09.709 
I can't understand where is a magnet so
that<00:06:04.589> it<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:06.419> was<00:06:06.750> it<00:06:07.710> was<00:06:08.039> and<00:06:08.490> it<00:06:09.360> can't

understand<00:06:10.259> where<00:06:10.469> to<00:06:10.620> stop<00:06:10.919> so<00:06:11.550> the

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
understand where to stop so the

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.860 
understand where to stop so the
semi-auto<00:06:12.689> will<00:06:12.990> not<00:06:13.229> work<00:06:14.210> work<00:06:15.210> correctly
