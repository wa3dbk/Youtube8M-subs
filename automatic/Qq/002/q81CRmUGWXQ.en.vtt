loop<00:00:19.850> first<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.939> want<00:00:21.119> to

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
loop first you want to

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.450 

take<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.120> little<00:00:24.890> loop

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460

at that send a half not type of thing

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.520 
at that send a half not type of thing
you<00:00:31.579> have<00:00:31.730> tagged<00:00:31.970> and<00:00:32.239> right<00:00:32.419> here<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.260> this

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
you have tagged and right here and this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.380 
you have tagged and right here and this
you<00:00:33.739> can<00:00:33.860> put<00:00:34.040> your<00:00:34.219> your<00:00:34.850> hook<00:00:35.030> or<00:00:35.239> do<00:00:35.329> you

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
you can put your your hook or do you

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.530 
you can put your your hook or do you
lure<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.930> that<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:37.190> then<00:00:37.820> take<00:00:37.970> that<00:00:38.000> tagging

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
lure to that and then take that tagging

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.520 
lure to that and then take that tagging
feedback<00:00:39.260> through<00:00:40.390> you<00:00:41.390> don't<00:00:41.540> want<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:41.750> wrap

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
feedback through you don't want to wrap

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.140 
feedback through you don't want to wrap
that<00:00:42.710> around<00:00:43.600> about<00:00:44.600> three<00:00:44.839> times<00:00:45.079> is<00:00:45.440> good

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
that around about three times is good

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.219 
that around about three times is good
and<00:00:47.150> then<00:00:47.659> bring<00:00:48.320> that<00:00:48.350> tag<00:00:48.710> end<00:00:49.690> back<00:00:50.690> through

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
and then bring that tag end back through

00:00:51.229 --> 00:01:03.759 
and then bring that tag end back through
your<00:00:51.500> loop<00:00:58.210> go<00:00:59.210> ahead<00:00:59.500> some<00:01:00.500> set<00:01:00.739> tight<00:01:02.769> let's

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
your loop go ahead some set tight let's

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.040 
your loop go ahead some set tight let's
go<00:01:03.890> allow<00:01:04.100> your<00:01:04.309> your<00:01:04.699> hook<00:01:05.030> or<00:01:05.300> your<00:01:05.539> lure<00:01:05.750> to

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
go allow your your hook or your lure to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.990 
go allow your your hook or your lure to
swim<00:01:06.320> freely<00:01:06.710> through<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.250> water<00:01:07.550> that's

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
swim freely through the water that's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.230 
swim freely through the water that's
really<00:01:08.570> really<00:01:08.750> strong<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:10.759> lot<00:01:11.030> there

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
really really strong the lot there

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.730 
really really strong the lot there
really<00:01:11.539> simple<00:01:12.100> we'll<00:01:13.100> use<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:15.110> WT<00:01:15.710> is

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
really simple we'll use that the WT is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.370 
really simple we'll use that the WT is
to<00:01:16.600> tie<00:01:18.009> your<00:01:19.009> leader<00:01:19.429> to<00:01:19.759> your<00:01:20.149> regular<00:01:21.140> line

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
to tie your leader to your regular line

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.480 
to tie your leader to your regular line
and<00:01:22.539> way<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.720> do<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.080> take<00:01:25.070> your<00:01:25.250> two

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
and way to do that is take your two

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.639 
and way to do that is take your two
lines<00:01:26.000> here<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.569> kind<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.200> use<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.380> down<00:01:27.619> a

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
lines here and kind of use it down a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.350 
lines here and kind of use it down a
little<00:01:27.800> bit<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:30.190> take<00:01:31.190> one<00:01:31.399> side<00:01:31.670> make<00:01:32.330> a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
little bit and take one side make a

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.640 
little bit and take one side make a
little<00:01:32.659> little<00:01:33.619> loop

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.990 

and<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.870> over<00:01:39.870> and<00:01:40.260> under<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.830> like<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:41.790> do

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and then over and under I like to do

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.720 
and then over and under I like to do
four<00:01:42.390> times<00:01:42.660> on<00:01:42.870> this<00:01:43.050> one<00:01:43.430> gives<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> nice

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
four times on this one gives a nice

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.900 
four times on this one gives a nice
strong<00:01:45.150> not<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:49.020> moisture<00:01:49.760> pull<00:01:50.760> that

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
strong not the moisture pull that

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.690 
strong not the moisture pull that
semi-tight<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.870> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.050> way<00:01:52.110> tight<00:01:52.610> then<00:01:53.610> do

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
semi-tight not all the way tight then do

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.200 
semi-tight not all the way tight then do
the<00:01:53.790> other<00:01:53.850> side<00:01:54.180> same<00:01:55.020> thing<00:01:56.690> over<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:59.210> under

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the other side same thing over and under

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:09.219 
the other side same thing over and under
both<00:02:00.510> lines<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:05.120> that<00:02:06.500> moisture<00:02:07.790> pull<00:02:08.790> that

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
both lines and that moisture pull that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.750 
both lines and that moisture pull that
semi<00:02:10.229> tight<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:11.040> take<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> opposite

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
semi tight and then take the opposite

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.360 
semi tight and then take the opposite
ends<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.180> pull<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.560> cinch<00:02:13.830> down<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
ends and pull and they cinch down it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.820 
ends and pull and they cinch down it
comes<00:02:14.490> tight<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.270> then<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.320> can<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.590> clip

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
comes tight and then you can just clip

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.420 
comes tight and then you can just clip
these<00:02:16.980> tag<00:02:17.340> ends<00:02:17.580> off<00:02:17.820> they're<00:02:19.130> pretty<00:02:20.130> close

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
these tag ends off they're pretty close

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.210 
these tag ends off they're pretty close
but<00:02:21.120> not<00:02:21.270> too<00:02:21.570> close<00:02:21.810> down<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.950> don't<00:02:23.100> want

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
but not too close down you don't want

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.160 
but not too close down you don't want
this<00:02:23.250> line<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.820> not<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.600> pass<00:02:24.780> through<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
typically make about a three-foot leader

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.900 
typically make about a three-foot leader

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
and then that gives you plenty of leader

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.630

that<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.140> can<00:03:01.260> kind<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.620> pull<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.130> through

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489
