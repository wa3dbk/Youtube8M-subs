00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.109
 let's calculate the product of matrices that 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.520
 appears on screen 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.530
 we have two matrices, let's observe that here 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 we have a row this first matrix 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.870
 It has only one row and three columns 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.930
 post is a 1 x 3 matrix 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 this second matrix has 3 rows 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.810
 and two columns 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 as the number of columns of the first 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.420
 matches the number of rows in the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.330
 second you can make that product and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.120
 the result will be a 1 by 2 matrix 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.940
 what we're going to get a matrix from a 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.320
 row and two columns one row and two 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.430
 columns then we're going to have two 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.050
 elements here 1 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.540
 and 2 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.000
 this first element will be the first 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.130
 row and first column 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.720
 is the first element you get from 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.090
 multiply the first row of the 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.610
 first matrix by the first column of 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.320
 the second matrix the elements are 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 get to multiply the first row 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.900
 of this matrix by the first column of 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.520
 this matrix and that first element would be 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.520
 2 for 2 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.880
 more second per second minus one per 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.880
 three 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.900
 plus third by third 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 what we have left is four more 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:33.450
 one by 333 and this is equal 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.130
 4 - 31 34 as here we would have 4 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.299
 to find out if we can remove these in 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.299
 delete numbers yes 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.650
 and now this element here would be 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.700
 first row second column then it 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.049
 you will obtain from multiplying the first row 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.049
 of the first matrix 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.050
 for the second column 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.630
 of the second matrix 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.020
 first row for second column then 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.020
 is element of there would be 2 for 1 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.860
 + 1 x 0 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.980
 + 3 for 2 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.100
 this leaves us all but one minus two 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.690
 plus one for zero that is 0 3 for 26 less 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.780
 26 what is 4 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.910
 we have already obtained the two elements of 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.670
 the product matrix and this would be the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.500
 result I will erase everything except the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.100
 matrix that we have left the result 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.040
 of multiplying those two matrices which 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.409
 it would be for a little bit like that 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.739
 result of multiplying those two 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:56.739
 matrices is 44
