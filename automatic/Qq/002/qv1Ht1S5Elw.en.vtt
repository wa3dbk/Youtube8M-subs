00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
sometimes I'll tightline it and put it

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.990 
sometimes I'll tightline it and put it
off<00:00:12.770> for<00:00:12.949> the<00:00:13.039> back<00:00:13.190> of<00:00:13.340> the<00:00:13.430> boat<00:00:13.610> but<00:00:13.850> we're

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
saves you a lot of trouble I got the Big

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.530 
saves you a lot of trouble I got the Big
Bob<00:00:21.170> around<00:00:21.410> there<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:22.640> then<00:00:22.820> I'll<00:00:22.970> put<00:00:23.270> two

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
Bob around there and then I'll put two

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.480 
Bob around there and then I'll put two
big<00:00:23.720> egg<00:00:23.990> sinkers<00:00:24.530> right<00:00:24.770> here<00:00:25.039> that<00:00:25.250> really

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
big egg sinkers right here that really

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.170 
big egg sinkers right here that really
keeps<00:00:26.050> larger<00:00:27.050> suckers<00:00:27.500> from<00:00:28.030> swimming<00:00:29.030> up<00:00:29.150> to

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
keeps larger suckers from swimming up to

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.490 
keeps larger suckers from swimming up to
the<00:00:29.360> surface<00:00:29.810> because<00:00:30.020> otherwise<00:00:30.170> they'll

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
the surface because otherwise they'll

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.960 
the surface because otherwise they'll
spend<00:00:30.770> a<00:00:30.860> lot<00:00:31.010> of<00:00:31.039> time<00:00:31.280> swimming<00:00:31.580> around<00:00:31.820> on

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
spend a lot of time swimming around on

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.700 
spend a lot of time swimming around on
the<00:00:32.029> surface<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:33.199> then<00:00:33.289> what<00:00:33.440> I'll<00:00:33.530> do<00:00:33.680> is

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
the surface and then what I'll do is

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.410 
the surface and then what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:34.040> put<00:00:34.300> well<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.329> got<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:36.250> three-foot

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
I'll put well I got a three-foot

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.090 
I'll put well I got a three-foot
fluorocarbon<00:00:38.649> 100-pound<00:00:39.649> leader<00:00:40.040> and<00:00:42.100> my

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
fluorocarbon 100-pound leader and my

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.610 
fluorocarbon 100-pound leader and my
experience<00:00:43.700> I<00:00:44.030> have<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.570> lot<00:00:44.899> more<00:00:44.930> strikes

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
experience I have a lot more strikes

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.560 
experience I have a lot more strikes
with<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:45.920> fluorocarbon<00:00:46.820> leader<00:00:46.940> versus<00:00:47.450> the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
with the fluorocarbon leader versus the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.500 
with the fluorocarbon leader versus the
skill<00:00:47.899> I<00:00:48.800> think<00:00:49.280> those<00:00:49.640> fish<00:00:49.910> can<00:00:50.149> see<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
skill I think those fish can see the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.510 
skill I think those fish can see the
steel<00:00:50.809> leader<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.350> lot<00:00:52.010> easier<00:00:52.370> this

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
steel leader a lot easier this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.330 
steel leader a lot easier this
fluorocarbon<00:00:53.329> they<00:00:53.450> say<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:53.809> kind<00:00:54.110> of

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
fluorocarbon they say it kind of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.410 
fluorocarbon they say it kind of
vanishes<00:00:55.340> as<00:00:55.640> soon<00:00:55.790> as<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:56.000> put<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.270> in<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
vanishes as soon as you put it in the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.990 
vanishes as soon as you put it in the
water<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:58.510> then<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.870> use<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.610> much<00:01:01.610> certain<00:01:01.879> what

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
water and then I use a much certain what

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.060 
water and then I use a much certain what
size<00:01:02.239> treble<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:02.930> is<00:01:03.140> but<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.680> like<00:01:03.860> using

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
size treble this is but I like using

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.559 
size treble this is but I like using
pretty<00:01:04.339> pretty<00:01:05.299> good<00:01:05.780> size<00:01:06.049> hooks<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:08.299> I<00:01:08.359> kind

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:08.569 
pretty pretty good size hooks and I kind

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.359 
pretty pretty good size hooks and I kind
of<00:01:08.630> made<00:01:08.780> my<00:01:08.810> own<00:01:08.959> quick<00:01:09.350> strike<00:01:09.649> rig<00:01:09.679> here<00:01:10.189> I

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
of made my own quick strike rig here I

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.590 
of made my own quick strike rig here I
just<00:01:11.060> attached<00:01:11.829> eight-inch<00:01:12.829> leader

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
just attached eight-inch leader

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.730 
just attached eight-inch leader
fluorocarbon<00:01:14.600> leader<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:15.049> this<00:01:15.200> other<00:01:15.409> leader

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
fluorocarbon leader to this other leader

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.649 
fluorocarbon leader to this other leader
so<00:01:16.399> it's<00:01:16.549> basically<00:01:16.939> just<00:01:17.060> like<00:01:17.359> a<00:01:17.389> quick

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
so it's basically just like a quick

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.359 
so it's basically just like a quick
strike<00:01:17.929> rig<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.859> a<00:01:18.889> lot<00:01:19.039> of<00:01:19.159> like<00:01:19.249> quick

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
strike rig but a lot of like quick

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.389 
strike rig but a lot of like quick
strike<00:01:19.729> rigs<00:01:20.060> you<00:01:20.240> buy<00:01:20.560> today<00:01:21.560> iron

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
strike rigs you buy today iron

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.879 
strike rigs you buy today iron
fluorocarbon<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.389> I<00:01:23.779> like<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.170> fluorocarbon

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
fluorocarbon and I like the fluorocarbon

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:29.410 
fluorocarbon and I like the fluorocarbon
so<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.259> way<00:01:27.380> I<00:01:27.409> go<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.119> been<00:01:29.119> working

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
so this is the way I go and been working

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.870 
so this is the way I go and been working
pretty<00:01:29.600> good<00:01:29.779> for<00:01:29.990> me<00:01:30.079> this<00:01:30.200> year

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.870 

the<00:01:34.880> split<00:01:35.270> shot<00:01:35.509> here<00:01:36.340> that's<00:01:37.340> just<00:01:37.459> a<00:01:37.670> little

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
the split shot here that's just a little

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.349 
the split shot here that's just a little
extra<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.359> keep<00:01:38.509> that<00:01:38.749> sucker<00:01:39.079> down<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:40.490> think

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
extra to keep that sucker down I think

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.300 
extra to keep that sucker down I think
the<00:01:41.479> more<00:01:41.659> weight<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.869> better<00:01:42.200> cuz<00:01:42.529> some<00:01:43.249> of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
the more weight the better cuz some of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.609 
the more weight the better cuz some of
these<00:01:43.399> suckers<00:01:43.670> could<00:01:44.060> be<00:01:44.179> 16<00:01:44.719> 18<00:01:45.049> inches<00:01:45.169> long

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
these suckers could be 16 18 inches long

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.209 
these suckers could be 16 18 inches long
and<00:01:46.119> so<00:01:47.119> they<00:01:47.209> have<00:01:47.329> no<00:01:47.479> problem

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
and so they have no problem

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.169 
and so they have no problem
lifting<00:01:49.219> up<00:01:49.279> that<00:01:49.429> kind<00:01:49.639> of<00:01:49.729> weight<00:01:49.909> they'll

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
lifting up that kind of weight they'll

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.169 
lifting up that kind of weight they'll
swim<00:01:50.630> around<00:01:50.869> on<00:01:50.959> the<00:01:51.020> surface<00:01:51.439> so<00:01:51.999> that's<00:01:52.999> why

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
swim around on the surface so that's why

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.330 
swim around on the surface so that's why
I<00:01:53.209> do<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:54.340> okay<00:01:56.679> it's<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.770> last<00:01:57.979> day<00:01:58.189> of<00:01:58.219> the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
I do that okay it's the last day of the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.129 
I do that okay it's the last day of the
season<00:01:58.579> so<00:01:58.969> they<00:01:59.299> were<00:01:59.359> out<00:01:59.569> of<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.959> really

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
season so they were out of the really

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:05.530 
season so they were out of the really
big<00:02:00.439> suckers<00:02:00.919> that<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.099> typically<00:02:01.579> use<00:02:03.639> but

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
big suckers that I typically use but

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.219 
big suckers that I typically use but
I<00:02:05.590> mean<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.950> guy<00:02:07.190> will<00:02:07.370> work<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:08.030> usually<00:02:09.020> like

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
I mean this guy will work I usually like

through the lips and I've had so many

hook on me it seems like I can think of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.310 
hook on me it seems like I can think of
very<00:02:36.470> few<00:02:36.590> fish<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.430> when<00:02:38.270> they<00:02:38.390> take<00:02:38.690> this

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
very few fish that when they take this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.650 
very few fish that when they take this
with<00:02:39.620> tube<00:02:39.860> troubles<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:41.150> quick<00:02:41.360> strike<00:02:41.630> rig

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
with tube troubles that quick strike rig

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.300 
with tube troubles that quick strike rig
it<00:02:41.960> allows<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.410> set<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.740> hook<00:02:42.860> right<00:02:43.070> away

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
it allows you to set the hook right away

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.650 
it allows you to set the hook right away
that<00:02:43.520> time<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.820> fish<00:02:44.030> doesn't<00:02:44.300> have<00:02:44.420> time<00:02:44.600> to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that time the fish doesn't have time to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.930 
that time the fish doesn't have time to
swallow<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:46.220> hooks<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.670> don't<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:46.850> to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
swallow the hooks and you don't have to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.160 
swallow the hooks and you don't have to
worry<00:02:47.090> about<00:02:47.120> deep<00:02:47.510> hook<00:02:47.720> in<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.960> fish<00:02:48.140> and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
worry about deep hook in the fish and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.970 
worry about deep hook in the fish and
killing<00:02:48.620> them<00:02:48.740> and<00:02:49.070> that<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.680> always<00:02:51.950> a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
killing them and that that is always a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.050 
killing them and that that is always a
bad<00:02:52.220> thing<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.730> that's<00:02:53.600> how<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> rigged<00:02:53.960> a<00:02:53.990> bomb
