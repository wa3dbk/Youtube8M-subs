 from the moment I entered that 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.590
 I left everything behind the girl who was 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.380
 timid nervous I was unsure of 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.570
 itself all everything was left behind 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.360
 a transformation to what I am today 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.070
 a safer girl who knows what 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.520

 the day of the event arrived where the rehearsal 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.129
 general was very important because 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.280
 we had to keep in mind what it was 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.140
 the posture the choreography all that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.109
 had to do with that night everything had 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.820
 to be perfect we were so 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.000
 nervous because being a space more 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.479
 big and we did not get any more tense 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.560

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.500
 the attention the nerve did not have 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.759
 overwhelmed all the racks that was a 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.979
 chaos a talking and that nervous and that 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.320

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.159
 Make up when I have to comb my hair 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.159
 It's my wardrobe 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.090
 when I saw that dress and I felt wow 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.090
 the most beautiful woman at that time that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.610
 dress gave me that vote of confidence and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.210
 of self-confidence that that was 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.850
 something amazing 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.119
 missing a girl for me I close the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.979
 eyes and I start to imagine everything that 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.770
 helped how I was going to walk that 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.250
