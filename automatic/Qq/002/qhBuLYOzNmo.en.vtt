00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone as I have guests 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.050
 to eat and I'm going to light them for dessert 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.780
 pudding because I thought show you how 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.200
 I make the recipe, well, the first thing that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.810
 we have some ingredients I have prepared 5 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.440
 eggs 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.140
 200 grams of sugar half a liter of 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.600
 milk the sugar was because we're going to catch 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.090
 4 tablespoons to make the 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.900
 candy and a lemon that we have caught 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.689
 a little piece of skin, well, first thing 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 what we have to do is put the milk 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.240
 to warm up 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.470
 and half a liter of milk 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.790
 and we're going to add the lemon rind 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.040
 I'm going to teach you because this is one thing 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.530
 important the lemon rind when 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.470
 you make them of the lemon you have to remove it 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.990
 very finite so that it does not have part 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.060
 white because the bitter lemon white 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.930
 and then it does not look good in desserts 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.780
 then the skin of the lemon to the milk and already 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.659
 we are going to put it to heat 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.520
 The next thing we're going to do is catch 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.920
 a flannel 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.969
 and we are going to add 4 tablespoons 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.969
 of sugar 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.430
 make candy 2 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.030
 3 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.030
 same 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.030
 all right 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.110
 the candy and this fact we are going to 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.390
 remove from the fire 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.980
 and you have to spin it around so that it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.280
 stick on all the walls of the 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.280
 flane 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.940
 right now it does not stick much because it's 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.820
 still too hot but according to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.430
 go cooling it will go sticking 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.980
 the candy is already harder and as you can see 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.510
 it sticks very well to the walls 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.730
 like milk we already have it 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.250
 practically about to boil we're going 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.500
 to withdraw 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.890
 I already have the 5 eggs prepared in a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.960
 container then let's take 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.960
 the sugar and we're going to beat everything 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.520
 of sugar 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.910
 and let's do it well 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.750
 is the next thing we have to do is 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.790
 incorporate the milk that is hot 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.370
 let's incorporate but little by little 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.040
 it is very important to always do it 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.569
 slowly because if not the eggs are 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.959
 they are going to curdle 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.209
 then we take with a ladle and very 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.850
 slowly let's throw a thread of milk 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.450
 at the same time that we move the eggs 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.450
 A) Yes 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.940
 slowly 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.950
 I already have the la olla express 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.400
 put on fire and I've put something 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.440
 because now we are going to put the flanera 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.100
 which is done in the express pot we carry 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.020
 the rest of the milk faster because 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.580
 nothing happens 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.520
 in the flanera that we have already 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.360
 caramelized let's pour milk with 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.760
 the eggs and the sugar 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.230
 the cabbage we insure where it does not have 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.020
 no piece that has not been mixed 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.740
 well a piece of lemon that has been 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.390
 could separate 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.660
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.970
 cover the flanera 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.420
 we already have the boiling water in the pot 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.150
 express we put it 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.599
 the water has to be left to cover as 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.599
 half of the flanera approximately 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.599
 we cover 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.180
 we put the dumbbell 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.910
 and good since it starts to whistle ten 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.730
 minutes once the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.460
 ten minutes we will leave it outside the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.070
 fire 5 more minutes and then we will open 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.130
 the pot I'll show case not 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.540
 you have plan was with a lid there is no 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.260
 No problem I have done many times 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.540
 and there is no problem in a normal flanera 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.699
 here we do not have the liquid inside a 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.190
 Once you have poured the liquid, take a 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.190
 albal paper what is lid like this 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.050
 you will think that the water will enter 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.050
 but not 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.020
 well well attached 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.880
 and we would do the same as what we had in 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.800
 an express pot with water to put on the 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.800
 half and it's perfect I can assure you 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.540
 It 's been 10 minutes we will remove 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.910
 the pot of fire 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.680
 and when I stop puffing steam the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.930
 we will open, do not think about raising the 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.860
 weighs while you are steaming what 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.540
 you complain we wait 5 minutes we go to 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.540
 remove the flanera from the express pot 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.270
 helping us with a cloth because if not 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.270
 we can burn 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.100
 and we left it out here until it 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.810
 cool once cold we can overflow it 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.040
 to check if the flan is good 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.110
 guajardo what we have to do is 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.250
 pierce it with a needle 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.250
 let's check 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.379
 we think 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.260
 as the needle has come out clean is that 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.270
 it's perfect 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.900
 As the flan is already cold we can 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.900
 dismantle it 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.039
 we put the font upside down 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.039
 we hold ourselves carefully 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.370
 and this is the plan 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:58.539
 pretty fast to express development and 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:00.760
 not having to turn on the oven we're going to 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.800
 put it on the table 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.470
 It is a flan that is delicious I have 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.400
 years doing it that sure he likes 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.400
 everyone 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.100
 I hope you have been able to enjoy 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.100
