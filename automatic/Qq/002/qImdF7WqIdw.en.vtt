00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.190 
of plastic between the board and battery
but<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.700> seems<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.479> odd<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
but this seems like a really odd way to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.619 
but this seems like a really odd way to
disassemble<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> laptop<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.119> went<00:02:09.539> ahead

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
disassemble the laptop so I went ahead

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.080 
disassemble the laptop so I went ahead
and<00:02:09.840> disconnected<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> ribbon<00:02:11.129> cables<00:02:11.520> for

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and disconnected the ribbon cables for

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.650 
and disconnected the ribbon cables for
the<00:02:12.150> USB<00:02:12.750> C<00:02:13.050> port

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660

all<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.290> cables<00:02:17.470> disconnected<00:02:18.400> we<00:02:18.790> can

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
all the cables disconnected we can

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.820 
all the cables disconnected we can
separate<00:02:19.450> both<00:02:19.660> halves<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.350> case<00:02:20.560> and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
separate both halves of the case and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.610 
separate both halves of the case and
really<00:02:21.580> see<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.450> how<00:02:22.630> different<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:23.380> new

actually get down to removing a few of

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.030 
actually get down to removing a few of

removal i'm turning our attention to the
upper<00:03:40.510> half<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.960> case<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:41.710> can<00:03:41.860> remove<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
upper half of the case we can remove the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.280 
upper half of the case we can remove the
trackpad<00:03:43.090> which<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.540> held<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:43.840> place<00:03:43.959> with<00:03:44.080> a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
the audio board assembly lastly we can

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.890 
the audio board assembly lastly we can
detach<00:03:51.490> the<00:03:51.700> Retina<00:03:51.970> display<00:03:52.300> from<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.660> case

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
detach the Retina display from the case

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.610 
detach the Retina display from the case
and<00:03:53.170> our<00:03:53.560> teardown<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.520> complete<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:56.470> what
