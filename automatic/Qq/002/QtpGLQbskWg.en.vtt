00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
glass I feel that's where the posters

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.300 
glass I feel that's where the posters
are<00:01:05.790> away<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.619> the

are away and it's also about the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.220 
are away and it's also about the
dissipation<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.030> Colin<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.520> using<00:01:11.520> grey<00:01:12.230> in

dissipation of Colin and using grey in

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.460 
dissipation of Colin and using grey in
distance<00:01:14.240> not<00:01:15.240> only<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.630> exaggerate

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
distance not only to exaggerate

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.580 
distance not only to exaggerate
atmospheric<00:01:17.370> perspective<00:01:17.780> but<00:01:18.780> also<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.260> use

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
atmospheric perspective but also to use

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.850 
atmospheric perspective but also to use
distance<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> metaphor<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:20.970> time<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
distance as a metaphor for time and the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.719 
distance as a metaphor for time and the
gray<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:24.030> symbolize<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:25.070> color<00:01:26.070> which<00:01:26.460> is

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
gray would symbolize the color which is

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.620 
gray would symbolize the color which is
not<00:01:26.760> defined<00:01:27.450> yet<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.220> undefined<00:01:30.030> future

not defined yet or the undefined future

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.670 
not defined yet or the undefined future
and<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:32.010> foreground<00:01:32.580> would<00:01:33.180> describe<00:01:33.750> when

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and the foreground would describe when
