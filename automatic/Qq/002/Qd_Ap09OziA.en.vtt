Hello &amp; Welcome to F3 Health &amp; Beauty Care

I am Satvinder &amp; today i am going to share a face pack made of orange peel powder

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.120
We all love glowing skin, and orange peel has many benefits

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:24.603
It is rich in Vitamin C. It has tanning properties, it removes tan from your skin.

00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:29.800
It also removes the access oil from the skin &amp; makes you skin supple &amp; soft

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:31.479
So, let's start making

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.840
You will require orange peel powder, Sandal wood powder, Milk &amp; Lemon Juice

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.316
Orange peel powder can be easily available in the market.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.686
But i prefer homemade one

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:48.101
just take the orange peel, dried it in the sun for 2-3 days, till it is hard.

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.921
and grind them into a fine powder, and your orange peel powder is ready.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.539
so, let's start making

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.240
Take 1 Spoon of orange peel powder

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.799
1/4 spoon of sandal wood powder

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.340
2 spoons of milk

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.500
and just add 1/2 a spoon of lemon juice

00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:16.291
And make a fine paste

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.776
You can add little more milk

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.520
If your face pack is thick

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:31.578
and you are done with this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.501
Apply this on your face, leave it for 10-15 minutes . Let is dry completely &amp; then wash it off with lukewarm water

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.160
