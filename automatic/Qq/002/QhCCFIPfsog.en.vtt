00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
perception of what's happening in the

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.810 
perception of what's happening in the
world<00:00:10.960> then<00:00:11.440> I<00:00:11.469> would<00:00:11.800> have<00:00:11.980> if<00:00:12.130> I<00:00:12.280> were<00:00:12.519> to

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
world then I would have if I were to

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.289 
world then I would have if I were to
nurse<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.950> spirit<00:00:15.339> consciousness<00:00:15.610> I've

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
nurse the the spirit consciousness I've

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.600 
nurse the the spirit consciousness I've
been<00:00:16.540> dealing<00:00:16.779> with<00:00:16.960> since<00:00:17.610> consciously

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
been dealing with since consciously

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.939 
been dealing with since consciously
since<00:00:19.060> I<00:00:19.240> was<00:00:19.390> two<00:00:19.600> years<00:00:19.630> old<00:00:20.080> and<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.590> 40

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
since I was two years old and the the 40

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.040 
since I was two years old and the the 40
years<00:00:24.189> that<00:00:24.460> I<00:00:24.699> spent<00:00:24.730> working<00:00:25.300> as<00:00:25.689> a<00:00:25.720> nurse

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
years that I spent working as a nurse

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.220 
years that I spent working as a nurse
has<00:00:26.650> shown<00:00:27.010> me<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:28.060> difference<00:00:28.269> between<00:00:28.779> the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
has shown me the difference between the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.290 
has shown me the difference between the
medical<00:00:29.710> community<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.580> way<00:00:30.670> they<00:00:30.939> think

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
medical community and the way they think

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.259 
medical community and the way they think
and<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:32.410> way<00:00:32.439> our<00:00:32.619> spirit<00:00:33.340> consciousness<00:00:33.610> is

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
and the way our spirit consciousness is

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.829 
and the way our spirit consciousness is
actually<00:00:34.870> put<00:00:35.589> together<00:00:35.830> at<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:37.059> design<00:00:37.540> and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
actually put together at the design and

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.350 
actually put together at the design and
function<00:00:38.379> of<00:00:38.589> the<00:00:39.309> spirit<00:00:39.640> consciousness<00:00:39.909> is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
function of the spirit consciousness is

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.030 
function of the spirit consciousness is
a<00:00:40.390> very<00:00:40.600> different<00:00:40.900> than<00:00:41.199> what<00:00:41.500> medicine

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
a very different than what medicine

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.820 
a very different than what medicine
understands<00:00:42.940> so<00:00:43.629> medicine<00:00:44.379> is<00:00:44.530> always

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
understands so medicine is always

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
understands so medicine is always
treating<00:00:45.339> us<00:00:45.489> from<00:00:45.790> an<00:00:45.940> external<00:00:46.449> concept<00:00:47.229> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
treating us from an external concept and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.149 
treating us from an external concept and
the<00:00:48.850> spirit<00:00:49.239> consciousness<00:00:49.510> is<00:00:50.110> our<00:00:50.320> internal

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
the spirit consciousness is our internal

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.359 
the spirit consciousness is our internal
design<00:00:51.879> and<00:00:52.150> function<00:00:52.690> so<00:00:53.290> when<00:00:54.010> we<00:00:54.280> are

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
design and function so when we are

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.149 
design and function so when we are
looking<00:00:54.760> at<00:00:54.850> everything<00:00:55.320> externally<00:00:56.320> we

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
looking at everything externally we

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.509 
looking at everything externally we
basically<00:00:57.510> cannot<00:00:58.619> understand<00:00:59.619> why<00:01:00.129> we<00:01:00.309> get

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
basically cannot understand why we get

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.329 
basically cannot understand why we get
sick<00:01:00.790> but<00:01:01.600> if<00:01:01.750> we<00:01:01.900> look<00:01:01.930> at<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:02.470> internally<00:01:03.159> is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
sick but if we look at it internally is

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.740 
sick but if we look at it internally is
perfectly<00:01:03.760> clear

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.030 

and<00:01:10.750> open<00:01:10.960> people<00:01:11.530> come<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.070> me<00:01:14.040> they're

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
and open people come to me they're

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.690 
and open people come to me they're
desperate<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:16.630> have<00:01:16.930> gone<00:01:17.230> through<00:01:17.700> maybe

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
desperate they have gone through maybe

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.260 
desperate they have gone through maybe
the<00:01:18.910> medical<00:01:19.390> system<00:01:19.600> for<00:01:20.140> 20<00:01:20.500> 30<00:01:20.740> years<00:01:21.340> they

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
the medical system for 20 30 years they

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.150 
the medical system for 20 30 years they
have<00:01:22.480> had<00:01:22.720> all<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.260> medications<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.130> can

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
have had all the medications you can

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.150 
have had all the medications you can
imagine<00:01:24.610> anybody<00:01:25.150> ordering<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:26.140> them<00:01:26.350> they

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
imagine anybody ordering for them they

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.530 
imagine anybody ordering for them they
have<00:01:28.620> believed<00:01:29.620> their<00:01:29.890> limitations<00:01:30.730> they

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
have believed their limitations they

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.370 
have believed their limitations they
haven't<00:01:31.870> understood<00:01:32.940> their<00:01:33.940> relationship<00:01:34.930> to

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
haven't understood their relationship to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.100 
haven't understood their relationship to
nature<00:01:36.010> earth<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.940> universe<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.720> then

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
nature earth and the universe and then

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.860 
nature earth and the universe and then
so<00:01:38.440> therefore<00:01:38.940> they<00:01:39.940> don't<00:01:40.150> understand<00:01:40.660> how

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
so therefore they don't understand how

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.760 
so therefore they don't understand how
to<00:01:40.930> heal<00:01:41.290> themselves<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.840> do<00:01:43.990> with<00:01:44.740> a

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
to heal themselves and all I do with a

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
to heal themselves and all I do with a
person<00:01:45.400> no<00:01:45.580> matter<00:01:45.610> how<00:01:46.120> thick<00:01:46.479> they<00:01:46.720> are<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
person no matter how thick they are is I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.120 
person no matter how thick they are is I
counsel<00:01:49.270> them<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.870> spiritual<00:01:50.410> counseling<00:01:50.920> I

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
counsel them the spiritual counseling I

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.630 
counsel them the spiritual counseling I
do<00:01:51.580> neural<00:01:52.200> depolarization<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:54.070> help<00:01:54.400> them

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
do neural depolarization and I help them

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.660 
do neural depolarization and I help them
to<00:01:54.910> understand<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:56.650> they<00:01:57.070> have<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.460> look

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
to understand that they have to look

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.840 
to understand that they have to look
internally<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.630> heal<00:01:58.930> themselves<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.860> do<00:02:00.280> not

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
internally and heal themselves I do not

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.680 
internally and heal themselves I do not
heal<00:02:01.510> anyone<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:03.130> heal<00:02:03.520> themselves<00:02:04.390> by<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
heal anyone they heal themselves by the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.560 
heal anyone they heal themselves by the
changes<00:02:05.350> they<00:02:05.530> make<00:02:05.800> within<00:02:06.220> themselves<00:02:06.729> so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
changes they make within themselves so

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.530 
changes they make within themselves so
our<00:02:07.900> mind<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.070> way<00:02:09.220> we<00:02:09.429> think<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:10.149> the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
our mind and the way we think is the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.860 
our mind and the way we think is the
essence<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.170> our<00:02:11.709> behavior<00:02:12.430> we're<00:02:13.120> reflective

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
essence of our behavior we're reflective

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.530 
essence of our behavior we're reflective
being<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.650> whatever<00:02:15.220> our<00:02:15.459> mind<00:02:15.760> has<00:02:16.030> up<00:02:16.209> here

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
being so whatever our mind has up here

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.750 
being so whatever our mind has up here
is<00:02:16.690> let's<00:02:17.230> reflect<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.950> out<00:02:18.100> into<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
is let's reflect it out into the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.229 
is let's reflect it out into the
physical<00:02:18.970> world<00:02:19.300> as<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.459> behavior<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:22.030> we

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
physical world as the behavior and if we

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.850 
physical world as the behavior and if we
have<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> belief<00:02:23.019> that<00:02:23.920> we're<00:02:24.700> going<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.180> be

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
have a belief that we're going to be

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.009 
have a belief that we're going to be
sick<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.489> we're<00:02:28.090> going<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.810> this

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
sick and that we're going to have this

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.900 
sick and that we're going to have this
disease<00:02:29.410> because<00:02:29.860> our<00:02:30.040> parents<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.700> this

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
disease because our parents have this

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.820 
disease because our parents have this
disease<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:32.019> know<00:02:32.170> we'll<00:02:32.440> set<00:02:32.709> ourselves

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
disease and you know we'll set ourselves

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.860 
disease and you know we'll set ourselves
up<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.370> have<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.880> disease<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.920> we<00:02:35.920> will

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
up to have the disease and we will
