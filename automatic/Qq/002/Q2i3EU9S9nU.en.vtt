 through tele cameras and robotized 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:00.129
 being a fast efficient system and very 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.129
 precise 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.350

 it's very easy to use you know it 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.390
 all alone that being also very much

 cables through 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.720
 also communicating with the 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.170
 computer is much more reliable and much 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.170
 faster 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.160
 with the screen located in the part 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.709
 front of the machine we can do the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:24.480
 parallel much more comfortably and with a 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:25.980
 more general view the procedure is
