00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
okay I'll try to explain problem with

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.359 
okay I'll try to explain problem with
the<00:00:08.880> Oakland<00:00:09.380> replacement<00:00:10.429> lens<00:00:14.540> this<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
the Oakland replacement lens this is the

the Oakland replacement lens this is the
flak<00:00:17.369> jacket<00:00:17.789> frame<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:22.070> standard

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
flak jacket frame and this is standard

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:33.130 
flak jacket frame and this is standard
for<00:00:24.330> lens<00:00:26.359> that<00:00:28.580> flak<00:00:29.580> jacket<00:00:31.219> is<00:00:32.219> coming<00:00:32.489> with

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
for lens that flak jacket is coming with

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:42.190 
for lens that flak jacket is coming with
so<00:00:34.140> I'll<00:00:34.260> put<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.579> but<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> lens

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
so I'll put and we can see but the lens

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.940 
so I'll put and we can see but the lens
is<00:00:43.200> perfectly<00:00:43.920> fit<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.629> no<00:00:45.629> way<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.469> remove<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
is perfectly fit in no way to remove the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.459 
is perfectly fit in no way to remove the
lens<00:00:47.600> it's<00:00:48.600> actually<00:00:49.340> stable<00:00:50.340> enough<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
lens it's actually stable enough and

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.299 
lens it's actually stable enough and
yeah<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.489> remove<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:57.109> pushing

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
yeah you can remove it just by pushing

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.880 
yeah you can remove it just by pushing
frame<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> right<00:00:59.940> spot<00:01:00.649> got<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
frame in the right spot got the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.570 
frame in the right spot got the
replacement<00:01:02.760> lens<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.660> polarized<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
replacement lens the polarized one and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.679 
replacement lens the polarized one and
see<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> tag<00:01:07.580> polarized<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:10.850> if<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.119> put

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
see the tag polarized one and if I put

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.890 
see the tag polarized one and if I put
the<00:01:12.960> black<00:01:14.600> polar<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:15.930> led<00:01:16.530> lens<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.900> okay

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the black polar right led lens in okay

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.810 
the black polar right led lens in okay
no<00:01:19.140> problem

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
no problem

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.960 
no problem
they're<00:01:20.820> perfectly<00:01:21.360> fitted<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.759> there's<00:01:23.759> no

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
they're perfectly fitted and there's no

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.100 
they're perfectly fitted and there's no
way<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.750> remove<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.710> stable<00:01:26.159> enough<00:01:27.110> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
way to remove it it's stable enough you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.060 
way to remove it it's stable enough you
can<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> run<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:33.680> cycling<00:01:34.680> or

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
can have a run you can go cycling or

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.880 
can have a run you can go cycling or
whatever<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.079> only<00:01:39.200> remove<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.409> just

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
whatever and you can only remove it just

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
whatever and you can only remove it just
by<00:01:42.020> doing<00:01:43.880> push<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.060> hard<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.540> right<00:01:46.049> place

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
by doing push it hard in the right place

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.580 
by doing push it hard in the right place
so<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.520> got<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.509> gold<00:01:49.470> ones<00:01:51.979> polarized<00:01:52.979> again

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
so we got the gold ones polarized again

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.530 
so we got the gold ones polarized again
xlg<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.299> atoms<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.729> put<00:02:00.299> this

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
xlg as the atoms so when we put this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.999 
xlg as the atoms so when we put this
lens<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> frame<00:02:04.430> we<00:02:05.430> hear<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> click

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
lens to the frame we hear the click

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:17.490 
lens to the frame we hear the click
Allen's<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:14.610> fit<00:02:15.610> exactly<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.470> can

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
Allen's just not fit exactly and you can

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.910 
Allen's just not fit exactly and you can
see<00:02:17.890> here<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:22.300> putting<00:02:22.900> your<00:02:23.290> finger<00:02:23.709> like

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
see here just putting your finger like

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.000 
see here just putting your finger like
this<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.900> lens<00:02:26.110> can<00:02:26.290> be<00:02:26.470> removed<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:28.030> very

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
this the lens can be removed it's very

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.199 
this the lens can be removed it's very
and<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.250> can<00:02:30.430> hear<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.820> sound<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.490> it's

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
and then you can hear the sound so it's

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.330 
and then you can hear the sound so it's
supposed<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:36.570> but<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:38.020> lens<00:02:38.320> can<00:02:39.310> be

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
supposed to be in but the lens can be

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.000 
supposed to be in but the lens can be
easily<00:02:40.530> very<00:02:41.530> easily<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:43.180> removed<00:02:43.980> what<00:02:44.980> I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
easily very easily be removed what I

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.770 
easily very easily be removed what I
think<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.610> problem<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:49.120> has<00:02:49.150> very

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
think the problem is is that it has very

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.680 
think the problem is is that it has very
small<00:02:49.950> curved<00:02:51.120> sure<00:02:53.100> comparing<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.489> this<00:02:54.690> to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
small curved sure comparing to this to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.479 
small curved sure comparing to this to
the<00:02:55.810> other<00:02:56.160> large<00:02:57.160> one<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:58.410> think<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.739> this<00:03:00.130> is

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
the other large one I think that this is

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.010 
the other large one I think that this is
the<00:03:00.910> problem<00:03:01.420> cannot<00:03:02.410> be<00:03:02.470> easily<00:03:02.920> seen<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.989> I

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
the problem cannot be easily seen but I

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.620 
the problem cannot be easily seen but I
think<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:06.580> curve<00:03:06.910> here<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.350> problem
