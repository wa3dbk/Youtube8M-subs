to better understand the oceans students

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.590 
to better understand the oceans students
say<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.259> class<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.770> interesting<00:01:54.429> and<00:01:54.610> fun<00:01:54.850> but

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
say the class is interesting and fun but

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.109 
say the class is interesting and fun but
it's<00:01:55.780> not<00:01:55.959> always<00:01:56.200> easy<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.610> physics<00:01:57.970> behind

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
it's not always easy the physics behind

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.510 
it's not always easy the physics behind
it<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.539> definitely<00:01:59.140> it's<00:01:59.500> pretty<00:01:59.679> complex<00:02:00.069> so

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
it is definitely it's pretty complex so

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.210 
it is definitely it's pretty complex so
um<00:02:00.819> it's<00:02:01.149> interesting<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.959> learn<00:02:02.049> about<00:02:02.220> so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
um it's interesting to learn about so

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.580 
um it's interesting to learn about so
yeah<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:03.880> think<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.149> does<00:02:04.240> are<00:02:04.420> relevant<00:02:04.810> um<00:02:05.110> so

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
yeah I think it does are relevant um so

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.899 
yeah I think it does are relevant um so
far<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:05.979> good<00:02:06.009> I've<00:02:06.399> learned<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.640> lot<00:02:06.670> about

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
far so good I've learned a lot about

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.340 
far so good I've learned a lot about
like<00:02:07.179> how<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.420> wave<00:02:07.600> progresses<00:02:08.110> through<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
like how the wave progresses through the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.559 
like how the wave progresses through the
ocean<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.640> physics<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> little

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
ocean and like the physics is a little

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.120 
ocean and like the physics is a little
advanced<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.620> can<00:02:11.890> get<00:02:11.980> complicated

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
advanced it can get complicated

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.430 
advanced it can get complicated
sometimes<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.480> definitely<00:02:13.900> worth<00:02:14.230> it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
sometimes but it's definitely worth it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440 
sometimes but it's definitely worth it
yeah<00:02:14.709> yeah<00:02:15.459> it's<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> very<00:02:15.849> popular<00:02:16.060> class

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
yeah yeah it's a very popular class

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.930 
yeah yeah it's a very popular class
there's<00:02:16.720> always<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.959> waiting<00:02:17.170> list

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.000
