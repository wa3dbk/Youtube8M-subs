released that she was pregnant she was
wearing<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> high-waisted<00:02:17.819> slack<00:02:18.180> thing<00:02:18.390> next

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
wearing a high-waisted slack thing next

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.949 
wearing a high-waisted slack thing next
to<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.870> t-shirt<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.640> pattern<00:02:21.060> kind<00:02:21.720> of

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
to the t-shirt like the pattern kind of

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.470 
to the t-shirt like the pattern kind of
and<00:02:22.260> don't<00:02:23.130> really<00:02:23.519> like<00:02:23.819> how<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.120> doesn't<00:02:24.269> fit

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
and don't really like how it doesn't fit

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.520 
and don't really like how it doesn't fit
near<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.720> back<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.319> problem

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
near the back so that's the problem

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.250 
near the back so that's the problem
really<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.970> lot<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.450> these<00:02:27.569> outfits<00:02:27.840> don't<00:02:28.019> fit

really a lot of these outfits don't fit

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.870 
really a lot of these outfits don't fit
so<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.560> not<00:02:28.650> really<00:02:28.890> surprising<00:02:28.980> next<00:02:29.760> is
