I'd<00:06:24.769> be<00:06:24.799> I<00:06:25.989> don't<00:06:26.989> think<00:06:27.139> it'll<00:06:27.259> be<00:06:27.349> too

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
I'd be I don't think it'll be too

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:34.029 
I'd be I don't think it'll be too
natural<00:06:27.979> for<00:06:28.159> you<00:06:31.959> okay<00:06:32.959> so<00:06:32.989> now<00:06:33.379> your<00:06:33.679> look<00:06:33.860> is

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
natural for you okay so now your look is

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.729 
natural for you okay so now your look is
complete<00:06:34.729> but<00:06:35.479> this<00:06:35.719> is<00:06:35.929> the<00:06:36.169> look<00:06:36.379> that<00:06:36.409> I

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:36.739 
complete but this is the look that I

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:39.759 
complete but this is the look that I
think<00:06:36.949> is<00:06:37.669> I<00:06:38.089> think<00:06:38.869> this<00:06:39.019> amount<00:06:39.439> of<00:06:39.529> makeup

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:39.769 
think is I think this amount of makeup

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:41.919 
think is I think this amount of makeup
is<00:06:40.129> perfect<00:06:40.339> for<00:06:40.729> eighth<00:06:40.849> grade<00:06:41.300> it<00:06:41.599> might<00:06:41.749> be

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 
is perfect for eighth grade it might be

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:43.540 
is perfect for eighth grade it might be
way<00:06:42.079> too<00:06:42.319> much<00:06:42.349> for<00:06:42.589> you<00:06:42.979> it<00:06:43.189> might<00:06:43.339> be<00:06:43.489> too

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
way too much for you it might be too

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.609 
way too much for you it might be too
little<00:06:43.879> for<00:06:44.149> you<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:44.569> eye<00:06:44.599> look<00:06:45.019> is<00:06:45.199> pretty

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:45.619 
little for you the eye look is pretty

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.919 
little for you the eye look is pretty
not<00:06:46.069> like<00:06:46.249> intense<00:06:46.729> but<00:06:47.209> it<00:06:47.360> is<00:06:47.599> a<00:06:47.629> lot<00:06:47.899> of

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:47.929 
not like intense but it is a lot of

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:50.169

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:54.439 
eye look is very very natural but it has

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:56.949

00:06:58.929 --> 00:06:58.939 
so I don't know it would be too much

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.819 
so I don't know it would be too much
might<00:06:59.209> be<00:06:59.329> too<00:06:59.449> little<00:06:59.629> I<00:06:59.899> don't<00:07:00.439> know<00:07:00.589> I<00:07:00.649> don't

might be too little I don't know I don't

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:02.079 
might be too little I don't know I don't
really<00:07:01.039> want<00:07:01.189> to<00:07:01.429> hear<00:07:01.579> about<00:07:01.610> it<00:07:01.939> in<00:07:01.999> the

12th<00:07:15.139> grade<00:07:15.499> but<00:07:16.839> actually<00:07:17.839> I<00:07:17.899> think<00:07:17.989> this<00:07:18.199> is

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:18.349 
12th grade but actually I think this is

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:21.790 
12th grade but actually I think this is
a<00:07:18.379> good<00:07:18.649> look<00:07:19.009> for<00:07:19.759> like<00:07:20.029> 8th<00:07:20.329> to<00:07:21.079> 9th<00:07:21.349> grade<00:07:21.589> I

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 
a good look for like 8th to 9th grade I

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.299

think<00:07:22.360> because<00:07:23.649> yeah<00:07:24.649> I'll<00:07:24.769> probably<00:07:24.949> be

00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:25.309 
think because yeah I'll probably be

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:27.069 
think because yeah I'll probably be
wearing<00:07:25.519> this<00:07:25.669> like<00:07:25.879> a<00:07:25.999> mountain<00:07:26.419> night<00:07:26.689> area

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:27.079 
wearing this like a mountain night area

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.820 
wearing this like a mountain night area
as<00:07:27.139> well<00:07:27.379> I<00:07:27.409> don't<00:07:27.679> think<00:07:27.709> I'll<00:07:27.919> wear<00:07:28.069> anymore

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.700 
as well I don't think I'll wear anymore
and<00:07:29.190> less<00:07:29.310> like<00:07:29.520> a<00:07:29.900> warlike<00:07:30.900> foundation<00:07:31.590> or

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
and less like a warlike foundation or

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.850 
and less like a warlike foundation or
something<00:07:32.100> but<00:07:33.110> he<00:07:34.110> actually<00:07:34.260> hope<00:07:34.620> you<00:07:34.740> guys
