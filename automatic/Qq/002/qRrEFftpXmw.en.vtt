00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
anything any other kind of youtuber I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.880 
anything any other kind of youtuber I

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.410 
think it's something that is really fun
it<00:04:07.100> should<00:04:07.160> be<00:04:07.310> given<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.700> try<00:04:07.910> because<00:04:08.150> it's

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
it should be given a try because it's

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.090 
it should be given a try because it's
really<00:04:08.600> really<00:04:08.780> cool<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.200> really<00:04:09.350> puts

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
really really cool and it really puts

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.020 
really really cool and it really puts
you<00:04:10.220> on<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.340> different<00:04:10.610> level<00:04:10.700> with<00:04:10.910> your

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
you on a different level with your
