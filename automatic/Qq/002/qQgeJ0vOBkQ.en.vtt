00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.690
 and we started 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.089
 we hold by hand 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.650
 asthma is nothing more than how it was 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.259
 someone who does not need to give more if not 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 is going to break the thing and we have to 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.490
 orient it in such a way that they do not want 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.110
 the wires inside it until the if 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.040
 they are not going to be cut and here we are going to do 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.110
 a tremendous slamming then we have to 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.160
 accommodate it for that I need the two 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 hands 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.470
 once we see it as we cover it 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.970
 and we put the legs and they are already 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.970
 we go in the final straight 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.210
 this thing has two legs here 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.730
 and supposedly after the here I believe 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.400
 he did not break it 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.770
 but it does not matter these are these two legs 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.379
 assemble there in that trapeze that you see 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.490
 there 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.820
 and in this other 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.110
 we are 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.400
 what has gone one way to the other 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.400
 then he is 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.740
 doing being careful to make a 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.630
 side the cables and want 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.509
 what is going to prevent it from moving 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.430
 when you put the lid on now let's 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.520
 put the lid we will accommodate the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 cables 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.479
 it happened that another one had been unlocked already 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.479
 we arrange 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.530
 it's like well 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.890
 and let's put the lid on 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.920
 accommodate the cables and accommodate the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:54.470
 We already put the cables and put the lid 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:57.490
 and now let's put one the legs 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.890
 I did not want to get the screws out of here 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.810
 because it's easier to manipulate them from this 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.110
 way 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 here is the I got to where they see with 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.500
 hand 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.909
 and this is in I got also 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.909
 A) Yes 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.340
 now let's tighten 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.340
 with this tool 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.659
 and I need both hands 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.720
 Y
