00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.020
 Question 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.500
 do not 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.539
 fall 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.400
 I decided on other players and with 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.200
 respect to those of the position I said in the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:49.380
 week although my continuity is not 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.380
 neither fear in football 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.680
 when it seems better to me we were or 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.969
 when we became the owner of the match 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.540
 winning 1 to 0 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.430
 we allow a getafe reaction that 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.009
 complicated the first time and put it in 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.380
 the game seems to me that the team 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:18.090
 I was when well but things are allowed 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.520
 or mentally we do not have the hardness 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.130
 necessary to continue playing the same 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.130
 way and each deconcentration 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.500
 they provoke us goals against all 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.390
 ways we could have tied the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.729
 party but we also missed the office 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.579
 to defend well the last five 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 minutes of the game and I think that's 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.840
 responsibility of the coach also 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.250
 I think that in each game we have lacked 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.000
 something today we have needed to know how to be 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.750
 know how to hold if you could not play or not 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.820
 fit the goal the second goal in others 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.240
 we had to miss the ones we had 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.060
 good we will find explanation not a 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.700
 for all the matches but each in 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.209
 every game anyway is a 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.209
 streak what 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.200
 that mine trust and good makes us 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.200
 reflect on what's coming 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.860
 no one has spoken with me 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.430
 and I would also understand 10 matches without 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.879
 win are too many 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.859
 so I 'm afraid because something happens 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.270
 we do not have the other but I would find 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.760
 what 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.270
 the streak has a significant weight in 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.270
 the decision 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.970
 today excuse me to think about what happened 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.970
 I just can not think about the next 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 come on
