00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
new map packs come out it's gone down to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.949 
new map packs come out it's gone down to
300<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:26.130> make<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.490> easier<00:02:26.819> because<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.330> no<00:02:27.810> one

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
300 to make it easier because if no one

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.210 
300 to make it easier because if no one
knows<00:02:28.440> yet<00:02:28.890> he<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.819> on<00:02:29.940> ps3<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.660> me<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.800> in

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
don't recommend doing hardcore because

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.630 
don't recommend doing hardcore because
like<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.110> says<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.650> hard<00:03:55.950> it's<00:03:56.250> very<00:03:56.370> hard

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
like it says it is hard it's very hard

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.890 
like it says it is hard it's very hard

it's hard to escape so I recommend you
doing<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.980> he<00:04:02.340> doing<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.880> solo<00:04:03.329> but<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
doing is he doing it on solo but the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.710 
doing is he doing it on solo but the
problem<00:04:04.170> with<00:04:04.320> solo<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.360> are<00:04:06.570> don't

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
problem with solo is that you are don't

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.600 
problem with solo is that you are don't
know<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.140> get<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> bonus<00:04:07.769> pull<00:04:08.370> on

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
else he was not escaped but what I

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.569 
else he was not escaped but what I
recommend<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.329> doing<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.840> when<00:04:16.440> if<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:17.100> do<00:04:17.280> go
