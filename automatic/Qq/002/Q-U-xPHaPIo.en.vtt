probably<00:01:39.420> pretty<00:01:39.870> a<00:01:40.050> lot<00:01:40.320> lower<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.950> mean

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
probably pretty a lot lower I mean

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
probably pretty a lot lower I mean
honestly<00:01:41.880> when<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.300> see<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> good<00:01:42.810> thumbnail

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
honestly when I see a good thumbnail

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.660 
honestly when I see a good thumbnail
that<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.530> makes<00:01:43.740> me<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.190> ties<00:01:44.370> to<00:01:44.520> want

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that just makes me more on ties to want

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.800 
that just makes me more on ties to want

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
to click on the video because that means

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.210 
to click on the video because that means
that<00:01:46.050> they're<00:01:46.170> putting<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.500> lot<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.710> effort

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
that they're putting a lot of effort

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.710 
that they're putting a lot of effort
into<00:01:47.370> it<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.210> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> shows<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
into it and it just kind of shows that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.090
