configuration

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:16.860 

you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.160 

you

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.920 

so<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.350> accuracy<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.280> at<00:03:26.460> 150<00:03:27.450> feet<00:03:27.480> I

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
so the accuracy for it at 150 feet I

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.050 
so the accuracy for it at 150 feet I
went<00:03:28.890> ahead<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.070> switched<00:03:29.340> out<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:29.610> target<00:03:29.970> I

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
went ahead and switched out the target I

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.730 
went ahead and switched out the target I
put<00:03:30.240> up<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.390> 15<00:03:31.020> inch<00:03:31.280> steel<00:03:32.280> pan<00:03:33.170> on<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.500> paper

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
put up a 15 inch steel pan on the paper

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.920 
put up a 15 inch steel pan on the paper
the<00:03:35.520> eight-inch<00:03:35.910> targets<00:03:36.360> 8<00:03:36.570> inches<00:03:36.870> wide

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the eight-inch targets 8 inches wide

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.260 
the eight-inch targets 8 inches wide
essentially<00:03:37.710> I<00:03:37.860> was<00:03:38.280> scoring<00:03:38.640> like<00:03:38.790> less<00:03:39.060> than

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
essentially I was scoring like less than

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.660 
essentially I was scoring like less than
40%<00:03:39.600> on<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.110> hit<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.830> went<00:03:41.430> ahead<00:03:41.490> and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
40% on the hit so I went ahead and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.860 
40% on the hit so I went ahead and
switched<00:03:41.730> out<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> target<00:03:42.420> see<00:03:42.540> how<00:03:42.630> that's

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
switched out the target see how that's

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:54.420 
switched out the target see how that's
gonna

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:56.899 
so I went ahead and pushed the target

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:59.829 
so I went ahead and pushed the target
back<00:04:57.049> to<00:04:57.289> 200<00:04:57.829> feet<00:04:57.979> now<00:04:58.299> I've<00:04:59.299> got<00:04:59.509> the<00:04:59.629> hop-up

back to 200 feet now I've got the hop-up

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:03.099 
back to 200 feet now I've got the hop-up
as<00:05:00.199> high<00:05:00.499> as<00:05:00.559> it<00:05:00.859> can<00:05:01.009> go<00:05:01.479> I'm<00:05:02.479> not<00:05:02.719> going<00:05:03.019> to

well<00:05:53.960> there<00:05:54.170> you<00:05:54.200> have<00:05:54.320> it<00:05:54.470> for<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.800> accuracy

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
well there you have it for the accuracy

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.530 
well there you have it for the accuracy
on<00:05:55.880> an<00:05:56.540> 8<00:05:56.690> inch<00:05:56.900> target<00:05:57.380> at<00:05:58.310> 100<00:05:58.730> feet<00:05:58.940> or<00:05:59.150> 30

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
on an 8 inch target at 100 feet or 30

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.280 
on an 8 inch target at 100 feet or 30
meters<00:06:00.070> shot<00:06:01.070> about<00:06:01.280> 80%<00:06:02.150> had<00:06:02.390> 2<00:06:02.630> Flyers<00:06:03.020> but

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
meters shot about 80% had 2 Flyers but

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.840 
meters shot about 80% had 2 Flyers but
they<00:06:03.440> were<00:06:03.500> really<00:06:03.800> really<00:06:04.040> close<00:06:04.160> and<00:06:04.580> just

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
they were really really close and just

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.060 
they were really really close and just
off<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.240> paper<00:06:05.480> grouping<00:06:06.380> was<00:06:06.470> about<00:06:06.710> 6

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
off the paper grouping was about 6

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.940 
off the paper grouping was about 6
inches<00:06:07.310> so<00:06:07.930> 80%<00:06:08.930> of<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.050> time<00:06:09.260> at<00:06:09.440> 100<00:06:09.770> feet

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
inches so 80% of the time at 100 feet

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.160 
inches so 80% of the time at 100 feet
you're<00:06:10.100> going<00:06:10.130> to<00:06:10.250> have<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.430> 6<00:06:10.760> inch<00:06:10.970> group<00:06:11.270> I

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
you're going to have a 6 inch group I

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.160 
you're going to have a 6 inch group I
actually<00:06:12.740> dropped<00:06:13.190> at<00:06:13.430> 150<00:06:14.180> feet<00:06:14.390> I<00:06:14.600> was<00:06:15.080> only

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
actually dropped at 150 feet I was only

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.040 
actually dropped at 150 feet I was only
about<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.500> get<00:06:15.680> about<00:06:16.190> 40%<00:06:16.910> on<00:06:17.420> paper<00:06:17.750> so<00:06:17.990> I

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
about to get about 40% on paper so I

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.380 
about to get about 40% on paper so I
went<00:06:18.260> to<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.410> 15<00:06:18.800> inch<00:06:18.830> target<00:06:19.460> and<00:06:19.610> then<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.150> went

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
went to a 15 inch target and then I went

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.990 
went to a 15 inch target and then I went
ahead<00:06:20.510> and<00:06:20.810> got<00:06:21.350> the<00:06:21.530> 15<00:06:22.100> or<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.400> 15<00:06:22.760> inch

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
ahead and got the 15 or the 15 inch

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.200 
ahead and got the 15 or the 15 inch
target<00:06:23.590> 80<00:06:24.590> percent<00:06:25.040> of<00:06:25.130> the<00:06:25.220> time<00:06:25.430> so<00:06:25.460> at<00:06:25.730> 150

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
target 80 percent of the time so at 150

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.730 
target 80 percent of the time so at 150
feet<00:06:26.390> you<00:06:26.990> know<00:06:27.110> you're<00:06:27.290> definitely<00:06:27.410> going<00:06:27.710> to

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
feet you know you're definitely going to

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.410 
feet you know you're definitely going to
be<00:06:27.830> shooting<00:06:28.070> some<00:06:28.190> people<00:06:28.400> out<00:06:28.550> actually

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
be shooting some people out actually

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.570 
be shooting some people out actually
accuracy<00:06:30.080> dropped<00:06:30.380> off<00:06:30.590> quite<00:06:31.040> a<00:06:31.070> bit<00:06:31.250> at

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
accuracy dropped off quite a bit at

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.900 
accuracy dropped off quite a bit at
between<00:06:32.120> 150<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:32.930> 200<00:06:33.140> feet<00:06:33.620> range

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
between 150 and 200 feet range

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.240 
between 150 and 200 feet range
I<00:06:34.940> had<00:06:35.360> to<00:06:35.480> hop<00:06:35.660> up<00:06:35.690> maxed<00:06:36.440> as<00:06:36.560> far<00:06:36.860> as<00:06:37.010> it<00:06:37.160> could

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
I had to hop up maxed as far as it could

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.970 
I had to hop up maxed as far as it could
go<00:06:37.310> and<00:06:37.790> I<00:06:38.150> was<00:06:38.300> holding<00:06:38.810> at<00:06:39.080> 5<00:06:39.260> mil<00:06:39.560> dot<00:06:39.740> high

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
go and I was holding at 5 mil dot high

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.210 
go and I was holding at 5 mil dot high
in<00:06:40.190> my<00:06:40.340> scope<00:06:40.640> and<00:06:40.850> I<00:06:41.210> got<00:06:41.390> 1<00:06:41.720> out<00:06:42.050> of<00:06:42.230> about<00:06:42.440> 15

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
in my scope and I got 1 out of about 15

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.400 
in my scope and I got 1 out of about 15
shots<00:06:43.610> so<00:06:44.030> you're<00:06:44.840> not<00:06:44.930> gonna<00:06:45.050> be<00:06:45.170> scaring

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
shots so you're not gonna be scaring

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.560 
shots so you're not gonna be scaring
anyone<00:06:45.680> at<00:06:45.890> 15<00:06:46.310> you<00:06:46.670> know<00:06:46.700> essentially<00:06:47.300> they

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
anyone at 15 you know essentially they

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.080 
anyone at 15 you know essentially they
were<00:06:47.770> still<00:06:48.770> fairly<00:06:49.010> accurate<00:06:49.670> as<00:06:49.820> far<00:06:50.000> as

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
were still fairly accurate as far as

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.700 
were still fairly accurate as far as
they're<00:06:50.240> left<00:06:50.480> to<00:06:50.600> right<00:06:50.810> but<00:06:51.500> they<00:06:51.620> were

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
they're left to right but they were

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.940 
they're left to right but they were
dropping<00:06:51.980> off<00:06:52.280> short<00:06:52.670> so<00:06:53.410> you<00:06:54.410> know<00:06:54.530> probably

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
dropping off short so you know probably

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.590 
dropping off short so you know probably
going<00:06:55.100> to<00:06:55.160> need<00:06:55.250> maybe<00:06:55.520> an<00:06:55.730> R<00:06:55.880> hop<00:06:56.120> increase

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
going to need maybe an R hop increase

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.330 
going to need maybe an R hop increase
the<00:06:56.750> FPS<00:06:57.140> or<00:06:57.320> something<00:06:57.530> to<00:06:57.590> get<00:06:57.680> out<00:06:57.830> to<00:06:57.950> 200

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.640 
the FPS or something to get out to 200
feet<00:06:58.520> but<00:06:58.760> in<00:06:58.850> 100<00:06:59.210> 150<00:06:59.870> foot<00:07:00.050> range<00:07:00.260> it's

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
feet but in 100 150 foot range it's

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.500 
feet but in 100 150 foot range it's
pretty<00:07:01.220> accurate<00:07:01.490> you'll<00:07:01.910> definitely<00:07:02.390> be

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510
