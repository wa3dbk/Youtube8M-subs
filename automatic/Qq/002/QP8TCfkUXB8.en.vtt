00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
firstly I get the nappy and then I fold

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.790 
firstly I get the nappy and then I fold
it<00:00:23.240> in<00:00:24.240> half<00:00:25.460> this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.640> ideal<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> smaller

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
it in half this is ideal for the smaller

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.999 
it in half this is ideal for the smaller
reborns<00:00:28.880> then<00:00:29.880> look<00:00:30.029> at<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.869> end<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.769> fold

it<00:00:32.219> into<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.850> square<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.340> open<00:00:35.640> corners

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it into a square so all the open corners

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.310 
it into a square so all the open corners
are<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.600> side<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> top

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
are to one side and we get the top

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.010 
are to one side and we get the top
corner<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.629> pull<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> straight<00:00:45.930> across<00:00:48.020> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
corner and pull it straight across to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.100 
corner and pull it straight across to
make

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.140 

a<00:00:52.170> triangle<00:00:54.260> we<00:00:55.260> turn<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.710> over<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:57.740> then

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.720 

we'll<00:01:01.750> get<00:01:01.870> hold<00:01:02.110> of<00:01:02.260> this<00:01:02.410> end<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.310> we<00:01:03.460> fold

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
we'll get hold of this end and we fold

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.880 
we'll get hold of this end and we fold
it<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.460> now<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.700> have<00:01:07.030> a<00:01:07.360> triangle<00:01:08.350> with<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.560> pad

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890
