 advice number 11 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.660
 what is the number 11 that touches us this 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.890
 time is very, very important and very 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.700
 but very easy to be depending if you have 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.860
 a lot of work or not if your partner is very 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.150
 demanding 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.160
 sex is sleeping more sleep more helps 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.950
 take fat has many explanations 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.770
 one the most simple is 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.250
 for example a person who sleeps five 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.550
 hours and then is all day walking 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.570
 not working that you happen to feel more 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.700
 tired and then grab more hungry for 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.190
 suffer this fatigue and over will not 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.170
 feel like exercising 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.840
 take after 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.710
 if the same 8 or 9 hours 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.869
 the body feels more rested by 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.729
 which is going to be less hungry and 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.100
 we will be more rested and with more 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.700
 encouragement to exercise besides 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.020
 this when we sleep less occurs 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.850
 a dysfunction in the secretion of 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.969
 hormones for example the hormone 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.400
 growth that segregates in the 3rd 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.610
 fourth stage of the dream rem 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.590
 and also mainly one hour 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.370
 after going to bed and two rhythms 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 obviously 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.960
 among other things but basically 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.200
 the most important thing is this and when one 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.960
 sleeps little in addition during the day free 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.550
 one more cortisol that is the hormone 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.040
 related to stress once 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.330
 and then we have to try to 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.229
 sleep as many hours 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.120
 possible at our discretion and in our 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.670
 life because it's not fair that a person 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.800
 Come and tell them to sleep 8 9 10 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.350
 hours when you really can not 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.120
 do what I ask you is that if 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.370
 they have to lose weight they have to 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.490
 burn fat is that they sleep the most 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.130
 number of hours possible to stop 3 and in 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.390
 their lives then well this is the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.760
 council number two and I hope there will be 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.150
 liked the number 10 advice to burn 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.790
 Fat is eating more protein and fat 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.710
 good and try to reduce a little 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.740
 carbohydrates carbon a little there is no that 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.740
 eliminate the proteins we already know chicken
