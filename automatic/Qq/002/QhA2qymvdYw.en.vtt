millimeter<00:00:15.320> inputs<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.520> USB

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
millimeter inputs is just that it's USB

it's<00:00:18.960> still<00:00:19.260> analog<00:00:19.789> but<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> USB<00:00:21.330> version

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
it's still analog but the USB version

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.460 
it's still analog but the USB version
now<00:00:21.869> has<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> volume<00:00:22.350> control<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:23.220> line<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:24.470> if

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
this but pretty much the only thing we

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.550 
this but pretty much the only thing we
have<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.910> look<00:03:45.090> at<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.540> speaker<00:03:46.019> setting

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
have to look at is the speaker setting

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.380 
have to look at is the speaker setting
and<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.580> basically<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.180> same<00:03:48.330> as

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
and this is just basically the same as

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.840 
and this is just basically the same as
your<00:03:48.660> volume<00:03:48.989> control<00:03:49.410> that's<00:03:49.980> already<00:03:50.730> on

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
your volume control that's already on

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.170 
your volume control that's already on
the<00:03:51.090> cord<00:03:51.420> or<00:03:51.630> down<00:03:52.380> in<00:03:52.560> your<00:03:52.650> task<00:03:52.890> manager<00:03:53.459> so

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
the cord or down in your task manager so

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.199 
the cord or down in your task manager so
now<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.840> effect<00:03:55.670> now<00:03:56.670> here<00:03:56.850> under<00:03:57.090> the

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
now on to effect now here under the

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.390 
now on to effect now here under the
effects<00:03:57.510> tab<00:03:57.750> first<00:03:58.680> thing<00:03:58.860> we<00:03:58.980> have<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.310> in

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
effects tab first thing we have is in

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.370 
effects tab first thing we have is in
the<00:03:59.459> environment<00:04:00.060> this<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.630> just<00:04:00.780> pretty<00:04:01.200> much

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
the environment this is just pretty much

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.630 
the environment this is just pretty much
where<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:01.709> set<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:01.920> up<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.160> sound<00:04:02.459> like<00:04:02.580> a

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
where you can set it up to sound like a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.110 
where you can set it up to sound like a
studio<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.630> car<00:04:04.500> or<00:04:04.769> room<00:04:05.010> who<00:04:05.640> knows<00:04:05.850> what

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
studio a car or room who knows what

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.699 
studio a car or room who knows what
pretty<00:04:06.570> much<00:04:06.660> I've<00:04:06.959> always<00:04:07.110> found<00:04:07.350> this<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.650> be

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
pretty much I've always found this to be

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.490 
pretty much I've always found this to be
worthless<00:04:08.390> just<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> little<00:04:09.690> bit<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.380> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
worthless just a little bit that is the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.150 
worthless just a little bit that is the
environment<00:04:10.799> size<00:04:11.280> now<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.239> is<00:04:12.390> important

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
environment size now this is important

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.920 
environment size now this is important
with<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:14.190> headset<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.390> want<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.600> set<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.840> all

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
with this headset you want to set it all

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.240 
with this headset you want to set it all
the<00:04:16.019> way<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.350> right<00:04:16.500> which<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.919> large

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
the way to the right which is a large

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.969 
the way to the right which is a large
room<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.690> further<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.140> go<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.739> smaller

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
room the further you go to a smaller

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.760 
room the further you go to a smaller
room<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:21.299> just<00:04:21.539> basically<00:04:21.750> adds<00:04:22.109> echo<00:04:22.710> to

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
room it just basically adds echo to

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.580 
room it just basically adds echo to
everything<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.460> hear<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.599> just<00:04:24.840> does<00:04:25.440> not

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
everything you hear and it just does not

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.140 
everything you hear and it just does not
sound<00:04:25.830> good<00:04:25.979> at<00:04:26.220> all<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:26.700> keep<00:04:26.940> it

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
sound good at all so keep it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.439 
sound good at all so keep it
over<00:04:27.300> on<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.540> right<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.960> large<00:04:28.199> room<00:04:29.449> setting

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
over on the right to large room setting

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.659 
over on the right to large room setting

up the equalizer with this headset makes

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.400 
up the equalizer with this headset makes
the<00:04:32.910> biggest<00:04:33.240> difference<00:04:33.449> out<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.080> everything

the biggest difference out of everything

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.850 
the biggest difference out of everything

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
and every option that you can choose now

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.939 
and every option that you can choose now
these<00:04:38.039> are<00:04:38.370> only<00:04:39.270> supposed<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:39.780> go<00:04:39.870> down<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.560> 50

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
these are only supposed to go down to 50

these are only supposed to go down to 50
Hertz<00:04:41.190> which<00:04:41.370> is<00:04:41.699> base<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.270> up<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.870> 20,000

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
Hertz which is base and up to 20,000

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.620 
Hertz which is base and up to 20,000
Hertz<00:04:43.710> now<00:04:44.669> if<00:04:44.789> you<00:04:44.880> look<00:04:45.000> at<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.210> equalizer

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
Hertz now if you look at the equalizer

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.499 
Hertz now if you look at the equalizer
down<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.440> bottom<00:04:46.590> graph<00:04:46.979> it'll<00:04:47.970> say<00:04:48.120> 30

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
down on the bottom graph it'll say 30

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.020 
down on the bottom graph it'll say 30
what<00:04:49.440> we're<00:04:49.590> doing<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.220> adjusting<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.880> volume

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
what we're doing is adjusting the volume

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.560 
what we're doing is adjusting the volume
of<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:52.139> Hertz<00:04:52.490> by<00:04:53.490> raising<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:53.970> decibels<00:04:54.449> or

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
of the Hertz by raising the decibels or

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.600 
of the Hertz by raising the decibels or
lowering<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.050> decibels<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:56.190> we<00:04:56.310> start<00:04:56.490> with

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
lowering the decibels so we start with

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.760 
lowering the decibels so we start with
30<00:04:56.970> which<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.479> deeper<00:04:57.780> bass<00:04:57.990> bring<00:04:58.740> that

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
30 which is the deeper bass bring that

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.210 
30 which is the deeper bass bring that
up<00:04:58.919> about<00:04:59.190> halfway<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:01.530> second<00:05:01.889> one<00:05:02.010> which<00:05:02.190> is

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
up about halfway the second one which is

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.610 
up about halfway the second one which is
a<00:05:02.340> higher<00:05:02.580> base<00:05:02.880> under<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.240> 60<00:05:03.720> Hertz<00:05:03.930> bring

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
a higher base under the 60 Hertz bring

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.070 
a higher base under the 60 Hertz bring
that<00:05:04.650> up<00:05:04.830> maybe<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.400> quarter<00:05:05.699> of<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.030> way<00:05:06.180> then

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
that up maybe a quarter of the way then

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.100 
that up maybe a quarter of the way then
from<00:05:07.320> 120<00:05:08.130> all<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.760> way<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.180> right<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.570> 2k

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
from 120 all the way to the right to 2k

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.810 
from 120 all the way to the right to 2k
we<00:05:10.560> can<00:05:10.680> just<00:05:10.800> pretty<00:05:11.039> much<00:05:11.190> leave<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:11.669> alone

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
we can just pretty much leave that alone

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.400 
we can just pretty much leave that alone
and<00:05:12.680> from<00:05:13.680> 4k<00:05:14.220> start<00:05:14.669> bring<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:15.030> up<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.479> little

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
and from 4k start bring that up a little

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.810 
and from 4k start bring that up a little
bit<00:05:16.680> 8k<00:05:17.669> up<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.360> little<00:05:18.570> higher<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.110> 16<00:05:19.979> k<00:05:20.310> bring

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
bit 8k up a little higher and 16 k bring

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.730 
bit 8k up a little higher and 16 k bring
that<00:05:20.849> up<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.300> match<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.960> base<00:05:22.169> that<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:22.530> have

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
that up to match the base that you have

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.990 
that up to match the base that you have
at<00:05:23.220> 30<00:05:24.530> this<00:05:25.530> is<00:05:25.590> pretty<00:05:25.889> much<00:05:25.979> a<00:05:26.099> good<00:05:26.610> overall

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
at 30 this is pretty much a good overall

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.510 
at 30 this is pretty much a good overall
setting<00:05:27.599> for<00:05:28.050> these<00:05:28.199> speakers<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:28.889> from<00:05:29.400> this

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
setting for these speakers and from this

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.490 
setting for these speakers and from this
point<00:05:29.639> you<00:05:30.449> can<00:05:30.599> adjust<00:05:30.690> it<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.110> your<00:05:31.260> liking

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
point you can adjust it to your liking

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.650 
point you can adjust it to your liking
but<00:05:32.400> this<00:05:32.550> will<00:05:32.699> give<00:05:32.849> you<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.000> good<00:05:33.090> starting
