00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
dynamic amount you can just use some
JavaScript<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.270> determine<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> length<00:01:49.409> but

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
JavaScript to determine the length but

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.789 
JavaScript to determine the length but
since<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.149> hard<00:01:52.110> code<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.350> into

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
since I know it I can hard code it into

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.850 
since I know it I can hard code it into
the<00:01:52.920> UL<00:01:53.549> element<00:01:54.060> saying<00:01:54.960> okay<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.500> this

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the UL element saying okay this this

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 
the UL element saying okay this this
whole<00:01:56.070> thing<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.369> gonna<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.549> three<00:01:56.850> thousand

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
whole thing is gonna be three thousand

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
whole thing is gonna be three thousand
pixels<00:01:57.930> YX<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.560> three<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.850> inner

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
pixels YX is three of them and the inner

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.700 
pixels YX is three of them and the inner
this<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.659> thing<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.899> contains<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
this is the thing that contains it and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.260 
this is the thing that contains it and
I'm<00:02:01.770> saying<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.070> two<00:02:02.340> thousand<00:02:02.850> pixels<00:02:03.000> wide

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
I'm saying that two thousand pixels wide

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.600 
I'm saying that two thousand pixels wide
so<00:02:03.479> essentially<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.350> slide<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.100> size<00:02:05.310> one

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so essentially one slide the size one

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.940 
so essentially one slide the size one
slide<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.119> I'm<00:02:06.270> hiding<00:02:06.810> what's<00:02:07.079> overflowing

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
slide and I'm hiding what's overflowing

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.290 
slide and I'm hiding what's overflowing
so<00:02:08.160> that's<00:02:08.369> why<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.550> don't<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.149> other

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so that's why you don't see these other

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.170 
so that's why you don't see these other
ones<00:02:09.509> over<00:02:09.690> here

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
ones over here

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.460 
ones over here
but<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.210> have<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.720> whole<00:02:11.870> thing<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.260> there's

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
but I have the whole thing so there's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.350 
but I have the whole thing so there's
one<00:02:12.680> long<00:02:12.920> strip<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:13.610> three<00:02:13.880> thousand

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
one long strip that's three thousand

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.290 
one long strip that's three thousand
pixels<00:02:14.540> wide<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.920> when<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.130> animate<00:02:16.490> left

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
pixels wide and so when I animate left

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.890 
pixels wide and so when I animate left
and<00:02:17.510> right<00:02:17.720> he's<00:02:18.200> just<00:02:18.440> sliding<00:02:19.100> this<00:02:19.340> UL

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
and right he's just sliding this UL

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.560 
and right he's just sliding this UL
element<00:02:20.900> here<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.830> left<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.160> right<00:02:22.310> which

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
element here to the left and right which

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.810 
element here to the left and right which
looks<00:02:23.570> like<00:02:23.960> this<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.310> guy<00:02:25.610> right<00:02:25.670> here

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
looks like this so this guy right here

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.570 
looks like this so this guy right here
this<00:02:26.150> UL<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.560> three<00:02:28.100> thousand<00:02:28.430> pixels

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
this UL is it that three thousand pixels

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.000 
this UL is it that three thousand pixels
wide<00:02:28.910> its<00:02:29.720> parent<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.350> only<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.590> thousand

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
wide its parent is only a thousand

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.400 
wide its parent is only a thousand
pixels<00:02:31.190> wide<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:32.150> when<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.330> click<00:02:33.080> one<00:02:33.380> of

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
pixels wide and when I click one of

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.870 
pixels wide and when I click one of
those<00:02:33.530> buttons<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:34.130> just<00:02:34.310> sliding<00:02:34.580> this

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
those buttons it's just sliding this

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.550 
those buttons it's just sliding this
thing<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.390> left<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.870> right<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.440> know

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
thing to left and right you know

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.460 
thing to left and right you know
revealing<00:02:37.040> whichever<00:02:37.520> one<00:02:38.080> now<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.350> said

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
revealing whichever one now this is said

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.010 
revealing whichever one now this is said
to<00:02:39.650> be<00:02:39.770> somewhat<00:02:40.520> dynamic<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.750> other<00:02:41.900> thing

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
to be somewhat dynamic the other thing

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.070 
to be somewhat dynamic the other thing
is<00:02:42.110> not<00:02:42.140> dynamic<00:02:42.860> is<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> total<00:02:44.180> size<00:02:44.360> which<00:02:44.900> I

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
is not dynamic is the total size which I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.840 
is not dynamic is the total size which I
don't<00:02:45.230> mean<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.500> do<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.980> didn't<00:02:46.250> but

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
don't mean to do that so I didn't but

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.010 
don't mean to do that so I didn't but
this<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.120> JavaScript<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:47.780> all<00:02:47.930> it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
this is a JavaScript this is all it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.120 
this is a JavaScript this is all it
takes<00:02:48.170> as<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.530> matter<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.740> fact<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:48.980> only

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
takes as a matter of fact that only

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.310 
takes as a matter of fact that only
takes<00:02:49.460> this<00:02:49.880> much<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.450> do<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.690> carousel<00:02:51.110> this

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
takes this much to do the carousel this

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.990 
takes this much to do the carousel this
is<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.710> changing<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.310> classes<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:52.880> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
is just changing the classes so the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.820 
is just changing the classes so the
class<00:02:53.210> change<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.960> is<00:02:54.170> highlighted<00:02:54.740> right

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
class change that is highlighted right

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.830 
class change that is highlighted right
here<00:02:55.130> that's<00:02:55.820> changing<00:02:56.300> these<00:02:56.450> little<00:02:56.690> guys

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
here that's changing these little guys

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.350 
here that's changing these little guys
when<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.350> click<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.010> making<00:02:58.730> them<00:02:58.820> be<00:02:58.940> solid

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
when you click on making them be solid

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.530 
when you click on making them be solid
versus<00:02:59.780> empty<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.220> that's<00:03:01.490> doing<00:03:01.760> these<00:03:01.850> when

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
versus empty so that's doing these when

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.390 
versus empty so that's doing these when
you<00:03:02.630> click<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.960> removes<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.740> active<00:03:04.250> class

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
you click it removes the active class

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.450 
you click it removes the active class
and<00:03:04.940> then<00:03:05.420> adds<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.750> active<00:03:06.020> class<00:03:06.140> in<00:03:06.830> CSS<00:03:07.340> I

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
and then adds the active class in CSS I

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.220 
and then adds the active class in CSS I
have<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> active<00:03:07.970> class<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.360> be<00:03:08.480> like<00:03:08.720> fill<00:03:09.110> it

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
have the active class to be like fill it

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.920 
have the active class to be like fill it
in<00:03:09.320> basically<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> for<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.210> carousel<00:03:11.510> code

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
in basically so for the carousel code

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.470 
in basically so for the carousel code
right<00:03:12.170> here<00:03:12.520> all<00:03:13.520> I'm<00:03:13.790> doing<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.150> I'm<00:03:14.270> getting

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
right here all I'm doing is I'm getting

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.760 
right here all I'm doing is I'm getting
the<00:03:14.600> index<00:03:15.050> of<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.380> current<00:03:17.500> link<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.680> are

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
the index of the current link that are

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.130 
the index of the current link that are
clicking<00:03:19.070> on<00:03:19.130> so<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.730> 1<00:03:20.540> 2<00:03:20.750> &amp;<00:03:21.080> 3

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
clicking on so this is 1 2 &amp; 3

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.070 
clicking on so this is 1 2 &amp; 3
essentially<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.880> if<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.030> click<00:03:23.210> on<00:03:23.360> -<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:24.050> know

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
essentially so if I click on - you know

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.680 
essentially so if I click on - you know
that's<00:03:24.260> index<00:03:24.620> -<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.550> is<00:03:25.700> index<00:03:26.030> 3<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:26.570> is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
that's index - this is index 3 this is

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.680 
that's index - this is index 3 this is
the<00:03:26.810> next<00:03:27.080> one<00:03:27.490> and<00:03:28.490> so<00:03:29.180> what<00:03:29.300> I<00:03:29.330> do<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.600> I

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
the next one and so what I do is I

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.590 
the next one and so what I do is I
multiply<00:03:30.400> well<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.670> made<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.180> console<00:03:32.510> dot

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
multiply well I made this console dot

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.270 
multiply well I made this console dot
log<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.380> actually<00:03:33.890> it's<00:03:34.010> only<00:03:34.070> two

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
log in here so actually it's only two

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.840 
log in here so actually it's only two
lines<00:03:34.460> of<00:03:34.580> code<00:03:34.990> so<00:03:35.990> what<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.170> do<00:03:36.260> is<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:36.470> multiply

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
lines of code so what I do is I multiply

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.340 
lines of code so what I do is I multiply
the<00:03:37.850> index<00:03:38.240> so<00:03:38.630> if<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:38.870> were<00:03:38.990> to<00:03:39.050> click<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.290> this

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
the index so if I were to click on this

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.160 
the index so if I were to click on this
one<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.680> would<00:03:39.860> be<00:03:39.890> two<00:03:40.300> times<00:03:41.300> a<00:03:41.570> thousand<00:03:42.020> so

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
one it would be two times a thousand so

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.610 
one it would be two times a thousand so
give<00:03:42.410> me<00:03:42.470> two<00:03:42.500> thousand<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:44.959> just<00:03:45.200> animate

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
give me two thousand and I just animate

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.010 
give me two thousand and I just animate
the<00:03:45.770> margin<00:03:46.160> left<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:47.209> know<00:03:47.300> excitement<00:03:47.720> I'm

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
the margin left you know excitement I'm

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.690 
the margin left you know excitement I'm
sliding<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.680> left<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.400> give<00:03:49.580> it<00:03:49.670> a

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
sliding to the left and give it a

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.000 
sliding to the left and give it a
negative<00:03:49.850> there<00:03:50.300> and<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.140> when<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.470> click<00:03:51.650> on<00:03:51.830> -

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
negative there and so when I click on -

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.340 
negative there and so when I click on -
it<00:03:52.250> will<00:03:52.400> animate<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.880> 2,000<00:03:53.600> pixels<00:03:53.750> -<00:03:54.080> left

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
it will animate a 2,000 pixels - left

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.160 
it will animate a 2,000 pixels - left
click<00:03:55.100> on<00:03:55.310> three<00:03:55.550> it'll<00:03:55.850> do<00:03:56.000> 3000<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.810> click<00:03:56.990> on

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
click on three it'll do 3000 I click on

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.990 
click on three it'll do 3000 I click on
the<00:03:57.560> first<00:03:57.830> one<00:03:58.120> it'll<00:03:59.120> do<00:03:59.650> it'll<00:04:00.650> do<00:04:00.850> it'll<00:04:01.850> go

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
the first one it'll do it'll do it'll go

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.710 
the first one it'll do it'll do it'll go
back<00:04:02.150> here<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.600> beginning<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:04.270> that's<00:04:05.270> all

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
back here to the beginning so that's all

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.490 
back here to the beginning so that's all
the<00:04:05.900> code<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.530> there<00:04:07.400> is<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:07.640> carousel<00:04:08.240> I'm<00:04:09.170> not

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
the code and there is a carousel I'm not

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.170 
the code and there is a carousel I'm not
including<00:04:09.800> any<00:04:10.040> libraries<00:04:10.760> other<00:04:10.940> than

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
including any libraries other than

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.020 
including any libraries other than
jQuery<00:04:11.840> itself<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.740> this<00:04:13.340> is<00:04:13.490> literally<00:04:13.790> the

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
jQuery itself and this is literally the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.199 
jQuery itself and this is literally the
only<00:04:14.120> JavaScript<00:04:14.630> code<00:04:15.080> loaded<00:04:15.530> on<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.770> page

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
only JavaScript code loaded on the page

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.870 
only JavaScript code loaded on the page
so<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:18.140> can<00:04:18.290> build<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.560> carousel<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:19.310> two<00:04:19.700> lines

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
so you can build a carousel in two lines

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.590 
so you can build a carousel in two lines
of<00:04:20.090> code

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
of code

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.430 
of code
if<00:04:21.260> you

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440

to add these little guys up here that's
another<00:04:26.330> two<00:04:26.510> lines<00:04:26.690> code<00:04:26.930> but<00:04:27.560> uh<00:04:27.590> yeah

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100
