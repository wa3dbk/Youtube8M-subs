way it is you know we would settle for a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.259 
way it is you know we would settle for a
draw<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.280> there<00:03:10.519> who<00:03:10.760> should<00:03:10.969> say<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.150> won't

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
draw in there who should say we won't

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.670 
draw in there who should say we won't
get<00:03:11.450> one<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.750> mean<00:03:11.900> what<00:03:12.049> are<00:03:12.170> your<00:03:12.319> hopes<00:03:12.530> for

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
get one I mean what are your hopes for

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.289 
get one I mean what are your hopes for
Newcastle<00:03:13.219> this<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.459> ok<00:03:13.700> well<00:03:13.909> I<00:03:13.969> think<00:03:14.060> will

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
Newcastle this is ok well I think will

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.970 
Newcastle this is ok well I think will
do<00:03:14.420> well<00:03:14.450> i<00:03:14.659> think<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.139> know<00:03:15.200> when<00:03:15.650> i<00:03:15.680> look<00:03:15.889> at

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
do well i think you know when i look at

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.890 
do well i think you know when i look at
our<00:03:16.189> would<00:03:16.400> say<00:03:16.579> would<00:03:16.700> be<00:03:16.760> top<00:03:17.060> 10<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.840> i

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
our would say would be top 10 and i

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.699 
our would say would be top 10 and i
think<00:03:18.109> that<00:03:18.230> would<00:03:18.290> be<00:03:18.439> a<00:03:18.469> massive

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
think that would be a massive

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.849 
think that would be a massive
improvement<00:03:19.310> on<00:03:19.370> what<00:03:19.400> we<00:03:19.579> had<00:03:19.700> last
