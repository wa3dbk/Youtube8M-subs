00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello my name is john and with you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.440
 new season 6 strings is easy and so than 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.960
 does this and the giving season differ 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.480
 this past season we didn't have 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.539
 rack there was no soft box there were no cameras 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.730
 for 90 thousand well, although cameras for 90 thousand 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 we are not here now we have added sa bons 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 and so much that now do not shoot here 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.520
 this is all thanks to our great friends 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.149
 thank you for today's exercise 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.149
 such a 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.670
 in today's lesson 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.860
 And where to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.860
 here 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:06.879
 you can do something worth this exercise 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.879
 of which 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.329
 Now consider the principle of the game set 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.539
 Our first chord c hit the bass 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:27.890
 thumb strings then hook 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:30.700
 three lower strings then make a hummer on 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.700
 fourth string 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.870
 ipad3 bottom strings and so on with us 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.870
 repeated three times 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.060
 four other chords are played the same 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.060
 the very way 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:11.720
 the following code and come to the tonic then 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.310
 there is a chord c 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.690
 gradually in this chord we have you 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.500
 on 5 string 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:28.290
 hummer on 4 in the next chord we have 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:32.840
 goes bases on 4 hummer on 3 and in the last 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.000
 chord we have a pass by 6 to 5 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.860
 In principle, and all than they differ 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.299
 now you can safely pour 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:53.670
 cowboy hats boots two winchesters 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:54.410
