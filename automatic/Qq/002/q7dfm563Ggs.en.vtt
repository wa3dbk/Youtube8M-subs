they didn't route the pipe through the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.220 
they didn't route the pipe through the
crossmember<00:00:28.939> every<00:00:29.360> four-link<00:00:29.869> I've<00:00:30.050> ever

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
crossmember every four-link I've ever

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.770 
crossmember every four-link I've ever
put<00:00:30.560> on<00:00:30.590> had<00:00:31.250> pastors<00:00:31.970> for<00:00:32.239> three<00:00:32.629> inch

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780

put on had pastors for three inch
exhaust<00:00:32.989> hmm

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
exhaust hmm

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.619 
exhaust hmm
the<00:00:34.400> exhaust<00:00:34.730> is<00:00:34.970> routed<00:00:35.390> through<00:00:35.420> the

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
the exhaust is routed through the

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.479 
the exhaust is routed through the
crossmember<00:00:36.320> just<00:00:36.500> take<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.129> look<00:00:37.339> at<00:00:37.430> the

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
crossmember just take a look at the

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.640 
crossmember just take a look at the
pictures<00:00:37.910> or<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.180> episode<00:00:39.170> where<00:00:39.379> we<00:00:39.410> built

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
pictures or the episode where we built

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.320 
pictures or the episode where we built
the<00:00:39.800> exhaust<00:00:40.129> but<00:00:40.370> there's<00:00:40.519> provisions<00:00:40.760> going

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
the exhaust but there's provisions going

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.600 
the exhaust but there's provisions going
through<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.600> crossmember<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.309> three

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
through the crossmember for the three

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.640 
through the crossmember for the three
inch<00:00:43.760> exhaust<00:00:43.940> as<00:00:44.480> well<00:00:44.660> as<00:00:44.839> exhaust<00:00:45.170> mounting

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
inch exhaust as well as exhaust mounting

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.799 
inch exhaust as well as exhaust mounting
so<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:45.949> can<00:00:46.160> run<00:00:46.400> it<00:00:46.430> straight<00:00:47.390> out<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.690> back

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
so you can run it straight out the back

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.509 
so you can run it straight out the back
if<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.140> wanted<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.680> that's<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:49.370> how<00:00:49.489> we

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
if you wanted to that's just how we

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.700 
if you wanted to that's just how we
chose<00:00:49.909> to<00:00:50.180> do<00:00:50.329> it<00:00:50.480> it's<00:00:51.110> got<00:00:51.289> a<00:00:51.320> look<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.559> little

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
chose to do it it's got a look a little

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.770 
chose to do it it's got a look a little
closer<00:00:51.980> with<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.280> big<00:00:52.489> cruising<00:00:52.820> why<00:00:53.570> would

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
closer with the big cruising why would

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.810 
closer with the big cruising why would
anyone<00:00:53.989> want<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:54.379> run<00:00:54.620> their<00:00:54.800> exhaust<00:00:55.219> and<00:00:55.610> end

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
anyone want to run their exhaust and end

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.819 
anyone want to run their exhaust and end
it<00:00:56.059> under<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.510> vehicle<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.109> not<00:00:57.350> go<00:00:57.559> out<00:00:57.680> the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
it under the vehicle and not go out the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.220 
it under the vehicle and not go out the
side<00:00:58.100> or<00:00:58.430> all<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:58.940> way<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.270> back<00:00:59.449> it's

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
side or all the way to the back it's

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.959 
side or all the way to the back it's
just<00:01:00.350> kind<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.680> preference<00:01:01.100> ending<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.760> under

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
the car we've kind of turned it out to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.840 
the car we've kind of turned it out to
the<00:01:03.440> sides<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:03.859> gives<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.250> kind<00:01:04.399> of<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.610> cool

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
the sides it gives it kind of a cool

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.630 
the sides it gives it kind of a cool
Rumble<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:06.020> good<00:01:06.229> base<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:07.009> you'll<00:01:07.430> know

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
Rumble and a good base to it you'll know

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.219 
Rumble and a good base to it you'll know
it's<00:01:07.789> coming<00:01:08.149> it's<00:01:08.240> gonna<00:01:08.390> sound<00:01:08.690> cool

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
it's coming it's gonna sound cool

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.150 
it's coming it's gonna sound cool
it<00:01:09.590> needs<00:01:09.920> an<00:01:10.330> X<00:01:11.330> or<00:01:11.660> an<00:01:11.840> h-pipe<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.649> tailpipes

the<00:01:14.030> drone<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.479> going<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.840> be<00:01:14.960> horrible<00:01:15.440> on<00:01:15.679> the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
the drone is going to be horrible on the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.800 
the drone is going to be horrible on the
highway<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:16.460> think<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.000> truck<00:01:17.240> sounds<00:01:17.600> just

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
highway I think the truck sounds just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.450 
highway I think the truck sounds just
fine<00:01:18.080> I<00:01:18.110> don't<00:01:18.410> know<00:01:18.470> what<00:01:18.619> John<00:01:18.860> Kaase<00:01:19.190> his

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
fine I don't know what John Kaase his

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.600 
fine I don't know what John Kaase his
experiences<00:01:20.210> with<00:01:20.619> exhaust<00:01:21.619> or<00:01:21.950> motors<00:01:22.280> I'm

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
experiences with exhaust or motors I'm

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.130 
experiences with exhaust or motors I'm
sure<00:01:23.060> he<00:01:23.149> doesn't<00:01:23.479> have<00:01:23.660> a<00:01:23.690> whole<00:01:23.899> lot<00:01:24.110> of

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
sure he doesn't have a whole lot of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.469 
sure he doesn't have a whole lot of
experience<00:01:24.530> at<00:01:24.979> it<00:01:25.160> but<00:01:25.369> we're<00:01:26.060> happy<00:01:26.270> with

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
experience at it but we're happy with

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.270 
experience at it but we're happy with
the<00:01:26.539> way<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:26.810> came<00:01:27.050> out<00:01:27.259> yep<00:01:27.530> we've<00:01:28.099> done

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
the way it came out yep we've done

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.400 
the way it came out yep we've done
plenty<00:01:28.429> exhaust<00:01:28.880> with<00:01:29.090> X<00:01:29.450> pipes<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:29.990> H<00:01:30.080> pipes

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
plenty exhaust with X pipes and H pipes

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.320 
plenty exhaust with X pipes and H pipes
but<00:01:30.709> you<00:01:31.130> know<00:01:31.190> some<00:01:31.429> of<00:01:31.550> them<00:01:31.670> are<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.209> know

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
but you know some of them are you know

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.120 
but you know some of them are you know
different<00:01:32.569> budgets<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.440> different<00:01:33.709> styles

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
different budgets and different styles

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.529 
different budgets and different styles
and<00:01:34.280> that's<00:01:34.429> just<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.729> way<00:01:34.819> we<00:01:34.970> chose<00:01:35.209> to<00:01:35.390> do

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
and that's just the way we chose to do

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.029 
and that's just the way we chose to do
yeah<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:36.020> usually<00:01:36.170> get<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.619> drawing<00:01:36.920> from

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
yeah you usually get the drawing from

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:50.520 
yeah you usually get the drawing from
too<00:01:37.280> long<00:01:37.459> of<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.700> tailpipe<00:01:37.910> so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.020 

talking<00:01:51.530> about<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.860> engine<00:01:52.400> people<00:01:52.790> were

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
talking about the engine people were

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.190 
talking about the engine people were
wondering<00:01:53.300> about<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.600> amount<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.840> horsepower

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
wondering about the amount of horsepower

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.160 
wondering about the amount of horsepower
nobody<00:01:55.100> ever<00:01:55.280> said<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.880> wish<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:56.479> had<00:01:56.659> less<00:01:56.900> power

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
nobody ever said I wish I had less power

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.570 
nobody ever said I wish I had less power
that's<00:01:57.770> exactly<00:01:58.370> right

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
that's exactly right

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.120 
that's exactly right
percent<00:01:59.210> right<00:01:59.450> and<00:02:00.200> always<00:02:00.350> press<00:02:00.800> on<00:02:01.010> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
percent right and always press on the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.730 
percent right and always press on the
throttle<00:02:01.580> harder<00:02:02.000> or<00:02:02.060> softer<00:02:02.330> but<00:02:02.750> hard<00:02:03.680> to

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
throttle harder or softer but hard to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.150 
throttle harder or softer but hard to
add<00:02:03.979> more<00:02:04.159> horsepower<00:02:04.640> about<00:02:05.420> 500<00:02:06.260> more<00:02:06.979> than

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
add more horsepower about 500 more than

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.699 
add more horsepower about 500 more than
that's<00:02:07.310> dumb<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.970> just<00:02:08.240> break<00:02:08.479> stuff<00:02:08.810> 500<00:02:09.619> is

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
that's dumb and just break stuff 500 is

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.590
