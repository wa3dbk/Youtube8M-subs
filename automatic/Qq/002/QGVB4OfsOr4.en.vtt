 welcome all subscribers to the channel here 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 fans with you hamish this transfer light 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.710
 digest which always take off some 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.570
 useful fresh and interesting news 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.340
 today's release you will recognize the sudden 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.670
 about m46 patton 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.210
 when does fv215b fv replace 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:29.730
 4202 when there will be new tests of physics and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:31.949
 much more have been around for a long time 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.200
 rumors that the hangar will soon appear 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.420
 very important change carousel tanks 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 for now all this in distant plans but 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.379
 happy that the developers do not deny 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.670
 the fact that this is now underway 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.710
 serious development vk 4502 aw 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 or just alpha sneakers going 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.449
 a little apnut or rather patch him 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.340
 machine gun embrasure when moving away 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.910
 that is, in the forehead of the body alpha sneaker 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.350
 will become one less zone 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.840
 developers don't want to reveal the future 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.489
 details of the breakdown nerf and all 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.290
 This is due to the fact that the tank blogger 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.720
 very quickly spread about it 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.490
 news i'm by the way including many k 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.220
 Unfortunately, they did not understand that they were 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.510
 but early tests, and he is not breaking in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 the result will be very different 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
 because of this rose 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.180
 a lot of war in what is naturally not 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 pretty developers so now 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.710
 any details of the breakthrough nerf we 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.170
 very soon we will find out 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.140
 generally float with the general test but 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.090
 but it is known for sure that the patch 98 nerf 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.670
 No break through and most likely 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.640
 will have to wait for either 99 or something else 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.759
 farther on going survive longtime 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.790
 Nagon m46 patton will get a small 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.450
 about dpm will increase by about 100 units 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.930
 spread less pine 38 to 0 37 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.970
 and time information from 2 and 2 seconds to 1 and 9 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.189
 In general, it is certainly not very weighty 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.500
 numbers but nevertheless any about it 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.869
 well in addition to this and booking 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 tank will get a little better but about this you 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.290
 already for 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.070
 These developers have learned that 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.410
 one hundred percent after the introduction of the patch 098 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.810
 tests will be held soon 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.670
 new physics of the movement of tanks we all 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.680
 Remember that this physics turned out just 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.290
 gorgeous it remains only to wait 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.170
 before the new test which will be more likely 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.180
 just final and after that in patch 99 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.790
 most likely a new physics engine 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.580
 for release despite the fact that now 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.560
 work is underway on new physics and on 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.959
 havok and we are from a bunch a bunch a bunch than 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.660
 developers have already managed to complete 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.070
 work on a new sound engine but to 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.410
 Sorry so far because of the lack 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.900
 some kind of weighty content it 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.640
 they are not going to enter well anyway 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.510
 remains the fact of a new sound engine 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.280
 ready and that's cool all the expected replacement 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.100
 fv 4202 on centurion action x fv215b on 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.470
 Chiften in the next patches will not appear 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.810
 but still developers have plans then 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.880
 so that these tanks appear at least in this 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.459
 so there is a very big chance 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.890
 the fact that they will appear in about patch 9 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.720
 10 or maybe a little later in any 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.620
 occasionally work on it for a long time 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.540
 then the output will be something suitable 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.100
 it is also known for certain that after the patch 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 from 999 10 and 9 11 will not be 100 that is 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.010
 numbering is almost likely to go 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.140
 further will be 912 913 and so on and this 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.350
 many also shares of that moment when 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.299
 All the same, there will be a version 1 0 0 okay 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.239
 since the developers decided so means 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.120
 so need either version 100 getting ready 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.829
 something really cool on this 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.720
 today's release of easy digest 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.239
 ends hope you were interested 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.220
 you were rude do not forget to put 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.110
 Like under the video write your opinion in 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.850

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.380
 also on the channel here's a fan good luck to you success
