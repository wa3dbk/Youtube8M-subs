00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
it on the collar and then on the

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.960 
it on the collar and then on the

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
Americans layer them but I just I don't

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.680 
Americans layer them but I just I don't
know<00:06:44.039> it<00:06:44.160> might<00:06:44.310> just<00:06:44.340> be<00:06:44.639> me<00:06:44.789> that<00:06:44.820> doesn't<00:06:45.330> me
