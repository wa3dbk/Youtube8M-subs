really quick oh I'm so glad that this

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.639 
really quick oh I'm so glad that this
one<00:01:47.850> has<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> pump<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.350> always

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
one has a pump because this one always

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.530 
one has a pump because this one always
kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.100> spills<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.210> soon<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
kind of like spills out as soon as you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.510 
kind of like spills out as soon as you
open<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.009> did<00:01:53.130> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
open it which is what it just did just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.069 
open it which is what it just did just
now<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.240> colors<00:01:54.600> aren't<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.530> an<00:01:55.860> exact

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
now the colors aren't really an exact

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.929 
now the colors aren't really an exact
match<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.380> don't<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> formula<00:01:59.490> seems<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
match I don't think the formula seems to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.550 
match I don't think the formula seems to
be<00:02:00.030> exactly<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> same<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:01.229> lightweight

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
be exactly the same really lightweight

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.350 
be exactly the same really lightweight
which<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.670> love

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
which I really love

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.149 
which I really love
I<00:02:03.560> love<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.950> formula<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.640> these

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
I love the formula on these

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.749 
I love the formula on these
which<00:02:06.249> is<00:02:06.840> why<00:02:07.840> I'm<00:02:07.899> such<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> huge<00:02:08.440> fan<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:09.459> if

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
which is why I'm such a huge fan but if

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.770 
which is why I'm such a huge fan but if
you<00:02:10.030> can<00:02:10.269> see<00:02:10.479> these<00:02:10.690> swatches<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.660> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
you can see these swatches this is the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.830 
you can see these swatches this is the
old<00:02:13.959> one<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.920> new<00:02:15.099> one<00:02:15.840> they

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.780 
old one and this is the new one they
definitely<00:02:17.110> look<00:02:17.410> different<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.040> new<00:02:18.220> one<00:02:18.459> is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
definitely look different the new one is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.330 
definitely look different the new one is
less<00:02:19.150> red<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.650> looks<00:02:20.860> more<00:02:21.099> of<00:02:21.129> like<00:02:21.310> a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
less red and looks more of like a

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.360 
less red and looks more of like a
neutral<00:02:21.940> color<00:02:22.540> or<00:02:22.959> undertone<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:24.099> that<00:02:24.340> a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
neutral color or undertone it's that a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.550 
neutral color or undertone it's that a
such<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.030> warm<00:02:25.450> undertone<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:25.989> there<00:02:26.319> might<00:02:26.530> be

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
such a warm undertone so there might be

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.449 
such a warm undertone so there might be
a<00:02:26.709> good<00:02:26.920> thing

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.160 
love that it will give me a matte finish
so<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.700> can't<00:03:42.000> wait<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.390> do<00:03:42.510> an<00:03:42.599> eye<00:03:42.780> look<00:03:43.019> with

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
so I can't wait to do an eye look with

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.539 
so I can't wait to do an eye look with
this<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.560> I'll<00:03:43.620> probably<00:03:43.799> record<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.370> tutorial

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
this and I'll probably record a tutorial

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.210 
this and I'll probably record a tutorial
because<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.599> don't<00:03:46.290> know<00:03:46.349> it's<00:03:46.560> gorgeous<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.040> I

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
because I don't know it's gorgeous and I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.369 
because I don't know it's gorgeous and I
think<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.549> would<00:03:47.700> look<00:03:47.730> good<00:03:48.170> brown<00:03:49.170> skin

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
think this would look good brown skin

that I have this one is golden and I

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.020 
that I have this one is golden and I
went<00:04:07.709> ahead<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.010> picked<00:04:08.340> up<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.640> golden

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
went ahead and picked up the golden

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.210 
went ahead and picked up the golden
medium<00:04:09.450> just<00:04:09.720> because<00:04:10.079> this<00:04:10.620> one<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:10.950> little

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
medium just because this one is a little

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.149 
medium just because this one is a little
bit<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:11.730> can<00:04:11.879> tell<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.389> little<00:04:12.690> yellow<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.500> not

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
bit you can tell a little yellow and not

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.039 
bit you can tell a little yellow and not
exactly<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.730> perfect<00:04:14.909> color<00:04:15.239> match<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.750> am

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
exactly a perfect color match I am

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.779 
exactly a perfect color match I am
wearing<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.560> today<00:04:16.709> though<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.489> doesn't

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
wearing it today though so it doesn't

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.670 
wearing it today though so it doesn't
look<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.180> off<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.169> I<00:04:19.229> just<00:04:19.260> thought<00:04:19.620> that

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
look that off but I just thought that

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.979 
look that off but I just thought that
the<00:04:19.919> golden<00:04:20.310> medium<00:04:20.669> would<00:04:21.269> be<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.510> better

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
the golden medium would be a better

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.830 
the golden medium would be a better
color<00:04:22.949> match<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:23.490> I'm<00:04:23.580> excited<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.180> get<00:04:24.419> try

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
