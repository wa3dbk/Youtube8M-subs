00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.519
 my 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.519
 the glass farm in appearance one 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.739
 much discussed object the one spits it 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.929
 out and the other one always embraces it 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.179
 more people now find it straining to it 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.559
 rising up is the project really bad 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.040
 become interesting 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.260
 but their always negative opinions 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.510
 the one who invented it must 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.339
 crawl on his knees 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.559
 make him there so apologize it's it 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.699
 biggest mistake she ever made that separation 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.050
 made it the biggest 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.050
 make a scandal shine 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.680
 why lie down and lie sand ram 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.809
 market field 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.600
 mark train but we had a show 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.119
 beautiful breed they should have left 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.769
 let this add even more misery 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.570
 the middle class 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.600
 it is not to let there is so 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.880
 many vacancies and the nicest part 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.680
 they're selling that congregation but 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.140
 to give away 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.210
 we give display 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.400
 if you count what this ultimately 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.200
 just bring the mo and if you go now 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.420
 view that the businessmen who do it 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.399
 have bought can see how we care 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.960
 but then also skates 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.310
 parking spaces there with we are one 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.580
 other entrepreneur himself 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.280
 parking lot had to ensure they never miss 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.010
 management and miss manage your parties 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.990
 then this is something of first class well your 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.060
 believe who his fault is this him 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.710
 well the one who fits the shoe pull it 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.900
 and let the one who is there 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.340
 responsible for those who know 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.510
 best who they are 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.479
 we will not be after a cross again 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.090
 throw every one 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.220
 sham will agree that this is it 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.659
 biggest list management has been as 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.580
 she once did and seem like it soon 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.210
 you will go shopping once 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.470
 here if it is open then the village and 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.840
 we will have to learn to live with it and 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.100
 appear lamy 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.680
 in mean the building won't leave 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.970
 to think but is ever Sinterklaas 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.140
 played the municipality of appearance 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.819
 on with this project 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.840
 we are now just fifteen minutes up 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.269
 the building site at the glass farm 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.310
 appearances and we have many opinions 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.959
 already heard and i must say he 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.390
 opinion are indeed divided even though we 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.040
 now in that principle more positive 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.890
 have had negative reactions 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.200
 reactions the glass farm is there will 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.810
 there are and will remain for later 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.249
 from December in a complete picture and 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.299
 when it opens exactly that 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.080
 hear and later but I want to agree 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.730
 through 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.100
 a nice response from a violin 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.570
 to hear sir shines through to 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.130
 in heart and soul what do you think of the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.270
 farm yes in itself I think so 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.390
 That's great, man 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.400
 it the complex is actually very much 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.020
 straw compared to 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.180
 to the beautiful church and it completely falls 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.090
 so clearly nothing to see anymore 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.440
 from this side yes yes and that is possible 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.030
 but after four 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.190
 all those people who come to drive because of this 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.630
 they see that I no longer like the church 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.790
 I also heard what you say drive on 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.620
 that this is just going to be car-free 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.770
 yes the market wali yes but here will 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.640
 I do think to keep it as rich as the 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.900
 ask them 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.459
 think where the municipalities should go 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.170
 but not according to me or 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.600
 car-free lesson number 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.750
 market quarter outdoor your ideas but 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.010
 the here still more than wrong there then 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.540
 I do not know either 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.890
 if it states a moment ago and because you are the u 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.840
 says, well I do n't think so 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.530
 wrong I think you are not very big 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.910
 really negative 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.459
 you're not mad either 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:36.430
 in between you may like me I think so 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.220
 an asset to appearances 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.720
 so look at the terraces later 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.500
 is you're here to do once 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.989
 find a cup of coffee 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.600
 I am prone to windows in that 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.220
 coffee go byee mommy tv73 hours 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.330
 t the cup of coffee and the cake is free 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.989
 to thank you behind me at the head of 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.730
 South 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.709
 for example here comes on the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.180
 ground floor and part on the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.600
 first floor with an open vi de 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.519
 grand café alles café jan van amstel 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.200
 named after the seafarer who is in the 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.480
 large church next door 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.310
 we buried a familiar appearance 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.530
 to Jan van Amstel with his all 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.690
 scarface 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.580
 tv73 continues to follow this construction but we 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.290
 are also going to talk first with the 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.940
 to see how it projects 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.229
 and what needs to happen 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.020
 have been the setbacks 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.550
 We hear that the performer 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.850
 highest point has been reached 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.639
 yes the front point and for Friday week 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.849
 reach and 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.020
 a little mutual 4 earlier 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.999
 do n't pay too much attention to that 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.770
 spent at that time 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.580
 and now comes the steel construction 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.639
 around it 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.409
 now you see how big it is now coming 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.199
 an image of you that the total picture 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.669
 is going to be on the square i think if 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.259
 the glass will be up in no time at all 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.840
 a much nicer image is going to be like 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.999
 what did him in 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.219
 it's about how many cups is this 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.229
 complete picture 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:59.330
 directing a lot of them it is best there 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.860
 many are three floors is case one 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.710
 two floors total and then you have 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.840
 another piece of technical space at the top 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.189
 yes they are quite a few cups especially 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.379
 because retail premises are your eyes 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.379
 floor and so there are things 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.090
 that have been disappointing in the 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.979
 situation where you are now 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.990
 no we do not really have setbacks 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.189
 let's go yes i always have a reasonable one 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.810
 had good weather 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.580
 so basically all this just runs 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.000
 according to plan and also good when 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:30.650
 goes the champagne bottles to the side 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.449
 off when gp finished yes that she avoided 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.779
 December I should have been driving with it 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.129
 pand yes i would like the dates there still 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.419
 a bit after what the stores all 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.110
 want of course 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.639
 and of course what the possible 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.080
 winter weather and what to do after it 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.729
 winter weather then we are of course one 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.270
 bit for when pee is closed 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.129
 is then we are the winter ahead and that 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.279
 But the problem is not there but there are 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.649
 There are demands from the tenants who still have it 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:57.110
 must be taken so it drops 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:58.969
 data we are not there yet as far 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.460
 people so many people so many people 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.680
 many wishes of course I had 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.689
 many more jobs here 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.839
 appearance because new stores are coming 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.270
 the hospitality comes the one as far as I am 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:13.759
 have understood a gym above 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.949
 in short, appearance gets a unique one 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.750
 projects or put the Japanese there 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.219
 large coach buses for 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.740
 probably that is the question 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.069
 just let's be honest and honest 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.529
 being 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.120
 it is a super unique project and 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:29.180
 it has the glass farmhouse 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.020
 this still rose for tv73 the channel 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.020
 put ge bosch and environment
