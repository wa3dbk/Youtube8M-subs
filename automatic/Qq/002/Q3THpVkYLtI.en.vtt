from<00:00:35.309> us<00:00:35.460> love<00:00:35.820> stick<00:00:36.120> they<00:00:36.780> handle<00:00:37.140> any

awesomely<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.640> made<00:00:42.149> my<00:00:42.300> landing<00:00:42.690> gear<00:00:42.719> from

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
awesomely I made my landing gear from

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.619 
awesomely I made my landing gear from
coat<00:00:43.590> hangers<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.340> they<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.030> attached<00:00:45.300> with

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
coat hangers and they are attached with

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.330 
coat hangers and they are attached with
rubber<00:00:45.870> bands<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> rubber<00:00:46.770> ends<00:00:47.190> are

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
rubber bands and the rubber ends are

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.060 
rubber bands and the rubber ends are
definitely<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.180> very<00:00:48.600> nice<00:00:48.989> way<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> attach<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
definitely a very nice way to attach the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.310 
definitely a very nice way to attach the
landing<00:00:50.489> gear<00:00:50.730> they<00:00:51.270> add<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> lot<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.930> spring

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
landing gear they add a lot of spring

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.920 
landing gear they add a lot of spring
and<00:00:52.530> absorb<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> lot<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> impact<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.300> use<00:00:54.750> an

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and absorb a lot of the impact I use an

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.040 
and absorb a lot of the impact I use an
800<00:00:55.350> million<00:00:55.649> 3s<00:00:56.160> battery<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.510> gives<00:00:57.899> me

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
800 million 3s battery and that gives me

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
800 million 3s battery and that gives me
about<00:00:58.410> 10<00:00:58.649> minutes<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> flight<00:00:59.280> time<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.699> least

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
about 10 minutes of flight time at least

about 10 minutes of flight time at least
the<00:01:00.629> nut<00:01:00.780> ball<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> FT<00:01:01.500> fly<00:01:01.739> are

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the nut ball in the FT fly are

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
the nut ball in the FT fly are
definitely<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> most<00:01:02.609> easiest<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> build<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
definitely the most easiest to build and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
definitely the most easiest to build and
fly<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.500> nut<00:01:04.680> ball<00:01:04.860> actually<00:01:05.400> only<00:01:05.580> takes<00:01:05.850> 2

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
fly the nut ball actually only takes 2

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.260 
fly the nut ball actually only takes 2
pieces<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.720> build<00:01:07.130> they<00:01:08.130> both<00:01:08.340> absorb<00:01:08.640> crashes

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
pieces to build they both absorb crashes

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
pieces to build they both absorb crashes
very<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.369> very

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
very very well and are very very

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030 
very very well and are very very
forgiving<00:01:12.299> planes<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:13.170> oh<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.409> only<00:01:13.799> use

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
forgiving planes they oh they only use

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.190 
forgiving planes they oh they only use
elevator<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> rudder<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.330> control<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.020> which

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
elevator and rudder for control of which

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.429 
elevator and rudder for control of which
they<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.920> easily<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.520> loops<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> rolls

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
they can easily do loops and rolls

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.010 
they can easily do loops and rolls
whereas<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.890> delta<00:01:20.520> uses<00:01:21.119> Ella<00:01:21.360> vans<00:01:21.630> for

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
whereas the delta uses Ella vans for

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.310 
whereas the delta uses Ella vans for
control<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.710> has<00:01:23.460> an<00:01:23.610> actual<00:01:23.909> KF<00:01:24.509> step<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
control and has an actual KF step on it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.679 
control and has an actual KF step on it
so<00:01:26.250> please<00:01:26.460> enjoy<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.909> flight<00:01:27.119> footage<00:01:27.479> from

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
so please enjoy the flight footage from

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.780 
so please enjoy the flight footage from
all<00:01:27.840> these<00:01:27.930> planes<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> enjoy<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.549> I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
all these planes and if you enjoy this I

00:01:29.790 --> 00:04:20.390 
all these planes and if you enjoy this I
alike<00:01:30.240> would<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.810> appreciated

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
so I made another YouTube account about

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.350 
so I made another YouTube account about
a<00:04:22.500> month<00:04:22.770> ago<00:04:22.919> called<00:04:23.340> other<00:04:23.580> ghost<00:04:23.850> riders<00:04:24.210> or

make<00:04:31.669> so<00:04:32.669> if<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.880> can<00:04:33.000> check<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.240> out<00:04:33.449> that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
make so if you can check that out that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.320 
make so if you can check that out that
would<00:04:34.620> be<00:04:34.650> awesome<00:04:34.919> I'll<00:04:35.729> probably<00:04:36.000> have<00:04:36.240> a

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
would be awesome I'll probably have a
