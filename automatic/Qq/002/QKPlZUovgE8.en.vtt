00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.750 
pretty nice right there if you get a 360
view<00:04:09.640> on<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.860> now<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:11.890> believe<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.489> actually

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
view on that now I believe this actually

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.940 
view on that now I believe this actually
lights<00:04:13.329> up<00:04:13.630> bad<00:04:13.810> as<00:04:13.930> well<00:04:14.170> so<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.440> get<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.799> just

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
lights up bad as well so I get to just

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.500 
lights up bad as well so I get to just
put<00:04:15.130> some<00:04:15.160> batteries<00:04:15.760> on<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.060> back<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.299> believe

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
put some batteries on the back I believe

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.170 
put some batteries on the back I believe
and<00:04:16.959> on<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.829> middle<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.430> actually<00:04:18.729> lights<00:04:18.910> up

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
and on the middle it actually lights up

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.820 
and on the middle it actually lights up
so<00:04:19.479> that's<00:04:20.320> pretty<00:04:20.620> nice<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:22.090> back<00:04:22.330> view<00:04:22.830> of

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830
