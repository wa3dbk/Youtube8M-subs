Namaskar!
Welcome to Nishmadhulika.com

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.642
Today we will make Idli in a microwave oven.

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.964
Let’s start making Idli in a microwave oven.

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.674
3 cups idli’s batter.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:24.763
½ tsp salt.

00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:27.926
1 tsp oil.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.834
To cook microwave idli’s we’ll take microwave safe idli maker.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.240
These are the moulds and this is the lid to the container.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:54.940
Apply some oil with your hands in the moulds.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.500
mix salt in the batter.

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:11.788
This batter is a fermented batter. To make the batter take 1/3th part of the rice and 1/4 th part of split black beans.

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:19.462
Clean them and keep them overnight in water and grind them separately.

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:26.501
Rice should be thickly grinded and split black beans very finely. Mix them both.

00:01:27.077 --> 00:01:37.501
In summers, out them aside for 12 hours the batter will be ready and fermented.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:43.197
But in winters its takes about 20-24 hours for the batter to ferment.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:50.032
Put 200 gram water in the dish and put the batte in each mould.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:09.326
Place the mould in the dish.

00:02:10.537 --> 00:02:20.527
Fill the other mould also and set it on top of the other.

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:25.460
Cover it with a lid.

00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:41.953
Keep it in the microwave for 4 minutes in the highest degree temperature.

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:52.152
It’s done now we’ll take it out.

00:02:55.307 --> 00:03:09.225
Leave it for 2 minutes because when food comes out from the oven it is still cooking.

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:43.329
The idli’s are ready to eat now.

00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:47.537
It looks very delicious and spongy.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:53.158
Serve it with peanut chutney and sambhar.

00:03:53.258 --> 00:04:00.551
