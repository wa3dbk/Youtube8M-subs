00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.960
 We offer our clients extensive 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.070
 variety in polyethylene bags 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.820
 Low and high density in various sizes 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.820

 mining state institutions 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.900
 municipalities among others 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.259
 Our production is made up of 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.770
 printing extrusion processes and 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.770
 sealed 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.619
 and extrusion 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.680
 it is a continuous process by which the 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.650
 resin is subjected to high temperatures 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.290
 to melt them by the action of these and 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.650
 of friction 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.420
 then she is forced to go through a die that 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.680
 provides you with forms and measures 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.270
 defined by default 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.270
 forming the polyethylene sleeve 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.979
 when mixing the resin with additives from 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.289
 color called masterbatch too 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.899
 we can give a lot of colors to 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.539
 these low polyethylene sleeves and 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.319
 high density according to the 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.299
 demands of our customers 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:11.069
 finally this coil is cooled to 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.069
 avoid permanent deformations 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.570
 yes 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.590
 Print 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.360
 process by which you get it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.819
 the flexographic ink to the surface of 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.980
 the polyethylene coil passing it to 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.900
 through our printing machine that 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.590
 has an image carrier 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.170
 porous or clips sets 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.360
 using liquid inks according to 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.360
 Design defined by our customers 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.000
 Our printing machine can realize 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.090
 Prints of up to 6 colors counting 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.650
 with specialized equipment to measure and 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.659
 control the color 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.750
 keeping an accurate record and a 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.660
 uniform attention achieving impressions 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.590
 of photographic quality 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.550
 yes 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.830
 sealed 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.050
 Our modern machinery allows us 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.840
 perform various types of sealing as 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.610
 seal stamp lateral seal stamp 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.070
 reinforced and more we can also give to 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.510
 our final product finished with gauze

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.370
 Protect the environment 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.370
 we recycle the excess plastic of the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.819
 productive process and we reuse it in 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.430
 the manufacture of more bags reducing 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.579
 maximize the impact on the environment 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.239
 environment thus demonstrating another of 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:56.310
 our strengths our commitment 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.310
