00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
lifted before so this is 135 pounds it's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.859 
lifted before so this is 135 pounds it's
it's<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:23.640> moderately<00:00:24.119> heavy<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.539> might<00:00:24.720> have

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it's it's moderately heavy we might have

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.500 
it's it's moderately heavy we might have
to<00:00:24.960> lighten<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.300> first

their own way walk up to the bar and
stand<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.780> pick<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
stand up with it just pick it up in the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.560 
stand up with it just pick it up in the
starting<00:00:34.770> position<00:00:36.920> good<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.540> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
starting position good all right so I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
starting position good all right so I
always<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.050> start<00:00:40.200> teaching<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
always like to start teaching the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.639 
always like to start teaching the
deadlift<00:00:41.610> from<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> top<00:00:42.180> down<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> number

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
deadlift from the top down for a number

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.060 
deadlift from the top down for a number
of<00:00:43.680> reasons<00:00:44.180> number<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.649> you're

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
of reasons number one of which is you're

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.770 
of reasons number one of which is you're
always<00:00:47.370> stronger<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> eccentric<00:00:48.750> portion

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
always stronger in the eccentric portion

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.319 
always stronger in the eccentric portion
of<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> movement<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.250> by<00:00:50.489> having<00:00:50.730> him<00:00:51.090> get

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of a movement so by having him get

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
of a movement so by having him get
everything<00:00:51.570> tight<00:00:52.050> from<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> top<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.129> then

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
everything tight from the top and then

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.420 
everything tight from the top and then
ask<00:00:54.030> him<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> hold<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.469> slowly<00:00:55.860> lowers

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
ask him to hold it as he slowly lowers

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.760 
ask him to hold it as he slowly lowers
it<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:58.020> easier<00:00:58.500> than

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it is going to be a bit easier than

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
it is going to be a bit easier than
trying<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.219> him<00:00:59.399> tight<00:00:59.640> from<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> bottom

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
trying to get him tight from the bottom

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.330 
trying to get him tight from the bottom
and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.930> use<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> concentric<00:01:01.920> portion<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and then use the concentric portion of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.969 
and then use the concentric portion of
the<00:01:02.430> movement<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.750> train<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> form<00:01:04.409> so

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the movement to to train the form so

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.410 
the movement to to train the form so
training<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> form<00:01:05.640> from<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> top<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.240> little

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
training the form from the top is little

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.840 
training the form from the top is little
easier<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.840> tired<00:01:07.080> already<00:01:09.500> hang<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.619> there

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
easier get tired already hang out there

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.020 
easier get tired already hang out there
good

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
good

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
good
so<00:01:12.409> like<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:15.619> eccentric

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so like if that's what is eccentric

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
so like if that's what is eccentric
portion<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> look<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.420> about

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
portion of the look like what is about

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.300 
portion of the look like what is about
to<00:01:18.810> look<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.250> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
to look like I know you got a lot of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.100 
to look like I know you got a lot of
 work<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.570> three<00:01:24.570> places<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
 work to do so three places that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.539 
 work to do so three places that
we<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> bar<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> touch<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.369> it's

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
we want the bar to touch right now it's

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
we want the bar to touch right now it's
only<00:01:26.640> touching<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.450> teetering<00:01:27.780> right

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
only touching one it's teetering right

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
only touching one it's teetering right
on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> middle<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.920> his<00:01:29.009> back<00:01:29.220> meaning

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
on the middle of his back meaning

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090 
on the middle of his back meaning
there's<00:01:30.299> too<00:01:31.229> much<00:01:31.380> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.680> too<00:01:31.920> much

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
there's too much kind of too much

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.850 
there's too much kind of too much
flexion<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:32.750> too<00:01:33.750> much<00:01:33.900> extension<00:01:34.530> too<00:01:34.710> much

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
flexion here too much extension too much

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
flexion here too much extension too much
extension<00:01:35.490> right<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> do

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
extension right so what we got to do

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
extension right so what we got to do
who's<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> balance<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.400> bit

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
who's going to balance this out a bit

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.980 
who's going to balance this out a bit
there<00:01:39.030> should<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> twenty<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
there should be about a twenty to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.990 
there should be about a twenty to
twenty-two<00:01:40.619> degree<00:01:41.189> curve<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.670> each<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.939> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
twenty-two degree curve in each one of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.859 
twenty-two degree curve in each one of
the<00:01:42.150> portions<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> spine<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> believe<00:01:44.869> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the portions of the spine I believe the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
the portions of the spine I believe the
first<00:01:46.259> way<00:01:46.619> an<00:01:47.009> easiest<00:01:47.399> way<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.759> this

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
first way an easiest way to get this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.060 
first way an easiest way to get this
process<00:01:48.119> started<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:49.079> by<00:01:49.259> putting<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:49.649> fingers

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
process started is by putting my fingers

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.620 
process started is by putting my fingers
on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> bottom<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.700> his<00:01:50.790> shoulder<00:01:51.119> blades<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
on the bottom of his shoulder blades and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.380 
on the bottom of his shoulder blades and
saying<00:01:52.409> bring<00:01:52.860> my<00:01:53.070> fingers<00:01:53.579> together

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
saying bring my fingers together

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.190 
saying bring my fingers together
I<00:01:54.570> almost<00:01:55.049> some<00:01:55.380> drawing<00:01:55.799> down<00:01:57.079> into<00:01:58.079> this

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
I almost some drawing down into this

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
I almost some drawing down into this
area<00:01:58.500> time<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:58.860> palpating<00:01:59.520> those<00:01:59.670> scapula

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
area time really palpating those scapula

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
area time really palpating those scapula
adductors<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.750> told<00:02:00.930> him<00:02:01.049> told<00:02:01.380> him

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
adductors like I told him told him

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.999 
adductors like I told him told him
before<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.369> bring<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.640> together<00:02:03.979> he's<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
before now bring it together he's a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.709 
before now bring it together he's a
strong<00:02:05.369> dude<00:02:05.670> he's<00:02:05.880> pretty<00:02:06.060> athletic

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
strong dude he's pretty athletic

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.330 
strong dude he's pretty athletic
you<00:02:07.290> could<00:02:07.409> probably<00:02:07.500> maintain<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.190> but

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you could probably maintain that but

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.059 
you could probably maintain that but
what<00:02:08.429> I'm<00:02:08.550> also<00:02:08.700> gonna<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.830> he's<00:02:10.830> getting

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
what I'm also gonna do he's getting

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.530 
what I'm also gonna do he's getting
tired<00:02:11.300> grab<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> again<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.810> time<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:13.050> your

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
tired grab it again this time with your

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.730 
tired grab it again this time with your
yeah<00:02:15.540> with<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:15.930> palms<00:02:16.140> up<00:02:16.319> now<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.500> reason

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
yeah with your palms up now the reason

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.960 
yeah with your palms up now the reason
why<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> asked<00:02:17.100> him<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> do<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> palms<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.850> is

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
why I asked him to do the palms up is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.150 
why I asked him to do the palms up is
because<00:02:18.150> palms<00:02:18.569> up<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:21.120> coupled<00:02:21.840> with

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
because palms up is is coupled with

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.309 
because palms up is is coupled with
external<00:02:23.160> rotation<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.880> upper<00:02:24.090> arm<00:02:24.319> extra

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
external rotation of the upper arm extra

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.960 
external rotation of the upper arm extra
external<00:02:25.830> rotation<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.370> upper<00:02:26.580> arm<00:02:26.760> is

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
external rotation of the upper arm is

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.360 
external rotation of the upper arm is
coupled<00:02:27.390> with<00:02:27.450> scapular<00:02:28.110> adduction<00:02:28.500> so

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
coupled with scapular adduction so

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.979 
coupled with scapular adduction so
instead<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.730> having<00:02:29.910> him<00:02:30.239> with<00:02:30.480> his<00:02:30.630> hands

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
instead of having him with his hands

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.559 
instead of having him with his hands
medially<00:02:31.590> rotated<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.310> forcing<00:02:33.150> scapular

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
medially rotated and forcing scapular

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.840 
medially rotated and forcing scapular
adduction<00:02:33.870> I'm<00:02:34.590> putting<00:02:35.370> him<00:02:35.459> at<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
adduction I'm putting him at a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.030 
adduction I'm putting him at a
mechanical<00:02:36.690> advantage<00:02:36.750> by<00:02:37.290> having<00:02:37.680> him<00:02:37.800> turn

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
mechanical advantage by having him turn

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.070 
mechanical advantage by having him turn
his<00:02:38.190> palms<00:02:38.430> up<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> little<00:02:39.750> bit<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.020> a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
his palms up so it's a little bit of a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.600 
his palms up so it's a little bit of a
cheat<00:02:40.319> but<00:02:40.770> I'm<00:02:40.830> willing<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
cheat but I'm willing to do it in the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.740 
cheat but I'm willing to do it in the
early<00:02:41.850> stages<00:02:42.150> while<00:02:42.540> he's<00:02:43.100> while<00:02:44.100> he's

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
early stages while he's while he's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.910 
early stages while he's while he's
developing<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.870> strength<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.410> his<00:02:46.620> weak

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
developing the strength in his weak

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.130 
developing the strength in his weak
links<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.180> guy's<00:02:48.360> had<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> lot<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.780> muscles

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
links this guy's had a lot of muscles

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.990 
links this guy's had a lot of muscles
he's<00:02:49.290> definitely<00:02:49.650> strong<00:02:49.920> he's<00:02:50.070> athletic<00:02:50.190> but

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
he's definitely strong he's athletic but

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.570 
he's definitely strong he's athletic but
not<00:02:51.360> structurally<00:02:52.080> sound<00:02:52.400> because<00:02:53.400> right

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
not structurally sound because right

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.910 
not structurally sound because right
here<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.239> almost<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.590> almost<00:02:55.709> get

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
here it's almost like I can almost get

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.320 
here it's almost like I can almost get
my<00:02:56.010> hands<00:02:56.340> under<00:02:56.550> here<00:02:56.760> where<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.180> should

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
my hands under here where there should

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.990 
my hands under here where there should
be<00:02:57.450> thick<00:02:57.750> pieces<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.530> muscle<00:02:58.880> holding<00:02:59.880> you

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
be thick pieces of muscle holding you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.199 
be thick pieces of muscle holding you
holding<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.840> tight<00:03:01.110> there's<00:03:01.739> nothing<00:03:02.209> so

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
holding you tight there's nothing so

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.030 
holding you tight there's nothing so
that's<00:03:03.780> why<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.350> weight<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.680> getting<00:03:04.890> heavy

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
that's why this weight is getting heavy

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.160 
that's why this weight is getting heavy
