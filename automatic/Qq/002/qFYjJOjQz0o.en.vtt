 Giao Team 1 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.000
 I'll apologize first. I'm going to make a quick review. 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.770
 4 There were a lot of things in between and it was not just that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.580
 I was a little busy. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.449
 So Wave Shader Five Pro 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.160
 m is the view you do before you posted this blue t's external shaders 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.420
 I have three versions 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:38.940
 First , give me the version with the highest Pro version 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:43.140
 I'm perfectly perfect water color Im rocking the higher version and version y 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 y it would have to play emotional color yellow pharmacist 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.020
 Annie Annie 2 versions sweat 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.520
 This is what is laid yes to that one most similar to genuine Mai tractor fire 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.710
 Amateur 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.660
 External Shader Five Pro Once on the main lead, it's really pretty . 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.030
 panorama 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.500
 You did not look cool . 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.939
 Applied 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:17.170
 I've been a lot of buttons before, and I 've got a language setting for a year. 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.990
 You can see it cleanly in this way by going to the settings. 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.190
 And I bought this for the reduced steam pack. 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:28.060
 This is an if life rock and what is this dare 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.420
 Yet I can not feel the need to buy a true four sk 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.360
 Now let's hear one major bear wave forces also 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.890
 Oh, that's it. 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.590
 Yama February 2 Up of Amine 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.310
 Let's take a look at the low front . 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.690
 Camel film landscape landscape 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.770
 Uh, you know now, you see the shader pack this rack does it take a lot of Saturdays 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.910
 I do not know if it 's the top version. 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.940
 I think the best born the right 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.479
 The frame is a little deeper than friends. 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:10.330
 Yeah , it's okay when it comes to loading chunks. 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:14.260
 It likes to control the frame view kaeya snow will come between 13 and 15 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.670
 Now it looks much broken 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.230
 4 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:26.530
 It means the texture is slightly heavier test is not a source pack 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.650
 It's a little hot, but it's not good. 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:35.680
 Now as negative reviews recently heard ls 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:37.690
 Exineus is already separated from the woolly srs rather than the lowest source 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.550
 I'm walking a little . 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:45.580
 I can see the water ripples move naturally . 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.870
 You look very smooth. 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:55.330
 If lashed the landscape yijeongdo evil happened to Likes 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:59.300
 This is what you got in the presentation with a neat design gray tone like this 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.410
 Even a little chat buiIding font naked 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:07.000
 You can ignore the cancer because it is even. 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.000
 Now let's look at the semi-landscape. 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.290
 The script is true 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.870
 When it becomes rice, it gradually becomes dark. 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:23.830
 The moon rises a few seconds 4 David comes into his heart 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:29.930
 Let 'See you later, until the rice buiIding well uh movie yet implemented 4 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:34.069
 It's going down nicely. You used the sun with a nice 4 lens flare. 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.670
 I have the sun just dropping things come to mind 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:41.030
 It's good for a mongolian dream in the 1st century . 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:46.250
 Get yourself off. 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:51.590
 D come off a little party foundries answer Likes body 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:56.959
 My favorite color is the kmp shader 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.680
 Texture Pack There, forget the same color as there Aoi 3 too pretty 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.500
 same 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.829
 I like it. 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.769
 And here you see the laws shine. 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.950
 So I can safely avoid it at night. 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:15.189
 Uh, it 's kind of great. 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:20.919
 This light is really gentle and beautifully effected 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:23.250
 I think it's really good, but if you go to the dark place , 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.250
 It's not. 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.160
 So I do not see what looks good to look four minutes've seen five seconds 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:35.280
 So if you put the lights on this way, the spider pops out. 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.140
 Really 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.730
 I've done a simple review of the external shell the five reviews 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:47.660
 You've created Blue t. I 'll put yo link on the bottom. 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.410
 To share the next ah get to see 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.700
 You have to join the cafÃ© and you have to climb the district. 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:59.060
 I had another nice spec or script that I had on the review 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:04.810
 Thank you. 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.810

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.730
 Be coming 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.430
