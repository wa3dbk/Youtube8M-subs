00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
think of the way there's a passage to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.389 
think of the way there's a passage to
the<00:01:18.600> surface<00:01:18.899> derivative<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.130> blocked

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
the surface derivative but was blocked

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.480 
the surface derivative but was blocked
by<00:01:20.610> some<00:01:20.909> kind<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.210> logic<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:23.009> pure<00:01:23.220> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
by some kind of logic it was pure and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.740 
by some kind of logic it was pure and
clear<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.909> package<00:01:24.270> rewards

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750
