server side yet and they didn't have

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.940 
server side yet and they didn't have
time<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.350> 0.9<00:01:40.829> point<00:01:41.070> 0<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.360> he<00:01:42.950> does

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
time for that in 0.9 point 0 but he does

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
time for that in 0.9 point 0 but he does
say<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.670> hope<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:45.240> server-based

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

crafting<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.640> future<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.600> doesn't

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
crafting in the future so it doesn't

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.749 
crafting in the future so it doesn't
mean<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.380> coming<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.549> means

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
mean that's not coming it just means

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.340 
mean that's not coming it just means
that<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.750> maybe<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that it's going to be like maybe in the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219 
that it's going to be like maybe in the
1.0<00:01:53.009> update<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.670> server-based<00:01:54.450> crafting<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
1.0 update so server-based crafting is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.929 
1.0 update so server-based crafting is
coming<00:01:55.590> which<00:01:55.799> would<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.130> better<00:01:56.549> make

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
coming which would be better make

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.859 
coming which would be better make
servers<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.890> guess<00:01:58.890> better<00:01:59.540> anyways<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.719> end

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
servers I guess better anyways the end

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.120 
servers I guess better anyways the end
