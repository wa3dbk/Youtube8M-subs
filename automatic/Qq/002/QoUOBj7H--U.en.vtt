00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.470
 I'm very in love I'm very much in love 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.839
 or sorry you'll be asking about 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.700
 what good and less other involved ticos 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.280
 as always commenting and I'm very 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.100
 in love with the weapon that I have wielded the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.140
 good test now provides time back 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.960
 when the game came out but it was little 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.540
 time and is the vector is the vector is a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.890
 submachine gun is not the one that I think is the one 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.290
 they give you even the one with whom 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.960
 it just comes to start the game if not 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.240
 I was wrong and I had never tried it 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.680
 have the people I tried I tried it on their 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.260
 time but it did not convince me and it was 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.790
 put me yesterday I swear it is not 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.650
 they're worth I swear to you why this was not my 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.840
 first game I have another game that 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.610
 it is likely that the saved by 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.710
 if it is that it was also a game 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.060
 good very good game is not a 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.410
 heading up how it is but it was a very 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.030
 Good game 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 that I took the first one or 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.820
 I literally took myself out to the first me 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.790
 I said austral the truth that goes a lot 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.890
 but this weapon and I have this game and 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.870
 another game are more games to which you 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.500
 I have saved for you but good 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.500
 is a game that almost falls almost m me 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 I was 4 to 4 I told him this is chasing him 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 I wanted to tell I did not ask you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.030
 editing the gameplay then I told it and it's 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.850
 the last streak before the end of the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.420
 just game kill me and three seconds 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.550
 after 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.860
 ends game and I had four left 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.540
 they missed four and it was very impossible or 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 it was no longer missing time apart from that 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.259
 they killed me and they killed me because I just 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.539
 came two and one he stabbed 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.460
 then yes it is impossible to react to 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.590
 take out the weapon before it does more 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.060
 sharp something but good here for example 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.560
 I saw one at the bottom and said u and what is going to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.940
 come here I will do the 314 and that is 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.800
 Carmen gets hooked here but 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.570
 it turns out that you bought it matched with 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.000
 another friend and then welcome me for the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.410
 culete here on the side but good 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 I like it a lot and you will ask 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.560
 with what things I have it because I have it with 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.110
 the usual hilt that we 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.240
 missing in your life and the muffler and still 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.590
 well the truth is that it has very juicy not 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.040
 has recoil has a very good 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.620
 aim 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 with stability and when it shoots if 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.370
 it really reduces very very little so 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.840
 it allows you to shoot far enough 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.670
 but I still do not risk against 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.860
 people from far away because they hook you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.229
 one with the ark 12 or any of these 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.570
 3 bursts is that I do not know now 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.760
 what is it called and they are by the culete 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.350
 then nothing can be done 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.910
 long distances but luckily this 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.420
 fried map fr 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.680
 and gh adds to you for quite a bit that 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.940
 it's very good for russia, which is how I 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.290
 like it well I know is that if you see the game 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.670
 I am constantly lost football 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.250
 I'm crazy like crazy forever 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.260
 crazy and I know that's why you like it too 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.910
 my videos not because I do not play 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.950
 strategically like how others do 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.690
 great youtubers good is starting 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.580
 in subjects that I catch you more tranquilito if 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.160
 and so drawn streak Like It Hot 'and 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.620
 from your site I'm always going to put 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.420
 I go to death and if it goes well then well and 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.010
 if not then nothing but much better than 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.250
 come out and because it's much more fun 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.320
 truth and as you see of gusts I have the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.430
 watchdog that never miss the 100 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.930
 has what the truth is that if I 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.550
 you put in this guy on this map you have to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.260
 dedicate their time and I also to 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.850
 place them strategically because if you 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.440
 you have fixed some that I have already placed 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.270
 and those that are missing by placing 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.740
 the few can can be very very 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.230
 lethal and then therefore sometimes 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.430
 it's better not to be a simple record once 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.260
 that you get the sentinel can you 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.640
 put her not to give her a little head and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.590
 say such a look will put here this 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.360
 elevated site such that it is difficult for 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.190
 kill from behind but a part that 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.080
 it gave me a lot of anger because I put it 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.730
 I killed the dog and diego 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.380
 falls also sentinel and then over 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.730
 they kill me sentinels days without killing 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.670
 I do not know if he had an advantage that 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.280
 therefore, logically 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.200
 the equipment is controlled by the system 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.569
 that is controlled only that you do not control it 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.550
 you are invisible to them but good a 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.630
 little bit of anger that part but still 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.220
 I am very satisfied with the gameplay 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.420
 well he also decided to play with the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.280
 vector because good not to upload 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.480
 always gameplays with the metal said 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.430
 I'm going to try it this was the first 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.959
 progresses is most likely that if in 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.400
 another test time I was surprised less 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.580
 about 500 but you almost here comes the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.680
 third no no 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.450
 will grow up and go away killed but then 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.080
 then you will see that there are still more triples 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.140
 that's why it took me quite pretty 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.849
 and that I believe because sometimes he and the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.050
 comments such play with others not by 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.880
 favor 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.550
 the other opportunity but it is that sometimes 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.230
 It's disgusting because you're hooked 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.720
 one is that the long 12 in these 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.150
 games the beast that is is what comes 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.370
 they get jail after all 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.470
 the patches and that here comes a hair 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.720
 he had every two but you almost wait for 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.950
 the third asshole there escapes me or 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.479
 it kills him 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.040
 I think the kill has been my dog ​​yes 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.030
 I think if you win and see killed by 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.460
 example this is what I told you 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.710
 I was firing the logical thing that gives away but not 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.840
 I seriously risk prison as it is 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:42.139
 a weapon because with the odds 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:48.530
 some games to the minimum that try 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:51.530
 another weapon because it's always against me 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.540
 have a little compassion kill me the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.230
 times you want if you can clear 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.760
 and the game I think we won if the 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.250
 we won and also for quite and here 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.430
 well a little bit too a little bit for 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:10.340
 this is my final streak I'm going 44 9 and I finish 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:13.370
 60 and 68 10 of the 24 casualties 5 are with 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.230
 assault or whatever it would give 19 but I have 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.660
 an attendance counts as low so 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.880
 I would stay with 20 out of 24 and I have 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.830
 hard line if you wonder what advantages 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.540
 I have then I love to go super 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.370
 super fast or I've seen it is 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.110
 as I like more in this game nothing of 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.470
 remove more harm anything whatever other 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.990
 stories why I have it with marathon 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.660
 with light weight with hard line with 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.310
 scavenger with which draws fast 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.720
 but what does it cost one that costs three in 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.670
 which dons quickly after 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.560
 paint and look here we look here comes 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.060
 a ball mouth two balls and we go for 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.060
 the third pig beast 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.909
 three parts of three casualties where is 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.930
 pretty well I hope you support it as 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.219
 always with a like and the truth is that 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.110
 I hope you enjoy this example 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.699
 because I think it's very good and I hope 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.020
 that both the comment and the game I 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.339
 that I always enjoyed them if you passed a 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.080
 good little bit of coast since not much 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:02.990
 people go up at least Spaniards who 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.430
 the typical ones that you could know and is 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.979
 a pity that they do not do so much with 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.389
 how good is the game but good 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.770
 thanks for giving you that 200 likes are 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.779
 very well and thanks of all also for 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.550
 have seen the video up to this point 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.650
 so good as you see here I follow 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.080
 taking out the streak and it is that it has become 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.879
 As you can see I'm coming, I'm going to stop 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.029
 I'm going to go more quiet, it's not always 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.949
 total madness and here and now yes good I 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.569
 I tried not to capture much because I said 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.939
 is that total we will win is clear 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:31.039
 that we are going to win we go 170 to 110 fixed 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.629
 down there on the left therefore I 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.580
 what am I going to capture if the best is 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.050
 now bloat make me low and we repeat 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.969
 corresponds there to give to give what 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.930
 I'm giving it now and it's a little 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:41.599
 risky also because you can 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.039
 sometimes appear anywhere but 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.809
 Well the truth is that it is quite 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.039
 well and as I tell you I'm going to upload more more 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.689
 clean and the pressure this moment has 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.399
 the heart that lives to stop because if 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:51.020
 As I said how much I left there 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:53.660
 is that I had no idea in that area 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.420
 same had as fixed 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.920
 I had like 13 or something like that and I have left 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.410
 a handful but good to stay 4 falls

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.060
 to be storms of assault remember that 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.860

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.180
