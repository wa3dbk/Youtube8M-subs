Crankbrothers<00:00:13.590> for<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.070> year<00:00:14.250> 10<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.030> we're

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
Crankbrothers for the year 10 and we're

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.970 
Crankbrothers for the year 10 and we're
gonna<00:00:15.269> take<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.540> look<00:00:15.719> at<00:00:15.809> these<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.890> we

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
gonna take a look at these what do we

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.189 
gonna take a look at these what do we
have<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.220> first<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.330> our<00:00:18.510> new<00:00:18.810> lefty

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
have here first so this is our new lefty

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.730 
have here first so this is our new lefty
wheel<00:00:19.380> set<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.520> made<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:21.140> using<00:00:22.140> Cannondale

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
wheel set we made it using Cannondale

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.029 
wheel set we made it using Cannondale
specifications<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.240> uses<00:00:24.869> our<00:00:25.019> iodine<00:00:25.500> front

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
specifications I uses our iodine front

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.920 
specifications I uses our iodine front
hub<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> basis<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.269> cuz<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.599> needed<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
hub as a basis just cuz we needed the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.550 
hub as a basis just cuz we needed the
space<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:29.340> put<00:00:29.519> their<00:00:29.670> big<00:00:30.349> axle<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.470> they

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
space to put their big axle that they

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.220 
space to put their big axle that they
have<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:32.030> so<00:00:33.030> basically<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.480> use<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
have here so basically we just use the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.170 
have here so basically we just use the
same<00:00:34.410> shell<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.340> different<00:00:35.610> machining<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
same shell it's different machining to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.979 
same shell it's different machining to
fit<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.630> Cannondale<00:00:37.760> system<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.870> was

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
fit the Cannondale system and it was

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.240 
fit the Cannondale system and it was
actually<00:00:40.230> fairly<00:00:40.350> easy<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.739> make<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
actually fairly easy to make it's the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.520 
actually fairly easy to make it's the
same<00:00:41.520> as<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> cobalt<00:00:42.120> wheel<00:00:42.270> set<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.350> weight

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
same as a cobalt wheel set the weight

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.520 
same as a cobalt wheel set the weight
difference<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.010> minimal<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.320> basically<00:00:46.320> no

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
difference is minimal so basically no

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.470 
difference is minimal so basically no
difference<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.039> cobalt<00:00:47.340> wheel<00:00:47.550> same<00:00:48.239> rim

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
difference with a cobalt wheel same rim

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.959 
difference with a cobalt wheel same rim
and<00:00:48.920> yeah<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.070> made<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> special<00:00:50.579> black

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and yeah we made it in the special black

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.330 
and yeah we made it in the special black
and<00:00:51.149> gold<00:00:51.270> color<00:00:51.739> which<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> new<00:00:53.070> color<00:00:53.250> for

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and gold color which is a new color for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
and gold color which is a new color for
2010<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.090> well<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.780> easy<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.140> build

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
2010 as well as it is easy to build

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.090 
2010 as well as it is easy to build
different<00:00:56.219> tensions<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:57.590> it's<00:00:58.590> identical

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
different tensions or it's identical

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.400 
different tensions or it's identical
actually<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.930> was<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> nice<00:01:01.230> thing

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
actually so that was the nice thing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.720 
actually so that was the nice thing
about<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.190> wasn't<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> much

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
about it really that wasn't that much

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.939 
about it really that wasn't that much
work<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.090> designing<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> hub<00:01:04.049> testing<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
work just designing the hub testing it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.830 
work just designing the hub testing it
out<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.309> sure<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.670> everything<00:01:06.090> worked

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
out make sure that everything worked

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300 
out make sure that everything worked
well<00:01:06.960> we're<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:07.830> using<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> same

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
well we're actually using the same

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.880 
well we're actually using the same
bearings<00:01:08.729> Cannondale<00:01:09.180> uses<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:10.350> which<00:01:10.770> are

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
bearings Cannondale uses just which are

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
bearings Cannondale uses just which are
different<00:01:11.130> than<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> berries<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.330> used<00:01:12.479> in

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
different than the berries we used in

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
different than the berries we used in
our<00:01:12.630> other<00:01:12.810> wheels<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
our other wheels just because it is for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.070 
our other wheels just because it is for
Canada<00:01:15.210> wanted<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> make<00:01:15.689> sure<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:16.020> were

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
Canada wanted to make sure they were

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200 
Canada wanted to make sure they were
cool<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.979> they<00:01:17.040> were<00:01:17.130> stoked<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.640> we

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
cool with it and they were stoked so we

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.580 
cool with it and they were stoked so we
use<00:01:18.330> their<00:01:18.479> bearings<00:01:18.840> which<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.170> really

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
use their bearings which are really

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.890 
use their bearings which are really
high-end<00:01:19.950> ezo<00:01:20.310> bearings<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.420> kind

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
high-end ezo bearings I know it's kind

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.410 
high-end ezo bearings I know it's kind
of<00:01:21.960> known<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> industry<00:01:22.380> yeah<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.420> yeah

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
of known in the industry yeah so yeah

of known in the industry yeah so yeah
it's<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.900> pretty<00:01:25.140> simple

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
it's a pretty simple

now we're here we have the new twenty
nine<00:01:32.280> our<00:01:32.430> wheelset<00:01:33.140> big<00:01:34.140> requests<00:01:34.740> like

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
nine our wheelset big requests like

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.590 
nine our wheelset big requests like
every<00:01:35.100> year<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.850> show<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> wheel<00:01:36.270> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
every year you know we show the wheel so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.060 
every year you know we show the wheel so
it's<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> first<00:01:37.049> question<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.680> welcome<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.630 
the year they'll be they'll be available
and<00:01:50.990> again<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.289> use<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.560> basis<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
and again we use this basis the the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.399 
and again we use this basis the the
cobalt<00:01:54.000> wheel<00:01:54.090> set<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.960> want<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.289> be

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
cobalt wheel set we want it to be

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.690 
cobalt wheel set we want it to be
lightweight<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:56.039> know<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.280> had<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> big

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
lightweight you know we had a big

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.670 
lightweight you know we had a big
discussion<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.720> true<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.049> use<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.470> wider

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
discussion like true we use the wider

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.160 
discussion like true we use the wider
rim<00:01:59.039> skinnier<00:01:59.940> rim<00:02:00.149> how<00:02:00.479> much<00:02:00.630> machine<00:02:00.990> in

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
rim skinnier rim how much machine in

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.710 
rim skinnier rim how much machine in
which<00:02:01.229> folks<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:03.210> know<00:02:03.300> after<00:02:03.569> talking

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
which folks and you know after talking

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.109 
which folks and you know after talking
for<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> while<00:02:04.080> most<00:02:05.069> 29er<00:02:05.520> guys<00:02:05.759> want

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
for a while most 29er guys want

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.180 
for a while most 29er guys want
lightweight<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:07.050> most<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.679> my<00:02:07.770> heart<00:02:07.950> tails

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
lightweight the most of my heart tails

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.639 
lightweight the most of my heart tails
so<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.600> just<00:02:09.630> went<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:09.989> light<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.440> could

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so so we just went as light as we could

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.940 
so so we just went as light as we could
and<00:02:11.069> yeah<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.420> bigger<00:02:12.600> hoop<00:02:12.950> we're

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and yeah it's just a bigger hoop we're

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.070 
and yeah it's just a bigger hoop we're
still<00:02:14.220> actually<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> testing<00:02:15.090> phase<00:02:15.120> to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
still actually in the testing phase to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.050 
still actually in the testing phase to
make<00:02:16.230> sure<00:02:16.410> everything's<00:02:16.800> work<00:02:17.310> works<00:02:17.790> well

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
make sure everything's work works well

are<00:02:30.150> autumn<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.600> stuck<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.049> said<00:02:31.290> super

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
are autumn was stuck just said super

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.860 
are autumn was stuck just said super
stiff<00:02:32.370> everything<00:02:32.790> worked<00:02:32.940> perfect<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.810> I

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
stiff everything worked perfect and I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.850 
stiff everything worked perfect and I
was<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.019> little<00:02:34.170> worried<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.500> they'd<00:02:34.709> be

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
was a little worried that they'd be

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.009 
was a little worried that they'd be
flexi<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.430> something<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.269> really

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
flexi or something like that but really

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.400 
flexi or something like that but really
no<00:02:37.140> issues<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.989> same<00:02:40.170> thing

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
no issues with that so the same thing

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.090 
no issues with that so the same thing
the<00:02:40.799> weight<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.220> comparable<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.209> Marv<00:02:42.840> ik<00:02:43.519> the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
the weight is comparable to Marv ik the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:53.300 
the weight is comparable to Marv ik the
it's<00:02:45.580> about<00:02:45.760> 1800<00:02:46.450> grams<00:02:46.660> isn't<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.110> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.920 

tension<00:02:54.310> was<00:02:54.460> changed<00:02:54.880> for<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.090> little<00:02:55.330> bit<00:02:55.480> I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
tension was changed for a little bit I

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.320 
tension was changed for a little bit I
lived<00:02:56.650> with<00:02:56.740> lower<00:02:56.950> tension<00:02:57.460> actually<00:02:57.640> and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
lived with lower tension actually and

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.170 
lived with lower tension actually and
just<00:02:59.320> because<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.310> bigger<00:03:00.550> hoop<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:01.030> don't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
just because the the bigger hoop I don't

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.730 
just because the the bigger hoop I don't
know<00:03:01.270> we<00:03:01.390> just<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.140> otherwise

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
know we just have to do that otherwise

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.400 
know we just have to do that otherwise
it<00:03:03.070> was<00:03:03.240> just<00:03:04.240> getting<00:03:04.510> too<00:03:04.660> tight<00:03:04.900> too<00:03:05.140> stiff

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
it was just getting too tight too stiff

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.230 
it was just getting too tight too stiff
and<00:03:05.680> like<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.370> wheel<00:03:06.520> wasn't<00:03:06.880> building<00:03:07.030> up

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
and like the wheel wasn't building up

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.450 
and like the wheel wasn't building up
right<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.930> have<00:03:08.140> longer<00:03:08.500> spans<00:03:08.800> here<00:03:09.070> too<00:03:09.280> now

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
right we have longer spans here too now

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.760 
right we have longer spans here too now
so<00:03:10.210> if<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.720> if<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.050> tighten<00:03:11.290> these<00:03:11.530> wheels

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
so if you if you tighten these wheels

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.730 
so if you if you tighten these wheels
too<00:03:12.040> much<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.520> start<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.150> get<00:03:13.270> like<00:03:13.740> flour

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
too much just start to get like flour

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.920 
too much just start to get like flour
effects<00:03:15.430> going<00:03:15.820> on<00:03:16.120> because<00:03:16.330> these<00:03:16.570> fans<00:03:16.780> are

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
effects going on because these fans are

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.650 
effects going on because these fans are
so<00:03:17.140> long<00:03:17.380> compared<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.980> these<00:03:18.100> ones<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:18.670> so

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
so long compared to these ones so so

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.970 
so long compared to these ones so so
yeah<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.810> little<00:03:19.990> bit<00:03:20.050> lower<00:03:20.170> tension<00:03:20.650> but<00:03:20.800> it

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
yeah a little bit lower tension but it

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.680 
yeah a little bit lower tension but it
didn't<00:03:21.520> affect<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.910> riding<00:03:22.210> at<00:03:22.330> all<00:03:22.450> it's

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
didn't affect the riding at all it's

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.860 
didn't affect the riding at all it's
just<00:03:22.900> it's<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.890> same<00:03:24.360> together<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.570> biggest

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
just it's the same together the biggest

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.290 
just it's the same together the biggest
issue<00:03:26.080> was<00:03:26.350> trying<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.800> figure<00:03:27.010> out<00:03:27.300> which

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
issue was trying to figure out which

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.930 
issue was trying to figure out which
room<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.600> use<00:03:28.780> which<00:03:29.020> spokes<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.470> use<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.790> that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
room to use which spokes to use but that

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.270 
room to use which spokes to use but that
was<00:03:31.300> pretty<00:03:31.450> much<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.660> everything<00:03:32.230> else<00:03:32.350> works

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
was pretty much it everything else works

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.430 
was pretty much it everything else works
out<00:03:33.430> well<00:03:33.610> again<00:03:34.300> we're<00:03:34.450> using<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.690> cobalt<00:03:35.140> is

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
out well again we're using the cobalt is

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.610 
out well again we're using the cobalt is
the<00:03:35.590> basis<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.250> cobalt<00:03:36.730> front<00:03:37.360> hub<00:03:37.570> it's<00:03:38.380> only

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
the basis so cobalt front hub it's only

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.210 
the basis so cobalt front hub it's only
a<00:03:38.800> you<00:03:39.460> know<00:03:39.550> 15<00:03:40.120> millimeter<00:03:40.480> QR<00:03:40.840> or<00:03:40.870> or<00:03:41.440> QR<00:03:41.920> a

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
a you know 15 millimeter QR or or QR a
