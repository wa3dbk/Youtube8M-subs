there<00:00:00.900> are<00:00:01.079> several<00:00:01.500> basic<00:00:01.829> types<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.520> numbers

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
there are several basic types of numbers

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.829 
there are several basic types of numbers
which<00:00:03.629> we<00:00:03.840> are<00:00:04.290> going<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.740> encounter<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.839> we

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
which we are going to encounter and we

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.600 
which we are going to encounter and we
can<00:00:07.830> group<00:00:08.130> them<00:00:08.370> into<00:00:08.639> sets<00:00:10.160> the<00:00:11.160> diagram<00:00:11.580> you

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
can group them into sets the diagram you

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.160 
can group them into sets the diagram you
see<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:13.769> real<00:00:14.099> number<00:00:14.639> system<00:00:15.170> which

these I'm just going to talk you through
some<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.599> basic<00:00:30.599> concepts<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.500> are

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
some of the basic concepts which are

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.520 
some of the basic concepts which are
illustrated<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:32.630> this<00:00:33.630> chart<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> very

illustrated here this chart is a very

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.790 
illustrated here this chart is a very
common<00:00:35.040> visual<00:00:35.820> which<00:00:36.630> shows<00:00:37.230> us<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
common visual which shows us the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.160 
common visual which shows us the
different<00:00:37.920> sets<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.910> numbers<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.989> they

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
different sets of numbers and what they

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.880 
different sets of numbers and what they
include<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:42.450> start<00:00:42.870> from<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> inside<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
include if we start from the inside of

include if we start from the inside of
the<00:00:43.980> diagram<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:45.030> particular<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.690> the

the diagram in particular with the
natural<00:00:46.590> numbers<00:00:48.260> that's<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> more

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
natural numbers that's kind of the more

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.430 
natural numbers that's kind of the more
fun<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:52.070> fundamental<00:00:53.070> set<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.940> numbers<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
fun to fundamental set of numbers the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.250 
fun to fundamental set of numbers the
first<00:00:55.710> numbers<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> learn<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:57.260> usually

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
first numbers that you learn are usually

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.349 
first numbers that you learn are usually
natural<00:00:58.680> numbers<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.460> sometimes<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.180> call

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
natural numbers or sometimes we call

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.750 
natural numbers or sometimes we call
them<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.840> counting<00:01:01.379> numbers<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.100> that's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
them the counting numbers and that's

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.700 
them the counting numbers and that's
simply<00:01:03.030> 1<00:01:03.390> 2<00:01:04.019> 3<00:01:04.769> 4<00:01:05.540> whole<00:01:06.540> numbers<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.619> be

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
simply 1 2 3 4 whole numbers that can be

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.300 
simply 1 2 3 4 whole numbers that can be
used<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> count<00:01:08.220> things<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:10.439> set<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.920> whole

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
used to count things the set of whole

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.960 
used to count things the set of whole
numbers<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:12.390> almost<00:01:12.840> exactly<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.710> same

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
numbers is almost exactly the same

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.170 
numbers is almost exactly the same
except<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> also<00:01:15.119> includes<00:01:15.750> 0<00:01:16.790> therefore<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
except it also includes 0 therefore the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.859 
except it also includes 0 therefore the
whole<00:01:18.360> numbers<00:01:19.040> include<00:01:20.040> 0<00:01:20.670> along<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
whole numbers include 0 along with the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.679 
whole numbers include 0 along with the
natural<00:01:22.290> numbers<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.970> general<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.509> we

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
natural numbers and in general as we

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.310 
natural numbers and in general as we
work<00:01:24.900> our<00:01:25.080> way<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> diagram<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
work our way out of the diagram the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
work our way out of the diagram the
bigger<00:01:28.320> categories<00:01:29.100> include<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> smaller

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
bigger categories include the smaller

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.289 
bigger categories include the smaller
ones<00:01:30.810> they're<00:01:31.200> within<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.310> anything<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.270> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
ones they're within so anything which is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.859 
ones they're within so anything which is
a<00:01:33.570> natural<00:01:34.200> number<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.470> also<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.950> whole<00:01:35.280> number

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
a natural number is also a whole number

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.050 
a natural number is also a whole number
anything<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.229> whole<00:01:37.710> number<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> also

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
anything which is a whole number is also

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.170 
anything which is a whole number is also
an<00:01:39.360> integer<00:01:40.070> when<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.189> talk<00:01:41.400> about<00:01:41.430> integers

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
an integer when we talk about integers

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.580 
an integer when we talk about integers
we<00:01:42.930> add<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.860> opposites<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.899> natural

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
we add the opposites of the natural

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
we add the opposites of the natural
numbers<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.540> 1<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.340> negative<00:01:50.340> 1

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
numbers so now we have 1 and negative 1

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.660 
numbers so now we have 1 and negative 1
we<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.409> 2<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.360> negative<00:01:54.360> 2<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> basically

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
we we have 2 and negative 2 so basically

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.410 
we we have 2 and negative 2 so basically
we're<00:01:57.090> including<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.290> whole<00:01:58.500> numbers

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
we're including all the whole numbers

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.649 
we're including all the whole numbers
along<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.659> their<00:02:00.780> negative<00:02:01.490> counterparts

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
along with their negative counterparts

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.020 
along with their negative counterparts
those<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> integers<00:02:04.700> notice<00:02:05.700> at<00:02:05.880> this

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
those are the integers notice at this

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
those are the integers notice at this
point<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.479> still<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:06.990> include<00:02:07.350> anything

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
point we still don't include anything

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.410 
point we still don't include anything
like<00:02:08.330> 1/2<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.810> 3.5<00:02:11.330> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
like 1/2 or 3.5 the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.559 
like 1/2 or 3.5 the
rational<00:02:13.080> numbers<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:14.060> anything<00:02:15.060> which<00:02:15.390> can

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
rational numbers are anything which can

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.059 
rational numbers are anything which can
be<00:02:15.690> written<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.250> ratio<00:02:17.250> or<00:02:18.200> as<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> fraction

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
be written as a ratio or as a fraction

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.750 
be written as a ratio or as a fraction
so<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> bunch<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.720> examples<00:02:21.900> over<00:02:22.530> here

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
so we have a bunch of examples over here

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.100 
so we have a bunch of examples over here
but<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:24.030> note<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.480> they<00:02:24.599> don't<00:02:24.840> always

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
but I will note that they don't always

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.280 
but I will note that they don't always
look<00:02:25.950> like<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.720> add<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
look like this so I'm going to add it to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.850 
look like this so I'm going to add it to
this<00:02:28.530> diagram<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.310> few<00:02:30.090> examples<00:02:30.900> which<00:02:31.680> are

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
this diagram a few examples which are

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.979 
this diagram a few examples which are
things<00:02:32.010> which<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.790> written<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.930> form

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
things which can be written in this form

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.940 
things which can be written in this form
as<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.530> ratio<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.220> integers<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.810> are<00:02:37.050> perhaps

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
as a ratio of integers but are perhaps

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.330 
as a ratio of integers but are perhaps
not<00:02:38.420> initially<00:02:39.420> written<00:02:39.569> that<00:02:39.930> way

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
not initially written that way

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.130 
not initially written that way
so<00:02:41.340> here<00:02:41.610> I've<00:02:41.760> added<00:02:41.940> three<00:02:42.360> more<00:02:42.599> rational

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
so here I've added three more rational

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.970 
so here I've added three more rational
numbers<00:02:43.500> three<00:02:44.190> point<00:02:44.459> two<00:02:45.709> negative<00:02:46.709> one

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
numbers three point two negative one

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.440 
numbers three point two negative one
point<00:02:47.640> seven<00:02:48.090> five<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.310> zero<00:02:50.310> point<00:02:50.819> six

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
point seven five and zero point six

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.280 
point seven five and zero point six
repeating<00:02:52.280> these<00:02:53.280> are<00:02:53.610> all<00:02:53.790> rational<00:02:54.569> numbers

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
repeating these are all rational numbers

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.520 
repeating these are all rational numbers
because<00:02:56.130> they<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.850> they're<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.900> written<00:02:58.290> as

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
because they can they're not written as

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.759 
because they can they're not written as
a<00:02:59.269> fraction<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.330> two<00:03:00.390> numbers<00:03:00.780> but<00:03:01.049> they<00:03:01.530> can

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
a fraction of two numbers but they can

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.280 
a fraction of two numbers but they can
be<00:03:01.890> converted<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.760> written<00:03:03.060> as<00:03:03.180> such<00:03:03.450> for

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
be converted and written as such for

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.670 
be converted and written as such for
example<00:03:04.350> zero<00:03:05.040> point<00:03:05.340> six<00:03:05.700> repeating<00:03:06.560> can<00:03:07.560> be

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
example zero point six repeating can be

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.580 
example zero point six repeating can be
written<00:03:07.860> as<00:03:08.069> two-thirds<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:09.170> fact<00:03:10.170> any

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
written as two-thirds in fact any

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.970 
written as two-thirds in fact any
repeating<00:03:11.580> decimal<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:13.290> be<00:03:13.470> written<00:03:13.680> as<00:03:13.920> a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
repeating decimal can be written as a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.319 
repeating decimal can be written as a
rational<00:03:14.760> number<00:03:15.769> our<00:03:16.769> irrational<00:03:17.609> numbers

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
rational number our irrational numbers

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.569 
rational number our irrational numbers
on<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.470> other<00:03:19.590> hand<00:03:19.890> are<00:03:20.579> simply<00:03:21.120> any<00:03:22.579> number

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
on the other hand are simply any number

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.110 
on the other hand are simply any number
which<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.269> not<00:03:25.049> rational<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:27.140> these<00:03:28.140> are<00:03:28.680> ones

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
which is not rational so these are ones

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.319 
which is not rational so these are ones
which<00:03:30.120> if<00:03:30.570> they're<00:03:31.140> expressed<00:03:31.739> as<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> decimal

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
which if they're expressed as a decimal

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.780 
which if they're expressed as a decimal
go<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.510> forever<00:03:33.780> without<00:03:34.109> repeating<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:35.220> famous

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
go on forever without repeating a famous

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.229 
go on forever without repeating a famous
example<00:03:36.299> being<00:03:36.510> PI<00:03:37.700> when<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.790> write<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.090> as<00:03:39.209> a

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
example being PI when you write it as a

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.970 
example being PI when you write it as a
decimal<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:40.109> keeps<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.769> forever

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
decimal it keeps going on forever

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.729 
decimal it keeps going on forever
without<00:03:41.250> repeating<00:03:41.900> also<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.079> square<00:03:43.440> root

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
without repeating also the square root

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.160 
without repeating also the square root
of<00:03:43.950> many<00:03:44.730> numbers<00:03:45.239> which<00:03:45.480> are<00:03:45.570> not<00:03:45.750> perfect

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
of many numbers which are not perfect

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.930 
of many numbers which are not perfect
squares<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:46.920> sorry<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.310> spirit<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.700> any

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
squares I'm sorry the spirit of any

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.319 
squares I'm sorry the spirit of any
number<00:03:48.480> which<00:03:49.109> is<00:03:49.230> not<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.410> perfect<00:03:49.829> square

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
number which is not a perfect square

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.130 
number which is not a perfect square
is<00:03:51.329> going<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:52.109> irrational<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:54.140> the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
is going to be irrational and the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.199 
is going to be irrational and the
opposite<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.859> such<00:03:56.100> numbers<00:03:56.519> would<00:03:56.880> be<00:03:56.910> as

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
opposite of such numbers would be as

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.710 
opposite of such numbers would be as
well<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:58.590> together<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.549> irrational<00:04:00.120> numbers

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
well so together the irrational numbers

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.259 
well so together the irrational numbers
and<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.650> rational<00:04:02.160> numbers<00:04:02.489> make<00:04:02.760> up<00:04:02.970> the

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
and the rational numbers make up the

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.920 
and the rational numbers make up the
real<00:04:03.600> numbers<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:06.209> we<00:04:06.329> need<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.600> have<00:04:06.750> the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
real numbers so we need to have the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.140 
real numbers so we need to have the
definitions<00:04:07.620> for<00:04:07.890> what<00:04:08.160> each<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.639> these<00:04:08.760> types

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
definitions for what each of these types

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.199 
definitions for what each of these types
of<00:04:09.389> numbers<00:04:09.540> are<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:10.200> better<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.970> fully

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
of numbers are to better and to fully

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.910 
of numbers are to better and to fully
understand<00:04:12.810> what<00:04:12.959> we're<00:04:13.290> talking<00:04:13.470> about<00:04:13.739> when

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
understand what we're talking about when

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.470 
understand what we're talking about when
we<00:04:14.040> talk<00:04:14.220> about<00:04:14.250> these<00:04:14.579> kind<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:14.970> numbers<00:04:15.239> but

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
we talk about these kind of numbers but

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.890 
we talk about these kind of numbers but
this<00:04:16.229> diagram<00:04:17.100> gives<00:04:17.639> us<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.940> good<00:04:18.150> overall

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
this diagram gives us a good overall

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.070 
this diagram gives us a good overall
view<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.970> helps<00:04:20.970> us<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.239> see<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.419> relations

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
view and helps us to see the relations

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.300 
view and helps us to see the relations
such<00:04:22.919> as<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:24.060> fact<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.560> natural<00:04:25.560> numbers

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
such as the fact that natural numbers

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.260 
such as the fact that natural numbers
a<00:04:26.370> subset<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.210> integers<00:04:27.770> because<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:29.790> set<00:04:30.090> of

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
a subset of integers because the set of

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.320 
a subset of integers because the set of
natural<00:04:30.450> numbers<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.820> contained<00:04:32.820> entirely

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
natural numbers is contained entirely

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.840 
natural numbers is contained entirely
within<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:34.740> set<00:04:34.980> of<00:04:35.010> integers<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.919> I'd<00:04:38.340> like

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
within the set of integers so I'd like

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.879
