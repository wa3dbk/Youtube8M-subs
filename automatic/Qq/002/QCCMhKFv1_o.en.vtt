Fishing Boys

00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:06.176
I'm so hungry. Let's go to find some food.

00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:08.413
Yes, I am hungry as well

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:13.188
Nothing

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:16.117
Nothing here either 

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:20.964
Under the bed.
Nothing either

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:23.344
Let's go fishing

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.935
There are 2 fishing rods. One for you, one for me.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:56.985
Nhat, I caught a fish.

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:02.555
But...

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.333
A man is cutting trees

00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:07.311
They deforest for wood

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:09.796
Burning the forest

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:12.908
These two persons are throwing garbage to the river

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:21.559
This water is polluted

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.530
Two years later...

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:43.240
Yeah, this is my usual place

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:55.130
Why aren't there any fish this time?

00:01:55.747 --> 00:01:58.750
Ah, it is too dirty. That's why there are no fish

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:02.100
Where are you, fish?

00:02:04.513 --> 00:02:07.010
It is so boring

00:02:08.435 --> 00:02:11.440
Today I can't catch any fish. So I am hungry. It is so boring

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.200
And...

00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:22.640
Trees died because of lack of water

00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:26.560
So...

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.110
Because of lack the of water, our friends 
 are planting trees to help create water

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.520
Some years later, the tree will grow big and lush
