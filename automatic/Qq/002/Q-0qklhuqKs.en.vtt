00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.580
 new pc stand so new package and as 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.510
 teacher and yes that is in the case of 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.760
 dell inspiron 660 reason why I new 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.180
 pc needed and was parked with the 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.300
 following an old pc no longer then 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:34.750
 Of course, new and the chic must 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:38.030
 after all, 529 has cost 529 and 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.690
 then the whole topic will look exactly 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.690
 have fun 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.380
 so now we take the pc for the first time 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.130
 in operation and i can only repeat 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.930
 I am very curious how it looks 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:29.040
 first there is a button 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:41.080
 you have to press on it then lights up 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:44.700
 then so del sign appears here 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.700
 I think I'm really great 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.269
 that the pc ds now over in the fall 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.780
 the internet connected 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.829
 per lan by cable and has to be 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.519
 probably the first time 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.519
 to register 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:23.970
 and yes the display is really great 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:33.030
 very sharp so completely normal even if 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:34.950
 it's just over vga and the pc sees it 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.450
 In any case, I think so 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.209
 very stylish and yes so now I am 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.310

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.109

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.209
 German selected now I go too 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.950
 continue now my settings 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.849

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.599

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.909

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.440

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.510

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:24.270
