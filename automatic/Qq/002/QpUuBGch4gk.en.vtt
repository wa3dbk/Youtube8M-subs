00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.149
 quests will disguise himself there is otherwise there is 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.910
 thought of these two live stream and more in 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.860
 below the clip did not work 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.500
 I'm trying to fuck him but all 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.140
 I hate it 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.869
 I tried for two hours of time 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.910
 of all placed all this up and where it's 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.959
 did not work anyway saarburg is 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.970
 all the time I do not even know 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.000
 why there was a shift of voice 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.770
 have not played twice in a row 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:42.190
 damn shit it was the most 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:45.550
 annoying to bite one back not two 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.200
 oh my mouth to the third brother but 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.880
 not so on your anguish because 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.320
 in front of the salute of good I like that to 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.460
 report cultures to resume asi 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.020
 because we started as soon as it is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:03.940
 like that in this style of return but 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:05.140
 it's no more serious than it's two 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.360
 time I do not think in the clip 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.430
 start why are they wanting 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.900
 we can give 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.530
 Saturday I received adverse or not and you 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.680
 see where is he telling me where is 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.960
 does he find and no man disappears 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.220
 but just no longer there but you know it's 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.110
 not because it's been a bit that I've 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.390
 not touched to 20 be doing that I have 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.520
 lost necessarily world watts and 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.930
 when sometimes she wants to surf then 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.930
 manager and this beautiful little clip 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.290
 well it's a ferret chuck greene that makes 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.520
 always fun like that took 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.080
 always well the bottom of love jo but 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.710
 I have not spoken with you yet it's a 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.790
 this famous black ops too there no what 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.620
 is outings what are they in 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.880
 think down sir maybe that 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.710
 could interest some people 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.720
 so here is my opinion on this killer 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.060
 could be our self I find that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.500
 gerald be really good candelier like 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.330
 know I guess anyone who 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.550
 account to integrate in the cases of 10 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.680
 month in general and I find that it's 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.080
 really it's going really well has 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.120
 need a black ops so made by 6.5 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.830
 in data that is really very very 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.360
 unpopular and I think they have 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.610
 really took a lot of tariffs to that 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.620
 there and they look epic 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.960
 I really hors d'oeuvre we comment 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:36.350
 yvon because but I hope it's going to be 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:38.320
 not bad nice but say I bite you and 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.730
 I could forget this wonderful find 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:48.200
 fucking he spent 15 months I was better 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:50.620
 like that at the common it's my 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:04:01.220
 luck the soft and psp 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:03.920
 nothing yes and no ben me too 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.300
 yeah ok I fell in it and yes 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.520
 for before I said black ops 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.400
 trauma of a game not bad epic I 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.340
 really to protest this make sure you 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.120
 that the beast I will do really 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.100
 a lot 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.299
 I 'm not his first doubled better I 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.669
 do not know but mark the beast we eat 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.820
 of the bank wants to play almost not bad 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.980
 that for that ensures only heats the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.900
 organic cheese oat milk or a staff 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.760
 so that's more or less good 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.590
 unfolded I think the community in 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.750
 general d really great expectations for 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.310
 this black ops too i think that's okay 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.020
 when the broker says I have the impression 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.970
 that they did not shoot well this time 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.070
 I really hope that's fine 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.080
 restore the world's taste to stay in this 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.820
 game to really play it a lot 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.020
 because I think it's because we fooled 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.810
 a sauna in the boxes very good 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.290
 properly will love it turned out to be a 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.290
 phone access 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.800
 Thursday afternoon is right 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.480
 it is to think better than in the faith 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.330
 it's not the same thing 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.990
 this tablecloth surf flanders is not 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.520

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.320
