Paul<00:00:02.159> or<00:00:02.669> other<00:00:02.879> archtop<00:00:03.480> guitar<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.620> have<00:00:04.740> to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
Paul or other archtop guitar you have to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.680 
Paul or other archtop guitar you have to
fit<00:00:05.069> them<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.609> curve<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.180> top

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
fit them to the curve of the top

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.020 
fit them to the curve of the top
that's<00:00:07.410> because<00:00:07.859> mounting<00:00:08.280> rings<00:00:08.460> come<00:00:08.760> flat

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
that's because mounting rings come flat

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.360 
that's because mounting rings come flat
on<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.360> bottom<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.900> if<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:11.010> screw<00:00:11.250> them

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
on the bottom and if you just screw them

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.450 
on the bottom and if you just screw them
down<00:00:11.580> they<00:00:11.790> warp<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.870> they<00:00:12.990> wrinkle<00:00:13.400> they<00:00:14.400> do

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
down they warp and they wrinkle they do

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.189 
down they warp and they wrinkle they do
come<00:00:14.790> tapered<00:00:15.210> from<00:00:15.360> back<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.660> front<00:00:15.960> and

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
come tapered from back to front and

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.380 
come tapered from back to front and
that's<00:00:16.289> good<00:00:16.710> because<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.400> keeps<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.180> face

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
that's good because that keeps the face

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.510 
that's good because that keeps the face
of<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> pickup<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.260> lie<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.100> strings

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
of the pickup in the lie of the strings

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.939 
of the pickup in the lie of the strings
and<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> fretboard<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:22.260> only<00:00:22.439> part<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.710> have

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and the fretboard the only part you have

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.460 
and the fretboard the only part you have
to<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.310> shape<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.760> curve<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.269> top<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to do is shape the curve to the top to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.890 
to do is shape the curve to the top to
rough<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.160> top<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.820> hold<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> in

shape that way this gives me a line to
work<00:00:40.860> towards<00:00:44.510> I'll<00:00:45.510> use<00:00:45.660> double<00:00:46.050> stick<00:00:46.230> tape

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
jaws that aren't so wide so you can cut

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
way to the pencil line or just use it as

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200 
way to the pencil line or just use it as
a<00:01:03.930> visual<00:01:04.439> mark<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.250> you're<00:01:05.489> trying<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> lower

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a visual mark if you're trying to lower

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
a visual mark if you're trying to lower
the<00:01:06.450> pick<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.990> height<00:01:07.170> you'd<00:01:07.380> cut<00:01:07.650> more

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the pick up and height you'd cut more

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.039 
the pick up and height you'd cut more
plastic<00:01:08.340> away<00:01:11.210> once<00:01:12.210> I've<00:01:12.390> knit<00:01:12.630> four<00:01:12.900> men

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
plastic away once I've knit four men

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
plastic away once I've knit four men
down<00:01:13.260> I'm<00:01:13.470> switching<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> scraper<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
down I'm switching to a scraper just to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
down I'm switching to a scraper just to
smooth<00:01:15.210> out<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> nip<00:01:15.780> marks<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
smooth out the nip marks and get it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.870 
smooth out the nip marks and get it
basically<00:01:17.369> smooth<00:01:18.470> then<00:01:19.470> I'll<00:01:19.650> use<00:01:19.799> files<00:01:20.159> I

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.359 

like<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.090> razor-sharp<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:25.680> fall<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
like to razor-sharp to fall for the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.700 
like to razor-sharp to fall for the
corners<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.810> thick<00:01:28.080> plastic<00:01:28.380> in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
corners because that's thick plastic in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.630 
corners because that's thick plastic in
the<00:01:28.829> casting<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.549> cuts<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> real<00:01:30.600> fast

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
the casting and it cuts it real fast

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.069 
the casting and it cuts it real fast
then<00:01:32.640> I'll<00:01:32.759> switch<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> finer<00:01:33.540> files<00:01:33.869> these

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
then I'll switch to finer files these

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.770 
then I'll switch to finer files these
are<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.439> nothing<00:01:34.619> saddle<00:01:35.100> files<00:01:35.630> move<00:01:36.630> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
are like nothing saddle files move it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.319 
are like nothing saddle files move it
out<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.200> jump<00:01:37.470> onto<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:38.009> scraper<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.579> any<00:01:38.729> time

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.179 

now<00:01:42.329> I'm<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> sand<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> curve

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
now I'm going to sand this to the curve

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.730 
now I'm going to sand this to the curve
of<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> top<00:01:44.700> lap<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.299> into<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> top<00:01:45.960> by

of the top lap it into the top by

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.710 
of the top lap it into the top by
papering<00:01:47.310> off<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> top<00:01:47.909> putting<00:01:48.509> some

papering off the top putting some

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.499 
papering off the top putting some
double-stick<00:01:49.170> sand<00:01:49.619> paper<00:01:49.890> down<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.509> using

double-stick sand paper down and using

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.899 
double-stick sand paper down and using
short<00:01:51.899> strokes<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.829> forth<00:01:53.070> till<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
short strokes back and forth till it

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.240 
short strokes back and forth till it
fits<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.479> can't<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> direction<00:01:55.920> because

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
fits I can't go that direction because

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.420 
fits I can't go that direction because
this<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.850> isn't<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.299> radius<00:01:57.689> top<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:59.189> does

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
this really isn't a radius top it does

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.700 
this really isn't a radius top it does
have<00:01:59.670> radiuses<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> center<00:02:01.469> it's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
have radiuses but in the center it's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.830 
have radiuses but in the center it's
flat<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> violin<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.180> got<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.509> flat

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
flat like a violin it's got this flat

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.910 
flat like a violin it's got this flat
spot<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:05.450> use<00:02:06.450> sign<00:02:06.719> painters<00:02:07.200> tape<00:02:07.409> because

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
spot I use sign painters tape because

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.669 
spot I use sign painters tape because
it's<00:02:08.099> extremely<00:02:08.729> low<00:02:08.940> tack<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:10.500> use<00:02:10.649> it

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it's extremely low tack and we use it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.100 
it's extremely low tack and we use it
for<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:11.129> sorts<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.760> finishing<00:02:12.360> applications

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
for all sorts of finishing applications

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.620 
for all sorts of finishing applications
and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.650 
and
action<00:02:18.270> I'm<00:02:19.270> starting<00:02:19.960> with<00:02:20.080> 80<00:02:20.710> grit<00:02:21.660> that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
action I'm starting with 80 grit that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.890 
action I'm starting with 80 grit that
might<00:02:22.960> do<00:02:23.170> me<00:02:23.350> fine<00:02:23.560> right<00:02:23.890> there<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.660> see

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
might do me fine right there you can see

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.330 
might do me fine right there you can see
where<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.110> wish<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.590> could<00:02:32.770> go<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.130> direction

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
where I wish I could go this direction

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.040 
where I wish I could go this direction
it<00:02:33.790> would<00:02:33.910> be<00:02:34.060> more<00:02:34.270> stable<00:02:34.780> now<00:02:36.810> I'm<00:02:37.810> going<00:02:37.960> to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
it would be more stable now I'm going to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.310 
it would be more stable now I'm going to
switch<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.320> 120<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:40.660> can<00:02:40.840> see<00:02:41.020> right<00:02:41.200> away

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
switch to 120 you can see right away

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.690 
switch to 120 you can see right away
where<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.740> high<00:02:41.860> spots<00:02:42.190> are

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
where the high spots are

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.200 
where the high spots are
I<00:02:44.700> think<00:02:45.700> I'll<00:02:45.790> quit<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.120> 120<00:02:47.760> there's<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.910> burr

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
I think I'll quit at 120 there's a burr

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.360 
I think I'll quit at 120 there's a burr
I<00:02:49.510> don't<00:02:50.140> know<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.350> can<00:02:50.530> see<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.160> out

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
I don't know if you can see that out

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:13.089 
I don't know if you can see that out
there

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.280 

that's<00:03:13.909> not<00:03:14.120> perfect<00:03:14.540> but<00:03:14.659> it's<00:03:14.810> pretty<00:03:14.989> darn

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
that's not perfect but it's pretty darn

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.510 
that's not perfect but it's pretty darn
good<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:17.239> quick
