them pardon the pun and pick up the axes
with<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> TK<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> throw<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> right<00:00:46.110> back<00:00:46.170> at

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
them and kill them but this is easier

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
them and kill them but this is easier
said<00:00:48.270> than<00:00:48.539> done<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.320> wasters<00:00:50.039> will

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
said than done because the wasters will

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
said than done because the wasters will
transform<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> once<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.320> axis<00:00:52.710> will

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
transform and once they do the axis will

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.950 
transform and once they do the axis will
disappear<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.610> can't<00:00:53.940> pick<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.390> now

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
disappear so you can't pick them up now

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
disappear so you can't pick them up now
to<00:00:55.020> prevent<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.890> recommend<00:00:56.070> something

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
to prevent this I recommend something

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
to prevent this I recommend something
strong<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.149> accurate<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> sniper<00:00:58.500> rifle

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
strong and accurate like a sniper rifle

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
strong and accurate like a sniper rifle
now<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.789> any<00:00:59.910> time<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> game<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
now at any time there in the game you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
now at any time there in the game you
could<00:01:00.840> go<00:01:00.960> into<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.260> pause<00:01:01.440> menu<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.039> go<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
could go into your pause menu and go to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.009 
could go into your pause menu and go to
achievements<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.059> once<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.870> can

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
achievements and once there you can

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.260 
achievements and once there you can

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
can see I have 20 out of 30 so without

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.179 
can see I have 20 out of 30 so without
further<00:01:11.220> ado<00:01:11.700> let's<00:01:12.030> begin<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.420> farming<00:01:13.189> so

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
further ado let's begin the farming so

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.560 
further ado let's begin the farming so
this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> basic<00:01:14.909> strategy<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.360> here

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
this is the basic strategy right here

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.149 
this is the basic strategy right here
you're<00:01:15.750> gonna<00:01:15.840> use<00:01:16.020> stasis<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.890> slow<00:01:17.070> them

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you're gonna use stasis just slow them

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.740 
you're gonna use stasis just slow them
down<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:17.939> gonna<00:01:18.119> shoot<00:01:18.299> them<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> arm

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
down and then gonna shoot them the arm

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.420 
down and then gonna shoot them the arm
and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.500> you're<00:01:19.619> gonna<00:01:19.710> use<00:01:19.799> Canisius<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and then you're gonna use Canisius to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
and then you're gonna use Canisius to
pick<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> axe<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.299> shoot<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:21.900> back

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
pick up the axe and shoot it right back

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.780 
pick up the axe and shoot it right back
at<00:01:22.259> their<00:01:22.409> legs<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> why<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
at their legs and this is why I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
at their legs and this is why I
recommend<00:01:24.090> playing<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.869> casual<00:01:25.320> because

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
recommend playing it on casual because

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
recommend playing it on casual because
you<00:01:25.680> could<00:01:25.830> kill<00:01:26.009> them<00:01:26.220> basically<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you could kill them basically with that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.020 
you could kill them basically with that
one-two<00:01:27.330> punch<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.490> do<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> same<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
one-two punch and do the same for the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:02:02.920 
one-two punch and do the same for the
rest<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.390> ice<00:01:30.570> climbers

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.880
