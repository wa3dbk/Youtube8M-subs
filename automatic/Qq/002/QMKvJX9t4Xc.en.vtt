00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
printers were not cheap I don't see the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.720

army<00:03:00.360> actually<00:03:00.540> using<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.460> because<00:03:02.460> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
army actually using this because the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.130 
army actually using this because the
guns<00:03:02.940> would<00:03:03.060> just<00:03:03.210> be<00:03:03.300> way<00:03:03.480> too<00:03:03.540> expensive<00:03:03.810> to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
guns would just be way too expensive to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.440

make<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.280> mean<00:03:05.520> shit<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.880> guess<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.330> could

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
make but I mean shit I guess it could

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.690 
make but I mean shit I guess it could
happen<00:03:06.600> right<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.950> kind<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.370> sounds<00:03:08.670> like

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
happen right so it kind of sounds like

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.700 
Call of Duty I think it's gonna be tight
and<00:04:07.590> fall<00:04:07.830> with<00:04:08.310> like<00:04:08.490> perks<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.090> killstreaks

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710
