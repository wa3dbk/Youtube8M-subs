00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.339
 entity and sport company gives all their mice the names of dragons dragons are 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.629
 different colors and scales with a mouse apron too hello everyone 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.930
 online store photos my name is max and this is kitty esports theron 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.980
 Immediately tell you about the colors and coatings have a glossy coating 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.570
 soft touch these 2 are green and black and the rest 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.360
 glossy this yellow white and red mouse is big and wide is unlikely to fit 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.109
 for small hands it looks symmetrical, but in fact sharpened 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.929
 under the right hand this is indicated by a recess under the thumb 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.399
 just one side and only one button on the right just try to take it 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.710
 with her left hand and it immediately becomes clear that it is for right-handed buttons 10 left right 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.600
 scroll two side and one to the right it is very conveniently located under the middle 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.940
 finger next go two buttons 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.429
 dipyai other buttons are on the bottom of the mouse this button to switch profiles 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.350
 and a button for switching the poll frequency; if everything is clear with profiles, then why? 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.250
 I still didnâ€™t understand how to switch the polling frequency, especially since it is possible in the wood 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.969
 expose however the buttons are located so that accidentally press them 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.840
 It will not work and it is good next on the bottom there is such a switch 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.640
 At first I thought that he was blocking the weight compartment so that it would not open no 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.909
 No, and then I thought he was blocking these buttons again. No, he disconnects 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.140
 side buttons yes again practical application in 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.770
 This little I see but maybe someone needs the buttons themselves very much 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.039
 durable because omron switches are installed inside 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.479
 As in the same steel services, for example, one more moment of the dipyai switch button 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.679
 located far enough away from the wheel I like it because their 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.090
 accidentally you will not press but the one who needs during the game to quickly press them will face 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.789
 the fact that it is rather inconvenient by the way the level is now shown 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.469
 light indicator here wheel as for me too drowned inside and 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.439
 slightly backlash but it doesn't matter easy to get used to 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.410
 laser sensor with a resolution of 5610 should be enough next to it is 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.480
 compartment for weights of 5 each of four and a half grams I love heavy 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.500
 mouse but use all the weights did not become too much advantage 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.450
 and the mouse is not comfortable to lift so left only three of them so the balance was 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.620
 actually restored the mouse is very cool sitting in his hand and if also the weight 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.900
 configure it is generally cool turns out the driver here seems kind of simple but has 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.160
 quite ample opportunities you can assign to any button except the left 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.630
 macro one of several standard commands like back in a browser or launch 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.519
 applications also have tuning now and polling frequency macro recording 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.299
 and backlight adjustment you can choose from seven colors for 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.799
 whole mouse or your own color for four different areas logo wheels on the back 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.959
 part or side there is also a cool battle mode in this mode color 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.510
 backlight varies depending on your a.e. 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.889
 first dark blue but the faster you push the button the faster it changes 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:16.950
 the color on this hundreds ends rather you can download 2 more programs 1 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.819
 allows you to adjust the separation height and a different button press speed 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.389
 I think it's cool but you could integrate them into the main driver 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.889
 less hassle would be sport parties children generally intended to play the genre 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.760
 RTS is so written everywhere and it was developed together with 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.720
 Taiwanese starcraft ram softball but honestly I would love to ride 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.269
 it not only in dota and starcraft but also k. 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.069
 maybe it's because I practically don't use macros a couple of nice 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.139
 surprises left finally in the first place is the cable it is very thin and 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.130
 light is cool and he is in fabric braid, which in my opinion is also not bad 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.169
 secondly this is a cool soft bag for transportation of a couple of sun 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.819
 compartments inside and a pair of stickers I just collect them 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.560
 a trifle but it was nice in general I liked the mouse very well showed itself 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.450
 In games of design, I put 5 ergonomics 4 still have a little incomprehensible 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.519
 moments however it absolutely does not spoil 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.380
