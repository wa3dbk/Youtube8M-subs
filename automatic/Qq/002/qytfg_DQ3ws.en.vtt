yourself<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.659> then<00:01:20.659> Cassadine<00:01:21.200> was<00:01:21.500> designed

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
yourself and then Cassadine was designed

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.250 
yourself and then Cassadine was designed
to<00:01:22.070> screw<00:01:22.310> up<00:01:22.400> your<00:01:22.430> farm<00:01:22.939> if<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.780> come<00:01:23.960> close

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
to screw up your farm if you come close

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.270 
for loss aides he will use full combo on
you<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:26.900> magic<00:01:27.230> resistance<00:01:27.620> will<00:01:27.920> be<00:01:28.040> quite

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
you so magic resistance will be quite

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.450 
you so magic resistance will be quite
important<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.060> early<00:01:29.360> game<00:01:30.010> if<00:01:31.010> we<00:01:31.250> have<00:01:31.430> a
