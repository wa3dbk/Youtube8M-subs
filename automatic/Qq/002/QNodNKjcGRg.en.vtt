00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.930 
triple-a I think one moving on to the
whole<00:02:24.980> cut<00:02:25.190> they<00:02:25.340> get<00:02:25.490> these<00:02:25.610> artistic

pictures where the edges are very blurry

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.130 
pictures where the edges are very blurry
and<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.100> get<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.090> put<00:02:29.270> filters

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
and then you get it you can put filters
