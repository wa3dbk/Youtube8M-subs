00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
than I gave it credit for originally it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
than I gave it credit for originally it
has<00:01:06.390> some<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:06.840> nice<00:01:07.020> proportions<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
has some really nice proportions and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
has some really nice proportions and
good<00:01:08.159> sculpt<00:01:08.520> work<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.180> did<00:01:09.450> put<00:01:09.780> new

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
good sculpt work to it I did put new

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
good sculpt work to it I did put new
lower<00:01:10.380> legs<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> folks<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.640> didn't<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
lower legs on it folks I didn't like the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.200 
lower legs on it folks I didn't like the
feet<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> had<00:01:12.840> at<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.040> boots<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
feet that it had at all or the boots so

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.520 
feet that it had at all or the boots so
I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.140> makes<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.500> big

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I think that really makes a big

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.170 
I think that really makes a big
difference<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.460> I'll<00:01:17.610> get<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
difference but I'll get into that in a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.649 
difference but I'll get into that in a
little<00:01:18.210> bit<00:01:18.560> he<00:01:19.560> stands<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.430> under<00:01:21.299> six<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
little bit he stands just under six and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.359 
little bit he stands just under six and
a<00:01:21.689> half<00:01:21.720> inches<00:01:22.170> tall<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.409> he's<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> scale<00:01:23.159> with

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
a half inches tall so he's in scale with

like<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.860> hole<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> skin<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.110> used<00:01:58.110> some

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
like a hole in the skin I used some

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
like a hole in the skin I used some
gloss<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.920> make<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.189> look<00:01:59.340> kind<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.610> goopy<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
gloss to make it look kind of goopy and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.520 
gloss to make it look kind of goopy and
wet<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.689> did<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> same<00:02:01.110> thing<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
wet and I did the same thing for the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
wet and I did the same thing for the
eyes<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> mouth<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.430> course<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.540> see

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
eyes in the mouth of course you can see

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.910 
eyes in the mouth of course you can see
the<00:02:04.130> pink<00:02:05.130> glossiness<00:02:05.969> coming<00:02:06.329> through<00:02:06.630> I

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
the pink glossiness coming through I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.589 
the pink glossiness coming through I
think<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> holes<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.789> whole<00:02:09.060> areas

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
think in the holes at whole areas

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.330 
think in the holes at whole areas
whatever<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> want<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> call<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.129> I'm

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
trying to make them look kind of nasty

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.730 
trying to make them look kind of nasty
without<00:02:13.170> making<00:02:13.410> them<00:02:13.470> look

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
without making them look

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.520 
without making them look
-<00:02:13.920> nasty<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.670> think<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.300> worked<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.600> well<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.080> was

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the jaw just a little bit I didn't want

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.560 
the jaw just a little bit I didn't want
it<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:27.990> quite<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.400> square<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.580> angular<00:02:29.850> but

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
it to be quite so square and angular but

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.040 
it to be quite so square and angular but
it<00:02:30.810> still<00:02:31.140> maintains<00:02:31.680> its<00:02:31.860> general<00:02:32.760> look<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:34.020> I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
it still maintains its general look so I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.930 
it still maintains its general look so I
was<00:02:34.230> pretty<00:02:34.440> happy<00:02:34.620> with<00:02:35.010> using<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.490> head<00:02:35.820> it

nicely so turned out good again use

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.140 
nicely so turned out good again use
magnets<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:44.370> time<00:02:44.610> instead<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.880> putting<00:02:44.940> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
magnets this time instead of putting a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.880 
magnets this time instead of putting a
screw<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.660> because<00:02:45.960> he's<00:02:46.080> got<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.380> big<00:02:46.590> bulb

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890

head<00:02:47.130> up<00:02:47.280> there<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:48.210> drilled<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
head up there I just drilled out the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.150 
head up there I just drilled out the
ball<00:02:48.870> peg<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.230> put<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.470> magnet<00:02:49.860> right<00:02:50.010> in

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
ball peg and put the magnet right in

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.690 
ball peg and put the magnet right in
there<00:02:50.400> which<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.650> equally<00:02:52.650> effective<00:02:52.770> as<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
there which is equally effective as the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.270 
there which is equally effective as the
screw<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.210> that's<00:02:54.420> good<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.770> straps<00:02:56.100> on

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280

buckles there I did the seam piping all

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.070 
buckles there I did the seam piping all
the<00:03:44.460> way<00:03:44.550> around<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.480> legs<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.960> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080

arms<00:03:48.300> using<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.230> wire<00:03:49.800> technique<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.550> I've

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
arms using the wire technique that I've

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.690 
arms using the wire technique that I've
used<00:03:50.910> before<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.920> wanted<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.250> keep<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.550> kind

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
used before and I wanted to keep it kind

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.580 
used before and I wanted to keep it kind
of<00:03:53.820> high<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.390> not<00:03:54.660> only<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> design

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
of high on this not only for the design

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.110 
of high on this not only for the design
I<00:03:55.620> didn't<00:03:56.100> want<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.310> black<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.610> come<00:03:56.760> too<00:03:56.910> far

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
I didn't want the black to come too far

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.360 
I didn't want the black to come too far
down<00:03:57.300> but<00:03:57.570> also<00:03:58.170> if<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.590> kept<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.950> up<00:03:59.040> here<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.280> was

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
down but also if I kept it up here I was

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.800 
down but also if I kept it up here I was
able<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.640> make<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.300> could<00:04:00.390> rotate

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
able to make it so that you could rotate

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.770 
able to make it so that you could rotate
the<00:04:00.960> leg<00:04:01.200> without<00:04:02.190> destroying<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.330> look<00:04:03.540> of

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
the leg without destroying the look of

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.830 
the leg without destroying the look of
the<00:04:04.230> pattern<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.970> think<00:04:06.330> that<00:04:06.480> turned<00:04:06.630> out

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
the pattern so I think that turned out

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.410 
the pattern so I think that turned out
really<00:04:07.020> nicely<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.680> works<00:04:07.830> well<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.970> keeps

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
really nicely and it works well it keeps

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.450 
really nicely and it works well it keeps
the<00:04:09.750> pattern<00:04:10.200> where<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.440> belongs<00:04:10.800> at<00:04:11.250> all

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
the pattern where it belongs at all

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.850 
the pattern where it belongs at all
times<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.210> I<00:04:12.240> think<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.630> works<00:04:12.810> out<00:04:13.020> I<00:04:13.260> added

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
times so I think that works out I added

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.539 
times so I think that works out I added
a<00:04:14.070> holster<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:14.670> his<00:04:14.910> side<00:04:15.150> or<00:04:15.690> on<00:04:16.049> his<00:04:16.140> thigh

as I already mentioned so I took some of

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.790 
as I already mentioned so I took some of
the<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:09.370> used<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.150> wrestler<00:05:10.539> figure<00:05:10.930> for<00:05:11.289> cable

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
at the top of the boot there and I just

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.909 
at the top of the boot there and I just
connected<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.400> legs<00:05:24.909> together<00:05:25.240> so<00:05:25.770> he's<00:05:26.770> got

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
connected the legs together so he's got

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.469 
connected the legs together so he's got
these<00:05:27.069> grand<00:05:27.340> black<00:05:27.580> boots<00:05:27.880> with<00:05:28.090> little

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
these grand black boots with little

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.540 
these grand black boots with little
rivets<00:05:28.810> in<00:05:28.960> them<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.770> little<00:05:30.009> patch<00:05:30.190> of<00:05:30.219> red

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
rivets in them and a little patch of red

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.749 
rivets in them and a little patch of red
on<00:05:30.729> the<00:05:30.849> top<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:32.680> it<00:05:32.860> just<00:05:32.889> kind<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.370> I<00:05:33.520> think<00:05:33.580> I

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
on the top and it just kind of I think I

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.730 
on the top and it just kind of I think I
think<00:05:34.090> overall<00:05:34.449> it<00:05:34.870> just<00:05:35.080> fits<00:05:35.259> the<00:05:35.440> figure

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
think overall it just fits the figure

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.070 
think overall it just fits the figure
better<00:05:35.949> than<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:37.060> smaller<00:05:37.449> feet<00:05:37.780> that<00:05:37.990> were

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
better than the smaller feet that were

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.110 
better than the smaller feet that were
on<00:05:38.259> the<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:39.130> original<00:05:39.610> body<00:05:41.460> is<00:05:42.460> not<00:05:42.759> a<00:05:42.789> little

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
on the the original body is not a little

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.520 
on the the original body is not a little
bit<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:45.250> feet<00:05:45.460> did<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.820> Bucky<00:05:46.810> cap<00:05:47.050> head<00:05:47.349> were

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
bit the feet did the Bucky cap head were

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.209 
bit the feet did the Bucky cap head were
just<00:05:47.740> too<00:05:47.949> small<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.719> I<00:05:49.740> didn't<00:05:50.740> like<00:05:50.860> him<00:05:51.009> so

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
just too small and I didn't like him so

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.689 
just too small and I didn't like him so
I<00:05:51.400> replaced<00:05:51.789> him<00:05:52.000> I<00:05:52.090> think<00:05:52.360> these<00:05:52.449> work<00:05:52.690> well

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
I replaced him I think these work well

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.969 
I replaced him I think these work well
so<00:05:54.699> for<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.180> black<00:05:55.419> it's<00:05:55.719> all<00:05:55.870> just<00:05:56.139> solid

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
so for the black it's all just solid

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.930 
so for the black it's all just solid
flat<00:05:57.190> black<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:58.270> red<00:05:58.509> is<00:05:58.810> black<00:05:59.259> with

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
flat black the red is black with

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.760 
flat black the red is black with
obviously<00:06:00.940> red<00:06:01.210> drybrushing<00:06:01.719> over<00:06:02.110> it<00:06:02.229> to

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
obviously red drybrushing over it to

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.550 
obviously red drybrushing over it to
give<00:06:02.949> the<00:06:03.130> texture<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.210> right<00:06:04.389> look<00:06:04.870> the

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
give the texture and the right look the

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.640 
give the texture and the right look the
eyes<00:06:05.740> are<00:06:06.280> semi-gloss<00:06:07.210> white<00:06:07.710> for<00:06:08.710> this<00:06:08.830> head

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
eyes are semi-gloss white for this head

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.629 
eyes are semi-gloss white for this head
excuse<00:06:11.650> me<00:06:12.539> dust<00:06:14.969> and<00:06:15.969> all<00:06:16.270> the<00:06:16.569> gray<00:06:16.990> straps

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
excuse me dust and all the gray straps

excuse me dust and all the gray straps
in<00:06:18.639> belt<00:06:18.940> are<00:06:19.330> not<00:06:19.599> completely<00:06:20.080> glossy<00:06:20.560> but

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
in belt are not completely glossy but

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.409 
in belt are not completely glossy but
they<00:06:20.800> do<00:06:20.860> have<00:06:21.130> a<00:06:21.159> little<00:06:21.400> bit<00:06:21.550> of<00:06:21.819> a<00:06:21.940> sheen<00:06:22.120> to

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
they do have a little bit of a sheen to

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.059 
they do have a little bit of a sheen to
them<00:06:22.599> that's<00:06:22.870> not<00:06:23.020> just<00:06:23.259> from<00:06:23.409> the<00:06:23.560> lights<00:06:23.770> I

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
them that's not just from the lights I

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:26.070 
them that's not just from the lights I
did<00:06:24.580> that<00:06:24.759> to<00:06:24.880> make<00:06:25.030> them<00:06:25.180> look<00:06:25.330> kind<00:06:25.659> of<00:06:25.719> just

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
did that to make them look kind of just

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.950 
did that to make them look kind of just
to<00:06:26.169> separate<00:06:26.620> them<00:06:26.740> from<00:06:26.770> the<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:28.240> level<00:06:28.870> of

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
to separate them from the the level of

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.990 
to separate them from the the level of
glossiness<00:06:29.620> for<00:06:29.860> the<00:06:29.949> outfit<00:06:30.370> so<00:06:30.610> it<00:06:30.849> looks

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
glossiness for the outfit so it looks

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.550 
glossiness for the outfit so it looks
like<00:06:31.150> different<00:06:31.300> materials<00:06:31.930> actually<00:06:32.169> I

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
like different materials actually I

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.749 
like different materials actually I
think<00:06:32.710> it<00:06:32.919> just<00:06:33.069> gives<00:06:33.159> a<00:06:33.310> little<00:06:33.460> bit<00:06:33.639> of

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
think it just gives a little bit of

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.879 
think it just gives a little bit of
realism<00:06:34.089> to<00:06:34.270> the<00:06:34.479> figure<00:06:34.810> again<00:06:35.440> this<00:06:35.710> isn't

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
realism to the figure again this isn't

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.409 
realism to the figure again this isn't
based<00:06:36.159> on<00:06:36.310> any<00:06:36.460> particular<00:06:36.639> version<00:06:37.360> of

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
based on any particular version of

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.000 
based on any particular version of
Deadpool<00:06:37.599> it's<00:06:37.960> just<00:06:38.139> what<00:06:38.260> I
