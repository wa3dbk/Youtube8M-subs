so I may have suffered the reasons unit

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:28.499 
so I may have suffered the reasons unit
I<00:00:22.470> prepared<00:00:23.470> my<00:00:23.769> e<00:00:25.859> cos<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:27.310> current<00:00:27.909> sensor

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
I prepared my e cos the current sensor

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:39.200 
I prepared my e cos the current sensor
Oh<00:00:30.300> Stevie<00:00:31.300> GTS<00:00:32.250> MRI<00:00:34.920> share<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.130> receiver<00:00:36.670> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.200 

I'm<00:00:40.210> gonna<00:00:41.190> mount<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:43.330> current<00:00:43.780> sons<00:00:44.080> are<00:00:45.210> on

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
I'm gonna mount the current sons are on

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.080 
I'm gonna mount the current sons are on
the<00:00:46.510> side<00:00:46.720> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:48.190> battery<00:00:48.580> tray<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:51.550> we<00:00:51.880> can

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
the side of the battery tray if we can

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:04.670 
the side of the battery tray if we can
burn<00:00:53.080> iso<00:00:53.410> maker<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.360> can<00:00:58.570> see<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:58.900> better

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.530 

it's<00:01:05.680> hard<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.100> see<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.610> battery<00:01:07.000> tray<00:01:07.299> back

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
it's hard to see the battery tray back

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.940 
it's hard to see the battery tray back
there<00:01:08.730> and<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:10.810> going<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.110> run<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.470> cables

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
there and I'm going to run the cables

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.450 
there and I'm going to run the cables
down<00:01:15.159> to<00:01:15.400> defeat<00:01:15.700> point<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:19.659> be<00:01:19.870> able<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.470> do

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
down to defeat point to be able to do

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:34.500 
down to defeat point to be able to do
this<00:01:21.700> I<00:01:25.080> need<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.850> remove<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:31.659> balloon<00:01:33.510> so

get<00:02:54.020> this

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:18.500 

okay<00:03:11.810> perfect<00:03:14.900> applause<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:17.060> ghost<00:03:18.060> cable

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
okay perfect applause the ghost cable

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.920 
okay perfect applause the ghost cable
and<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:19.950> need<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:22.520> turn<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.730> upside<00:03:24.180> down<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.750> be

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
and I need to turn it upside down to be

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.870 
and I need to turn it upside down to be
able<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.350> solder<00:03:26.240> so<00:03:27.240> i<00:03:27.300> have<00:03:27.540> just<00:03:28.110> flipped

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
able to solder so i have just flipped

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.280 
able to solder so i have just flipped
the<00:03:29.880> TBS<00:03:30.420> upside<00:03:31.200> down<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.800> be<00:03:31.920> able<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:34.310> solder

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
the TBS upside down to be able to solder

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:52.840 
the TBS upside down to be able to solder
de-<00:03:39.920> connection<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.190> board

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:05.750 

he's<00:03:53.420> quite<00:03:53.930> large

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.330 

okay<00:04:08.569> then<00:04:09.569> my<00:04:11.750> co<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.260> current<00:04:13.620> sensor<00:04:14.129> is

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
okay then my co is the current sensor is

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.449 
okay then my co is the current sensor is
attached<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.510> board<00:04:15.840> little<00:04:18.049> stripe<00:04:19.049> it

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
attached to the board little stripe it

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.189 
attached to the board little stripe it
like<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.669> so<00:04:21.560> let<00:04:22.560> me<00:04:22.740> have<00:04:22.919> soldered<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
like this so let me have soldered the

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.930 
like this so let me have soldered the
current<00:04:25.199> sensor<00:04:25.620> I'm<00:04:25.860> about<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:28.550> screw<00:04:29.550> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
current sensor I'm about to screw the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:05:05.700 
current sensor I'm about to screw the
boom<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:32.030> removed<00:04:33.030> for<00:04:35.449> soul<00:04:36.449> drain

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:15.570 

ok<00:05:08.350> and<00:05:09.350> I<00:05:09.560> have<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:09.770> power<00:05:10.040> source<00:05:13.390> IES

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
ok and I have the power source IES

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.390 
ok and I have the power source IES
mostly<00:05:16.580> current<00:05:16.940> sensor
