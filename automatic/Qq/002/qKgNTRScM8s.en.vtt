00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:01.650> I've<00:00:02.070> been<00:00:02.159> sold<00:00:02.429> in<00:00:02.520> 100<00:00:02.909> for<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.090> few

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so I've been sold in 100 for a few

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.510 
so I've been sold in 100 for a few
months<00:00:03.419> now<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.980> with<00:00:04.980> almost<00:00:05.190> no<00:00:05.339> real

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
months now and with almost no real

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.340 
months now and with almost no real
practice<00:00:05.879> average<00:00:06.210> somewhere<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> 35<00:00:07.319> or

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
practice average somewhere in the 35 or

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.220 
practice average somewhere in the 35 or
40<00:00:07.830> second<00:00:08.160> range<00:00:08.690> now<00:00:09.690> that's<00:00:09.900> not<00:00:10.050> really

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
40 second range now that's not really

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.570 
40 second range now that's not really
that<00:00:10.260> great<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:10.830> I'm<00:00:10.920> not<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.190> an<00:00:11.309> expert

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
that great so I'm not really an expert

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.799 
that great so I'm not really an expert
but<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.759> think<00:00:12.030> I'll<00:00:12.120> still<00:00:12.360> be<00:00:12.450> able<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.690> give

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
but I think I'll still be able to give

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.299 
but I think I'll still be able to give
you<00:00:12.900> some<00:00:13.139> pointers<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.860> how<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.009> get<00:00:14.190> started

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
you some pointers on how to get started

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.760 
you some pointers on how to get started
with<00:00:14.700> salt<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.480> Road<00:00:15.599> escape<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.139> using<00:00:16.619> one

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
with salt and Road escape just using one

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.580 
with salt and Road escape just using one
hand<00:00:17.750> okay<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.810> first<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.170> all<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.380> want<00:00:19.529> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
hand okay so first of all you want to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.890 
hand okay so first of all you want to
choose<00:00:19.770> which<00:00:19.920> hand<00:00:20.160> you're<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> use

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
choose which hand you're going to use

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.090 
choose which hand you're going to use
the<00:00:21.900> choice<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.199> rather<00:00:22.350> arbitrary<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.980> there

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the choice is rather arbitrary and there

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.560 
the choice is rather arbitrary and there
are<00:00:23.160> many<00:00:23.310> people<00:00:23.550> use<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> left<00:00:24.000> hand<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
are many people use the left hand and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.820 
are many people use the left hand and
almost<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.080> many<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.410> use<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> right

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
almost just as many that use the right

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.470 
almost just as many that use the right
hand<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.699> don't<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.180> there's<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
hand and I don't think that there's a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.230 
hand and I don't think that there's a
big<00:00:28.140> correlation<00:00:28.710> between<00:00:28.849> whether<00:00:29.849> or<00:00:30.119> not

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
big correlation between whether or not

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.690 
big correlation between whether or not
you're<00:00:30.420> left-handed<00:00:30.660> or<00:00:30.900> right-handed<00:00:31.700> for

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
you're left-handed or right-handed for

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.160 
you're left-handed or right-handed for
example<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.059> chose<00:00:33.210> left<00:00:33.480> hand<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
example I chose left hand because the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.720 
example I chose left hand because the
I'm<00:00:34.440> right-handed<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.430> left<00:00:35.550> hand

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
I'm right-handed I just left hand

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.040 
I'm right-handed I just left hand
because<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.149> cube<00:00:36.390> felt<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> more

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
because the cube felt all the more

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.560 
because the cube felt all the more
stable<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:37.620> left<00:00:37.890> hand<00:00:38.180> that<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.450> also

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
stable in my left hand that and I also

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.209 
stable in my left hand that and I also
wanted<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.020> able<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.320> eat<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.950> my<00:00:41.070> right

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
wanted to be able to eat with my right

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.260 
wanted to be able to eat with my right
hand<00:00:41.250> oh<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> saw<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.000> left<00:00:44.090> one<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
hand oh I saw with my left one of the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.670 
hand oh I saw with my left one of the
advantages<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.809> most<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> algorithms

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
advantages that most of the algorithms

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.139 
advantages that most of the algorithms
you<00:00:46.980> already<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.460> probably<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you already know are probably very are a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.299 
you already know are probably very are a
new<00:00:48.450> heavy<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.890> quite<00:00:50.070> awkward

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
new heavy and it is just quite awkward

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.819 
new heavy and it is just quite awkward
in<00:00:50.610> my<00:00:50.670> opinion<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.629> arm<00:00:51.809> moves<00:00:52.079> with

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
in my opinion to do the arm moves with

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.819 
in my opinion to do the arm moves with
the<00:00:52.949> right<00:00:53.129> hand<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.780> suggest<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> probably

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the right hand so I suggest you probably

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.619 
the right hand so I suggest you probably
try<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> use<00:00:56.250> left<00:00:56.610> first<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.300> switch<00:00:57.480> if

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
try to use left first and just switch if

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.750 
try to use left first and just switch if
it<00:00:57.719> feels<00:00:57.960> wrong<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.280> mostly<00:00:59.550> on

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it feels wrong but it's mostly on

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750 
it feels wrong but it's mostly on
personal<00:01:00.449> preference<00:01:01.520> okay<00:01:02.520> I'll<00:01:02.640> be

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
personal preference okay I'll be

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.590 
personal preference okay I'll be
explaining<00:01:03.090> everything<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
explaining everything from the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.149 
explaining everything from the
perspective<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.170> someone<00:01:04.350> he<00:01:04.559> consults<00:01:05.040> with

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
perspective of someone he consults with

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.190 
perspective of someone he consults with
their<00:01:05.309> left<00:01:05.460> hand<00:01:05.700> because<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.479> solved<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.080> my

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
their left hand because I solved with my

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.340 
their left hand because I solved with my
left<00:01:07.380> hand<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.979> hope<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.549> makes<00:01:08.700> sense<00:01:09.350> so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
left hand so I hope that makes sense so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980 
left hand so I hope that makes sense so
basic<00:01:10.590> moves<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.540> down<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.720> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
basic moves you get down like this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.370 
basic moves you get down like this
that's<00:01:13.890> pretty<00:01:14.070> self-explanatory<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:15.509> prime

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that's pretty self-explanatory you prime

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.280 
that's pretty self-explanatory you prime
I<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
I do like that and I don't think that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.740 
I do like that and I don't think that
there<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.560> better<00:01:19.799> way<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.130> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
there is a better way to do it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.940 
there is a better way to do it
for<00:01:22.140> ours<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.680> use<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:23.040> pinky<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.950> know

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
for ours I use my pinky like this I know

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.380 
for ours I use my pinky like this I know
that<00:01:26.189> some<00:01:26.340> people<00:01:26.460> use<00:01:26.729> their<00:01:26.909> ring<00:01:27.060> finger

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that some people use their ring finger

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.859 
that some people use their ring finger
to<00:01:27.659> put<00:01:28.729> for<00:01:29.729> our<00:01:29.850> prime<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> use<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:30.570> index

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
to put for our prime I use my index

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
to put for our prime I use my index
finger<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.640> that's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
finger like this and I know that that's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
finger like this and I know that that's
not<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> best<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.659> I've<00:01:33.960> been<00:01:34.110> recently

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
not the best way and I've been recently

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.920 
not the best way and I've been recently
trying<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> switch<00:01:35.490> using<00:01:36.240> pinky<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
trying to switch using pinky like this

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.950 
trying to switch using pinky like this
in<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.470> cases<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.509> I<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.810> some

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
in some cases and I know that some

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.100 
in some cases and I know that some
people<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.200> use<00:01:40.500> ring<00:01:41.189> finger<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.110> do

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
people actually use ring finger to do

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.539 
people actually use ring finger to do
those<00:01:43.290> moves<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.220> ridiculous

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
those moves and that's just ridiculous

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760 
those moves and that's just ridiculous
those<00:01:44.850> people<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.240> clearly<00:01:45.479> an<00:01:46.020> abomination

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
those people are clearly an abomination

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.770 
those people are clearly an abomination
because<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.240> don't<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.570> how<00:01:48.720> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
because I just I just don't see how you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.550 
because I just I just don't see how you
do<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.210> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> practice<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.020> lot

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
do that and you want to practice a lot

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.149 
do that and you want to practice a lot
of<00:01:52.710> combinations<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.880> rnu<00:01:54.479> UNR<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.500> all<00:01:56.130> those

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
of combinations so rnu UNR and all those

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.700 
of combinations so rnu UNR and all those
combo<00:01:58.030> moves<00:01:58.240> up<00:01:58.420> ulr<00:01:58.929> because<00:01:59.289> everything

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
combo moves up ulr because everything

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.889 
combo moves up ulr because everything
your<00:02:00.579> entire<00:02:00.819> one-handed<00:02:01.329> solves<00:02:01.600> going<00:02:01.810> to

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
your entire one-handed solves going to

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.559 
your entire one-handed solves going to
compose<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.350> these<00:02:02.499> two<00:02:02.679> moves<00:02:02.859> and<00:02:03.569> cube

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
compose of these two moves and cube

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.569 
compose of these two moves and cube
rotations<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.109> course<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.189> want<00:02:06.429> them<00:02:06.520> to

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
rotations of course so you want them to

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.479 
rotations of course so you want them to
be<00:02:06.789> really<00:02:06.939> quick<00:02:07.920> okay<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:08.979> now<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.220> actual

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
be really quick okay so now the actual

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.210 
be really quick okay so now the actual
solve<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:11.319> cross<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.709> net<00:02:11.830> well<00:02:12.040> you'll

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
solve so cross the net well you'll

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.860 
solve so cross the net well you'll
probably<00:02:12.280> do<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.849> same<00:02:13.120> way<00:02:13.299> as<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.750> do

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
probably do the same way as you do

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.930 
probably do the same way as you do
two-handed<00:02:14.470> you'll<00:02:15.099> most<00:02:15.340> likely<00:02:15.400> find<00:02:15.760> that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
two-handed you'll most likely find that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.309 
two-handed you'll most likely find that
tool<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.299> be<00:02:16.390> easy<00:02:16.569> because<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.080> will<00:02:17.200> have

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
tool to be easy because you will have

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.619 
tool to be easy because you will have
plenty<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.650> time<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:18.129> look<00:02:18.670> ahead<00:02:18.819> unlike<00:02:19.510> in

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
plenty of time to look ahead unlike in

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.990 
plenty of time to look ahead unlike in
the<00:02:19.660> 200<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.489> now<00:02:21.489> where<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.700> gets<00:02:21.849> really

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
the 200 so now where it gets really

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.699 
the 200 so now where it gets really
interesting<00:02:22.209> though<00:02:22.569> is<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.720> oil<00:02:23.200> step<00:02:23.500> and

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
interesting though is the oil step and

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.990 
interesting though is the oil step and
you<00:02:23.799> have<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> couple<00:02:24.129> of<00:02:24.280> options<00:02:24.430> based<00:02:24.879> on

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
you have a couple of options based on

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.750 
you have a couple of options based on
how<00:02:25.120> lazy<00:02:25.299> or<00:02:25.540> not<00:02:25.690> as<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.049> are<00:02:26.280> obviously<00:02:27.280> if

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
how lazy or not as you are obviously if

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.400 
how lazy or not as you are obviously if
you<00:02:27.879> are<00:02:27.910> really<00:02:28.120> serious<00:02:28.420> about<00:02:28.599> 100<00:02:29.110> cubing

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
you are really serious about 100 cubing

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.259 
you are really serious about 100 cubing
you<00:02:29.769> will<00:02:29.920> learn<00:02:30.040> all<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.519> one-handed<00:02:30.849> oils

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
you will learn all the one-handed oils

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.949 
you will learn all the one-handed oils
and<00:02:31.510> I'll<00:02:31.720> give<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:31.989> links<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.260> all<00:02:32.829> of<00:02:33.010> those

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
and I'll give you links to all of those

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.240 
and I'll give you links to all of those
if<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.110> are<00:02:35.140> less<00:02:35.379> serious<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.890> will<00:02:35.980> attempt

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
if you are less serious you will attempt

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.680 
if you are less serious you will attempt
to<00:02:36.370> use<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.640> same<00:02:36.849> oils<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.269> probably<00:02:37.569> use

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
to use the same oils you probably use

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.259 
to use the same oils you probably use
for<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.959> two-handed<00:02:38.410> selves<00:02:38.709> now<00:02:39.700> that's

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
for the two-handed selves now that's

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:40.710 
for the two-handed selves now that's
what<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.420> do

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
what I do

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.600 
what I do
and<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.650> will<00:02:41.799> most<00:02:42.069> likely<00:02:42.190> find<00:02:42.370> it

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
and but you will most likely find it

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.740 
and but you will most likely find it
very<00:02:42.790> difficult<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.180> execute<00:02:43.450> these

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
very difficult to execute these

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.830 
very difficult to execute these
algorithms<00:02:44.019> with<00:02:44.349> just<00:02:44.560> one<00:02:44.709> hand<00:02:45.239> now<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.690> know

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
algorithms with just one hand now I know

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.360 
algorithms with just one hand now I know
it<00:02:46.959> was<00:02:47.049> very<00:02:47.260> difficult<00:02:47.440> for<00:02:47.650> me<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.190> had

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
it was very difficult for me and I had

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.190 
it was very difficult for me and I had
to<00:02:48.489> relearn<00:02:48.879> most<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.359> these<00:02:49.420> oils<00:02:49.810> for<00:02:50.049> one

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
to relearn most of these oils for one

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.080 
to relearn most of these oils for one
hand<00:02:50.379> simply<00:02:51.099> by<00:02:51.310> doing<00:02:51.370> them<00:02:51.670> with<00:02:51.790> both

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
hand simply by doing them with both

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.309 
hand simply by doing them with both
hands<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.510> then<00:02:52.569> trying<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.900> see<00:02:53.079> what<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
hands and then trying to see what the

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.589 
hands and then trying to see what the
hell<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.500> was<00:02:53.590> doing<00:02:53.879> it's<00:02:54.879> just<00:02:55.000> not<00:02:55.209> as<00:02:55.450> easy

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
hell I was doing it's just not as easy

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.750 
hell I was doing it's just not as easy
as<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.810> sounds

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
as it sounds

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.520 
as it sounds
now<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.629> even<00:02:58.780> less<00:02:59.019> serious<00:02:59.349> we'll

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
now if you are even less serious we'll

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.349 
now if you are even less serious we'll
probably<00:02:59.739> use<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.069> -<00:03:00.220> Latoya<00:03:00.609> which<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.239> how

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
probably use the - Latoya which is how

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:01.949 
probably use the - Latoya which is how
it<00:03:01.480> started

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
it started

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.379 
it started
where<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.530> only<00:03:02.739> need<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.099> relearn<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.760> couple<00:03:04.329> of

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
where I only need to relearn a couple of

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.970 
where I only need to relearn a couple of
algorithms<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.200> seven<00:03:05.470> algorithms<00:03:05.859> where

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
algorithms the seven algorithms where

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.940 
algorithms the seven algorithms where
all<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.280> edges<00:03:06.489> are<00:03:06.579> oriented<00:03:06.970> correctly<00:03:07.950> now

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
all the edges are oriented correctly now

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.110 
all the edges are oriented correctly now
still<00:03:09.190> for<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.489> OL<00:03:09.609> all<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.880> have<00:03:09.970> more

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
still for the OL all you have more

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.940 
still for the OL all you have more
options<00:03:10.299> another<00:03:11.230> thing<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.680> can<00:03:11.799> learn

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
options another thing that you can learn

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.339 
options another thing that you can learn
as<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.280> zbf<00:03:12.790> 12<00:03:13.090> which<00:03:13.900> are<00:03:14.049> basically

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
as the zbf 12 which are basically

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.229 
as the zbf 12 which are basically
algorithms<00:03:14.859> for<00:03:15.040> inserting<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.549> last<00:03:15.760> f2l

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
algorithms for inserting the last f2l

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.150 
algorithms for inserting the last f2l
pair<00:03:16.269> in<00:03:16.599> such<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.840> way<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.049> when<00:03:17.919> you're<00:03:18.040> done

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
pair in such a way that when you're done

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.440 
pair in such a way that when you're done
inserting<00:03:18.639> it<00:03:18.760> all<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.060> edges<00:03:19.359> are<00:03:19.569> oriented

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
inserting it all the edges are oriented

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.330 
inserting it all the edges are oriented
so<00:03:22.450> for<00:03:22.630> example<00:03:23.049> for<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.620> case<00:03:23.829> where<00:03:24.099> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
so for example for this case where the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.250 
so for example for this case where the
two<00:03:24.549> edges<00:03:24.819> here<00:03:25.120> are<00:03:25.180> correctly<00:03:25.870> oriented

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
two edges here are correctly oriented

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.930 
two edges here are correctly oriented
there's<00:03:26.620> only<00:03:26.769> like<00:03:26.980> eight<00:03:27.250> cases<00:03:27.639> I<00:03:27.730> think

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
there's only like eight cases I think

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.759 
there's only like eight cases I think
for<00:03:28.450> this<00:03:28.569> case<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.900> particular<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.739> don't

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
for this case in particular you don't

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.460 
for this case in particular you don't
insert<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.489> like<00:03:30.700> normal<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.329> would<00:03:31.510> but

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
insert it like normal you would but

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.860 
insert it like normal you would but
instead<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:32.980> use<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.340> art<00:03:33.519> prime<00:03:33.819> F<00:03:34.150> R<00:03:34.569> F

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
instead you use the art prime F R F

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.960 
instead you use the art prime F R F
prime<00:03:35.109> insertion<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:36.459> guarantees<00:03:36.700> that

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
prime insertion and that guarantees that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.789 
prime insertion and that guarantees that
your<00:03:37.389> Cross<00:03:37.900> will<00:03:38.139> be<00:03:38.260> solved<00:03:38.590> when<00:03:38.739> you

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
your Cross will be solved when you

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.629 
your Cross will be solved when you
insert<00:03:39.099> it<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.540> there's<00:03:40.780> eight<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:40.989> those<00:03:41.200> and

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
insert it so there's eight of those and

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.699 
insert it so there's eight of those and
so<00:03:42.639> you<00:03:42.700> could<00:03:43.000> try<00:03:43.209> that<00:03:43.239> as<00:03:43.480> well<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:44.560> last

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
so you could try that as well the last

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.580 
so you could try that as well the last
approach<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.250> can<00:03:45.370> use<00:03:45.489> this<00:03:45.639> to<00:03:46.349> do<00:03:47.349> the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
approach that you can use this to do the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.129 
approach that you can use this to do the
petrous<00:03:47.980> method<00:03:48.549> approach<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.630> solving<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.049> F

petrous method approach to solving the F

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.300 
petrous method approach to solving the F

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
the edges oriented on the top so again

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.699 
the edges oriented on the top so again
you<00:03:58.090> only<00:03:58.239> have<00:03:58.419> to<00:03:58.510> relearn<00:03:58.840> those<00:03:59.109> seven<00:03:59.530> oil

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
you only have to relearn those seven oil

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.449 
you only have to relearn those seven oil
cases<00:04:00.220> with<00:04:00.819> for<00:04:01.180> one<00:04:01.299> hand<00:04:01.799> now<00:04:02.799> adventurous

method<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:03.819> don't<00:04:03.940> do<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.209> cross<00:04:04.419> or

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
method you don't do the cross or

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.879 
method you don't do the cross or
anything<00:04:04.780> like<00:04:05.019> that<00:04:05.049> but<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.470> build<00:04:05.680> this

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
anything like that but you build this

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.840 
anything like that but you build this
two<00:04:06.729> by<00:04:07.030> two<00:04:07.090> by<00:04:07.539> three<00:04:07.840> block<00:04:08.079> like<00:04:08.289> this

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
two by two by three block like this

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.440 
two by two by three block like this
then<00:04:09.240> you<00:04:09.300> hold<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.570> cube<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:10.800> and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
then you hold a cube just like that and

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.150 
then you hold a cube just like that and
do<00:04:12.450> some<00:04:12.690> where<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.080> do<00:04:13.440> some<00:04:13.650> magic<00:04:13.980> here

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
do some where you do some magic here

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.680 
do some where you do some magic here
which<00:04:14.370> I'm<00:04:14.490> not<00:04:14.610> going<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.880> explain<00:04:15.240> but

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
which I'm not going to explain but

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.390 
which I'm not going to explain but
basically<00:04:16.020> orient<00:04:16.500> all<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.830> edges<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.280> this

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
basically orient all the edges in this

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.060 
basically orient all the edges in this
step<00:04:18.080> so<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.110> was<00:04:19.350> magic<00:04:19.650> there<00:04:19.800> you<00:04:19.920> can

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
step so that was magic there you can

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.680 
step so that was magic there you can
check<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> links<00:04:20.670> for<00:04:20.880> how<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.239> do<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:21.540> in

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
check the links for how to do this in

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.230 
check the links for how to do this in
detail<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.170> now<00:04:23.100> basically<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.610> only<00:04:23.850> solve

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
detail and now basically you only solve

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.140 
detail and now basically you only solve
them<00:04:24.920> after<00:04:25.920> a<00:04:25.950> while<00:04:26.070> using<00:04:26.250> RNA<00:04:26.730> moves<00:04:26.910> after

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
them after a while using RNA moves after

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.670 
them after a while using RNA moves after
this<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:27.980> that<00:04:28.980> will<00:04:29.100> guarantee<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:30.680> once

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
this and that will guarantee that once

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.920 
this and that will guarantee that once
you<00:04:31.800> finish<00:04:32.040> up<00:04:32.190> -<00:04:32.310> all<00:04:32.480> you're<00:04:33.480> guaranteed<00:04:33.900> to

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
you finish up - all you're guaranteed to

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.400 
you finish up - all you're guaranteed to
run<00:04:34.200> into<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.680> case<00:04:35.040> where<00:04:35.250> although<00:04:36.140> all<00:04:37.140> the

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
run into a case where although all the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.830 
run into a case where although all the
edges<00:04:37.590> are<00:04:37.710> rented<00:04:38.040> correctly<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:39.630> can

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
edges are rented correctly so you can

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.740 
edges are rented correctly so you can
solve<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.170> oil<00:04:40.380> easily<00:04:41.040> so<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.420> PLL

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
solve the oil easily so a for the PLL

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.090 
solve the oil easily so a for the PLL
you<00:04:42.840> don't<00:04:42.990> have<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.200> many<00:04:43.350> options<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.980> can

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
you don't have that many options you can

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.940 
you don't have that many options you can
basically<00:04:44.310> use<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.880> tulip<00:04:45.180> below<00:04:45.510> or<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.900> can

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
basically use the tulip below or you can

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.740 
basically use the tulip below or you can
relearn<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.130> two-handed<00:04:47.580> PLL's<00:04:48.000> for<00:04:48.570> one

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
relearn the two-handed PLL's for one

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.440 
relearn the two-handed PLL's for one
hand<00:04:48.960> which<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:49.740> I<00:04:49.890> did<00:04:50.130> or<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.330> look

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
hand which is what I did or you can look

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.780 
hand which is what I did or you can look
up<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.690> special<00:04:52.130> one-handed<00:04:53.130> PLL's<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:53.730> I'll

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
up a special one-handed PLL's and I'll

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.240 
up a special one-handed PLL's and I'll
be<00:04:53.910> belongs<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.330> those<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:54.920> it<00:04:55.920> just<00:04:56.130> so

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
be belongs to those and it just so

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.950 
be belongs to those and it just so
happens<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.640> all<00:04:57.000> those<00:04:57.240> links<00:04:57.510> actually

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
happens that all those links actually

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.020 
happens that all those links actually
are<00:04:58.080> from<00:04:58.290> people<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:59.280> use<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.790> left<00:04:59.970> hand

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
are from people that use the left hand

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.310 
are from people that use the left hand
as<00:05:00.240> well<00:05:00.390> so<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.630> want<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.900> use<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.080> left<00:05:01.260> hand

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
as well so you want to use the left hand

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.930 
as well so you want to use the left hand
that<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:02.190> want<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.400> learn<00:05:02.490> from<00:05:02.730> those

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
that you want to learn from those

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.480 
that you want to learn from those
algorithms<00:05:03.710> so<00:05:04.710> it's<00:05:04.920> just<00:05:05.010> because<00:05:05.250> I'm<00:05:05.340> lazy

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
algorithms so it's just because I'm lazy

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.810 
algorithms so it's just because I'm lazy
I'm<00:05:05.870> executing<00:05:06.870> this<00:05:07.470> awkward<00:05:07.950> peel<00:05:08.190> for<00:05:08.670> this

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
I'm executing this awkward peel for this

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.860 
I'm executing this awkward peel for this
case<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.500> was<00:05:10.500> meant<00:05:10.710> for<00:05:10.770> two<00:05:11.070> hands<00:05:11.870> so

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
case that was meant for two hands so

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.750 
case that was meant for two hands so
again<00:05:13.170> you<00:05:13.320> want<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.620> find<00:05:14.310> something<00:05:14.610> better

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
again you want to find something better

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.410 
again you want to find something better
if<00:05:15.030> you're<00:05:15.510> serious<00:05:15.870> at<00:05:16.020> all

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
if you're serious at all

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.270 
if you're serious at all
okay<00:05:18.420> and<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.750> last<00:05:19.050> name<00:05:19.830> with<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.070> stress

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
okay and the last name with the stress

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.530 
okay and the last name with the stress
that<00:05:20.310> learning<00:05:20.790> to<00:05:20.940> solve<00:05:21.090> one<00:05:21.300> hand<00:05:21.480> that

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
that learning to solve one hand that

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.690 
that learning to solve one hand that
just<00:05:21.810> takes<00:05:21.990> practice<00:05:22.860> more<00:05:23.310> than<00:05:23.370> anything

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
just takes practice more than anything

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.910 
just takes practice more than anything
for<00:05:24.630> example<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:25.020> have<00:05:25.200> all<00:05:25.380> this<00:05:25.500> awesome

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
for example I have all this awesome

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.400 
for example I have all this awesome
theoretical<00:05:26.430> knowledge<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:26.910> yet<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:28.200> cube

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
theoretical knowledge and yet the cube

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.840 
theoretical knowledge and yet the cube
does<00:05:28.530> not<00:05:28.680> feel<00:05:28.920> stable<00:05:29.220> in<00:05:29.400> my<00:05:29.430> right<00:05:29.700> hand

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
does not feel stable in my right hand

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.820 
does not feel stable in my right hand
and<00:05:30.090> I<00:05:30.360> probably<00:05:30.720> average<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:31.230> minute<00:05:31.500> or<00:05:31.650> two

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
and I probably average a minute or two

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.140 
and I probably average a minute or two
with<00:05:31.950> it<00:05:32.100> there's<00:05:32.400> just<00:05:32.490> nothing<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:32.940> can<00:05:33.060> do

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
with it there's just nothing I can do

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.450 
with it there's just nothing I can do
about<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.540> it's<00:05:34.350> very<00:05:34.800> much<00:05:34.950> of<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.130> practice

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
about it it's very much of a practice

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.550 
about it it's very much of a practice
thing<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.600> just<00:05:36.810> make<00:05:36.930> sure<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.200> do<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:37.320> lot<00:05:37.530> of

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
thing so just make sure you do a lot of

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.440 
thing so just make sure you do a lot of
that<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.010> you'll<00:05:38.190> be<00:05:38.220> cubing<00:05:38.850> one<00:05:39.030> headed<00:05:39.330> in

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
that and you'll be cubing one headed in

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:48.480 
that and you'll be cubing one headed in
no<00:05:39.690> time<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.370> that's<00:05:41.370> it<00:05:41.460> for<00:05:41.580> now<00:05:41.810> all<00:05:42.810> right

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.590 

okay<00:05:49.490> so<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.640> know<00:05:49.760> that<00:05:49.850> you<00:05:50.090> guys<00:05:50.180> really<00:05:50.480> like

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
okay so I know that you guys really like

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.090 
okay so I know that you guys really like
the<00:05:50.750> blooper<00:05:51.050> sister<00:05:51.380> but<00:05:51.650> nothing<00:05:51.920> really

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
the blooper sister but nothing really

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.710 
the blooper sister but nothing really
funny<00:05:52.310> happened<00:05:52.640> during<00:05:52.880> making<00:05:53.270> of<00:05:53.540> this

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
funny happened during making of this

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.160 
funny happened during making of this
video<00:05:54.010> but<00:05:55.060> I'll<00:05:56.060> share<00:05:56.330> with<00:05:56.450> you<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.900> trick

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
video but I'll share with you a trick

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.460 
video but I'll share with you a trick
instead<00:05:57.820> so<00:05:58.820> it's<00:05:59.270> really<00:05:59.450> hard<00:05:59.690> to<00:05:59.840> do<00:06:00.440> a

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
instead so it's really hard to do a

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.320 
instead so it's really hard to do a
one-handed<00:06:00.920> moves<00:06:01.160> with<00:06:01.430> your<00:06:01.610> right<00:06:02.150> hand

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
one-handed moves with your right hand

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.630 
one-handed moves with your right hand
for<00:06:02.450> me<00:06:02.690> with<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:03.050> other<00:06:03.200> hand<00:06:03.470> but<00:06:04.430> it's

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
for me with the other hand but it's

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.760 
for me with the other hand but it's
surprisingly<00:06:05.180> easy<00:06:05.390> to<00:06:05.510> mirror<00:06:05.990> moves<00:06:06.410> across

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
surprisingly easy to mirror moves across

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.950 
surprisingly easy to mirror moves across
the<00:06:06.860> cubes<00:06:07.340> not<00:06:08.240> sure<00:06:08.450> why<00:06:08.600> it's<00:06:08.840> got

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
the cubes not sure why it's got

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.210 
the cubes not sure why it's got
something<00:06:09.230> to<00:06:09.350> do<00:06:09.440> with<00:06:09.470> how<00:06:09.710> screwed<00:06:09.890> up<00:06:10.070> we

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
something to do with how screwed up we

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.010 
something to do with how screwed up we
are<00:06:10.340> in<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.550> head<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:10.940> how<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.630> brain

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
are in the head and how the brain

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.590 
are in the head and how the brain
actually<00:06:12.290> goes<00:06:12.620> but<00:06:13.490> anyway<00:06:14.450> it's

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
actually goes but anyway it's

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.210 
actually goes but anyway it's
surprisingly<00:06:15.320> easy<00:06:15.500> to<00:06:15.590> do<00:06:15.770> with<00:06:15.950> just<00:06:16.160> a

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
surprisingly easy to do with just a

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.710 
surprisingly easy to do with just a
little<00:06:16.280> bit<00:06:16.400> of<00:06:16.550> practice<00:06:16.700> and<00:06:17.180> if<00:06:17.480> you<00:06:17.570> have<00:06:17.660> a

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
little bit of practice and if you have a

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.370 
little bit of practice and if you have a
good<00:06:17.900> few<00:06:18.080> one<00:06:18.230> like<00:06:18.470> this<00:06:18.950> cube<00:06:19.190> here<00:06:19.460> and

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
good few one like this cube here and

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.540 
good few one like this cube here and
then<00:06:21.380> actually<00:06:21.770> you<00:06:21.920> can<00:06:22.070> look<00:06:22.220> like<00:06:22.370> you're

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
then actually you can look like you're

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.790 
then actually you can look like you're
solving<00:06:22.760> two<00:06:23.000> heads<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.900> two<00:06:24.230> cubes<00:06:24.590> at<00:06:24.710> the

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
solving two heads that two cubes at the

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.960 
solving two heads that two cubes at the
same<00:06:25.010> time<00:06:25.190> but<00:06:25.400> actually<00:06:25.700> you're<00:06:25.820> just

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
same time but actually you're just

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.860 
same time but actually you're just
mirroring<00:06:26.300> all<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.260> moves<00:06:27.470> across<00:06:27.950> and<00:06:28.870> it's

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
mirroring all the moves across and it's

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.480 
mirroring all the moves across and it's
a<00:06:29.990> surprisingly<00:06:30.590> easy<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:31.040> kind<00:06:31.160> of<00:06:31.250> fun

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
a surprisingly easy and kind of fun

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.110 
a surprisingly easy and kind of fun
so<00:06:32.110> try
