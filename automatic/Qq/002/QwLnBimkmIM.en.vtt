response to this is to come straight in
with<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.560> elbow<00:01:08.830> it's<00:01:09.250> your<00:01:09.370> head<00:01:09.580> if<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:10.450> see

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
with the elbow it's your head if you see

with the elbow it's your head if you see
the<00:01:10.750> elbow<00:01:10.960> coming<00:01:11.230> up<00:01:11.410> you<00:01:11.770> have<00:01:11.830> to<00:01:12.070> be<00:01:12.160> able

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
the elbow coming up you have to be able

the elbow coming up you have to be able
to<00:01:12.340> get<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.700> inside<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.270> turn<00:01:13.510> this<00:01:13.660> to

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
to get to the inside to turn this to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.980 
to get to the inside to turn this to
particularly

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.130 

but<00:01:18.140> my<00:01:18.409> bills<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:20.180> basically<00:01:20.390> slice<00:01:20.960> this

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
but my bills you basically slice this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.920 
but my bills you basically slice this
down<00:01:21.280> with<00:01:22.280> your<00:01:23.000> belly<00:01:23.360> muscles<00:01:25.750> but<00:01:26.750> you're

down with your belly muscles but you're
actually<00:01:27.080> pushing<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.680> down<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.010> you're

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
actually pushing it down and you're

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.770 
actually pushing it down and you're
pushing<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.460> into<00:01:28.580> your<00:01:28.790> hand<00:01:28.970> myself<00:01:29.119> but<00:01:29.720> a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
pushing it into your hand myself but a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.109 
pushing it into your hand myself but a
couple<00:01:30.080> before<00:01:30.229> I<00:01:30.740> was<00:01:31.490> going<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.000> eyes

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
couple before I was going to the eyes

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.030 
couple before I was going to the eyes
but<00:01:32.420> I'm<00:01:32.540> using<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:33.080> motion<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.530> swing<00:01:33.770> arm

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
but I'm using this motion to swing arm

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.149 
but I'm using this motion to swing arm
gun<00:01:34.250> where<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.670> can<00:01:34.880> control<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.420> here<00:01:35.860> 22<00:01:36.860> horas

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
gun where I can control it here 22 horas

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.359 
gun where I can control it here 22 horas
opposition<00:01:37.759> okay

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.249 

with<00:01:42.880> this<00:01:43.119> motion<00:01:43.479> here<00:01:43.630> if<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.869> notice<00:01:44.140> when

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
with this motion here if you notice when

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.349 
with this motion here if you notice when
he<00:01:44.320> turns<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:44.859> the<00:01:45.219> allows<00:01:45.670> me<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.030> pull<00:01:46.210> up<00:01:46.329> my

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
he turns it the allows me to pull up my

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.319 
he turns it the allows me to pull up my
file<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.960> if<00:01:47.469> you<00:01:47.710> get<00:01:48.579> a<00:01:48.609> post<00:01:48.850> angle<00:01:49.119> on<00:01:49.210> this

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
file and if you get a post angle on this

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.289 
file and if you get a post angle on this
once<00:01:50.020> he<00:01:50.140> actually<00:01:50.259> turns<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:51.009> piece<00:01:51.340> exposing

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
once he actually turns a piece exposing

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.700 
once he actually turns a piece exposing
his<00:01:52.420> concepts<00:01:52.929> which<00:01:53.259> allows<00:01:53.530> me<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:54.039> actually

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
his concepts which allows me to actually

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.949 
his concepts which allows me to actually
but<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.189> to<00:01:57.310> be<00:01:57.460> not<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.360> client<00:01:58.840> because

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
but I have to be not the client because

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.330 
but I have to be not the client because
the<00:01:59.049> others<00:01:59.319> have<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.619> be<00:01:59.649> flexible<00:01:59.920> because

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
the others have to be flexible because

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.789 
the others have to be flexible because
if<00:02:00.579> I<00:02:00.670> maintain<00:02:00.850> or<00:02:01.479> rigid<00:02:01.929> attitude<00:02:02.170> he<00:02:02.530> feels

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
if I maintain or rigid attitude he feels

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.459 
if I maintain or rigid attitude he feels
he's<00:02:03.640> not<00:02:03.819> a<00:02:03.969> little<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.390> lot<00:02:04.420> too<00:02:04.750> much<00:02:05.020> when<00:02:05.409> I

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
he's not a little a lot too much when I

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.559 
he's not a little a lot too much when I
feel<00:02:05.709> the<00:02:05.770> pear<00:02:05.979> coming<00:02:06.459> I<00:02:06.609> just

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.199 

my<00:02:12.569> grace<00:02:13.370> under<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> play<00:02:14.609> don't<00:02:14.849> slow<00:02:15.180> me

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
my grace under the play don't slow me

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:28.959 
my grace under the play don't slow me
down<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:26.810> he's<00:02:27.810> probably<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.290> highest

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
down with in he's probably the highest

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.879 
down with in he's probably the highest
you<00:02:29.969> want<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> use<00:02:30.329> both<00:02:30.840> hands<00:02:31.079> on<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.409> so

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
you want to use both hands on this so

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.619 
you want to use both hands on this so
what<00:02:32.219> I<00:02:32.250> usually<00:02:32.459> do<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:32.939> split<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.569> the

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
what I usually do is I split this in the

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.720 
what I usually do is I split this in the
middle<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:33.989> Hendricks<00:02:34.349> with<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> second

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
middle of my Hendricks with the second

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.580 
middle of my Hendricks with the second
and<00:02:35.849> third<00:02:35.909> finger<00:02:36.239> when<00:02:37.049> where<00:02:37.169> I<00:02:37.200> push<00:02:37.439> it

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
and third finger when where I push it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.030 
and third finger when where I push it
down<00:02:37.620> my<00:02:37.980> extended<00:02:38.489> rest<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.709> you're<00:02:40.889> actually

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
down my extended rest so you're actually

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.309 
down my extended rest so you're actually
using<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.579> as<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> wedge<00:02:42.060> or<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.659> brace<00:02:48.199> if<00:02:49.199> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
mica tier turn it if you incorporate the

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.679 
mica tier turn it if you incorporate the
risk<00:02:52.199> from<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.980> other<00:02:53.159> if<00:02:54.150> you're<00:02:54.269> coming<00:02:54.480> on

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
this side with the other arm you're

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:06.430 
this side with the other arm you're
