00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
to the men's prejudging Jay Cutler's got

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.460 
to the men's prejudging Jay Cutler's got
the<00:01:15.730> shell<00:01:15.970> we<00:01:16.180> all<00:01:16.300> know<00:01:16.480> that<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:17.170> shouldn't

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
the shell we all know that it shouldn't

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.249 
the shell we all know that it shouldn't
even<00:01:17.620> be<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.830> doubt<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.630> think<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.720> top<00:01:19.930> three

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
even be a doubt I think the top three

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:21.990 
even be a doubt I think the top three
pretty<00:01:20.590> pretty<00:01:20.860> much<00:01:21.100> are<00:01:21.280> established<00:01:21.880> it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
pretty pretty much are established it's

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.190 
pretty pretty much are established it's
probably<00:01:22.210> going<00:01:22.329> to<00:01:22.390> be<00:01:22.450> filled<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.020> then

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
probably going to be filled and then

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.230 
probably going to be filled and then
branch<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.770> could<00:01:23.920> go<00:01:24.040> either<00:01:24.250> one<00:01:24.579> flip-flop

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
branch you could go either one flip-flop

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.850 
branch you could go either one flip-flop
them<00:01:25.720> but<00:01:25.900> I<00:01:25.930> think<00:01:26.200> Phil<00:01:26.409> looks<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.740> little

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
them but I think Phil looks a little

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.100 
them but I think Phil looks a little
better<00:01:27.100> much<00:01:27.460> improved<00:01:27.909> from<00:01:28.060> last<00:01:28.119> year<00:01:28.570> then

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
better much improved from last year then

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.870 
better much improved from last year then
it<00:01:29.229> gets<00:01:29.350> interesting<00:01:29.650> four<00:01:30.159> through<00:01:30.399> six<00:01:30.640> is

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
it gets interesting four through six is

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.450 
it gets interesting four through six is
very<00:01:31.210> interesting<00:01:31.860> Dexter<00:01:32.860> probably<00:01:33.310> has

to go with Dexter was four and then you

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.639 
to go with Dexter was four and then you
