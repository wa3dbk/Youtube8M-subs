primer<00:00:37.440> not<00:00:38.440> sure<00:00:38.680> if<00:00:38.800> it's<00:00:38.920> showing<00:00:39.250> up<00:00:39.370> in

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
primer not sure if it's showing up in

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.600 
primer not sure if it's showing up in
the<00:00:39.580> camera<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.590> it<00:00:41.949> started<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.460> eat<00:00:42.580> the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
the camera but it started to eat the

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.420 
the camera but it started to eat the
plastic<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:44.410> was<00:00:44.559> definitely<00:00:44.739> attacking<00:00:45.340> the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
plastic it was definitely attacking the

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.330 
plastic it was definitely attacking the
plastic<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:46.030> is<00:00:46.090> not<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.129> should<00:00:48.160> look

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
plastic that is not what it should look

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.450 
plastic that is not what it should look
like<00:00:48.489> when<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:48.970> prime<00:00:49.210> something<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:51.100> I

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
like when you prime something and I

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.520 
like when you prime something and I
should<00:00:51.640> have<00:00:51.699> just<00:00:51.900> got<00:00:52.900> me<00:00:53.050> some<00:00:53.229> dupli-color

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
should have just got me some dupli-color

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.680 
should have just got me some dupli-color
black<00:00:54.070> primer<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:54.699> just<00:00:54.729> going<00:00:55.030> over<00:00:55.210> this<00:00:55.420> I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
black primer and just going over this I

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.030 
black primer and just going over this I
knew<00:00:55.839> this<00:00:55.960> wasn't<00:00:56.199> gonna<00:00:56.350> work<00:00:56.650> for<00:00:56.830> some

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
knew this wasn't gonna work for some

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.049 
knew this wasn't gonna work for some
reason<00:00:57.370> it<00:00:57.489> just<00:00:57.519> seemed<00:00:57.850> like<00:00:57.879> everything

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
reason it just seemed like everything

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.270 
reason it just seemed like everything
was<00:00:58.299> going<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.750> good<00:00:58.960> but<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.199> put<00:00:59.589> a<00:00:59.620> light<00:00:59.979> mist

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
was going to good but I put a light mist

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.610 
was going to good but I put a light mist
coat<00:01:00.519> on<00:01:00.670> this<00:01:00.909> and<00:01:01.269> it<00:01:01.960> just<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.290> seems<00:01:02.500> like

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
coat on this and it just it seems like

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.550 
coat on this and it just it seems like
it's<00:01:02.739> like<00:01:02.799> powdery<00:01:03.280> like<00:01:03.489> it's<00:01:03.640> coming<00:01:03.940> off

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:04.560 
it's like powdery like it's coming off

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.230 
it's like powdery like it's coming off
so<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.979> guess<00:01:06.460> I'm<00:01:06.610> definitely<00:01:06.940> gonna<00:01:07.030> have<00:01:07.150> to

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
so I guess I'm definitely gonna have to

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.610 
so I guess I'm definitely gonna have to
put<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> coat<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.630> dupli-color<00:01:07.990> on<00:01:08.409> this

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
put a coat of dupli-color on this

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.190 
put a coat of dupli-color on this
because<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.760> know<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:10.090> stuff<00:01:10.360> works<00:01:10.630> but<00:01:10.990> this

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
because I know that stuff works but this

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.140 
because I know that stuff works but this
bright<00:01:11.470> touch<00:01:11.680> here<00:01:12.100> I've<00:01:12.549> used<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.940> gray

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
bright touch here I've used the gray

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.380 
bright touch here I've used the gray
stuff<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.659> it<00:01:13.750> worked<00:01:13.930> pretty<00:01:14.110> good<00:01:14.409> but<00:01:14.740> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
stuff and it worked pretty good but I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.850 
stuff and it worked pretty good but I
could<00:01:16.390> have<00:01:16.479> sworn<00:01:16.780> I<00:01:16.900> used<00:01:17.110> this<00:01:17.260> on<00:01:17.500> some<00:01:17.710> and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
could have sworn I used this on some and

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.109 
could have sworn I used this on some and
it<00:01:17.920> worked<00:01:18.100> good<00:01:18.250> too<00:01:18.460> but<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.700> might<00:01:18.909> have<00:01:19.030> been

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
it worked good too but I might have been

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.170 
it worked good too but I might have been
thinking<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.260> color<00:01:20.470> place<00:01:21.180> so

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
thinking of the the color place so

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.359 
thinking of the the color place so
general<00:01:22.689> purpose<00:01:23.049> primer<00:01:23.560> black<00:01:24.100> primer

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
general purpose primer black primer

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.429 
general purpose primer black primer
bright<00:01:24.759> touch<00:01:25.000> doesn't<00:01:25.719> want<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.020> work<00:01:26.140> on<00:01:26.320> the

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
bright touch doesn't want to work on the

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.069 
bright touch doesn't want to work on the
Revell<00:01:26.770> 70<00:01:27.250> Chevelle<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:27.850> I<00:01:28.180> guess<00:01:28.899> I'm<00:01:28.990> gonna

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
Revell 70 Chevelle so I guess I'm gonna

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.240 
I do have a little bit more sanding like
I<00:01:36.640> said<00:01:36.850> before<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.450> do<00:01:37.570> on<00:01:37.719> this<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.039> might

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
I said before to do on this so I might

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.859 
I said before to do on this so I might
just<00:01:39.280> go<00:01:39.460> ahead<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:39.850> sand<00:01:40.030> over<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:40.509> think

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
just go ahead and sand over that I think

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.120 
just go ahead and sand over that I think
it<00:01:40.960> should<00:01:41.170> all<00:01:41.289> come<00:01:41.320> off<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.950> then<00:01:42.039> I'll

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
it should all come off and then I'll

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.560 
it should all come off and then I'll
just<00:01:42.310> hit<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.609> with<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.820> dupli-color<00:01:43.060> black

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
just hit that with the dupli-color black

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.550 
just hit that with the dupli-color black
and<00:01:44.229> then<00:01:44.679> these<00:01:44.859> I<00:01:46.049> don't<00:01:47.049> know<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.229> might<00:01:47.439> have

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
and then these I don't know I might have

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.230 
and then these I don't know I might have
to<00:01:47.740> try<00:01:48.219> to<00:01:48.280> go<00:01:48.429> over<00:01:48.460> them<00:01:48.759> again<00:01:48.820> with<00:01:49.060> like<00:01:49.179> a

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
to try to go over them again with like a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.789 
to try to go over them again with like a
thousand<00:01:49.689> grit<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:49.960> 12-under<00:01:50.289> grit<00:01:50.530> sandpaper

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
thousand grit or 12-under grit sandpaper

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.560 
thousand grit or 12-under grit sandpaper
and<00:01:51.249> see<00:01:51.399> if<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.549> can<00:01:51.670> smooth<00:01:51.939> them<00:01:52.060> out<00:01:52.210> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and see if I can smooth them out and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.569 
and see if I can smooth them out and
yeah<00:01:55.570> so<00:01:55.899> we'll<00:01:56.020> go<00:01:56.140> from<00:01:56.259> there<00:01:56.439> guys<00:01:56.679> so<00:01:56.710> just

yeah so we'll go from there guys so just
a<00:01:57.640> little<00:01:58.439> hint<00:01:59.439> there<00:01:59.740> for<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.130> bright<00:02:00.609> touch

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
a little hint there for the bright touch

if<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.090> guys<00:02:01.240> have<00:02:01.479> used<00:02:01.689> it<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:01.960> it's<00:02:02.049> worked

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
if you guys have used it and it's worked

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.620 
if you guys have used it and it's worked
well<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:02.890> guess<00:02:03.490> that's<00:02:03.880> cool<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.359> like<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.569> said

well I guess that's cool and like I said

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.179 
well I guess that's cool and like I said
I<00:02:04.780> swore<00:02:05.170> I've<00:02:05.289> used<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.679> on<00:02:05.770> some<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.130> it

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
I swore I've used it on some and it

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.739 
I swore I've used it on some and it
worked<00:02:06.369> fine<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.939> know<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.299> gray<00:02:07.479> worked

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
worked fine but I know the gray worked

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.040 
worked fine but I know the gray worked
and<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:09.220> red<00:02:09.550> oxide<00:02:09.970> worked<00:02:10.240> fine<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.750> did

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
and the the red oxide worked fine it did

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.270 
and the the red oxide worked fine it did
seem<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.350> attack<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.710> little<00:02:11.920> bit<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
seem to attack a little bit of the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.180 
seem to attack a little bit of the
plastic<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.960> f-250<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.800> did<00:02:15.040> do

plastic on the the f-250 that I did do

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.740 
plastic on the the f-250 that I did do
it<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.700> wasn't<00:02:15.970> quite<00:02:16.030> as<00:02:16.270> bad<00:02:16.300> as<00:02:16.600> this

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it in but it wasn't quite as bad as this
