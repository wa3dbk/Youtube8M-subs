00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
curling iron

curling iron
you're<00:00:34.290> gonna<00:00:34.440> curl<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.070> ends<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> your<00:00:35.520> hair

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.420 
you're gonna curl the ends of your hair
with<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.780> process<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.890> don't<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.309> be

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
with this process you don't have to be

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.240 
with this process you don't have to be
very<00:00:38.730> perfect<00:00:39.329> messy<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.559> probably<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> best

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
very perfect messy is probably the best

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.400 
very perfect messy is probably the best
for<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.610> hairstyle<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.750> using<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
for this hairstyle and I'm using a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.790 
for this hairstyle and I'm using a
curling<00:00:43.800> iron<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.760> 1/4<00:00:45.480> inch<00:00:45.800> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
curling iron as one and 1/4 inch the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.690 
curling iron as one and 1/4 inch the
bigger<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.670> looser<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.000> curls

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.180 

I<00:00:51.900> recommend<00:00:52.900> taking<00:00:53.080> huge<00:00:53.620> chunks<00:00:53.950> of<00:00:54.070> hair

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
I recommend taking huge chunks of hair

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.360 
I recommend taking huge chunks of hair
to<00:00:54.400> curl<00:00:54.580> it<00:00:54.730> instead<00:00:55.060> of<00:00:55.290> taking<00:00:56.290> section<00:00:57.220> by

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
to curl it instead of taking section by

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.950 
to curl it instead of taking section by
section<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.090> reason<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.510> because<00:00:58.630> this

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
section and the reason is because this

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.800 
section and the reason is because this
will<00:00:59.140> create<00:00:59.260> more<00:00:59.350> loose<00:00:59.970> playful<00:01:00.970> relaxed

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
will create more loose playful relaxed

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.840 
will create more loose playful relaxed
and<00:01:02.140> just<00:01:02.320> messy<00:01:02.770> crawls<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.340> since<00:01:03.760> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
and just messy crawls and since the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.430 
and just messy crawls and since the
summer<00:01:04.150> you<00:01:04.480> don't<00:01:04.629> want<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:04.870> be<00:01:04.960> too<00:01:05.170> perfect

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
summer you don't want to be too perfect

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.920 
summer you don't want to be too perfect
and<00:01:06.150> stress<00:01:07.150> over<00:01:07.540> too<00:01:07.750> much<00:01:07.930> about<00:01:08.170> your<00:01:08.380> hair

parts<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.810> then<00:02:09.810> afterwards<00:02:10.380> we're<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
parts and then afterwards we're going to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.130 
parts and then afterwards we're going to
just<00:02:11.130> braid<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.550> normally<00:02:12.239> first<00:02:12.630> like<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
just braid it normally first like a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.380 
just braid it normally first like a
regular<00:02:13.380> braid<00:02:16.850> after<00:02:17.850> finishing<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
regular braid after finishing the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.729 
regular braid after finishing the
regular<00:02:18.570> braid<00:02:19.019> you're<00:02:19.260> going<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.500> take<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
regular braid you're going to take the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.290 
regular braid you're going to take the
strand<00:02:20.010> as<00:02:20.130> closest<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.790> back<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.150> your

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
strand as closest to the back of your

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.050 
strand as closest to the back of your
head<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.720> add<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> little<00:02:22.709> bit<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.980> hair<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
head and add a little bit of hair to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.840 
head and add a little bit of hair to
that<00:02:24.510> strand<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.489> basically<00:02:26.489> you're<00:02:26.730> going

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
that strand and basically you're going

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
that strand and basically you're going
to<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.090> braid<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.810> normally<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.190> then

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
to just braid it in normally and then

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.890 
to just braid it in normally and then
whichever<00:02:29.610> hair<00:02:29.940> lands<00:02:30.269> into<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.570> back<00:02:30.750> of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
whichever hair lands into the back of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.600 
whichever hair lands into the back of
your<00:02:30.989> head<00:02:31.140> again<00:02:31.440> you're<00:02:31.920> gonna<00:02:32.010> add<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.430> more

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
your head again you're gonna add in more

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.520 
your head again you're gonna add in more
hair<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.329> you're<00:02:33.600> gonna<00:02:33.750> continue<00:02:34.290> this

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
hair and you're gonna continue this

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.270 
hair and you're gonna continue this
process<00:02:35.720> down<00:02:36.720> your<00:02:37.200> head<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.920> actually

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
process down your head this is actually

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.460 
process down your head this is actually
very<00:02:41.489> simple<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:43.019> takes<00:02:43.049> practice

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
very simple to do and it takes practice

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.740 
very simple to do and it takes practice
so<00:02:44.070> once<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> hang<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.450> you'll

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
so once you get the hang of it you'll

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.840 
so once you get the hang of it you'll
understand<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:46.739> quite<00:02:46.950> easy<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.610> you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
understand that it's quite easy and you

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:56.610 
understand that it's quite easy and you
won't<00:02:48.030> get<00:02:48.150> confused

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.100 

you're<00:02:57.489> gonna<00:02:57.640> continue<00:02:58.180> braiding<00:02:58.450> down<00:02:58.810> your

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
you're gonna continue braiding down your

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.259 
you're gonna continue braiding down your
head<00:02:59.349> and<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.769> will<00:02:59.890> create<00:03:00.190> somewhat<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:00.940> a

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
head and it will create somewhat of a

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.780 
head and it will create somewhat of a
braided<00:03:01.629> headband<00:03:02.319> look<00:03:02.590> you're<00:03:03.489> gonna<00:03:03.580> go

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
braided headband look you're gonna go

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:13.770 
braided headband look you're gonna go
down<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.390> end

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.440 

I'm<00:03:14.770> going<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.370> continue<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.940> spray<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.240> a

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
I'm going to continue to spray it a

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.430 
I'm going to continue to spray it a
little<00:03:16.690> bit<00:03:16.810> past<00:03:17.020> my<00:03:17.200> jawline<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.290> we're

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
little bit past my jawline so we're

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.650 
little bit past my jawline so we're
going<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.620> now<00:03:20.830> tie<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> end<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.270> braid

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
going to now tie the end of the braid

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.449 
going to now tie the end of the braid
and<00:03:22.959> I'm<00:03:23.319> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.650> be<00:03:23.740> using<00:03:23.950> an<00:03:24.220> elastic

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
and I'm going to be using an elastic

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.300 
and I'm going to be using an elastic
that<00:03:25.090> matches<00:03:25.150> my<00:03:25.540> hair<00:03:25.900> color<00:03:26.200> um<00:03:27.100> I

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
that matches my hair color um I

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.710 
that matches my hair color um I
recommend<00:03:27.760> using<00:03:27.940> elastic<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.660> matches

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
recommend using elastic that matches

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.930 
recommend using elastic that matches
your<00:03:29.140> hair<00:03:29.290> color<00:03:29.350> or<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.740> clear<00:03:30.040> one<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.819> so

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
your hair color or a clear one just so

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.170 
your hair color or a clear one just so
that<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.300> blends<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.780> well<00:03:31.959> with<00:03:32.020> your<00:03:32.440> hair

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.059 

next<00:03:37.180> step<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.810> fix<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.140> braid<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.709> since

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
next step is to fix the braid and since

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.650 
next step is to fix the braid and since
I<00:03:39.250> have<00:03:39.430> short<00:03:39.700> layers<00:03:39.880> some<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.510> layers

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
I have short layers some of the layers

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.750 
I have short layers some of the layers
do<00:03:40.959> stick<00:03:41.260> out<00:03:41.470> but<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.340> doesn't<00:03:42.640> really

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
do stick out but it doesn't really

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.570 
do stick out but it doesn't really
bother<00:03:43.060> me<00:03:43.300> but<00:03:43.930> if<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.170> does<00:03:44.350> bother<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:45.010> you

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
bother me but if it does bother you you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.310 
bother me but if it does bother you you
can<00:03:45.730> take<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> hair<00:03:46.209> spray<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.930> spray<00:03:47.200> it

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
can take a hair spray and to spray it

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.080 
can take a hair spray and to spray it
down<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.830> some<00:03:48.040> without<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.670> flyaways<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.940> now

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
down to some without the flyaways so now

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.130 
down to some without the flyaways so now
the<00:03:52.540> first<00:03:52.780> style<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.260> done<00:03:57.870> well<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.050> the

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
the first style is done well to the

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.050 
the first style is done well to the
second<00:03:59.530> style<00:03:59.739> what<00:04:00.280> you're<00:04:00.459> gonna<00:04:00.550> do<00:04:00.819> is

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
second style what you're gonna do is

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.390 
second style what you're gonna do is
take<00:04:01.300> some<00:04:01.330> hair<00:04:01.780> from<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.620> opposite<00:04:03.100> side

you're<00:04:13.280> gonna<00:04:13.370> do<00:04:13.640> with<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.060> section<00:04:14.870> hair

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
you're gonna do with this section hair

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.990 
you're gonna do with this section hair
is<00:04:15.560> braided<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.430> we're<00:04:16.549> going<00:04:16.670> to<00:04:16.730> just<00:04:16.820> do<00:04:16.970> a
