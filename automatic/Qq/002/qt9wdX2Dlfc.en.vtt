00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 we are cold in this city you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.460
 they have no idea and then I went there I took a course 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.919
 writing and talking to people 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.590
 I realized that a lot of people feel like 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.570
 writing has sensational ideas in the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.839
 head but can not put it in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.310
 role because it is impressive as in 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.930
 your head all ideas are cool 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.880
 genial but will put the role it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 Doom sucks because when 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 you put on paper you face right 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 a paddle reality is following the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.230
 text requires more than a good idea. 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.489
 then you find that you need to have 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.770
 An organization you need to know 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.110
 to craft a character in a way that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.750
 he convinces the person he is reading is 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.239
 that character must have to have 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.850
 an interesting trajectory of being 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.500
 accompanied or you want to write 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.789
 that story in a cool way too 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.239
 writing what I say here is 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.820
 even aesthetics is not just write 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.129
 Then she opened the door and said then 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.460
 She turned and said right 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.250
 Do you want to have a little better text? 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.760
 Than this, do you want to tell a 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.009
 story is in a more interesting way 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.770
 In this technically speaking even unitec 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.479
 paragraph faceted paragraph that gives 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.150
 I like that you told me that you had 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.890
 Rare life you do not think of these 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.659
 things when you 're going to put the next 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.850
 role that this reality comes to light 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.759
 What I wanted to say about it is that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.460
 how everything in life write gets better 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.470
 with the practice and with time as 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.960
 The more you write the better you stay. 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.590
 in what seems like an idiot thing 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.720
 to say but people is in relation to 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.729
 writing sometimes do not touch it 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.159
 why time you look at the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.909
 and you write a sentence that is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.579
 you get so full of barriers there 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.439
 God still here're too bad I will not 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.860
 writing I'm going to move on because I 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.040
 This sucks I never can you 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.590
 I wrote a decent text that drug 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.180
 Maybe this idea was not so good. 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.250
 and then you see that wrote a dialogue is 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.470
 very difficult to create a character too 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.390
 it's not easy and then you start thinking 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.270
 that the problem is in you I know I 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.430
 I know because I 've been through this too. 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.320
 still goes through several moments 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.080
 When I sit down to write but I 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.500
 I mean the following this can not 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.340
 prevent you from sitting down and finally 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.520
 start writing because these things 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.860
 only disappear with the practice of writing 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.250
 To write, my dear, is that neither 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.330
 Anything else in this life, you want it. 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.970
 learn how to make a carrot cake 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.940
 probably the first cake will not go 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.850
 stay a show nÃ© first cake goes 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.980
 get the drug second little less 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.580
 drug the third a little less one 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.680
 fourth missile that good then the rule 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.480
 for writing is similar 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.220
 To start writing good stuff, you have to 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.290
 write bad thing before 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.120
 exceptions that exist in the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.680
 of people who are cool and 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.230
 bright to write the face has to 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.810
 writing knows that a lot of people are 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.700
 write and is not writing for some 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.040
 reason you are ashamed to show 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.410
 people, why your text for a 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.600
 period is not actually a type text 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.769
 1 It 's as if someone has seen you 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.420
 undressed 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.269
 One thing I said, my God, people. 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.150
 look will repair my cellulite will 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.310
 to notice my debut will notice that 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.110
 I'm the pneuzinho here is more or less 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.549
 this the feeling that you have a lot to 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.019
 show all this to someone who 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:50.120
 every person had clothes because 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.940
 it is really an intimate thing is what 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.650
 you write the site inside yourself 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.980
 Let's have the person read here. 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.930
 the ips of ours 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.590
 all this effort to write this 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.170
 here someone else says ours was not 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.540
 know your side where people 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.900
 idiots somebody make somebody laugh 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.480
 will find your text becciu 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.079
 there because that sort of thing actually 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.889
 The sooner you get through this the better. 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.039
 you 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.169
 this kind of fear and 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:26.050
 show your text to people only 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.090
 serves the headquarters of the company 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.710
 problem that it 's legal to criticize you 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.979
 receive because the person will say looks 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.919
 It's confusing, look, that's annoying. 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.289
 Do not you understand, I do not understand a character. 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.840
 this story then this feedback will 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.220
 helping know gives a fear in the beginning 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.660
 Why speak in my God do not you? 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.690
 receive reviews 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.120
 so had this tip known to treat 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.070
 your yarn your speech your child 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.410
 Nobody says anything bad about my son. 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.830
 can criticize my son did not want 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.889
 play this text in the world show the people 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.979
 Lessa plays. 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.139
 The faster you do it the faster. 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.830
 Will you mature as a writer goes? 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.960
 for me, but a lot of people that is 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.150
 with creative block type ah no 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.910
 I can write how to sign up people. 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.250
 I want to say one thing to write for 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.210
 some reason I do not know which one 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.229
 gained a status so mystical a 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.389
 thing like that 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.370
 I'll only write when that part goes down. 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.550
 and I type and it comes out 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.919
 sensationally bright on the 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.650
 truth did not write much effort know 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.560
 to write absolute pure effort is effort 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.479
 is little inspiration and expiration to one day 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.000
 in the year then what I tell you 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.909
 Sinta writes will get shit going 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.699
 surely you will probably read 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.310
 where there is certainly there but does not give up 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.669
 of what writes or moves forward 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.169
 then back to that piece is no 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.050
 stop writing because you think 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.700
 Bad does not do this, it goes on. 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.950
 keep writing 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.440
 depending on how bad it is too 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.690
 the third will be more or less the 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.680
 room more or less and so you go 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.620
 improving 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.170
 What is not possible is having this relationship with the 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.590
 text as if it were a thing full of 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:21.380
 boys understood full of barriers 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.990
 full of sweet river sweet lad like 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.910
 continue to criticize the text I will not 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.160
 write more for what? 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.930
 The one who needs it in life for what? 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.760
 anything right 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.010
 Once I met a guitarist Kim 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.480
 here in my city that is a 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:42.020
 very good face reference plays a crazy 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.600
 I know asked him speaks truth 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.570
 talent and that's good right is a gift that 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:52.490
 person has to play there turned to me and 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:54.980
 he spoke like that in a tone of studying people 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.670
 note the text is also happening 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.560
 super text do not be intimidated 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.810
 by bad paragraphs 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.630
 every person who ventures to write has 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.790
 Bad paragraphs in luggage 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.090
 Now what can not be done . 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.090
 none 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:27.340
 and do not write, and that's it. 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:30.340
 Kiss, bye, baby, baby, baby, do not you? 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.340
 baby
