the twinning heavy rail rifle and I know

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.850 
the twinning heavy rail rifle and I know
the<00:01:39.150> railgun<00:01:39.720> rail<00:01:40.110> weapons<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:40.619> always

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the railgun rail weapons have always

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
the railgun rail weapons have always
been<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> big<00:01:41.280> part<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.579> town<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.810> just

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
been a big part of town but it just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.969 
been a big part of town but it just
doesn't<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.500> sense<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.979> use<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.540> um<00:01:45.979> because

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
doesn't make sense to use it um because

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.219 
doesn't make sense to use it um because
in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> new<00:01:47.640> codex<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.930> railgun

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
in the new codex this is not a railgun

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.859 
in the new codex this is not a railgun
the<00:01:49.500> railgun<00:01:49.829> will<00:01:49.979> strength<00:01:50.250> 10<00:01:50.520> AP<00:01:51.000> 1<00:01:51.210> this

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the railgun will strength 10 AP 1 this

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.249 
the railgun will strength 10 AP 1 this
is<00:01:52.110> only<00:01:52.409> strength<00:01:52.799> 881<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.509> say<00:01:54.840> only

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
is only strength 881 so I say only

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.709 
is only strength 881 so I say only
that's<00:01:55.530> still<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:56.130> very<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:57.180> strong<00:01:57.299> weapon

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that's still a very very strong weapon

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.249 
that's still a very very strong weapon
it's<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> insta<00:01:58.799> kill<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.399> things

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
it's going to insta kill a lot of things

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.639 
it's going to insta kill a lot of things
but<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:02.659> 6th<00:02:03.659> edition<00:02:03.750> we're<00:02:04.079> getting<00:02:04.320> lots<00:02:04.439> of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
point in it you can take miss our drones

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.500 
point in it you can take miss our drones
with<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:25.920> want<00:02:26.189> I<00:02:26.489> would<00:02:27.150> always<00:02:27.269> go

miserable system and if I just use this

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.009 
miserable system and if I just use this

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
you can get eight shots on it that's

you can get eight shots on it that's
what<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.579> want<00:03:11.909> running<00:03:12.060> now<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.349> debate

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
what I want running now the debate

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.530

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
the high-yield mustn't miss our pod

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.610 
the high-yield mustn't miss our pod
you're<00:03:21.150> gonna<00:03:21.269> lose<00:03:21.629> one<00:03:22.019> strings<00:03:22.379> by<00:03:22.560> go

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
you're gonna lose one strings by go

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.680 
you're gonna lose one strings by go

entire missile pod there any strength 78

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.830 
entire missile pod there any strength 78
before<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:27.000> know<00:03:27.030> enemies<00:03:27.510> are<00:03:27.659> getting

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
before so you know enemies are getting

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.409 
before so you know enemies are getting
it<00:03:27.930> arm<00:03:28.079> saves<00:03:28.409> and<00:03:28.799> you're<00:03:29.699> only<00:03:29.819> strength<00:03:30.150> 7

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
it arm saves and you're only strength 7

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.500 
it arm saves and you're only strength 7
now<00:03:31.109> that's<00:03:31.709> not<00:03:32.040> something<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.939> bothers<00:03:33.479> me

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
now that's not something that bothers me

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.110 
now that's not something that bothers me
so<00:03:33.810> much<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.199> I<00:03:34.409> get<00:03:34.620> four<00:03:34.919> shots<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:36.949> think

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
so much because I get four shots I think

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.369 
so much because I get four shots I think
you<00:03:39.120> know<00:03:39.349> if<00:03:40.349> I'm<00:03:40.799> using<00:03:41.099> these<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.669> take<00:03:41.909> out

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
you know if I'm using these to take out

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.330 
you know if I'm using these to take out
terminators<00:03:43.379> that's<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:43.709> really<00:03:43.949> what<00:03:44.069> i<00:03:44.129> use

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
terminators that's not really what i use

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.869 
terminators that's not really what i use
my<00:03:44.519> broad<00:03:44.759> size<00:03:45.000> 4<00:03:45.319> I<00:03:46.319> want<00:03:47.069> them<00:03:47.159> for<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.489> lot<00:03:47.699> of

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
my broad size 4 I want them for a lot of

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.960 
my broad size 4 I want them for a lot of
firepower<00:03:48.769> so<00:03:49.769> if<00:03:50.069> i<00:03:50.189> can<00:03:50.340> get<00:03:50.430> more<00:03:50.729> shots

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
firepower so if i can get more shots

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.580 
firepower so if i can get more shots
that's<00:03:51.389> that's<00:03:51.720> great<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:52.139> me<00:03:52.290> that's

something that I'm really looking into

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.679 
something that I'm really looking into
and<00:03:54.259> I<00:03:55.280> love<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> idea<00:03:56.669> of<00:03:56.729> having<00:03:56.970> tons<00:03:57.509> of

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
and I love the idea of having tons of

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.659 
and I love the idea of having tons of
missiles<00:03:58.109> as<00:03:58.909> as<00:03:59.909> this<00:04:00.120> one<00:04:00.329> does<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:01.169> um<00:04:01.669> yes

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
missiles as as this one does so um yes

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
you get the four shots from the high

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.240 
you get the four shots from the high
yield<00:04:06.239> myself<00:04:06.359> on<00:04:06.720> system<00:04:07.169> me<00:04:07.680> four<00:04:07.979> shots

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
yield myself on system me four shots

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.640 
yield myself on system me four shots

from the smart missile system Asik a

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.619 
from the smart missile system Asik a
shot<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.069> you<00:04:11.759> could<00:04:11.939> have<00:04:12.090> your<00:04:12.269> drones

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
shot and you could have your drones

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.099 
shot and you could have your drones
popping<00:04:13.229> off<00:04:13.349> shots<00:04:13.379> as<00:04:13.739> well<00:04:14.989> that's<00:04:15.989> not

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
popping off shots as well that's not

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.330 
popping off shots as well that's not
really<00:04:16.169> what<00:04:16.409> you<00:04:16.530> know<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.829> have<00:04:16.949> shield
