put on it is sometimes working sometimes
not<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.970> problem<00:00:39.330> is<00:00:39.510> we've<00:00:39.720> just<00:00:40.110> introduced

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
not the problem is we've just introduced

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.020 
not the problem is we've just introduced
some<00:00:40.860> new<00:00:40.890> element<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
some new element which I think the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.460 
some new element which I think the
conclusion<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.720> it's<00:00:42.870> broken<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:45.440> well<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
conclusion is it's broken it's well I

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:54.340 
conclusion is it's broken it's well I
don't<00:00:46.830> change<00:00:47.190> anything

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.070 

and<00:00:54.530> hopefully<00:00:57.580> that's<00:00:58.780> weird

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
and hopefully that's weird

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.740 
and hopefully that's weird
we're<00:01:00.770> not<00:01:00.890> gonna<00:01:01.010> get<00:01:01.190> it<00:01:01.430> boys<00:01:02.390> too
