before<00:06:57.819> actually<00:06:58.419> it's<00:06:58.539> like<00:06:58.659> downloading<00:06:59.139> my

00:06:59.219 --> 00:06:59.229 
before actually it's like downloading my

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:00.510 
before actually it's like downloading my
textbooks<00:06:59.710> right<00:06:59.860> now<00:06:59.979> because<00:07:00.099> I<00:07:00.219> just<00:07:00.249> got

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
textbooks right now because I just got

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.170 
textbooks right now because I just got
them<00:07:00.729> today<00:07:01.229> but<00:07:02.229> really<00:07:02.740> like<00:07:03.009> this<00:07:03.189> app<00:07:03.400> for

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
them today but really like this app for

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.209 
them today but really like this app for
all<00:07:04.270> my<00:07:04.389> textbooks<00:07:04.930> rather<00:07:05.349> than<00:07:05.559> iBooks<00:07:05.979> I

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:06.219 
all my textbooks rather than iBooks I

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:07.769 
all my textbooks rather than iBooks I
think<00:07:06.400> this<00:07:06.580> is<00:07:06.699> a<00:07:06.729> great<00:07:06.999> app<00:07:07.180> for<00:07:07.210> that

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:07.779 
think this is a great app for that

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:09.689 
think this is a great app for that
and<00:07:07.870> then<00:07:08.650> last<00:07:08.919> but<00:07:09.039> not<00:07:09.189> least<00:07:09.490> I<00:07:09.669> have

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:09.699 
and then last but not least I have

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:10.799 
and then last but not least I have
prismo

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:10.809 
prismo

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.989 
prismo
which<00:07:11.050> is<00:07:11.199> kind<00:07:11.409> of<00:07:11.469> hard<00:07:12.189> to<00:07:12.339> do<00:07:12.699> I<00:07:12.729> can't

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:12.999 
which is kind of hard to do I can't

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.429 
which is kind of hard to do I can't
really<00:07:13.089> do<00:07:13.240> a<00:07:13.270> demonstration<00:07:13.779> but<00:07:14.050> basically

00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:14.439 
really do a demonstration but basically

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.480 
really do a demonstration but basically
what<00:07:14.620> it<00:07:14.710> does<00:07:14.740> is<00:07:15.039> you<00:07:15.219> take<00:07:15.550> a<00:07:15.729> picture<00:07:16.569> of

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
what it does is you take a picture of

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.679 
what it does is you take a picture of
something<00:07:18.490> and<00:07:18.999> it<00:07:20.759> creates<00:07:21.759> it<00:07:21.939> into<00:07:22.270> a<00:07:22.300> text

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:22.689 
something and it creates it into a text

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:24.629 
something and it creates it into a text
document<00:07:23.020> that<00:07:23.499> you<00:07:23.710> can<00:07:23.740> edit<00:07:23.979> so<00:07:24.219> you<00:07:24.399> have

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 
document that you can edit so you have

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:27.089 
document that you can edit so you have
an<00:07:24.729> assignment<00:07:25.300> that<00:07:25.419> you<00:07:25.569> have<00:07:25.620> that<00:07:26.620> you

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:27.099 
an assignment that you have that you

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:31.829 
an assignment that you have that you
want<00:07:27.639> to<00:07:28.409> put<00:07:29.409> it<00:07:29.589> put<00:07:30.189> like<00:07:30.399> I<00:07:30.669> don't<00:07:31.389> know<00:07:31.569> on

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:31.839 
want to put it put like I don't know on

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:33.329 
want to put it put like I don't know on
your<00:07:32.020> iPad<00:07:32.379> and<00:07:32.559> you<00:07:32.649> want<00:07:32.830> to<00:07:32.919> take<00:07:33.069> it<00:07:33.189> home
