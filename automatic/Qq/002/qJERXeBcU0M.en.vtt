 and that companies do not always mean security

 deco but learn that losses are contracts 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 and gifts are not account holders

 and learn that no matter how much you care 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
 some people just do not care 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 and accept that it does not matter how good a person is 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.790
 She is injured. She was five years old. 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 I learned to speak because he had been denounced 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.650
 It is discovered that we will take to build trust and only seconds to 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.030
 destroy it 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.760
 and that you can do things in an instant from which you will repent for the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 rest of life 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.090
 learn that true friendships 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 continues to grow even over long distances 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.669
 but he is not what you have in life 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.669
 but who do you have in life? 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:18.040
 and what good friends 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.040
 if a family that allowed by law 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.829
 I learned that we do not have to change friends if we understand that friends 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.709
 all 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.980
 He realizes that your best friend is you. 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.059
 can do anything 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.379
 with Brazil 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 hetherington the moments together 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.769
 I've found that the people you care about most in life 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.359
 They are taken from you very quickly. 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.190
 so we should always leave the people we love 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.570
 we with love words may be the last time the ones sold 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.909
 I learned that the circumstances of the environments 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.939
 has influence over us 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.939
 but we are responsible for ourselves 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.969
 begins to learn that one should not compare with others 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.969
 but with the best you can 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.669
 I discovered that it takes a long time to become the person who wants to be 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.779
 what time is short 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.159
 learn that it does not matter where it's come from 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.909
 but we will be together 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.999
 but if you do not know where any democracy is going 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.699
 I learned that 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.239
 o You control your actions or they control you 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.619
 and that if it was possible does not mean to be weak having no personality 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.759
 today it matters how delicate and fragile a situation is 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.619
 there are always two sides 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:51.569
 I learned that we are people who did what was necessary to do 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.569
 facing the consequences 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.509
 I learned that patience requires a lot of practice 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.480
 I discovered that sometimes 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.239
 The person you expect me to feel when you fall is one of the few that the 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.379
 helped raise five goals 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.840
 I have not learned that in practice it has more to do with the kind of experience 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.599
 had 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.219
 Why did you learn from them? 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.219
 how many birthdays or celebrations 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.629
 I learned that most of their positions without a public tender 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.980
 I learned that you should never tell a child 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.069
 What dreams are silly? 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.550
 few things are so brilliant and it would be a tragedy if she believed 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.159
 in that 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.509
 I learned that when you're angry 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.749
 have the right to be angry 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:47.749
 but that did not give her right to move 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.270
 not 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.810
 I discovered that just because someone very nice you mean 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.370
 does not mean that they are who a combination of factors 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.439
 because there are people who do not swear 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.439
 but simply do not know how to demonstrate it 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.409
 O 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.409
 I learned that it is not always enough to be forgiven by someone 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.550
 sometimes you have to serve the death penalty on yourself 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.719
 I learned with the same severity as you judge 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.719
 the moment at a time like this 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.979
 at first I care in how many pieces your heart was broken 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.580
 an owner for the attack with explosives and 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:41.819
 I am not for seven years in the fresh start to wait for the benfica 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.770
 flowers 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.620
 c pedrossian 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.979
 but can hardly bear 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.210
 what really is strong 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.309
 and that can go much further after thinking 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:55.150
 I do not think it's possible anymore 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.020
 what life really has values ​​and what you have 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.629
 Who spoke before the life of Paul? 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.350
 santa cruz stadium santa cruz 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.350
 make us lose time that we could conquer 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.009
 do not mark your midfield 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.580
