00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.310 
here's a glimpse of what my legs look
like<00:00:55.530> before<00:00:56.160> using<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.969> epilator<00:00:57.480> um<00:00:57.840> kind

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
like before using the epilator um kind

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.990 
like before using the epilator um kind
of<00:00:58.379> far<00:00:58.559> away<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:59.100> gonna<00:00:59.219> zoom<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
of far away so I'm gonna zoom up I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
of far away so I'm gonna zoom up I
didn't<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.690> much<00:01:01.140> hair<00:01:01.500> growth

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
didn't have that much hair growth

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
didn't have that much hair growth
because<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.550> can't<00:01:02.730> stand<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
because I really can't stand it but I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.050 
because I really can't stand it but I
did<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.100> how<00:01:05.220> we'll<00:01:05.400> pick<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.640> hair

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
did want to see how we'll pick up hair

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.719 
did want to see how we'll pick up hair
that<00:01:06.420> wasn't<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.680> long<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.310> does<00:01:08.460> recommend

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that wasn't very long it does recommend

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.210 
that wasn't very long it does recommend
you<00:01:08.939> having<00:01:09.330> longer<00:01:10.020> hair<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.770> it'll<00:01:11.130> be

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you having longer hair so it'll be

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
you having longer hair so it'll be
easier<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.390> tweezers<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.930> pick

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
easier for the little tweezers to pick

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.160 
easier for the little tweezers to pick
it<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.580> could<00:01:14.850> never<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.420> am

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
it up but I could never so here I am

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.030 
it up but I could never so here I am
it<00:01:21.040> kind<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.750> reminds<00:01:22.750> me<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:23.229> when<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:23.800> tweeze

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
it kind of reminds me of when you tweeze

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.830 
it kind of reminds me of when you tweeze
you<00:01:24.250> have<00:01:24.400> to<00:01:24.550> pull<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.850> skin<00:01:25.000> taut<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:25.810> that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
you have to pull the skin taut so that

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.310 
you have to pull the skin taut so that
the<00:01:26.620> hair<00:01:26.890> can<00:01:27.300> come<00:01:28.300> out<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.479> little<00:01:28.810> easier

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
the hair can come out a little easier

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.130 
the hair can come out a little easier
so<00:01:30.070> you're<00:01:30.190> basically<00:01:30.280> tweezing<00:01:31.119> but<00:01:31.300> going

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
so you're basically tweezing but going

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.040 
so you're basically tweezing but going
in<00:01:32.290> this<00:01:32.409> shaving<00:01:32.680> motion<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.630> book<00:01:34.780> says<00:01:35.020> to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
in this shaving motion the book says to

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.440 
in this shaving motion the book says to
go<00:01:35.380> slow<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:36.820> can<00:01:36.940> pick<00:01:37.060> up<00:01:37.210> more

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
go slow so that it can pick up more

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.820 
go slow so that it can pick up more
hairs<00:01:37.810> as<00:01:38.050> a<00:01:38.080> spinning<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.570> um<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.560> have<00:01:41.800> a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
hairs as a spinning but um I have a

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.980 
hairs as a spinning but um I have a
higher<00:01:42.220> tolerance<00:01:42.759> for<00:01:43.090> pain<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.630> went<00:01:43.930> over

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
higher tolerance for pain so I went over

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.590 
higher tolerance for pain so I went over
to<00:01:44.170> kind<00:01:44.409> of<00:01:44.470> face<00:01:44.729> when<00:01:45.729> I<00:01:45.759> was<00:01:45.909> on<00:01:46.030> my<00:01:46.180> legs<00:01:46.420> I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.170 
to kind of face when I was on my legs I
detached<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.009> put<00:01:48.190> on<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.460> smaller<00:01:48.850> one

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
detached it and put on the smaller one

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.960 
detached it and put on the smaller one
for<00:01:49.780> smaller<00:01:50.290> areas<00:01:50.800> like<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.190> kini<00:01:51.430> wines<00:01:51.700> of
