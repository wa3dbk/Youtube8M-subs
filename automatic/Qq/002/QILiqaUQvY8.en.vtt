I<00:05:33.500> imagine<00:05:34.460> that<00:05:34.639> it<00:05:35.060> matches<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.569> up<00:05:35.599> with

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
I imagine that it matches you up with

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.360 
I imagine that it matches you up with
somebody<00:05:36.169> on<00:05:36.439> the<00:05:36.620> other<00:05:36.649> side<00:05:36.860> of<00:05:37.159> the<00:05:37.219> world

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
somebody on the other side of the world

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.670 
somebody on the other side of the world
or<00:05:37.639> local<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.180> have<00:05:38.330> no<00:05:38.509> idea<00:05:38.870> but<00:05:39.139> there<00:05:39.500> must

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
or local I have no idea but there must

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.550 
or local I have no idea but there must
be<00:05:39.770> enough<00:05:40.099> people<00:05:40.279> playing<00:05:40.669> this<00:05:40.819> game<00:05:41.029> oh<00:05:41.560> I

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
be enough people playing this game oh I

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.869 
be enough people playing this game oh I
