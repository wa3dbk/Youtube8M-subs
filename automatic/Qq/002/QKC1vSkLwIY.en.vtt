Invictus<00:02:33.209> somewhat<00:02:33.630> famous<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.350> copying<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
Invictus somewhat famous for copying the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.309 
Invictus somewhat famous for copying the
Submariner<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> Rolex<00:02:36.630> Submariner<00:02:37.020> if<00:02:37.230> you

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
Submariner the Rolex Submariner if you

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.380 
Submariner the Rolex Submariner if you
look<00:02:37.470> at<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.680> shape<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.190> case<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.120> I've

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
look at the shape of the case and I've

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.270 
look at the shape of the case and I've
talked<00:02:39.720> about<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.290> when<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.860> talked<00:02:41.190> about

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
talked about this when I talked about

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.150 
talked about this when I talked about
the<00:02:41.610> video<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:43.230> Seiko<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.890> just

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
the video on the Seiko that I just

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.070 
the video on the Seiko that I just
showed<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:46.410> shape<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.890> case<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:48.080> the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
showed you the shape of the case on the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.420 
showed you the shape of the case on the
Rolexes<00:02:49.739> fits<00:02:50.459> very<00:02:50.760> nicely<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.540> your<00:02:51.690> wrist

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
Rolexes fits very nicely to your wrist

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.890 
Rolexes fits very nicely to your wrist
and<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.920> me<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.569> more<00:02:57.569> desirable

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
and just just to me is a more desirable

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.640 
and just just to me is a more desirable
shape<00:02:58.190> than<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.790> sticks<00:03:00.090> up<00:03:00.330> higher

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
shape than one that sticks up higher

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.699 
shape than one that sticks up higher
like<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> lot<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.280> newer<00:03:02.459> watches<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.709> this

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
like a lot of the newer watches do this

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.449 
like a lot of the newer watches do this
is<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> 99037<00:03:05.730> pro<00:03:06.630> diver

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
is the 99037 pro diver

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.190 
is the 99037 pro diver
another<00:03:08.459> thing<00:03:08.760> that's<00:03:08.910> different<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:10.080> you

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
another thing that's different if you

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.199 
another thing that's different if you
look<00:03:10.380> here<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:13.350> way<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.610> mechanism

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
look here the way this the the mechanism

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.759 
look here the way this the the mechanism
here<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.900> folds<00:03:16.230> over<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.590> is

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
here is that you folds over this is

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.680 
here is that you folds over this is
thicker<00:03:17.040> pieces<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.450> slightly

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
thicker pieces and it's a slightly

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.600 
thicker pieces and it's a slightly
different<00:03:18.959> design<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.799> does<00:03:19.950> not<00:03:20.160> have<00:03:20.489> an

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
different design it does not have an

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.180 
different design it does not have an
extension<00:03:21.120> bracelet<00:03:21.630> for<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.739> extend

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
extension bracelet for you to extend

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.020 
extension bracelet for you to extend
over<00:03:23.610> top<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:24.180> wetsuit<00:03:25.910> but<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:28.760> never<00:03:29.760> use<00:03:30.000> a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
over top of a wetsuit but I never use a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.940 
over top of a wetsuit but I never use a
wetsuit<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:30.870> for<00:03:31.079> me<00:03:31.200> that's<00:03:31.380> not<00:03:31.530> an<00:03:31.799> issue

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
wetsuit so for me that's not an issue

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.100 
wetsuit so for me that's not an issue
but<00:03:32.160> if<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.370> use<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> wetsuit<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.480> doesn't<00:03:33.959> have

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
but if you use a wetsuit it doesn't have

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.430 
but if you use a wetsuit it doesn't have
one<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:35.489> band<00:03:36.060> on<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.810> thicker<00:03:37.140> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
one the band on this is thicker and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.740 
one the band on this is thicker and
heavier<00:03:37.890> than<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.760> other<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.120> Viktor<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.510> just

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
heavier than the other and Viktor I just

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.000 
heavier than the other and Viktor I just
showed<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:42.090> end<00:03:42.359> pieces<00:03:43.519> are<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:46.010> solid

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
showed you the end pieces are a solid

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.190 
showed you the end pieces are a solid
piece<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.150> drilled<00:03:48.510> through<00:03:48.870> for<00:03:49.109> the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
piece that is drilled through for the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.990 
piece that is drilled through for the
pen<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.410> much<00:03:52.709> better<00:03:53.010> construction<00:03:53.700> on<00:03:53.880> the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
pen so much better construction on the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.199 
pen so much better construction on the
band<00:03:54.829> you<00:03:55.829> can<00:03:55.950> see<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.489> movement<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.000> has<00:03:57.030> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
band you can see the movement it has a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.630 
band you can see the movement it has a
Swiss<00:03:57.720> movement<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.560> hacking<00:03:59.250> movement

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
Swiss movement it is a hacking movement

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.009 
Swiss movement it is a hacking movement
which<00:03:59.730> means<00:04:00.000> when<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.329> unscrew<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.900> crown

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
which means when you unscrew the crown

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.990 
which means when you unscrew the crown
and<00:04:01.320> pull<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.620> out<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:01.920> will<00:04:02.040> stop<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.609> second

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
and pull it out it will stop the second

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.780 
and pull it out it will stop the second
hand<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:04.079> can<00:04:04.230> set<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.590> time<00:04:04.859> now<00:04:05.489> don't

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
on the hand and it's very comfortable

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.940 
on the hand and it's very comfortable
this<00:05:04.120> is<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.660> think<00:05:05.020> this<00:05:05.169> is<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.350> 42

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
this is a I think this is a 42

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.770 
this is a I think this is a 42
millimeter<00:05:06.400> I've<00:05:06.580> heard<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:07.210> said<00:05:07.450> that<00:05:07.630> it's

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
millimeter I've heard it said that it's

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.390 
millimeter I've heard it said that it's
40<00:05:08.139> millimeter<00:05:08.530> in<00:05:08.650> some<00:05:08.800> places<00:05:08.979> but<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.190> think

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
40 millimeter in some places but I think

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.520 
40 millimeter in some places but I think
it's<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.610> 42<00:05:09.940> so<00:05:10.630> it's<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:10.810> little<00:05:10.990> smaller<00:05:11.200> than

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
it's a 42 so it's a little smaller than

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.980 
it's a 42 so it's a little smaller than
the<00:05:11.710> 43<00:05:12.340> millimeter<00:05:12.790> and<00:05:13.000> Victor<00:05:13.780> that<00:05:13.960> I

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
the 43 millimeter and Victor that I

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.440 
the 43 millimeter and Victor that I
showed<00:05:14.260> you<00:05:14.290> earlier<00:05:14.470> which<00:05:15.160> to<00:05:15.790> me<00:05:15.970> this<00:05:16.240> is<00:05:16.419> a

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
showed you earlier which to me this is a

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.379 
showed you earlier which to me this is a
perfect<00:05:16.750> size<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.680> very<00:05:18.550> comfortable<00:05:19.060> on<00:05:19.270> the
