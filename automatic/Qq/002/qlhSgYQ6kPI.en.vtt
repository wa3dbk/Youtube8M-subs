00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.050 

I'm<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.890> create<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.370> short<00:00:05.730> little

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
I'm going to create a short little

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.169 
I'm going to create a short little
animation<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.839> some<00:00:07.410> sequenced<00:00:07.859> frames<00:00:08.280> using

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
animation of some sequenced frames using

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.669 
animation of some sequenced frames using
a<00:00:09.360> couple<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> animation<00:00:10.320> related

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
a couple of the animation related

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.129 
a couple of the animation related
features<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.219> motion<00:00:11.550> art<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.480> good<00:00:12.719> for

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
features in motion art this is good for

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.860 
features in motion art this is good for
html5<00:00:13.920> output<00:00:14.400> movies<00:00:15.299> are<00:00:15.450> very<00:00:15.599> heavy

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
html5 output movies are very heavy

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.500 
html5 output movies are very heavy
they're<00:00:16.710> not<00:00:16.830> cross<00:00:17.039> browser<00:00:17.310> compatible<00:00:18.000> etc

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
they're not cross browser compatible etc

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.470 
they're not cross browser compatible etc
so<00:00:18.810> from<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> file<00:00:19.890> menu<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.279> am<00:00:20.820> going<00:00:21.270> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
so from the file menu I am going to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.609 
so from the file menu I am going to
import<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.289> set<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.590> images<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:24.260> those<00:00:25.260> images

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
import a set of images and those images

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.689 
import a set of images and those images
are<00:00:26.220> numbered<00:00:26.670> sequentially<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.599> see

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
are numbered sequentially as you can see

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.780 
are numbered sequentially as you can see
the<00:00:29.699> open<00:00:29.939> button<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:31.399> right<00:00:32.399> now<00:00:32.550> they're

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the open button and right now they're

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.780 
the open button and right now they're
all<00:00:32.820> toggled<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.500> visible<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:35.640> going

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
all toggled to be visible so I'm going

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
all toggled to be visible so I'm going
to<00:00:35.850> select<00:00:36.030> them<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.649> first<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> do

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
to select them all first I'm going to do

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
to select them all first I'm going to do
is<00:00:38.160> delete<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.610> panel<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.149> need<00:00:39.300> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
is delete this panel I don't need it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.819 
is delete this panel I don't need it
select<00:00:40.350> all<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> images<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.469> from<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
select all of the images and from the

select all of the images and from the
arrange<00:00:44.160> menu<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.730> am<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> toggle

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
arrange menu I am going to toggle

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.990 
arrange menu I am going to toggle
selection<00:00:46.559> visibility<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.520> does<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
selection visibility what that does is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.479 
selection visibility what that does is
obviously<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.950> visibility<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.370> the

obviously if the visibility is on of the
selected<00:00:50.850> object<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.300> toggles<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> off<00:00:52.039> and

vice versa so I'm going to go out about

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.090 
vice versa so I'm going to go out about
three<00:00:55.860> seconds<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.680> with<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:58.890> all

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
three seconds here and with them all

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.880 
three seconds here and with them all
still<00:00:59.460> selected<00:01:00.059> from<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.930> arrange<00:01:01.230> menu<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
still selected from the arrange menu I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.750 
still selected from the arrange menu I
am<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> select<00:01:04.129> sequence<00:01:05.129> visibility

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
am going to select sequence visibility

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.660 
am going to select sequence visibility
and<00:01:05.970> I'm<00:01:06.810> asked<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.409> give<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.860> number<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.340> frames

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and I'm asked to give a number of frames

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670 
and I'm asked to give a number of frames
between<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> delay<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.260> turning<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
between the delay of turning the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.630 
between the delay of turning the
visibility<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> hit<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> ok<00:01:12.960> button<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
visibility so I hit the ok button and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.690 
visibility so I hit the ok button and
now<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.880> happens<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.229> play<00:01:16.470> these<00:01:16.700> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
now what happens is as I play these you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.130 
now what happens is as I play these you
see<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.420> explosion<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
see that I get that explosion the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.539 
see that I get that explosion the
problem<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.830> doesn't<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.250> quite<00:01:20.430> right

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
problem is it doesn't look quite right

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
problem is it doesn't look quite right
because<00:01:20.970> there's<00:01:21.930> transparency<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
because there's transparency on it and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.960 
because there's transparency on it and
the<00:01:23.939> first<00:01:24.210> image<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> displayed<00:01:25.970> stays

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the first image that is displayed stays

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
the first image that is displayed stays
displayed<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.200> forth<00:01:28.470> until<00:01:28.740> they're<00:01:29.100> all

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
displayed and so forth until they're all

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.130 
displayed and so forth until they're all
displayed<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.790> end<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> go

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
displayed at the end so I'm going to go

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.249 
displayed at the end so I'm going to go
another<00:01:31.530> three<00:01:31.979> frames<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.810> select<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:34.049> all

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
another three frames out select them all

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.940 
another three frames out select them all
and<00:01:34.700> again<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> arrange<00:01:37.049> menu<00:01:37.140> select

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and again from the arrange menu select

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.160 
and again from the arrange menu select
sequence<00:01:38.460> visibility<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.329> same<00:01:40.020> number

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
sequence visibility and the same number

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
sequence visibility and the same number
of<00:01:40.350> frames<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.670> each<00:01:41.790> one

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
of frames now you can see that each one

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.249 
of frames now you can see that each one
only<00:01:42.090> lives<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.509> three<00:01:42.869> frames<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:45.079> I'm<00:01:46.079> back

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
only lives for three frames so I'm back

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.139 
only lives for three frames so I'm back
in<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> little<00:01:46.829> bit<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.490> play<00:01:47.640> button<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
now I have a explosion from the file
