right<00:00:02.370> here's<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.700> poly<00:00:02.939> guy's<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> SAP<00:00:03.540> and

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:04.339 
right here's the poly guy's a SAP and

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.769 
right here's the poly guy's a SAP and
what<00:00:05.339> I'm<00:00:05.460> doing<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:05.970> I'm<00:00:06.299> just<00:00:06.450> waiting<00:00:06.750> for

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
what I'm doing now I'm just waiting for

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.780 
what I'm doing now I'm just waiting for
it<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.049> do<00:00:07.259> one<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.470> its<00:00:08.420> flush<00:00:09.420> cycles<00:00:10.790> and

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it to do one of its flush cycles and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.049 
it to do one of its flush cycles and
hopefully<00:00:12.300> you'll<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.450> able<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.690> see<00:00:12.840> exactly

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
hopefully you'll be able to see exactly

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.150 
hopefully you'll be able to see exactly
what<00:00:15.059> happens<00:00:15.420> as<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.619> see<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.920> bottom

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
what happens as you can see in a bottom

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.250 
what happens as you can see in a bottom
chamber<00:00:18.080> there's<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:20.480> funnel<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.810> goes<00:00:22.020> down

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
chamber there's a funnel that goes down

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.870 
chamber there's a funnel that goes down
to<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> middle<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.609> feels<00:00:23.820> like

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
to the middle and that feels like

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.320 
to the middle and that feels like
they're<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:25.199> bottom<00:00:25.350> part<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.830> then<00:00:26.760> when

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
they're in the bottom part and then when

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.689 
they're in the bottom part and then when
it's<00:00:27.480> when<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> years<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.699> been

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it's when the years actually been

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's when the years actually been
released<00:00:30.029> by<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> mechanical<00:00:30.900> valve<00:00:31.309> it<00:00:32.309> then

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
released by a mechanical valve it then

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910 
released by a mechanical valve it then
the<00:00:32.669> air<00:00:32.790> goes<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.059> into<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> top<00:00:33.809> chamber<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
the air goes up into the top chamber and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
the air goes up into the top chamber and
where<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.309> all<00:00:35.399> those<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.809> beads<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
where you got all those the beads and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.240 
where you got all those the beads and
the<00:00:38.300> bacteria<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.800> thing<00:00:40.800> gets<00:00:41.010> agitated

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the bacteria that thing gets agitated

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
the bacteria that thing gets agitated
and<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> beads<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:42.870> drop<00:00:43.079> down<00:00:43.110> into

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and all the beads then drop down into

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.619 
and all the beads then drop down into
the<00:00:43.559> bottom<00:00:43.800> chamber<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.969> after<00:00:45.180> water<00:00:45.360> fills

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the bottom chamber and after water fills

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
the bottom chamber and after water fills
back<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:46.039> it<00:00:47.039> comes<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> top<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
back up it comes up to the top all the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.200 
back up it comes up to the top all the
beads<00:00:48.570> float<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.960> top<00:00:49.079> after<00:00:49.920> being

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
beads float to the top after being

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.930 
beads float to the top after being
cleaned<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.360> any<00:00:51.420> major<00:00:52.129> debris<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
cleaned of any major debris and then it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.779 
cleaned of any major debris and then it
pumps<00:00:54.239> back<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> pond<00:00:55.579> there's<00:00:56.579> quite<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
pumps back into the pond there's quite a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.990 
pumps back into the pond there's quite a
lot<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> shaking<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.930> takes<00:00:58.170> place<00:00:58.879> which<00:00:59.879> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
lot of shaking that takes place which is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.330 
lot of shaking that takes place which is
probably<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> bit<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.719> downfall<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.440> that's

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
probably a bit of a downfall but that's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.200 
probably a bit of a downfall but that's
just<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.730> those<00:01:02.789> things

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
just one of those things

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.039 
just one of those things
here<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.870> comes<00:01:04.049> working<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:05.750> as<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:06.990> see

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
here it comes working now as you can see

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
here it comes working now as you can see
the<00:01:07.320> beads<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:09.060> they're<00:01:09.240> getting<00:01:09.330> agitated

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the beads and they're getting agitated

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.850 
the beads and they're getting agitated
in<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> air<00:01:10.189> it's<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> top<00:01:12.860> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
in the air it's going up to the top and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.469 
in the air it's going up to the top and
why<00:01:14.010> did<00:01:14.159> he<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> place<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.119> notice

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
why did he take in place if you notice

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.859 
why did he take in place if you notice
you<00:01:15.570> see<00:01:15.780> there's<00:01:16.680> no<00:01:16.830> water<00:01:17.540> coming<00:01:18.540> into<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
you see there's no water coming into the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.910 
you see there's no water coming into the
pond

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.590 

you<00:01:24.460> could<00:01:24.670> hear<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.910> water<00:01:25.060> coming<00:01:25.420> back

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
you could hear the water coming back

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.830 
you could hear the water coming back
into<00:01:25.780> it<00:01:25.960> again<00:01:28.020> there's<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:30.540> bead<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.750> they're

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
into it again there's a bead and they're

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.150 
into it again there's a bead and they're
floating<00:01:32.020> up<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.470> top<00:01:32.620> again<00:01:32.650> after<00:01:33.130> being

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
floating up to the top again after being

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.700 
floating up to the top again after being
cleaned<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.930> I'll<00:01:35.050> move<00:01:35.170> on<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.530> front

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
cleaned and I'll move on to the front

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.090 
cleaned and I'll move on to the front
yeah<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.190> can<00:01:36.370> see<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:38.590> happens<00:01:38.890> at<00:01:39.040> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
yeah so you can see what happens at the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:53.940 
yeah so you can see what happens at the
front<00:01:46.920> quite<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> lot<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.160> noise<00:01:52.620> once<00:01:53.620> it<00:01:53.740> fills

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
front quite a lot of noise once it fills

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.680 
front quite a lot of noise once it fills
up<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:58.619> water<00:01:59.619> then<00:02:00.479> starts<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.540> come<00:02:01.660> back

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
up the water then starts to come back

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.430 
up the water then starts to come back
out<00:02:01.990> again

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
out again

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.530 
out again
you<00:02:03.190> look<00:02:03.460> down<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:03.820> on<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.910> little<00:02:04.119> Volvo

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
you look down there on the little Volvo

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.230 
you look down there on the little Volvo
on<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.840> side<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.320> poly<00:02:05.770> geyser<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
on the side of the poly geyser the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.220 
on the side of the poly geyser the
plastic<00:02:07.690> thing<00:02:07.900> about<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.860> cyclone<00:02:09.310> that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
plastic thing about the cyclone that

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.979 
plastic thing about the cyclone that
then<00:02:11.230> starts<00:02:11.560> refilling<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.430> bottom<00:02:12.730> chamber

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
then starts refilling the bottom chamber

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.550 
then starts refilling the bottom chamber
back<00:02:13.989> we're<00:02:14.170> there

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
back we're there

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.770 
back we're there
and<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.340> really<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.670> basically<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.330> cycle

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and that really is basically the cycle

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.920 
and that really is basically the cycle
that<00:02:16.959> takes<00:02:17.170> place<00:02:18.060> once<00:02:19.060> every<00:02:19.330> 45<00:02:19.870> minutes

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
that takes place once every 45 minutes

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.900 
that takes place once every 45 minutes
we've<00:02:20.230> got<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.440> set<00:02:20.590> at<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.709> moment<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:21.820> an

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
we've got it set at the moment to an

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.440 
we've got it set at the moment to an
hour<00:02:23.040> down<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.070> whatever<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.489> want<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.730> say<00:02:25.390> it

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
hour down to whatever you want to say it
