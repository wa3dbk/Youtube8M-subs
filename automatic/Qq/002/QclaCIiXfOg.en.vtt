00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 the karlsruher sc presents wildpark 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.559
 tv powered by bath tv because it's the eighth 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.179
 win in a row in hall 1 0 2 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.679
 outward success what does it yours 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.049
 opinion that he is back with 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.580
 can drive three points home 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.910
 was difficult and playable today 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.529
 field for both teams and us 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.199
 have accepted time we knew 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.970
 the addition of the hall was only very deep 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.240
 let us play because there was 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.279
 of course escape through our early 1 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.850
 0 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.640
 second half they were a bit 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.160
 more aggressive but then ice cold 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.300
 slammed by kuhn and have that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.910
 play then brought over the stage 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 You see in your face that while 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.920
 of the game, once the pressure on the hand 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.780
 had to create what exactly happened 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.760
 I went to the headball duel and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.870
 yes I think I'm the head of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 opponent against my mine 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.199
 get eyebrows and therefore one 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 bit bursting with four 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.479
 Stitches are stitched and so it is not 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.340
 Now there are two more games in the game 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.409
 short sequence the league match against the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.080
 vfb stuttgart 2 and that already 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.360
 sold out cup games sc freiburg what 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.939
 is still on the program 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.509
 yes of course we want the maximum 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.030
 yield 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.810
 Of course, the league wants to win further 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.640
 and the sc freiburg most difficult bonus 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.570
 Of course, everything is possible here and there 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.970
 in focus the eighth victory in a row 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.320
 working victorious in hall so its was the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.630
 was a highly competitive hall really got us 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.280
 He has a good one here 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.720
 In spite of all this, the phase has also been managed 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.070
 We have to end up having the line 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 Lost many plants allowed 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.299
 hall really has a centimeter floor 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.430
 have fought accepted and that's why 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.540
 the way in the end still deserves something 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.250
 has your team today 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.200
 especially good and not so good 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.850
 They fancied they fought you 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.320
 who was a heavy ground 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.920
 It was not a snow on it was 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.750
 easy for a little bit harder ice 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.100
 and that was not so good for now 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.270
 soccer game and that was that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.159
 assumed that was a real one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.840
 have done with the gates and we are up 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.759
 finally defended and fought 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.020
 have to win here 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.030
 now there are two more games on the vfb 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.540
 stuttgart 2 and the cup game sc 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.280
 Freiburg 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.730
 The League Game It is rouwen hennings too 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.689
 Replace fifth yellow card today 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.950
 get the board 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.840
 it was clear that at some point this happens 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.280
 was his first foul in the game but it 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.750
 is so far but shown that we 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.609
 It was always possible to compensate for everything 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 again the right idea from the 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.019
 hat magic we have your options 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.959
 with with patrick dulleck karim benyamina 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.829
 simon brandstetter timo core striking 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.480
 the tips we have several 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.859
 possibilities we will in the course of 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.139
 week to see how we do it best 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.609
 You could say provocative if you know 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.959
 what the team can playful what 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.340
 yes already showed if you see 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.230
 that the team is fighting today 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.829
 then I can not do much 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.689
 go wrong 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.700
 It's a long way to go 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.720
 that it is difficult and that it is long 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.250
 that every team really does 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.569
 once everything is required and if you are 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.700
 if you have that in the back of your mind and if 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.349
 you always have that in mind and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.150
 Accordingly, then we are 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.470
 Alright, but it's a very, very good one 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.790
 long as we have seen 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.799
 really every opponent to offer something 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.220
 and also has to fight for his chances 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.609
 it is still quite long, the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.010
