what I tell people when they have that
little<00:02:37.640> feeling<00:02:37.879> like<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.689> to<00:02:38.840> drink<00:02:38.989> a

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
little feeling like that is to drink a

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.399 
little feeling like that is to drink a
lot<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.260> water<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.040> lower<00:02:40.219> the<00:02:40.400> dose

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
lot of water and to lower the dose

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.470 
lot of water and to lower the dose
that's<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:43.489> would<00:02:43.849> this<00:02:44.030> be<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:45.969> this<00:02:46.969> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
that's but would this be like this the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.979 
that's but would this be like this the
arena<00:02:47.810> lift<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.319> actually<00:02:48.769> not<00:02:49.280> as<00:02:49.989> energizing

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
arena lift is actually not as energizing

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.199 
arena lift is actually not as energizing
as<00:02:51.200> them<00:02:51.709> dhamaka<00:02:52.250> express<00:02:52.670> because<00:02:52.879> this<00:02:53.030> is

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
as them dhamaka express because this is

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.599 
as them dhamaka express because this is
it<00:02:53.389> this<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.079> an<00:02:54.230> eight<00:02:54.439> times<00:02:54.799> concentrate

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
it this is an eight times concentrate

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.059 
it this is an eight times concentrate
over<00:02:55.969> raw<00:02:56.180> maca<00:02:56.450> powder<00:02:56.810> because<00:02:57.200> we<00:02:57.469> do<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.620> 41

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
over raw maca powder because we do a 41

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.270 
over raw maca powder because we do a 41
extraction<00:02:58.579> two<00:02:58.760> times<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.750> it's<00:03:00.139> eight<00:03:00.709> times

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
extraction two times so it's eight times

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.300 
extraction two times so it's eight times
more<00:03:01.549> than<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.450> we<00:03:03.290> do<00:03:03.469> use<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.280> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
more than that and we do use this in the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.250 
more than that and we do use this in the
adrenal<00:03:04.760> lift<00:03:04.939> but<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:05.269> not<00:03:05.450> an<00:03:05.870> entire

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
adrenal lift but it's not an entire

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.020 
adrenal lift but it's not an entire
bottle<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.680> concentrate<00:03:06.950> because<00:03:07.519> we<00:03:07.879> also

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
bottle of concentrate because we also

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.509 
bottle of concentrate because we also
have<00:03:08.500> jatoba<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.980> suma<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.879> astragalus<00:03:11.329> and

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
have jatoba and suma and astragalus and

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.190 
have jatoba and suma and astragalus and
avena<00:03:13.519> sativa<00:03:13.669> sarsaparilla<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:15.019> there's

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
avena sativa sarsaparilla so there's

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.839 
avena sativa sarsaparilla so there's
other<00:03:15.319> herbs<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.829> here<00:03:15.859> that<00:03:16.340> are<00:03:16.370> taking<00:03:16.730> up

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
other herbs in here that are taking up

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.670 
other herbs in here that are taking up
the<00:03:16.970> space<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.480> would<00:03:17.629> normally<00:03:17.780> be<00:03:18.109> just<00:03:18.469> a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
the space that would normally be just a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.619 
the space that would normally be just a
containment<00:03:19.099> like<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.579> so<00:03:20.090> Audrina<00:03:20.389> loopt

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
containment like that so Audrina loopt

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.860 
containment like that so Audrina loopt

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.930 

not<00:03:26.500> really<00:03:26.830> I<00:03:26.860> mean<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.430> think<00:03:27.580> about<00:03:27.819> it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
not really I mean you think about it

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.880 
not really I mean you think about it
when<00:03:28.030> your<00:03:28.180> adrenal<00:03:28.569> glands<00:03:28.810> get<00:03:29.080> taxed<00:03:29.590> right
