00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.000 

so<00:00:00.750> now<00:00:00.870> I'm<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.170> introduce<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.740> you<00:00:01.770> the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
so now I'm going to introduce to you the

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.640 
so now I'm going to introduce to you the
part<00:00:02.310> on<00:00:02.460> your<00:00:02.610> Canon<00:00:02.939> XH<00:00:03.060> a1<00:00:03.449> where<00:00:04.290> you'll<00:00:04.500> be

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
part on your Canon XH a1 where you'll be

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.070 
part on your Canon XH a1 where you'll be
connecting<00:00:05.160> most<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.089> your<00:00:06.240> external<00:00:06.540> audio

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
connecting most of your external audio

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.990 
connecting most of your external audio
and<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:07.980> what<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.160> recommend<00:00:08.790> using

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
and this is what I recommend using

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.930 
and this is what I recommend using
instead<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.809> mic<00:00:10.469> terminal<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.790> can

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
instead of the mic terminal and you can

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.390 
instead of the mic terminal and you can
see<00:00:12.150> we've<00:00:12.360> got<00:00:12.540> two<00:00:12.719> XLR<00:00:13.380> inputs<00:00:13.830> right<00:00:14.040> here

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
see we've got two XLR inputs right here

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.490 
see we've got two XLR inputs right here
and<00:00:14.820> that's<00:00:15.269> why<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> XLR<00:00:15.809> looks<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.350> you

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and that's why the XLR looks like you

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.420 
and that's why the XLR looks like you
should<00:00:16.619> definitely<00:00:16.949> get<00:00:17.039> really<00:00:17.250> familiar

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
should definitely get really familiar

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.220 
should definitely get really familiar
with<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.000> when<00:00:18.480> I'm<00:00:18.600> working<00:00:18.840> with<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.990> lot<00:00:19.140> of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
with that when I'm working with a lot of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.859 
with that when I'm working with a lot of
audio<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.430> I've<00:00:20.550> got<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> bunch<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.420> switches

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
audio and I've got a bunch of switches

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.450 
audio and I've got a bunch of switches
right<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.320> let<00:00:22.500> me<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.769> introduce<00:00:22.980> those

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
right here let me just introduce those

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.779 
right here let me just introduce those
got<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.510> switch<00:00:25.019> between<00:00:25.230> line<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.010> mic<00:00:26.220> if

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
got a switch between line and mic if

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.800 
got a switch between line and mic if
you're<00:00:26.939> using<00:00:27.119> these<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.539> want<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> be

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
you're using these you want to be

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.740 
you're using these you want to be
switched<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.230> mic<00:00:28.760> channel<00:00:29.760> 1<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.330> then

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
switched to mic channel 1 and then

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.139 
switched to mic channel 1 and then
channel<00:00:31.050> 1<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.260> 2<00:00:31.590> basically<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.880> choose

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
channel 1 and 2 basically you can choose

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.700 
channel 1 and 2 basically you can choose
to<00:00:33.300> record<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> only<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.500> input

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to record if you only have one input

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
to record if you only have one input
into<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.520> channel<00:00:35.760> or<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.750> make<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
into one channel or you can make that a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
into one channel or you can make that a
stereo<00:00:37.710> recording<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.579> duplicate<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> audio

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
stereo recording and duplicate the audio

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.569 
stereo recording and duplicate the audio
also<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.530> using<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.219> record

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
also be using this when we record

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.819 
also be using this when we record
separate<00:00:42.030> channels<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:43.230> over<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.440> is

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
separate channels and then over here is

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.459 
separate channels and then over here is
the<00:00:43.860> mic<00:00:44.460> attenuator<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.360> basically<00:00:46.200> if

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the mic attenuator and basically if

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.560 
the mic attenuator and basically if
you're<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.100> loud<00:00:47.460> situation<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you're in a really loud situation and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.959 
you're in a really loud situation and
your<00:00:48.690> audio<00:00:48.960> levels<00:00:49.289> are<00:00:49.410> peaking<00:00:49.789> turn<00:00:50.789> this

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
your audio levels are peaking turn this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.639 
your audio levels are peaking turn this
on<00:00:52.129> it's<00:00:53.129> off<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.390> position<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
on it's off in that position on in that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.160 
on it's off in that position on in that
position<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.520> it'll<00:00:57.239> reduce<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.870> audio

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
position and it'll reduce the audio

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.340 
position and it'll reduce the audio
levels<00:00:58.559> by<00:00:58.800> 20<00:00:59.399> bowls<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.199> hopefully<00:01:01.199> give

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
levels by 20 bowls and hopefully give

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.410 
levels by 20 bowls and hopefully give
you<00:01:01.469> better<00:01:01.680> levels<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.789> got<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> couple<00:01:03.359> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you better levels also got a couple of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450 
you better levels also got a couple of
other<00:01:03.539> switches<00:01:03.989> over<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.280> will

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
other switches over here which we will

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.240 
other switches over here which we will
be<00:01:05.640> talking<00:01:05.850> about<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.510> second<00:01:07.040> but<00:01:08.040> first

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
be talking about in a second but first

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
can see we get a little indicator that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.850 
can see we get a little indicator that
our<00:01:39.960> XLR<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:41.729> our<00:01:41.909> display<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.860> yet

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
our XLR is on on our display and yet

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.889 
our XLR is on on our display and yet
once<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.220> plug<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> mic<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:45.000> we'll<00:01:45.479> actually<00:01:45.630> get

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
once we plug a mic in we'll actually get

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.350 
once we plug a mic in we'll actually get
some<00:01:46.110> levels<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:46.909> remember<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
some levels and just remember if you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.050 
some levels and just remember if you
ever<00:01:48.509> want<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> switch<00:01:48.899> back<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.530> board

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
ever want to switch back here on board
