00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.570 

the<00:00:10.170> area<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> think<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> church<00:00:11.280> has

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
the area that I think the church has

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.230 
the area that I think the church has
been<00:00:11.820> struggling<00:00:12.450> in

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
been struggling in

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.609 
been struggling in
is<00:00:13.300> where<00:00:13.630> we<00:00:14.469> model<00:00:15.219> for<00:00:15.969> or<00:00:16.619> parishioners

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
is where we model for or parishioners

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.010 
is where we model for or parishioners
and<00:00:17.860> for<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.400> world<00:00:18.580> what<00:00:19.150> Jesus<00:00:19.539> Christ<00:00:19.779> came

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
and for the world what Jesus Christ came

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.499 
and for the world what Jesus Christ came
here<00:00:20.200> to<00:00:20.320> do<00:00:20.439> to<00:00:20.950> reach<00:00:21.189> out<00:00:21.550> to<00:00:21.939> the<00:00:22.150> least<00:00:22.360> of

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
here to do to reach out to the least of

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.080 
here to do to reach out to the least of
these<00:00:22.689> it<00:00:23.439> has<00:00:23.470> not<00:00:23.770> proven<00:00:24.220> effective<00:00:24.669> to

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
these it has not proven effective to

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.510 
these it has not proven effective to
simply<00:00:25.119> teach<00:00:25.720> this<00:00:26.110> to<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.650> body<00:00:26.830> because

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
simply teach this to the body because

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.700 
simply teach this to the body because
they<00:00:27.849> simply<00:00:28.060> receive<00:00:28.570> it<00:00:28.750> take<00:00:29.230> some<00:00:29.410> great

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
they simply receive it take some great

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.410 
they simply receive it take some great
notes<00:00:29.949> and<00:00:30.279> then<00:00:30.640> go<00:00:30.789> home<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.180> do<00:00:31.269> nothing

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
notes and then go home and do nothing

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.799 
notes and then go home and do nothing
about<00:00:31.810> it<00:00:31.990> so<00:00:32.140> we<00:00:33.010> took<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.550> calculated<00:00:34.360> risk<00:00:34.390> a

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
about it so we took a calculated risk a

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.350 
about it so we took a calculated risk a
biblical<00:00:35.350> one<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.980> we<00:00:36.190> said<00:00:36.460> we<00:00:36.850> had<00:00:37.180> to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
biblical one and we said we had to

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.390 
biblical one and we said we had to
prioritize<00:00:37.629> this<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.590> model<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.070> for<00:00:39.309> the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
prioritize this and model it for the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.670 
prioritize this and model it for the
church<00:00:39.640> because<00:00:40.629> if<00:00:40.809> we<00:00:40.960> model<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.410> for<00:00:41.440> the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
church because if we model it for the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.079 
church because if we model it for the
church<00:00:41.890> then<00:00:42.280> maybe<00:00:42.550> we'll<00:00:42.790> become<00:00:42.940> a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
church then maybe we'll become a

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.810 
church then maybe we'll become a
lifestyle<00:00:43.839> for<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.230> body<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.769> so<00:00:45.250> that's<00:00:45.640> why

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
lifestyle for the body and so that's why

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.880 
lifestyle for the body and so that's why
we<00:00:46.000> chose<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.269> we<00:00:46.900> just<00:00:47.140> do<00:00:47.290> it<00:00:47.320> every<00:00:47.470> fifth

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
we chose it we just do it every fifth

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.130 
we chose it we just do it every fifth
Sunday<00:00:48.129> where<00:00:48.460> every<00:00:49.330> fifth<00:00:49.540> Sun<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:49.930> no

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
Sunday where every fifth Sun that no

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.950 
Sunday where every fifth Sun that no
matter<00:00:50.350> what<00:00:50.620> we<00:00:51.010> will<00:00:51.040> not<00:00:51.339> have<00:00:51.519> church<00:00:51.960> in

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
matter what we will not have church in

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.049 
matter what we will not have church in
the<00:00:53.379> traditional<00:00:53.949> sense<00:00:54.129> we'll<00:00:54.640> take<00:00:54.909> the

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
the traditional sense we'll take the

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.960 
the traditional sense we'll take the
church<00:00:55.330> to<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.140> community<00:00:56.619> so<00:00:57.339> for<00:00:57.549> example

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
church to the community so for example

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.450 
church to the community so for example
we<00:00:58.059> go<00:00:58.210> out<00:00:58.360> into<00:00:58.600> apartment<00:00:59.409> complexes<00:00:59.979> we<00:01:00.309> go

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
we go out into apartment complexes we go

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.789 
we go out into apartment complexes we go
out<00:01:00.640> into<00:01:00.850> schools<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.199> got<00:01:02.409> into<00:01:02.710> the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
out into schools we got into the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.250 
out into schools we got into the
community<00:01:03.369> we<00:01:04.000> go<00:01:04.150> out<00:01:04.330> into<00:01:04.629> nursing<00:01:05.049> homes

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
community we go out into nursing homes

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.039 
community we go out into nursing homes
and<00:01:05.590> really<00:01:05.950> all<00:01:06.250> we<00:01:06.400> try<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.700> do<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.090> be<00:01:07.630> Christ

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
and really all we try to do is be Christ

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.219 
and really all we try to do is be Christ
to<00:01:08.830> them<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:10.180> what<00:01:10.330> I've<00:01:10.450> loved<00:01:10.869> about<00:01:11.170> it

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
to them and so what I've loved about it

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.649 
to them and so what I've loved about it
is<00:01:11.380> is<00:01:11.799> that<00:01:12.369> church<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:12.880> no<00:01:13.030> longer<00:01:13.270> just

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
is is that church is no longer just

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.100 
is is that church is no longer just
Sunday<00:01:14.560> morning<00:01:14.979> church<00:01:15.159> is<00:01:15.790> now<00:01:15.939> what<00:01:16.540> you<00:01:16.780> do

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
Sunday morning church is now what you do

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.490 
Sunday morning church is now what you do
in<00:01:17.560> your<00:01:17.950> daily<00:01:18.340> experience<00:01:19.179> I<00:01:19.509> just<00:01:20.320> think

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
in your daily experience I just think

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.749

that's<00:01:20.619> what<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.920> body<00:01:21.100> of<00:01:21.280> Christ<00:01:21.490> should<00:01:21.700> be

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
that's what the body of Christ should be

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.120 
that's what the body of Christ should be
doing<00:01:22.119> we<00:01:22.450> should<00:01:22.479> be<00:01:22.719> infiltrating<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.770> the
