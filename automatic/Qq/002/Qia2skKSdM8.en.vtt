repaired<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.490> wheel<00:02:20.820> well<00:02:21.620> they<00:02:22.620> tape

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
repaired this wheel well they tape

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.430 
repaired this wheel well they tape
maintain<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.850> contour<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.750> original

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
maintain the contour of the original

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.380 
maintain the contour of the original
body<00:02:25.740> lines<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.760> when<00:02:26.880> they<00:02:26.970> put<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.270> new

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
body lines so when they put the new

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.960 
body lines so when they put the new
chrome<00:02:27.690> trim<00:02:27.990> up<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.380> trim<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.860> there<00:02:29.100> they

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
chrome trim up the trim on there they

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.750 
chrome trim up the trim on there they
just<00:02:30.180> had<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.330> cut<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.870> off<00:02:31.220> because<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.490> didn't

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
just had to cut it off because it didn't

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.620 
just had to cut it off because it didn't
match<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.890> you'll<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.340> patch<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.450> they

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
match so you'll see this patch that they

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.490 
match so you'll see this patch that they
have<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:36.900> made<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.600> he<00:02:39.600> didn't<00:02:39.840> want<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.170> tie

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
have all made and he didn't want to tie

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.380 
have all made and he didn't want to tie
into<00:02:40.740> this<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.250> wanted<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.700> kind<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:41.970> make<00:02:42.150> like

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
into this I wanted to kind of make like

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.020 
into this I wanted to kind of make like
that<00:02:42.630> if<00:02:43.410> you're<00:02:43.590> gonna<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.890> anything<00:02:44.190> extend

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
that if you're gonna do anything extend

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.420 
that if you're gonna do anything extend
it<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.600> little<00:02:45.900> mud<00:02:46.140> flap<00:02:46.530> blended<00:02:47.250> in

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it on like a little mud flap blended in

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.790 
it on like a little mud flap blended in
so<00:02:47.730> when<00:02:48.720> you're<00:02:48.840> patched<00:02:49.080> know<00:02:49.380> there's<00:02:49.740> a

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
so when you're patched know there's a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.480 
so when you're patched know there's a
throw<00:02:50.070> rubber<00:02:50.370> all<00:02:50.640> over<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> back<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.210> it

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
throw rubber all over the back of it

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.390 
throw rubber all over the back of it
quarter<00:02:53.490> panel<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:55.350> think<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> little<00:02:55.860> cool

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.479 

start<00:02:59.400> out<00:02:59.520> with<00:02:59.640> pressure<00:02:59.940> moving<00:03:01.459> yeah<00:03:02.459> I

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
start out with pressure moving yeah I

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.520 
start out with pressure moving yeah I
was<00:03:02.730> all<00:03:02.910> rotted<00:03:03.180> out<00:03:03.510> water<00:03:04.050> was<00:03:04.350> going

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
was all rotted out water was going

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.250 
was all rotted out water was going
inside<00:03:05.280> no<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.000> there's<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.239> patch<00:03:06.450> down<00:03:06.780> here

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
inside no so there's a patch down here

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.190 
inside no so there's a patch down here
patch<00:03:07.709> off<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.370> here<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.820> patch<00:03:09.090> here<00:03:09.630> and

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
patch off and here and a patch here and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.550 
patch off and here and a patch here and
it<00:03:10.290> ties<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.920> with<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:12.110> window<00:03:13.110> regulator<00:03:15.560> so

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
it ties in with the window regulator so

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.710 
it ties in with the window regulator so
it's<00:03:16.739> pretty<00:03:16.890> rusted<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.790> should<00:03:18.060> have<00:03:18.180> had<00:03:18.360> at

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
it's pretty rusted it should have had at

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.100 
it's pretty rusted it should have had at
least<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.500> outer<00:03:19.680> half<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:22.130> wheel<00:03:23.130> tub

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
least the outer half of the wheel tub

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.620 
least the outer half of the wheel tub
the<00:03:25.110> inner<00:03:25.290> wheel<00:03:25.620> mode<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.390> did<00:03:27.600> that

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
the inner wheel mode but if you did that

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.759 
the inner wheel mode but if you did that
then<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:28.860> all<00:03:29.300> rotted<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.540> us<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.500> by<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
then this is all rotted to us and by the

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.150 
then this is all rotted to us and by the
time<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.130> cut<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.550> all<00:03:32.760> up<00:03:33.000> might<00:03:33.420> as<00:03:33.540> well

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
time you cut this all up might as well

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.120 
time you cut this all up might as well
you<00:03:35.160> know<00:03:35.280> flare<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:36.690> bigger<00:03:36.900> wheels<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:40.130> do

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
you know flare it for bigger wheels I do

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.250 
you know flare it for bigger wheels I do
not<00:03:41.519> believe<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.150> using<00:03:42.630> these<00:03:42.780> kind<00:03:43.140> of

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
not believe in using these kind of

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.900 
not believe in using these kind of
shackles<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:44.340> does<00:03:44.640> not<00:03:44.820> look<00:03:45.510> very<00:03:46.910> high-tech

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
shackles it does not look very high-tech

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.110 
shackles it does not look very high-tech
at<00:03:48.120> all<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:49.320> fact<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.830> looks<00:03:50.040> really<00:03:50.550> bad<00:03:50.850> like

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
at all in fact it looks really bad like

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.870 
at all in fact it looks really bad like

get the right arch length you know
you're<00:03:58.280> gonna<00:03:58.400> need<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.730> longer<00:03:59.090> main<00:03:59.870> leaf

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
you're gonna need a longer main leaf

it's<00:04:23.690> why<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:23.930> know<00:04:24.170> like<00:04:24.350> ladder<00:04:24.800> bars<00:04:25.130> and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
it's why you know like ladder bars and

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.720 
it's why you know like ladder bars and

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
something that's like just putting a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.770 
something that's like just putting a

really thin metal and it's just like a

this all gets spot welded together then

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.130 
this all gets spot welded together then
it<00:06:27.320> makes<00:06:27.530> a<00:06:27.650> full<00:06:27.890> squared<00:06:28.690> channel<00:06:29.690> which

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
it makes a full squared channel which

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.830 
it makes a full squared channel which
would<00:06:30.320> make<00:06:30.500> it<00:06:30.680> rigid<00:06:30.890> but<00:06:31.880> this<00:06:32.150> part<00:06:32.510> is

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
would make it rigid but this part is

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.760 
would make it rigid but this part is
inherent<00:06:33.560> to<00:06:33.620> stiffen<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:35.690> suspension<00:06:36.560> where

the<00:06:36.950> shackle<00:06:37.490> is<00:06:37.610> going<00:06:37.760> to<00:06:37.820> be<00:06:37.940> bolting<00:06:38.480> up<00:06:38.630> so

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
the shackle is going to be bolting up so

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.440 
the shackle is going to be bolting up so
it's<00:06:39.050> kind<00:06:39.110> of<00:06:39.290> like<00:06:39.440> a<00:06:39.470> cantilever<00:06:40.270> like<00:06:41.270> I

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
it's kind of like a cantilever like I

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.700 
it's kind of like a cantilever like I
was<00:06:41.630> telling<00:06:41.870> you<00:06:41.990> about<00:06:42.080> putting<00:06:42.620> that

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.710 
was telling you about putting that
longer<00:06:43.040> shackle<00:06:43.820> on<00:06:43.910> here<00:06:44.240> it's<00:06:44.419> just<00:06:44.479> like

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
longer shackle on here it's just like

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.290 
longer shackle on here it's just like
really<00:06:45.290> torque<00:06:45.830> and<00:06:46.070> the<00:06:46.160> tail<00:06:46.790> end<00:06:47.090> of<00:06:47.240> your

really torque and the tail end of your

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.180 
really torque and the tail end of your
frame<00:06:48.190> that's<00:06:49.190> how<00:06:49.340> they<00:06:49.580> stiffen<00:06:50.330> this<00:06:50.510> up
