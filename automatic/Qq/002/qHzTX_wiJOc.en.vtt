00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.100 
and I grew up at the South stained end
and<00:01:24.550> so<00:01:24.820> if<00:01:24.910> I<00:01:25.060> ever<00:01:25.180> encroached<00:01:25.600> upon<00:01:25.780> the

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
northern end of the beach I'd get

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.130 
northern end of the beach I'd get
harassed<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.910> intimidated<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.690> threatened

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
harassed and intimidated and threatened

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.930 
harassed and intimidated and threatened
but<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:29.890> really<00:01:30.130> bred<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.580> lot<00:01:30.850> of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940

definitely changed in the style of it as
well<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:01.850> think<00:05:02.090> it's<00:05:02.389> become<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.660> more<00:05:02.930> feminine

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680

well I think it's become a more feminine
sport

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
but sometimes they still have to stand

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.900 
but sometimes they still have to stand
up<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.090> fight<00:05:17.300> for<00:05:17.600> their<00:05:17.720> rights<00:05:18.670> the<00:05:19.670> prize
