00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.830
 By the way, now every fifth oath is sold to Aldi 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.750
 Spin prices seem to prevail with the discounters and it means 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.779
 very bad times for the brewers 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.420
 If you knew that at 9live, the games are transparent and fair 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.630
 understandable so at least SID the transmitter that way 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.750
 you already know 9live is the station that officially nobody looks at but 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.449
 Last year, about 20 million people call 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.450
 and have played with mach fern sense because the programmer but if 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.240
 Let's take a closer look at something for fur puzzles puzzle us 9live 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.380
 could participate 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.730
 then it only shows 1 transparent very incomprehensible really seem 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.740
 to be very elastic concepts 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.780
 some ICE 3 9 broadcast live in July the supposedly simple task 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.020
 they all numbers 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.500
 This appeals to Paul Trost from the vicinity of Limburg the learned 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.200
 Accountant was head of accounting in one 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.430
 Midsize business numbers are its passion I have though 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.430
 Urs Hofer Bobo tried by area 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.969
 but I do not work 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.460
 b the result came 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.610
 I have Uta resolution 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.140
 viewed more on the video Gallus recorded 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.920
 and manageable and moreover could result in something far from mine 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.630
 Solutions way was none of the over 200 callers made also came 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.750
 9live solution 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.210
 of 6500 74 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.770
 The game ran for four hours no wonder apparently also Roman 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.940
 Numbers to be read backwards in the text even over line breaks 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.950
 away and in others 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.950
 for comfort an absurdity 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.940
 that in the whimsical methods when going ahead 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.850
 Percent the people 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.869
 Animate to make tires and hid him unfortunately just routine too 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.700
 still high cross cell 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.879
 Percent against which numbers do not contribute to the food solution 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.150
 So I think that already is no longer the fixed that already borders as 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.089
 illegal 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.690
 9live rip-off with riddles without recognizable solutions 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.269
 This opinion is also Ulrich Geiger from Berlin 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.769
 like Peter Trost, he failed a few months ago on a new live 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.159
 Puzzles and wondered about the strange resolution since busy 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.579
 he makes extensive use of the self-proclaimed transmitter 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.610
 Computer pictures of all play and compare the results with the 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.129
 Task if you do not change the backgrounds 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.399
 nasty methods is developed 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:46.579
 and tricks what to consider for something not funny it will be 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.059
 not transparent 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.459
 also rules we do not explain their distress and about it from one day to the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.379
 others changed today counts 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.059
 something like this is not missing 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.969
 In other games, there are different goals rules called for 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.639
 that the rules changed the rule that a game so others 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.439
 won and vice versa 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.029
 the audience in the foreground Dr 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.939
 ripped off 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.079
 Is it really true that 9live play more without apparent solutions 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.099
 earned money 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.539
 to investigate this record as the program of a broadcast week 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.589
 in total the over 60 hours of material 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.119
 cutouts 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.119
 more 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.519
 the formula 1 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.629
 Florian Klein stay then test us 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.980
 All of them actually none of the callers could use these supposedly simple ones 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.939
 played 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.299
 They left several hours 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.390
 Example of this riddle coming from the tenth of august they see all the animals like that 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.149
 is the simple question 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:47.599
 the supposed solution dubious 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.880
 SCN backwards he reads words about all the punctuation marks in the way like here 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.929
 at the IZA 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.979
 and tits 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.959
 Below in the text one finds after 9live interpretation 89 Tigerhai 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:10.180
 151 animals are not an animal +51 animals + 151 animals and also the word their total 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.569
 204 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.629
 and in addition to a team up, there are supposedly in addition to sixth 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.599
 no word on this goal way at the nine live resolution at 2 o'clock at night 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.499
 only a number is displayed 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:26.710
 today answer 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.830
 Example 2 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.900
 aired on the thirteenth eighth 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.890
 If you draw all the letters, the task is who the text and the 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.900
 Keyboard by counting only comes on 99 of the channels but presented after 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.940
 three hours of play mockingly a completely different result as can be 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.730
 stop 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.020
 Daimler ready 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.069
 that's because of course because of course, for example, in 3d who says 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.069
 that on 4 the 3d world has to see 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:55.919
 logical 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.339
 to the 99 come after 9live gusto still two a3 d-4d 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:04.550
 but then you are still at 143 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.949
 in the word 9live ten additional 9 l 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.180
 to give 50 more because the e stands for Roman 50th 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.949
 another tool is hiding here 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.520
 and since c4 Immisch wonders means in the word Schnappi allegedly still 100 kind too 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.520
 find a total of 103 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.490
 for me the solution is wrong 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.330
 because it's enough only teeth all pop star 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.150
 That's why the solution 3 0 3 is against their wrong 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.850
 it is the solution of 9live but not the solution agreed with the 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.860
 Question should be reached 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.240
 if the players really have such transparency and that as a normal one 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.999
 TV viewers can solve 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:55.909
 if they were not going to make those profits, hopefully they would not call them 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.300
 in the sense of 9live 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.839
 the self-proclaimed Kirsten in reality a turn away 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.159
 in the central Munich we want to ask why the games are like that 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.839
 intransparent and why the solutions are kept secret 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.589
 no answers in front of the camera the opinion only in writing one sees 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:17.309
 as an entertainment station the cells should be fun and continue to quote 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:20.659
 this includes the skill in solving and finding the 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.080
 prove a solution pathway 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.919
 for example, roman numbers or reading backwards are common 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.580
 Gimmicks you can find in every recipe 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.949
 but the sender may just keep on watching over 9live for 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.499
 the Bavarian state center for new media 

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:38.960
 here we play the excerpts 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.509
 Everything is correct everyone has to know if on the matchdays 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.800
 it certainly makes sense for me to go back to the race 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.419
 to be brought 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.509
 or because they do not matter 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.430
 I think so 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.370
 Accountant Paul Trost could not solve the calculation until today 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.529
 under Plusminus could not help him despite detailed research 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:03.100
 9live he has become from a television with the band 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.000
 Stick again in magazines 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.530
 because there he finds him the transparent solution
