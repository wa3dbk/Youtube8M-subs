kit is basically just a build of the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
kit is basically just a build of the
PlayStation<00:01:38.880> 4<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.210> developers<00:01:39.840> were<00:01:39.960> used

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
PlayStation 4 which developers were used

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
PlayStation 4 which developers were used
to<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.860> games<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.729> be

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
to make the games which would be

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
to make the games which would be
released<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.360> launch<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.990> PlayStation<00:01:43.680> 4

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
released on launch for the PlayStation 4

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
released on launch for the PlayStation 4
and<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> controller<00:01:45.119> offers<00:01:45.360> lots<00:01:45.899> of

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and but the controller offers lots of

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
and but the controller offers lots of
information<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.820> use<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
information which we can actually use to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.719 
information which we can actually use to
link<00:01:48.390> back<00:01:48.659> into<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.259> console<00:01:49.710> itself<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.490> if

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
link back into the console itself so if

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.280 
link back into the console itself so if
we<00:01:51.000> actually<00:01:51.270> break<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> control<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
we actually break down the control and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.410 
we actually break down the control and
first<00:01:52.530> we'll<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> look<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.820> bottom<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
first we'll have a look at the bottom of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
first we'll have a look at the bottom of
it<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> there's<00:01:55.680> actually<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
it we can see that there's actually a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.940 
it we can see that there's actually a
headphone<00:01:56.700> port<00:01:57.119> which<00:01:57.659> links<00:01:58.079> straight<00:01:58.500> into

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
headphone port which links straight into

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.709 
headphone port which links straight into
the<00:01:59.040> bottom<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> controller<00:02:00.270> now<00:02:00.509> this

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.520 
the controller could warn you of that
through<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.480> speaker<00:03:09.870> built<00:03:10.080> into<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
through the speaker built into the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.410 
through the speaker built into the
controller<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:11.550> we<00:03:11.610> look<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.940> top<00:03:12.209> of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
controller and if we look at the top of

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.449 
controller and if we look at the top of
the<00:03:12.600> controller<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.230> see<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.410> blue<00:03:13.890> sensor

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
the controller we can see a blue sensor

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.490 
the controller we can see a blue sensor
bar<00:03:14.610> which<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.060> actually<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.810> equivalent<00:03:16.290> of

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
bar which is actually the equivalent of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500 
bar which is actually the equivalent of
the<00:03:16.680> PlayStation<00:03:17.310> Move<00:03:17.580> bar<00:03:18.000> or<00:03:18.420> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the PlayStation Move bar or the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.449 
the PlayStation Move bar or the
PlayStation<00:03:19.110> Move<00:03:19.140> sensor<00:03:19.830> which<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.160> have

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
PlayStation Move sensor which we have

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.300 
PlayStation Move sensor which we have
seen<00:03:20.760> on<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.540> ps3<00:03:22.110> which<00:03:22.290> we<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.920> here

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
seen on the ps3 which we can see here

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
seen on the ps3 which we can see here
which<00:03:23.760> means<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.209> controller<00:03:24.780> actually

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
which means this controller actually

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.650 
which means this controller actually
incorporates<00:03:26.010> absolutely<00:03:26.730> everything<00:03:27.390> and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
incorporates absolutely everything and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.840 
incorporates absolutely everything and
if<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:27.989> want<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.560> move<00:03:28.830> this<00:03:29.070> control<00:03:29.280> around

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
if you want to move this control around

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.360 
if you want to move this control around
aiming<00:03:30.450> at<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.720> screen<00:03:31.049> shake<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:32.100> will<00:03:32.280> be

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
aiming at the screen shake it it will be

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.820 
aiming at the screen shake it it will be
recognized<00:03:32.880> just<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.930> same<00:03:34.200> fashion<00:03:34.590> that

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
recognized just in the same fashion that

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.789 
recognized just in the same fashion that
the<00:03:35.280> PlayStation<00:03:35.580> 3<00:03:36.390> move<00:03:36.810> would<00:03:37.320> recognize

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
the PlayStation 3 move would recognize

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.229 
the PlayStation 3 move would recognize
those<00:03:38.040> movements<00:03:38.340> as<00:03:38.700> well<00:03:38.730> which<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.150> very

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
those movements as well which is very

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.660 
those movements as well which is very
exciting<00:03:39.900> very<00:03:40.110> cool<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:41.010> controller<00:03:41.549> is

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
exciting very cool this controller is

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.699 
exciting very cool this controller is
definitely<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> massive<00:03:42.600> upgrade<00:03:43.290> from<00:03:43.530> the

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
definitely a massive upgrade from the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.190 
definitely a massive upgrade from the
ps3<00:03:44.040> version<00:03:44.430> in<00:03:45.000> terms<00:03:45.570> of<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> actual

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
ps3 version in terms of the actual

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.140 
ps3 version in terms of the actual
physical<00:03:46.470> aspects<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.430> ps4<00:03:47.880> controller

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
physical aspects of the ps4 controller

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.300 
physical aspects of the ps4 controller
and<00:03:48.750> what<00:03:48.900> has<00:03:49.080> changed<00:03:49.440> it's<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.010> little<00:03:50.190> bit

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
and what has changed it's a little bit

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.610 
and what has changed it's a little bit
chunkier<00:03:50.880> which<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.570> welcome<00:03:52.019> change<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.560> a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
chunkier which is a welcome change and a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.080 
chunkier which is a welcome change and a
lot<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.799> people<00:03:53.100> thought<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.610> ps3

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
lot of people thought that the ps3

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.759 
lot of people thought that the ps3
controller<00:03:54.510> was<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.750> little<00:03:54.959> bit<00:03:55.049> too<00:03:55.290> small

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
controller was a little bit too small

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.890 
controller was a little bit too small
the<00:03:56.190> analog<00:03:56.489> sticks<00:03:56.760> are<00:03:56.910> still<00:03:57.209> domed<00:03:57.570> but

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
the analog sticks are still domed but

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.750 
the analog sticks are still domed but
they<00:03:57.989> now<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.500> sort<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:58.890> outer<00:03:59.160> edge<00:03:59.489> to

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
they now have a sort of outer edge to

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.800 
they now have a sort of outer edge to
them<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.060> can<00:04:00.150> get<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.299> little<00:04:00.540> bit<00:04:00.660> more

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
them so you can get a little bit more

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.280 
them so you can get a little bit more
grip<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.920> r2<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.760> l2<00:04:03.060> trigger<00:04:03.870> buttons

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
grip and the r2 and l2 trigger buttons

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.320 
grip and the r2 and l2 trigger buttons
are<00:04:04.470> more<00:04:04.920> trigger<00:04:05.190> like<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.940> similar

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
are more trigger like in a similar

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.840 
are more trigger like in a similar
fashion<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.230> Xbox<00:04:07.470> 360<00:04:08.250> trigger<00:04:08.459> buttons

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
fashion to the Xbox 360 trigger buttons

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.569 
fashion to the Xbox 360 trigger buttons
rather<00:04:09.420> than<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> old<00:04:10.019> ps3<00:04:10.860> trigger<00:04:11.220> buttons

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
rather than the old ps3 trigger buttons

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.580 
rather than the old ps3 trigger buttons
which<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.150> again<00:04:12.360> very<00:04:12.630> cool<00:04:12.900> for<00:04:13.140> games<00:04:13.320> like

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
which is again very cool for games like

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.199 
which is again very cool for games like
who<00:04:13.769> will<00:04:13.920> do<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.280> your<00:04:14.400> shooting<00:04:14.790> games<00:04:15.030> where

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
who will do to your shooting games where

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.729 
who will do to your shooting games where
you<00:04:15.299> like<00:04:15.450> those<00:04:15.690> sort<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.079> trigger<00:04:16.350> buttons

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
you like those sort of trigger buttons

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.099 
you like those sort of trigger buttons
so<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:17.430> very<00:04:17.700> cool<00:04:18.030> as<00:04:18.329> well<00:04:18.690> now<00:04:18.810> all<00:04:18.930> this
