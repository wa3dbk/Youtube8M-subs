00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
at one flag most of the time there is a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.310 
at one flag most of the time there is a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
out of that area to get to the other

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.819 
out of that area to get to the other
parts<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> map<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.170> want<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.680> is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
parts of the map now we want to do is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.440 
parts of the map now we want to do is
you<00:02:04.920> want<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.100> split<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.549> team<00:02:05.790> into<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you want to split your team into the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.999 
you want to split your team into the
different<00:02:06.810> areas<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.560> them<00:02:07.740> guard

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
different areas and have them guard

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.770 
different areas and have them guard
those<00:02:08.190> areas<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> enemy

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
those areas that way when the enemy

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
those areas that way when the enemy
tries<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.229> run<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.619> their<00:02:10.890> spawn<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.400> can

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
tries to run out of their spawn you can

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.250 
tries to run out of their spawn you can
just<00:02:11.819> keep<00:02:12.030> killing<00:02:12.420> them<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.720> they<00:02:12.870> run<00:02:13.050> out

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
just keep killing them as they run out

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.290 
just keep killing them as they run out
and<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.830> works<00:02:14.010> perfectly<00:02:14.459> because<00:02:15.060> most

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and it just works perfectly because most

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.339 
and it just works perfectly because most
of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> time<00:02:15.629> you're<00:02:15.780> not<00:02:15.959> going<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> die

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
of the time you're not going to die

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.449 
of the time you're not going to die
because<00:02:16.560> they're<00:02:16.800> just<00:02:16.980> running<00:02:17.099> out<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
because they're just running out of the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.309 
because they're just running out of the
spawn<00:02:17.670> trying<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.180> get<00:02:18.300> out<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:18.810> they're

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
spawn trying to get out of there they're

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.320 
spawn trying to get out of there they're
just<00:02:19.590> running<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> headless<00:02:20.610> chicken<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
just running like a headless chicken and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.490 
just running like a headless chicken and
there's<00:02:21.420> trying<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:21.870> out<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.319> easily

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
there's trying to get out you can easily

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
there's trying to get out you can easily
pick<00:02:22.769> them<00:02:22.890> off<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.790> works<00:02:24.030> perfectly<00:02:24.330> if

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
pick them off and it works perfectly if

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.259 
pick them off and it works perfectly if
