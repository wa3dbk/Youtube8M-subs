this was to embed ourselves within the
community<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:13.430> we<00:03:13.459> built<00:03:13.819> a<00:03:14.000> floating<00:03:14.480> house

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
community so we built a floating house

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.130 
community so we built a floating house
that<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.410> call<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.739> CI<00:03:15.980> floating<00:03:16.519> office<00:03:17.140> that

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
that we call the CI floating office that

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.960 
that we call the CI floating office that
way<00:03:18.350> there<00:03:18.530> was<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.680> constant<00:03:19.310> day<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.790> night

fish farms we showed them how to do a

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.339 
fish farms we showed them how to do a
proper<00:05:15.970> sustainable<00:05:16.970> fish<00:05:17.210> farm<00:05:17.539> in<00:05:18.050> their

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
proper sustainable fish farm in their

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.820 
proper sustainable fish farm in their
house<00:05:18.669> how<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:19.729> raise<00:05:20.660> pigs<00:05:21.050> that<00:05:21.530> they<00:05:21.650> could

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
house how to raise pigs that they could

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.089 
house how to raise pigs that they could
sell<00:05:22.130> and<00:05:22.490> then<00:05:22.760> save<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.210> money<00:05:23.419> and

sell and then save the money and

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.610 
sell and then save the money and
obviously<00:05:25.099> saving<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.789> money<00:05:25.940> was<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.990> very

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
obviously saving the money was a very

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.270 
obviously saving the money was a very
big<00:05:29.139> opportunity<00:05:30.139> for<00:05:30.169> the<00:05:30.380> villagers<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:31.099> not

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
big opportunity for the villagers to not

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.920 
big opportunity for the villagers to not
have<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.669> depend<00:05:31.820> on<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.300> loan<00:05:32.510> sharks

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
have to depend on the loan sharks

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.790 
have to depend on the loan sharks
anymore<00:05:33.440> they<00:05:34.130> created<00:05:34.520> a<00:05:35.500> savings<00:05:36.500> group

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
anymore they created a savings group

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.390 
anymore they created a savings group
where<00:05:37.700> local<00:05:38.360> people<00:05:38.389> could<00:05:38.990> pull<00:05:39.380> in<00:05:39.620> amounts

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
where local people could pull in amounts

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.300 
where local people could pull in amounts
of<00:05:40.490> money<00:05:40.810> see<00:05:41.810> I<00:05:41.840> gave<00:05:42.320> him<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.650> idea<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:43.190> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
of money see I gave him the idea and the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.550 
of money see I gave him the idea and the
basic<00:05:43.729> concept<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:44.539> the<00:05:44.750> training<00:05:45.050> on<00:05:45.320> how<00:05:45.349> to

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
basic concept and the training on how to

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.800 
basic concept and the training on how to
put<00:05:45.889> this<00:05:46.010> together<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.639> with<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.599> they

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
put this together and with that they

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.170 
put this together and with that they
could<00:05:47.990> offer<00:05:48.200> each<00:05:48.469> other<00:05:48.650> loans<00:05:49.060> that<00:05:50.060> they

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
could offer each other loans that they

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.940 
could offer each other loans that they
could<00:05:50.330> pay<00:05:50.510> off<00:05:50.690> at<00:05:50.900> lower<00:05:51.110> interest<00:05:51.409> rates

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
could pay off at lower interest rates

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.709 
could pay off at lower interest rates
but<00:05:52.280> everything<00:05:52.820> was<00:05:52.969> controlled

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
but everything was controlled

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.409 
but everything was controlled
by<00:05:54.249> themselves<00:05:55.249> but<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.879> was<00:05:55.909> almost<00:05:56.179> like

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
by themselves but it was almost like

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.850 
by themselves but it was almost like

apart<00:06:00.860> from<00:06:01.149> overfishing<00:06:02.289> are<00:06:03.289> there<00:06:03.559> any

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:03.739 
apart from overfishing are there any

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
certainly overfishing is a big one but

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:15.759 
certainly overfishing is a big one but
we<00:06:13.519> know<00:06:13.639> that<00:06:13.669> the<00:06:14.479> flooded<00:06:14.929> forest<00:06:15.349> and<00:06:15.529> tol
