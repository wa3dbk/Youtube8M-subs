two-finger swipe will shrink that and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.060 
two-finger swipe will shrink that and
expand<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.020> works<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.350> Gmail<00:01:25.740> other

by pressing that button so that's new
jelly<00:01:31.320> bean<00:01:31.560> obviously<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> hit<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> X

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
jelly bean obviously you can hit the X

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.580 
jelly bean obviously you can hit the X
and<00:01:33.360> that'll<00:01:33.570> wipe<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.200> them<00:01:34.320> out<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.530> you
