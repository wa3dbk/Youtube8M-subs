00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:15.209
 the streak 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.610
 and so what's up, the video of what else? 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.230
 one of the series on the bottom of the chest and today I 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.940
 I chose another platform that does not 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.550
 super nintendo chose playstation one 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.830
 console that has tagged many and many have 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.890
 absolute certainty was very striking 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.080
 console and the game chosen is for this 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.120
 video was the game creche 2 because 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.190
 chose the game creche 2 that was one of the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 first there that I had more contact 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.510
 it's still in the playstation 1 era in the era 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.269
 playstation was one of the first ones I 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.489
 I had contact I saw the cd box 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.620
 with that clash art he was a child in the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 time, so I got a lot of attention and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.239
 I imagined time was worthy of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.789
 very 2d graphics cartridge when i saw 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.280
 I saw that 3d box. 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.620
 was drawing behind that graphic art a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.870
 game in 100 cd for the season was a 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.300
 novelty was a technological breakthrough 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.219
 great 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.829
 totally new dimension at the time the 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:10.920
 games in the 3d dimension 3d the games 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.290
 3d non 3d visual that exists nowadays 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.680
 but in three dimensions you could not 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.090
 only walk on the side just as she 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.399
 the platform games you can 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.200
 explore the maps further and was one of 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.659
 former also I had contact was 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.850
 the day care game called me more attention 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.950
 a game that really struck me a lot 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.719
 because as the first contact says there was 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.030
 only the box had not even known 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.609
 no one who had this console at the time 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.390
 It was when I was a child I did not have the money to 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.890
 purchase 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.659
 I kept imagining I kept imagining 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.710
 had this access that we have today 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.719
 on the internet and to our imagination and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.579
 until one day my cousin bought a 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.250
 playstation he had a super that 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.350
 also sold to buy a playstation and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.539
 opened the doors for me too because I 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.700
 I was going to his house just to watch him play. 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.409
 practically he idea that fury 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.929
 that moving thing would not let me 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.130
 I practically played I got two - he 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.100
 already took my hand told 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.539
 practically but it was good because it was kind 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.879
 the beginning of my life the fear of 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.129
 first contact I had with the 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.880
 playstation was with this game and when 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.970
 I saw the graph of him I would rather I stayed 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.980
 It was one thing to know that it was not 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.280
 I can not even explain with words to you. 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.810
 but it was a shock I would say even because 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.540
 for who was accustomed to graphics 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.020
 2d of super nintendo graphics so one 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.480
 certain limitation of perspective you are 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.640
 played this way in this 3d universe 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.940
 this different thing from this new universe 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.310
 You feel like exploring and ours was 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.990
 awesome was a shock even me 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.230
 I even dreamed of this game a 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.540
 time in the beginning when I say you have 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.700
 this contact with the playstation and then 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.190
 from him came so many other more quest 2 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.830
 It marked me a lot for it because I had 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.290
 this beginning of this contact with this age 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.360
 32-bit playstation 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.820
 long after I went to my 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.110
 playstation is this time I'm not 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.990
 I saw the console for the first time 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:11.060
 playstation was in 1997 if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.280
 9796 start 97 every time I had 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.950
 contact him and when I hear 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.620
 I started my life and on Playstation 1 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.050
 with the game creche 2 that really scored 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.640
 then came the 3d trio because 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.190
 possibly meet the first 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.850
 crash that left me all the other games 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.800
 like this 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.770
 an interesting thing that clash him 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.020
 it was for a while mascot the sony the case 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.210
 the sony the videogames division is not it 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.430
 It was also shore of the naughty dog ​​who 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.650
 the producer since he does not know 9.1 is 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.240
 No one knows but she is the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.040
 charted creator is from there breakthrough 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.230
 finally these great games of today in 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.440
 day but she started practically with 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.790
 This game or playstation 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.890
 If I'm wrong, I'm sorry but the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.590
 information that I have but much 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.870
 time it was her mascot was symbol 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.790
 of playstation I remember that came is a 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.870
 cd demonstration of the original playstation 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.360
 that's where the clash game came from and our 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.890
 I had been stamped in the box in the art of 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.620
 playstation console box with one 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.830
 wine day care 22 the bandicoot crash in the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.440
 character case and scored a lot this 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.299
 game really sure that many there 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 remember this game much play and 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.610
 spend a late afternoon baron playing 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.800
 This game is for sure. 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.259
 it was striking that for each one of a 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.900
 different way but for me the way 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.819
 that marked me was that was for the first 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.800
 contact of have had with the playstation 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.319
 I do not know through this game 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.530
 I played a lot after I finished every game. 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.870
 in several different times and numbers 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.300
 see this game and I felt a certain longing 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.520
 with this possibility of the emulator to 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.979
 people can relive the good times of 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.400
 this is a gift even you 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.169
 Can you get all these 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.610
 games that will fall in this life mark 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.060
 our childhood and play it again in the 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.889
 computer through the emulator and finally 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.719
 who has the console is a person who 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.099
 consider lucky you have a console 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:10.090
 still working 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.310
 because it really is a piece of the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.199
 life even a bigger piece is a 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.629
 memories are very good memories with 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.169
 sure every console has for each one 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.490
 It's no different for me, but it 's 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.860
 beginning to this playstation series 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.379
 also in the background of the first game chest 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.289
 here is the two bandicoot crash against e 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:31.210
 other videos also continue behind 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.250
 also from super nintendo various games and 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.750
 surprising the market would also like to 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.490
 bring but only to give a varied 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.860
 show you that it's not just 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.169
 of the cartridge consoles that I 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.050
 I remember a lot too and people talk 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.150
 so the elephant boyle does not like the 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.279
 your list does not strip the sony was part of 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.379
 my life was certainly part of life 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.569
 a lot of people are like many people 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.699

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.589
 good games and good times here
