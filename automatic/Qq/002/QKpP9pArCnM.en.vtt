00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.639
 Welcome to a new cooperative mode 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.380
 we're going to dedicate it to 64 black 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.590
 flag that has been announced at last 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.680
 officially and we have invited 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.110
 víctor yesterday to editor of Spain 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.080
 we invited you because you were the 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.520
 last week 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.619
 watching the presentation and seeing everything 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.359
 this is half filtered before the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.279
 weekend everything was a bit chaotic 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.449
 all these encounters we are there 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.920
 we had finished they came out 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.110
 images of kotaku while you were there 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 that's it and when I was there we were 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.680
 also at the hotel and they told us 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 So here we have an image of the map and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.549
 of the post post they were going to declare 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.010
 with reservations with reservations is 

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:45.449
 so good with that leak of kotaku 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 we already knew what the game was called 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.350
 We knew it was pirates and good and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
 this weekend was also filtered 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.589
 the trailer has been entering us has gone 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.420
 little by little going out yesterday he left 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.680
 images too but good a viewer 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.200
 he has also been playing with those 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.910
 leaks 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.840
 and there are two more or less leaning 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.129
 filtering something good he supported 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.990
 officially the cover that was sold 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.730
 peak Wednesday but it is a good figure 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.960
 for the variety of adapting to that 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.680
 filtering effect and I'm basically 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.510
 inevitable look 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.940
 Hey, this has come out, I'm going to 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.720
 officially the game the cover and already 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.920
 be but we have no inscribed wishes 4 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.170
 for next October 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.460
 we already know that it's about pirates and well you 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.050
 that you were there, you were 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.400
 division people was explaining the 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.470
 game tell us a little bit about you 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.020
 will teach we start with the trailer this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.850
 it starts that everything goes black starting at 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.380
 talk a bit about the protagonist who is 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.720
 edward quinn uy 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:42.650
 the grandfather of secret conduct 3 yes because 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:44.270
 they have taken the line of succession but good 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.979
 Well, it's a bit strange because always 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.320
 you have written they had been superior or 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.770
 always be forward or backward 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.360
 well we also talked a little was almost 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.130
 inevitable that they did a video game of 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.690
 pirates with that reef they had from the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.550
 naval battle is as soon as they made the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.200
 peak of the writers' first boat 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.600
 they said 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.810
 that you have to take it out in an entire game 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.780
 for 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.899
 to start a little good 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.580
 tell us a little bit is a murderer who is 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.630
 a pirate schools a bit how it's going to be 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.300
 the gameplay how to do a little 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.099
 Alhambra of playing that we print little 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.360
 they showed imagine showing a video 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.000
 that is not seen here has not yet been seen 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.819
 so yes you see scenes of flu and 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.700
 but very little comes out is the 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.900
 3g mechanics but you will have things 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.730
 new 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.530
 for example for the first time in the saga 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.410
 we will be able to dive underwater 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.950
 nothing is interesting to look for treasures 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.069
 sunken ships we will be able to go 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.260
 in search of treasures down there and going to 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.180
 be a completely open environment 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.610
 it's going to be a more open open world 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.099
 even that three already looked something but in 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.690
 I know this is going to be a moment 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.150
 frame is going to be your core series out there 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.500
 doing others you will move by all 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.380
 seas you will be able to attack any ship 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.450
 that you see and if exactly when 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.120
 clearly saturn there and you're exposed to 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.500
 that until then nothing in the mechanics 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.130
 battle 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.470
 it will be very similar to 3 with cannons with 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.130
 the arms of the ships but if the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.020
 boarding the boarding 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.730
 you can not that it can serve you and there 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.100
 I will not throw all the option 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.510
 to the trip is to inscribe the person a 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:28.700
 person on the side of a ship in the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.800
 boat the boarding sails is very good 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.120
 and they have also included what we 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.090
 counted if we counted in the article that 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.920
 has published in ign are going to include a 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.959
 bunch of real famous pirates if 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.120
 let's see the black woman especially 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.140
 most legendary plant the one that most 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.510
 know we have panic jacques and 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.220
 we know because he is the one who created the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.770
 typical flag with the skull and the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.560
 he wrote is justice then also 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.270
 we have to put some girls that magón and 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.690
 the pirates that the participant does not 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.070
 I knew but then it seems that it has been 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.020
 known that signed and yes that is more the 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.290
 silvers that good because he gave himself a 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.000
 one hundred with chants jack 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.510
 and a very strange story and that 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.750
 final 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.409
 I called for piracy and for them 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.290
 they had to flee and returned to the sea and 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.030
 just as the pirates had a 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.270
 curse so decided that the girls in 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.190
 a boat could not win the fate of 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.660
 be called strong that is because she is 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.590
 dressed as a man 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:35.240
 and a part would be good because we have a 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.140
 I do not know if they told you any detail 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.190
 more that they did not tell us much more games 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.190
 start this area in 2011 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:54.279
 388 development team eight studies 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.279
 in the game good 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.240
 of what we have talked about the sea also 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.770
 has logic understands typical has 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:09.159
 written in places that are three 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.159
 cities that would be a bit 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.050
 that is going to be a little bit more until 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.090
 percent water - which sea 40 percent of 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.129
 ground war so we will continue 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.770
 having continue we will continue to have the 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:24.139
 typical parkour yes I think I think 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.440
 stuck the roofs like this always but I 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.270
 I think you are eliminating the issue this 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.919
 use 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.639
 but is evolving the pleasing of 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.800
 all ways 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.190
 Well, very good looking, it has very 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.159
 good looking I was not very fan of 3 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.840
 not exactly an officer of 3 on 4 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.940
 this increase what they have shown 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.229
 it seems that the payroll that also touched 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.270
 better than in three there's even little 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.210
 I particularly like the pirates 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.460
 more thrown they have something have something that 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.599
 it draws our attention and in fact there 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.690
 A lot of video game tradition 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.590
 pirates that we liked a lot 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.389
 well, his vision will follow us 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.340
 counting things go little by little from 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.870
 here to October releasing small 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.169
 because in information surely so 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.169
 we can 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.680
 little by little showing good since 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.229
 we have height from here to October 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.760
 we will continue talking about up to 64 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.310
 thank you very much victor for coming to 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.550
 tell us logic and you will come another day 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.410
 surely to a cooperative way many 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.430
 thank you all and remember you 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.600
 that you can see all the videos in 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.840
