 and in this period is without authorization 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 to run the idea is to act in two 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.420
 monitoring the fronts remains aa 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.850
 instruments in the resolution of the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.040
 instruments that instrumentalize the agents 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.540
 inspection for the identification of

 driving is irregular and for 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.579
 other side to this process in the concession 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.049
 given the ability it avoids is to enable 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.670
 people who are not fully 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.290
 prepared for this 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.329
 the driver who uses some of the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.909

 the new rule begins to apply in the second 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.500
 next year's semester another step 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.520
 we are giving in the acceleration of change 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.259
 it's really just this behavior 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.259
