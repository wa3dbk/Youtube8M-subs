00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.660
 here are the fees youcef reguigui this 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.370
 lack and how are you young 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.870
 serve to what today are found 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.420
 so for a small video capture of 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.580
 flag on the express map I was in 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.710
 darkness company grisy carnival 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.540
 off charges sir code you go 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.100
 avenge adopted a little I want you 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.900
 explain how to adopt techniques 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.950
 in flag catch knowing that this is 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.900
 a game mode that was a bit of 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.820
 black holes petitions I noticed you 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.280
 go understand why so gone in 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.649
 did the capio really do not really 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.820
 a decerto mode at the base a mode 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.720
 competitive but I noticed that on 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.940
 black to the needs of guys who are 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.750
 fuck a little bit it's rare when we 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.340
 falls like teams 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.390
 so it's rather advantageous for your 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.160
 ratio of victories you assured 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.989
 eat a ratio of 12 1 catching flag 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.480
 for 200 wins me it's still 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.559
 it is abused especially that you play in 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.390
 team plus it allows you to 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.339
 work your team technique and 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.049
 your techniques here that allows you in 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.290
 talking to you really is 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.820
 it's really enjoyable to perform a 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.650
 do I strongly advise you 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.180
 otherwise you will see that at the level of 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.720
 kills that's because he's the most 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.880
 extraordinary 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.190
 knowing that what we do is 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.229
 that I have to death the goal in general 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 people make man because we 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.420
 has already fallen when teams and 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.070
 general they do not care a little declined 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.770
 what he's looking for is rather the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.090
 victories a bit like us so you 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.229
 go see that at the thighs and 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.939
 not what is the most extraordinary 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.640
 but only served you will see I have 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.250
 chained a nice series where I'm not dying 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.159
 away from tumors by the party ends 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.100
 rather not far from becoming nuclear 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.710
 it sucked me a bit so we are 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.240
 this period for that I explain to you 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.369
 a bit so how is a party going 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.590
 catching flag i can learn to 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.150
 some people but oh well we're going 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.409
 discuss anyway so some 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.290
 flags takes place in three rounds 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.689
 so there's a drama at the end of the round with 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.259
 so three catches took a step 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.270
 very complex 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.340
 so in fact the you have to take the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.329
 enemy flag to bring up your flag 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.799
 so you already see that the first 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.239
 sleeve went very very fast 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.500
 it's five-minute games that I 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.880
 took the exposed flag 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.420
 for a very short time see I did 5 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.310
 he is 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.680
 first inning with two shots 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.390
 only then as I explained to you 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.730
 liquids are really not very 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.000
 important the goal is to play the goal 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.010
 German 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.900
 so you'll see that I'm going 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.849
 chain a beautiful series now where 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.800
 everything will be chained so as soon as he 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.810
 would I advise you so for 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.690
 me how to say a wrestling 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.100
 flag there is each one has his roles so 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.989
 it's a piece of advice that I give do not leave 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.610
 not to the adventurous 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.319
 olivier at lala com debauchery serves her 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.470
 nothing at all the goal is to have 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.239
 really a strategy to address so in 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.709
 makes you green so it's 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.819
 people in general who play rifle 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.769
 assault that stays at the back which 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.880
 covers the maximum flag right there you 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.110
 see we but who do not care a 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.000
 little what they were against us there 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.769
 are we then it goes costs says 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.670
 sorry for this moment but frankly 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.580
 they do not care a bit see 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.260
 he falls into the building so and so has 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.549
 I had to myself I'm even I play in sng 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.720
 so Saturday what it is that is 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.970
 the person who is going to look for flags 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.400
 or who covers the flag bearers 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.500
 so to fuck me I do not play video 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.840
 which would be that at least in June we do not 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.890
 can play copyrights but there this 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.060
 is not the goal because I want 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.609
 explain why district groups 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.650
 strictly serves only slab 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.720
 because sleeves already are very 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.980
 fast and it was time to 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.450
 reappearance of chords you will die 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.700
 to the internee general repair this 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.160
 second part you will have cuts of 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.170
 hunt about 30 seconds kill you at 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.400
 the three four and a half to defended the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.500
 you're not going to do a lot 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.540
 of kiel with your focus groups 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.950
 you really know today what have we 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.310
 we played with little ones who would be 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.950
 kind drones not simple lightning and 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.359
 the stamps of the bankers trek tour l1 the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.709
 guardian for the backs so that's 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.870
 good for those who run the flag that 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.370
 allows to cover up flags and 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.680
 for women I played with a hymn 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.430
 because she says she's really a tool 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.989
 indispensable to become smg because 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.310
 when you have fine circus arts 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.950
 in august there are really good this 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.049
 that happened to us we won a lot 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.220
 of time because well we have a good 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.569
 level but is not huge in addition 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.550
 currently he is doing 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.840
 so a roster decerto 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.220
 because I do have some of the 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 matins who wish to make a roster 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.580
 returns myself I'm hungry I emptied 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.660
 especially so modern times and I can you 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.370
 ensure that when you have a sensor 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.810
 flags and on a mode 1 3 it played at 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.640
 my goal there was a lot of 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.989
 mail teams currently on black ops 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.850
 people do not care a little bit what they 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.480
 look for and who the death because 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.070
 the objects cifit and not but the blow of 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.060
 handle very trash tires and so of the 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.800
 blow they are looking for more tequila months 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.390
 charlie chaplin flag in general when 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.160
 you fall like steam that pretty 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.620
 complex of women the phone call so 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.850
 here is the pghm vast series to death and there 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.590
 I will speak to you my language of sports 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.260
 so the cap wav flags 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.000
 are really my can but can of 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.620
 life you will understand 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.390
 parma on night if you do the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.830
 mine of the capture flag on note 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.000
 you'll understand that it's really 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.100
 shit for those who do not think 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.560
 they abhor now I'm 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.850
 I do not hide an ounce when struck to death 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.920
 to say that both sides are not 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.690
 complicated in general so you 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.430
 two topics that will go camping at their 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.200
 flag like that it avoids them getting 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.130
 then tax install is actually what 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.970
 is going to happen what will they be doing to 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.350
 each end 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.640
 so if you are really good 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.350
 smart you put two more 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.460
 people on the other side and both 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.410
 other guys but what do they do 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.180
 they make clear and on our times 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.500
 that's what happens to say that the 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.300
 problem is that if you did not take 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.410
 there the problem happens is that 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.150
 it's you who will make this point 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.230
 to hit and from there it's impossible to 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.550
 get out ten points I can assure you 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.960
 body i will try to show you 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.290
 later in another video where I 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.150
 am going to perform a technique like that 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.970
 who is really well disgusting I 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.190
 can you assure it but these voices there to 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.780
 the base there we do not pose the flag sent 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.919
 because there I told them go 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.050
 did not put the flag I'm inserted 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.419
 nuclear with me will have me I had to 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.370
 to make a kilo max I do not want me 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.870
 remember I'm making a kill so I said 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.669
 the guys did not pose flag it serves 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.530
 for nothing I 'm going to chain the team on 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.060
 believe my allies and ben that is 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.140
 he wants to have fun making kills 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.419
 so I lost it I lost 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.820
 really enormously the clip is performed 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.370
 manu fuck are a little yes 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.340
 the relentless shon is really I was 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.810
 disgusted he remains a minute 25 and the 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.760
 problem is that the enemies redeem 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.070
 you see the big worry makes it a 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.760
 hood scoundrel flag that's at 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.350
 to say that the guys 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.810
 in general when you start their 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.130
 ask two flags sarah leave and the 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.930
 worst is when you notice the 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.940
 team and the guys you football and two 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.490
 flags three flags you take the 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.749
 first victory but 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.710
 and here it's a player it's really a 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.870
 dog times we end up in 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.249
 parties is a player in front what is it 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.810
 a young the problem is that the player 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:28.099
 all by itself what is happening in the 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.740
 kind of alone this fact this punk is a man 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.529
 by us and it becomes the friend really a 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.139
 job for lille so this is louis done to 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:38.389
 24.0 I say to myself go meresse 40 seconds 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.699
 hurry up you have a way to do it 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.779
 the problem is that the guys and 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.120
 joyner but the problem is that a 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:45.949
 tender appearance 17 seconds in the 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.770
 antilles to me to me 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.509
 so usually see copying 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.639
 flag I do not perform as much as they do 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.139
 saw brigitte at 22 anyway 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.999
 it was that he had the flag so he 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.169
 could do to touch and knowing 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.060
 that he chained the series to death because 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.529
 that I explain to you why in capture 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.509
 when you take the freight the same 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:04.039
 principle domination or demolition 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.569
 that when you kill an enemy next door 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.249
 of a goal you take more points 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.770
 that if you do not have the goal then 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:10.879
 filled him up with people for 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.279
 you if you really want to perform 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.689
 the series king takes the flag go with 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.279
 a report and make kilometers the 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:17.749
 skin like savoring around 100 

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.110
 points here we come to the end of the 

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:20.360
 gameplay 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.219
 see at at 25 0 I stop match and the 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.500
 sport in celebration and the problem is that 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:26.449
 Well, there's nobody else he comes to 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.279
 end of the party here it is thrown pebbles 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.279
 for viewing and to all
