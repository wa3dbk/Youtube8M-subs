00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
FMJ or something like that because it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.770 
FMJ or something like that because it
cause<00:02:31.099> it's<00:02:31.250> like<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.819> map<00:02:32.000> built<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.569> such<00:02:32.750> a

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
cause it's like the map built in such a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.570 
cause it's like the map built in such a
way<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.050> there's<00:02:33.410> very<00:02:33.470> thin<00:02:34.040> walls<00:02:34.310> that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
way that there's very thin walls that

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.509 
way that there's very thin walls that
are<00:02:34.640> very<00:02:34.790> penetrable<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.500> using<00:02:36.830> FMJ<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.400> a

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
are very penetrable so using FMJ is a

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.660 
are very penetrable so using FMJ is a
huge<00:02:37.819> huge<00:02:38.000> advantage<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:38.720> maps<00:02:39.019> like<00:02:39.290> that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
huge huge advantage and maps like that
