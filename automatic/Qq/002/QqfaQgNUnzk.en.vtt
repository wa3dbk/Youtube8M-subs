00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
advance which lead magnet will work best

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480 
advance which lead magnet will work best
so<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.170> test<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.619> let's<00:01:17.130> look<00:01:17.310> at<00:01:17.460> a

so you have to test it let's look at a
few<00:01:18.080> lead<00:01:19.080> magnet<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.860> let<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> page

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
few lead magnet so I let it on this page

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.950 
few lead magnet so I let it on this page
and<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> looks<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:23.750> well<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
not going to be very strong which will

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.660 
not going to be very strong which will
affect<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.500> opt-in<00:01:53.130> rates<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> negative

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
affect the opt-in rates in a negative

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.209 
affect the opt-in rates in a negative
way<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:55.020> show<00:01:55.290> me<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> steps<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.159> do

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
specific car if you click on it another

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.350 
specific car if you click on it another
thing<00:04:40.590> pops<00:04:40.919> up<00:04:41.160> which<00:04:41.790> was<00:04:41.970> totally

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
thing pops up which was totally

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.680 
thing pops up which was totally
unexpected<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:43.250> unexpected<00:04:44.250> behavior<00:04:44.690> is

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
unexpected and unexpected behavior is

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.439 
unexpected and unexpected behavior is
something<00:04:46.199> that<00:04:46.290> people<00:04:46.520> do<00:04:47.520> not<00:04:47.669> like<00:04:47.729> at<00:04:48.240> all

something that people do not like at all

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.659 
something that people do not like at all
so<00:04:48.960> that's<00:04:49.229> definitely<00:04:49.530> hurting<00:04:50.010> conversions

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
so that's definitely hurting conversions

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.270 
so that's definitely hurting conversions
here<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.150> why<00:04:51.750> not<00:04:52.080> add<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.590> email<00:04:52.889> field<00:04:53.070> to

here so why not add the email field to

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.300 
here so why not add the email field to
the<00:04:53.310> first<00:04:53.639> form<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.510> don't<00:04:54.720> need<00:04:54.960> this

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
it's a lead magnet page with a lead

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.550 
it's a lead magnet page with a lead
magnet<00:05:03.510> pop<00:05:04.110> up<00:05:04.289> over<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:04.860> double<00:05:05.639> offer<00:05:06.560> so

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
magnet pop up over it double offer so

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.930 
magnet pop up over it double offer so
are<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:07.770> making<00:05:08.160> this<00:05:08.250> conversion<00:05:08.639> makes

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
are you making this conversion makes

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.529 
are you making this conversion makes
takes<00:05:09.320> curiosity<00:05:10.320> can<00:05:10.620> be<00:05:10.830> very<00:05:11.070> effective<00:05:11.539> so

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
takes curiosity can be very effective so

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.250 
takes curiosity can be very effective so
now<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:12.930> read<00:05:13.470> on<00:05:13.710> tell<00:05:14.430> me<00:05:14.460> more<00:05:14.750> but<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.960> see

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
like it's kind of a you know a wall of

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.340 
like it's kind of a you know a wall of
text<00:05:20.550> they<00:05:20.669> throw<00:05:20.970> a<00:05:21.000> bunch<00:05:21.240> of<00:05:21.419> texts<00:05:21.810> at<00:05:21.930> me

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
text they throw a bunch of texts at me

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.320 
text they throw a bunch of texts at me
so<00:05:22.560> going<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.310> be<00:05:23.400> tutored<00:05:23.910> by<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.210> because

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
so going to be tutored by it because

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.629 
so going to be tutored by it because
people<00:05:24.720> don't<00:05:24.930> like<00:05:25.229> to<00:05:25.380> read<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:26.100> image<00:05:26.460> is

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
people don't like to read the image is

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.909 
people don't like to read the image is
like<00:05:26.850> a<00:05:26.880> clip<00:05:27.449> art<00:05:27.720> from<00:05:27.810> word<00:05:28.229> i<00:05:28.530> guess<00:05:28.680> it's

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
like a clip art from word i guess it's

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.100 
like a clip art from word i guess it's
supposed<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.340> be<00:05:29.520> targeted<00:05:29.789> funnel<00:05:30.419> but<00:05:30.900> we're

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
supposed to be targeted funnel but we're

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.779 
supposed to be targeted funnel but we're
talking<00:05:31.410> about<00:05:31.530> conversion<00:05:32.190> mistakes<00:05:32.550> here

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
talking about conversion mistakes here

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.219 
talking about conversion mistakes here
so<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.090> picture<00:05:33.240> makes<00:05:33.990> no<00:05:34.260> sense<00:05:34.560> at<00:05:35.220> all<00:05:35.430> and

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
so the picture makes no sense at all and

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.469 
so the picture makes no sense at all and
in<00:05:37.229> a<00:05:37.289> copy<00:05:37.620> flow<00:05:38.039> is<00:05:38.400> lacking<00:05:39.060> in<00:05:39.360> many

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
in a copy flow is lacking in many

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.510 
in a copy flow is lacking in many
aspects<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.260> want<00:05:40.889> to<00:05:40.950> learn<00:05:41.130> what<00:05:41.370> this

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
aspects I want to learn what this

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.040 
aspects I want to learn what this
mistakes<00:05:41.940> are<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.389> how<00:05:42.450> much<00:05:42.599> money<00:05:42.810> they're

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
mistakes are and how much money they're

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.750 
mistakes are and how much money they're
costing<00:05:43.410> me<00:05:43.530> or<00:05:43.620> whatever<00:05:43.919> it's<00:05:44.220> like<00:05:44.460> you

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
costing me or whatever it's like you

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
so that that's that's a that's turned

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.650 
so that that's that's a that's turned
here<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.860> you<00:05:53.760> know<00:05:53.880> there's<00:05:54.090> so<00:05:54.180> many<00:05:54.510> ways

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
here and you know there's so many ways

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.779 
here and you know there's so many ways
how<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.080> can<00:05:55.200> trim<00:05:55.560> this<00:05:55.680> copy<00:05:55.979> and<00:05:56.160> start<00:05:56.550> by

how you can trim this copy and start by

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.600 
how you can trim this copy and start by
cutting<00:05:57.090> useless<00:05:57.810> items<00:05:58.260> like<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.860> much<00:05:59.280> more
