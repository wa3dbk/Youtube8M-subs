 fruits rich in proteins are the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.470
 fruits are not generally known by 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.290
 its protein content since the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.000
 most have very modest levels in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.730
 comparison with usual foods 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.940
 rich in protein like fish the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.029
 eggs and soy however certain 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.130
 fruits have more protein than other 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.310
 for example some of the fruits with 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.990
 Higher protein content include 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 a cup of dried apricots count 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.559
 with 5 grams of protein a cup of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.170
 dried plums with 438 grams a cup 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.200

 Avocados are labeled as vegetables 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 they are really fruits with high 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.809
 protein content as well as zinc 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.670
 Niacin Folic acid fiber and others 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.830
 essential nutrients 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 They are also a good source of fat 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.140
 healthy for the heart unlike

 of other fruits however the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.810
 avocados are high in calories the fig 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.450
 just like avocados have a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.280
 high caloric content as well as a high 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 carbohydrate content and a good 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.899
 protein source due to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.670
 nutritional composition of fig 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.119
 often recommended as a snack

 delicious and nutritious for example a 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.950
 coconut has only 140 calories with 2 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.319
 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.319
 along with a dash of nutrients and 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.569
 healthy fats few people eat

 bananas and cherries the goji berries 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.549
 dry ones contain the amount of protein 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.170
 higher fruits do not contain as many 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.049
 proteins as other sources of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.310
 food of animal origin in general 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.069

 protein giving the body the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.010
 essential amino acids to form a 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.689
 complete protein fulfilling all 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.780
