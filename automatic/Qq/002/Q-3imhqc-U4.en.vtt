00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.210 
children to Disneyland in California and
as<00:04:12.990> I<00:04:13.170> was<00:04:13.260> about<00:04:13.410> two<00:04:13.620> hundred<00:04:13.710> yards<00:04:13.980> from

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
as I was about two hundred yards from

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.130 
as I was about two hundred yards from
the<00:04:14.370> front<00:04:14.490> gate<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:15.150> decided<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:15.990> know<00:04:16.079> what

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140

the front gate I decided you know what
maybe<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.590> shouldn't<00:04:16.890> take<00:04:16.980> my<00:04:17.040> level<00:04:17.400> until

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
maybe I shouldn't take my level until

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.770 
maybe I shouldn't take my level until
the<00:04:17.790> park<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.120> can<00:04:18.269> see<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.510> there<00:04:18.600> was<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
the park I can see that there was a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.180 
the park I can see that there was a
security<00:04:19.049> line<00:04:19.350> up<00:04:19.530> there<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.890> didn't<00:04:20.100> know

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
security line up there and I didn't know

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.979 
security line up there and I didn't know
what<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.370> rules<00:04:20.549> were<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.090> sometimes<00:04:21.840> they

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
what the rules were and sometimes they

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.060 
what the rules were and sometimes they
let<00:04:22.140> me<00:04:22.230> take<00:04:22.260> my<00:04:22.560> Leatherman<00:04:22.860> tools
