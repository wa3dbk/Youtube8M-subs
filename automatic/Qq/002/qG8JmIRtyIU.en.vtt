00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you max out a supercar you'll get close

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
you max out a supercar you'll get close
to<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> million<00:01:34.829> dollars<00:01:35.189> each<00:01:35.430> time<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> sell

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
to a million dollars each time you sell

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
to a million dollars each time you sell
it<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.229> what<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> need<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.979> drive

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
it so now what you need to do is drive

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
it so now what you need to do is drive
to<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.640> garage<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:38.909> drive<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.479> any<00:01:39.840> car<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
to your garage and drive out any car and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.620 
to your garage and drive out any car and
that<00:01:40.979> will<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.159> save<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.119> car<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> your

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that will actually save your car in your

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.780 
that will actually save your car in your
garage<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> don't<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.310> step<00:01:44.549> then

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
garage so if you don't do this step then

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
garage so if you don't do this step then
your<00:01:44.970> car<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.630> delete<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.439> glitch<00:01:46.619> will

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
your car will delete and the glitch will

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
your car will delete and the glitch will
not<00:01:46.950> work<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.399> make<00:01:47.729> sure<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> do

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
not work so just make sure that you do

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
not work so just make sure that you do
this<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.649> i<00:01:49.680> still<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.369> my

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
this but as you can see i still have my

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.249 
this but as you can see i still have my
bugatti<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.570> did<00:01:51.720> duplicate

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
bugatti and it did duplicate

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.499 
bugatti and it did duplicate
successfully<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.759> from<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.360> just

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
successfully so from here you can just

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.330 
successfully so from here you can just
repeat<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> process<00:01:55.259> over<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:55.950> over<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
repeat the process over and over and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.969 
repeat the process over and over and
this<00:01:56.729> also<00:01:56.939> bypasses<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.780> 45<00:01:58.290> minute<00:01:58.590> wait<00:01:58.770> so

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this also bypasses the 45 minute wait so

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.620 
this also bypasses the 45 minute wait so
you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.250> keep<00:01:59.490> selling<00:01:59.850> cars<00:02:00.060> over<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you can just keep selling cars over and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.569 
you can just keep selling cars over and
over<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.020> by<00:02:01.500> using<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.890> method<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.399> i

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
over and by using this method like i

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
over and by using this method like i
said<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.149> will<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:03.509> millions<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.409> just

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
said you will make millions it's just

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.990 
said you will make millions it's just
like<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> older<00:02:05.159> versions<00:02:05.549> where<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> could

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
