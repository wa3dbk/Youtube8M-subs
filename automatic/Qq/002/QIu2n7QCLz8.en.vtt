possibly moving to DTM next year now if

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.870 
possibly moving to DTM next year now if
we<00:00:19.289> don't<00:00:19.410> know<00:00:19.560> her<00:00:19.680> Antonia<00:00:20.189> fixed<00:00:20.490> Acosta

we don't know her Antonia fixed Acosta

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.480 
we don't know her Antonia fixed Acosta
is<00:00:21.029> he<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> redbull<00:00:22.020> young<00:00:22.260> driver<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.980> think

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
is he is a redbull young driver I think

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.210 
is he is a redbull young driver I think
he's<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.970> red<00:00:24.210> bull<00:00:24.510> racing<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.260> f1<00:00:25.650> x

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
he's the red bull racing in the f1 x

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.099 
he's the red bull racing in the f1 x
things<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.609> think<00:00:26.670> he<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.000> their<00:00:27.240> test<00:00:27.570> drive<00:00:27.869> at

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
things I think he is their test drive at

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.620 
things I think he is their test drive at
the<00:00:28.260> current<00:00:28.560> time<00:00:29.000> after<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.330> being<00:00:30.510> given

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the current time after not being given

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
the current time after not being given
the<00:00:30.810> Taurus<00:00:31.199> i<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.500> i<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.769> they<00:00:31.859> promote

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the Taurus i see i think they promote

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.030 
the Taurus i see i think they promote
into<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> test<00:00:32.850> driver<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.829> wanted

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
into a test driver so what they wanted

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
into a test driver so what they wanted
to<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.520> putting<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> motor<00:00:36.480> sport

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to do is putting it in the motor sport

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
to do is putting it in the motor sport
or<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.200> former<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.920> what<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.160> doesn't<00:00:38.340> clash

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
or a former to what that doesn't clash

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.590 
or a former to what that doesn't clash
with<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.940> formula<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:40.550> DTM<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.910> probably

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
with the formula one now DTM is probably

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.209 
with the formula one now DTM is probably
the<00:00:42.930> biggest<00:00:43.110> modes<00:00:43.530> well<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.920> doesn't

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the biggest modes well that doesn't

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.650 
the biggest modes well that doesn't
clash<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.149> Fallen<00:00:45.390> One<00:00:45.510> obviously

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
clash with the the Fallen One obviously

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
clash with the the Fallen One obviously
lots<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.200> motor<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.620> does<00:00:46.860> clash<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
lots of motor what does clash with the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.930 
lots of motor what does clash with the
f1<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:48.180> gp2<00:00:48.980> Walters<00:00:49.980> barrera<00:00:50.399> does<00:00:50.610> clash

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
f1 like gp2 Walters barrera does clash

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.670 
f1 like gp2 Walters barrera does clash
from<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> couple<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.600> occasions<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
from a couple of occasions with the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.340 
from a couple of occasions with the
formula<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.670> DTM<00:00:54.149> never<00:00:54.420> clashes<00:00:54.989> with

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
formula one but DTM never clashes with

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.900 
formula one but DTM never clashes with
the<00:00:55.410> formula<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:56.789> because

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the formula one I think that's because

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.310 
the formula one I think that's because
the<00:00:57.270> Germans<00:00:57.480> always<00:00:57.809> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.260> sure

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the Germans always want to make sure

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
the Germans always want to make sure
that<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.730> have<00:01:00.000> DTM<00:01:00.420> one

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that you can you know you have DTM one

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.240 
that you can you know you have DTM one
week<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:00.960> f1<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> next<00:01:01.620> week<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.129> know

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
week and then f1 the next week you know

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.319 
week and then f1 the next week you know
stuff<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.640> they<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> make<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
stuff like that they want to make it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.840 
stuff like that they want to make it
like<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.250> might<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.460> seeing

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
like that so I think we might be seeing

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.660 
like that so I think we might be seeing
Antonia<00:01:06.479> Felix<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> cost<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> DTM<00:01:08.369> next

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
Antonia Felix to cost in the DTM next

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.200 
Antonia Felix to cost in the DTM next
year<00:01:08.850> he<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.360> doing<00:01:09.710> do<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> test<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.460> week<00:01:12.030> I

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
year he is doing do a test this week I

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.140 
year he is doing do a test this week I
think<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.600> coming<00:01:12.930> week<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.280> BMW<00:01:14.520> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
think all this coming week in a BMW I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.100 
think all this coming week in a BMW I
think<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> might<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.750> already<00:01:15.869> done

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
think you might have already done

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
think you might have already done
testing<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.710> Audi<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> super<00:01:17.490> secret<00:01:17.700> test

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
testing and Audi and a super secret test

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.219 
testing and Audi and a super secret test
but<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.720> anyone's<00:01:18.960> supposed<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
but I don't think anyone's supposed to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.749 
but I don't think anyone's supposed to
know<00:01:19.380> about<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.310> he's<00:01:20.430> already<00:01:20.610> done

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
know about I think he's already done

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.820 
know about I think he's already done
test<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.530> we're<00:01:22.650> most

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
test in there so I think we're most

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350 
test in there so I think we're most
likely<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.340> seeing<00:01:23.610> Antonia<00:01:24.030> Felix

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
likely going to be seeing Antonia Felix

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.090 
likely going to be seeing Antonia Felix
the<00:01:24.420> cost<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.750> racing<00:01:25.110> next<00:01:25.229> year<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.950> is

the cost of racing next year this is

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
driving in this video nothing special

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.380 
driving in this video nothing special
whatsoever<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.860> yet<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.670> least<00:01:44.700> he's<00:01:44.970> driving

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
whatsoever but yet at least he's driving

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
whatsoever but yet at least he's driving
next<00:01:45.509> year<00:01:45.750> by<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> looks<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.560> mean<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
next year by the looks of it I mean it

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.440 
next year by the looks of it I mean it
looks<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.310> he'll<00:01:47.610> either<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.850> racing<00:01:48.420> for

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
looks like he'll either be racing for

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.170 
looks like he'll either be racing for
the<00:01:48.780> apt<00:01:49.290> squad<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.130> would<00:01:50.399> guess<00:01:50.670> they're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the apt squad I would guess they're

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.969 
the apt squad I would guess they're
sponsored<00:01:51.630> by<00:01:51.720> redbull<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.409> I'd<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.890> as

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
sponsored by redbull so I'd see that as

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
sponsored by redbull so I'd see that as
a<00:01:53.009> logical<00:01:53.520> fit<00:01:53.759> there<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.450> rest<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.869> audi

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
a logical fit there they rest for audi

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.459 
a logical fit there they rest for audi
or<00:01:55.409> BMW<00:01:56.390> redbull<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.570> sponsor<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> couple<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
or BMW redbull do sponsor a couple of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.859 
or BMW redbull do sponsor a couple of
drivers<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.369> BMW<00:01:59.850> side<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> i<00:02:00.479> think<00:02:00.689> red

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
drivers in the BMW side and i think red

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.630 
drivers in the BMW side and i think red
bulls<00:02:01.110> want<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> any<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> mercedes<00:02:02.490> driver

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
bulls want to any of the mercedes driver

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.120 
bulls want to any of the mercedes driver
so<00:02:03.180> i<00:02:03.390> think<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.960> even<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> BMW

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so i think it's even going to be a BMW

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.980 
so i think it's even going to be a BMW
or<00:02:05.159> an<00:02:05.490> Audi<00:02:05.700> will<00:02:06.000> see<00:02:06.180> Antonia<00:02:06.570> fix<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
or an Audi will see Antonia fix to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.190 
or an Audi will see Antonia fix to
Custer<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.619> he<00:02:07.680> races<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.360> DTM<00:02:09.929> next
