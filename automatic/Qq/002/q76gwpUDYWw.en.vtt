race<00:03:46.530> each<00:03:47.519> track<00:03:48.209> has<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.720> ability<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.530> get

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
race each track has the ability to get

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:56.360 
race each track has the ability to get
four<00:03:50.130> stars<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.669> it<00:03:51.859> here<00:03:52.859> it's<00:03:54.049> 3/4<00:03:55.370> play

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
four stars to it here it's 3/4 play

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.120 
four stars to it here it's 3/4 play
track<00:03:56.669> and<00:03:56.940> 1/4<00:03:57.510> plate<00:03:57.720> race<00:03:57.900> we'll<00:03:58.889> do<00:03:59.010> the

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
first track so this is the option for a

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.449 
first track so this is the option for a
movie<00:04:03.840> now<00:04:03.989> less<00:04:04.260> than<00:04:04.290> infiltration<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.250> can

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
movie now less than infiltration you can

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.800 
movie now less than infiltration you can
still

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.170 

and<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.470> see<00:04:08.680> what<00:04:08.890> that's<00:04:09.069> going<00:04:09.400> out<00:04:09.520> you<00:04:09.940> go

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
and you see what that's going out you go

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.000 
and you see what that's going out you go
faster<00:04:10.750> than<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:10.990> but<00:04:13.530> it's<00:04:14.530> kind<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.800> hard

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
faster than that but it's kind of hard

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:25.410 
faster than that but it's kind of hard
to<00:04:15.040> see<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.370> know<00:04:15.959> things<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.169> go<00:04:17.320> faster

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420
