00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
video I just been following my regular

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.439 
video I just been following my regular
routine<00:00:16.970> of<00:00:18.070> twisting<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:19.730> i'll<00:00:19.909> probably<00:00:20.150> do

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
routine of twisting and i'll probably do

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.409 
routine of twisting and i'll probably do
it<00:00:20.480> tutorial<00:00:21.230> or<00:00:21.499> something<00:00:22.130> on<00:00:22.429> that<00:00:22.820> later

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
it tutorial or something on that later

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.439 
it tutorial or something on that later
i've<00:00:24.050> been<00:00:24.619> experimenting<00:00:25.400> with<00:00:25.819> a<00:00:25.999> couple<00:00:26.390> of

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
i've been experimenting with a couple of

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.479 
i've been experimenting with a couple of
different<00:00:26.839> methods<00:00:27.019> that<00:00:27.589> have<00:00:27.800> been<00:00:27.859> working

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
different methods that have been working

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.579 
different methods that have been working
really<00:00:28.909> well<00:00:29.060> for<00:00:29.419> me<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:29.929> really

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
really well for me and really

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.819 
really well for me and really
moisturizing<00:00:31.399> my<00:00:31.550> hair<00:00:32.200> that<00:00:33.200> i'm<00:00:33.649> going<00:00:33.769> to

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
moisturizing my hair that i'm going to

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.529 
moisturizing my hair that i'm going to
continue<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.309> implement<00:00:34.609> throughout<00:00:35.359> the

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
continue to implement throughout the

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.259 
continue to implement throughout the
winter<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.649> i<00:00:36.680> just<00:00:36.920> wanted<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.430> do<00:00:37.699> like<00:00:38.059> a

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
winter so i just wanted to do like a

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.389 
winter so i just wanted to do like a
quick<00:00:38.539> length<00:00:39.230> check<00:00:39.530> i<00:00:39.590> figured<00:00:40.129> why<00:00:40.370> not

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
quick length check i figured why not

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.060 
quick length check i figured why not
since<00:00:41.030> my<00:00:41.179> hair<00:00:41.359> straight<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:41.829> it's<00:00:42.829> never

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
since my hair straight and it's never

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.040 
since my hair straight and it's never
really<00:00:43.309> straight<00:00:43.670> are<00:00:43.910> probably<00:00:44.359> flat<00:00:44.870> iron

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
really straight are probably flat iron

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.650 
really straight are probably flat iron
it<00:00:45.170> maybe<00:00:45.410> twice<00:00:45.739> or<00:00:46.550> three<00:00:46.789> times<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:47.210> year<00:00:47.239> so

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
it maybe twice or three times a year so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.340 
it maybe twice or three times a year so
