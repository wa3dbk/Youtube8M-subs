when<00:00:10.059> the<00:00:10.240> tape<00:00:10.450> is<00:00:10.660> rolled<00:00:11.020> this<00:00:11.260> way<00:00:11.530> it<00:00:12.520> has

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
when the tape is rolled this way it has

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.010 
when the tape is rolled this way it has
a<00:00:12.910> tendency<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:14.350> stay<00:00:14.740> in<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:15.340> tire<00:00:15.900> when<00:00:16.900> you

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
a tendency to stay in the tire when you

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.240 
a tendency to stay in the tire when you
put<00:00:17.320> it<00:00:17.560> in

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
put it in

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.730 
put it in
I<00:00:21.570> usually<00:00:22.570> when<00:00:23.320> I<00:00:23.350> buy<00:00:23.770> these<00:00:23.830> things<00:00:24.130> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I usually when I buy these things I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.220 
I usually when I buy these things I
usually<00:00:26.740> roll<00:00:27.040> them<00:00:27.220> up<00:00:27.370> and<00:00:27.780> just<00:00:28.780> leave<00:00:29.050> them

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
usually roll them up and just leave them

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.170 
usually roll them up and just leave them
that<00:00:29.290> way<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.580> other<00:00:30.760> way<00:00:32.190> but<00:00:33.190> I<00:00:33.430> think<00:00:34.000> a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
that way the other way but I think a

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.340 
that way the other way but I think a
couple<00:00:34.450> of<00:00:34.629> hours<00:00:35.050> might<00:00:35.379> do<00:00:35.680> it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.939 

that<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:41.949> have<00:00:42.309> a<00:00:42.340> tendency<00:00:42.670> just<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.899> roll<00:00:44.829> them

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
that I have a tendency just to roll them

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.869 
that I have a tendency just to roll them
up<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.660> leave<00:00:46.660> them<00:00:46.839> that<00:00:47.050> way<00:00:47.879> starting

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
up and leave them that way starting

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.410 
up and leave them that way starting
across<00:00:49.600> from<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.649> BAL<00:00:50.860> stem<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.820> valve<00:00:52.030> stem

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
across from the BAL stem the valve stem

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.079 
across from the BAL stem the valve stem
is<00:00:52.449> down<00:00:52.899> here<00:00:53.350> I'm<00:00:54.190> starting<00:00:55.059> up<00:00:55.300> here<00:00:57.089> put

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
is down here I'm starting up here put

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:05.679 
is down here I'm starting up here put
the<00:00:58.390> end

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:13.820 

like<00:01:06.320> this

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.240 

you<00:01:14.370> can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.910> how<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:16.050> tried<00:01:16.410> to<00:01:16.440> curl<00:01:16.980> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you can see how if it tried to curl the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.560 
you can see how if it tried to curl the
other<00:01:17.460> way<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:19.080> could<00:01:19.380> curl<00:01:19.770> itself<00:01:20.520> out

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.010 

but<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.470> way<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:27.210> stays<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:28.140> very<00:01:28.710> much
