00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
back of the spawn still camping and he

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.000 
back of the spawn still camping and he
barely<00:04:09.480> he<00:04:09.810> barely<00:04:10.169> killed<00:04:10.379> me<00:04:10.530> see<00:04:10.680> those<00:04:10.799> are

barely he barely killed me see those are

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.890 
barely he barely killed me see those are
those<00:04:11.099> deaths<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.180> can't<00:04:12.419> avoid<00:04:12.540> I

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
those deaths that you can't avoid I

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.210 
those deaths that you can't avoid I
couldn't<00:04:13.139> have<00:04:13.230> avoided<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.739> death<00:04:13.980> I

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
couldn't have avoided that death I

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.770 
couldn't have avoided that death I
wouldn't<00:04:14.669> even<00:04:14.760> thinking<00:04:15.150> about<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.540> kid

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
wouldn't even thinking about that kid

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.420 
wouldn't even thinking about that kid
again<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.260> then<00:04:16.380> he's<00:04:16.650> like<00:04:16.709> nine<00:04:17.099> and<00:04:17.310> three

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
again and then he's like nine and three

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.830 
again and then he's like nine and three
I<00:04:17.519> think<00:04:17.609> he<00:04:17.820> gets<00:04:17.970> one<00:04:18.150> workout<00:04:18.510> at<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.660> end

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
I think he gets one workout at the end

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.709 
I think he gets one workout at the end
of<00:04:18.870> this<00:04:18.959> gameplay<00:04:19.729> my<00:04:20.729> point<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:21.090> there<00:04:21.690> are

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
of this gameplay my point is there are

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.029 
of this gameplay my point is there are
certain<00:04:21.989> things<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.229> can<00:04:22.409> avoid<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.950> there

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
certain things you can avoid and there
