00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.750
 it bothers us so much with black dots 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.730

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.710

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 attentive to the videos and also what 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.289

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.330
 will send greetings now yes much talk 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.679
 let's start with the idea that they 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.800
 I have prepared that I know that they are going to 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.570
 like a lot and first of all 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.050
 remember to like the video if 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.610
 they want me to do more htm if it's first 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.649
 Once they visit my channel too 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.480
 subscribe here below on the button to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.209
 receive notifications 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.980
 when I upload new videos and also 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.920
 share likes for others 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.049
 people know about this channel if you believe 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.670
 that are going to benefit now yes we are going to 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.670
 start with the idea that I have 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.660
 in this little container I will put the same 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.310
 amount of the following ingredients 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:39.130
 ground salt baking soda and any cream 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.860
 cleaner you have for the face 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.680
 then mix all the ingredients with 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.680
 this cotton until there is a mixture 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.200
 like the one you see here after the meetings 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.430
 in the affected area as you can see that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.710
 in my hand and let it act for 5 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.850
 minutes and just rinse will touch 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.850
 as I normally will 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.019
 in the second option be using 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.019
 also in equal parts gelatin 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.090
 milk 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.350
 and simply mix the two 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.170
 ingredients after it is well 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.970
 you take it to the microwave 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.290
 about 10 seconds 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.670
 If you do not have a microwave, so 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.440
 you can take the fire until it is 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.270
 something like what you see here a little bit 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.460
 thick we meet in the affected area 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.370
 when it dries and looks like a band 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.370
 you take it off your face and that's it 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.040
 and finally who would say that the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.510
 glue would serve for beauty 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.650
 look for a glue that is not toxic 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.170
 for your skin 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.480
 you just take it a little bit together 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.970
 also where the black dots are 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.730
 and when this thin little layer dries 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.510
 that remains the takeoff and will be the function 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.510
 of a band 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.629
 well how easy was this idea I hope that 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.489
 try it at home please but before 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.469
 I would like to ask you a question that 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.750
 he came back to the beginning of the 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.730
 video I would like to know what is it 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.340
 first you do in the morning 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.769
 get up because for example the first thing 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.630
 what I do is that I take my cell phone and 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.700
 begins to review the different networks 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.980
 social networks like twitter facebook facebook 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.440
 youtube also to see the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.580
 updates that I have on my channel 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.890
 then it occurred to me to ask 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.840
 what do you do to get up 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.220
 which is the first thing I would like to know 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.820
 here in your comments please 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.090
 comment because I want to know 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.310
 so the winner was the winner 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.780
 leidy tabares she is the one that is going to 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.420
 bring all the prizes if you were not 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.240
 one of the winners do not feel bad 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.000
 that's why later more come 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.060
 raffles I can not tell you exactly when 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.590
 but rest assured, I'll try to do 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.470
 many more austere with other things 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.360
 even maybe prettier I hope that 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.970
 they liked it in the stands 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.970
 thank you for having supported me too 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.020
 that you liked we saw today 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.970
 htm and how I had tourist if you want 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.970
 that is still more htm because I have 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.729
 many more ideas to put it I have the 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.150
 idea of â€‹â€‹making some beautiful bracelets 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.550
 that I saw and other things too but if 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.740
 age I like this video I'll understand 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.100
 to say that you have to want to continue 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.259
 seeing more as I told you also in 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.980
 principle subscribe so you do not get 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.380
 miss any of the videos 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.120
 and since then after the next 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.120
 they said goodbye 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.229
 today as a child 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.630
 although it looked like this 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.520
 so you have to go 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.409
 it's okay 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.759
 but you cut me to try 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.759
 to them but the face 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.410
 yes
