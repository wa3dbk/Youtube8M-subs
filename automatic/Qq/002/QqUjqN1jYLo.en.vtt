study comm and in this video I'd like to
talk<00:00:05.730> about<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:06.420> question<00:00:06.870> from<00:00:07.080> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
talk about this question from the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.600 
talk about this question from the
Facebook<00:00:07.560> page<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.450> it<00:00:09.450> asks<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.370> been

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
Facebook page and it asks you have been

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.970 
Facebook page and it asks you have been
asked<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.179> divide<00:00:12.599> five<00:00:12.990> liters<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.740> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
asked to divide five liters of a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.630 
asked to divide five liters of a
suspension<00:00:14.580> into<00:00:15.480> an<00:00:15.859> equal<00:00:16.859> number<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.190> ten

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
suspension into an equal number of ten

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.210 
suspension into an equal number of ten
milliliter<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.390> 15<00:00:19.199> milliliter<00:00:19.710> unit-dose

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
milliliter and 15 milliliter unit-dose

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.240 
milliliter and 15 milliliter unit-dose
dispensing<00:00:21.029> cups<00:00:21.260> how<00:00:22.260> many<00:00:22.439> 10<00:00:22.710> milliliter

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
dispensing cups how many 10 milliliter

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.640 
dispensing cups how many 10 milliliter
dispensing<00:00:23.880> cups<00:00:24.119> will<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.869> made<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.380> then

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
dispensing cups will be made and then

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.060 
dispensing cups will be made and then
there's<00:00:25.859> four<00:00:26.189> available<00:00:27.150> answers<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> let's

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
there's four available answers so let's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.230 
there's four available answers so let's
talk<00:00:29.279> about<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.670> over<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
talk about this over here on the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.659 
talk about this over here on the
whiteboard<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> there's<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> few<00:00:32.610> different

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
whiteboard and there's a few different

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.030 
whiteboard and there's a few different
ways<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.540> work<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.500> algebra

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
ways to work this out to or with algebra

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.250 
ways to work this out to or with algebra
and<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.899> recommend

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and then one the one that I recommend

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.209 
and then one the one that I recommend
since<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.340> test<00:00:41.610> question<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> you're

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
since it's a test question and you're

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.840 
since it's a test question and you're
under<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> time<00:00:44.700> restraint<00:00:45.440> deadline<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.850> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
under a time restraint deadline is the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.100 
under a time restraint deadline is the
first<00:00:48.059> thing<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.300> would<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.780> look<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
first thing I would do is look at the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.069 
first thing I would do is look at the
answers<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.120> do<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> little<00:00:51.390> trial<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> error

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
answers and do a little trial and error

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.270 
answers and do a little trial and error
and<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:54.079> let's<00:00:55.079> go<00:00:55.230> ahead<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> put<00:00:56.100> down<00:00:56.250> our

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and so let's go ahead and put down our

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.340 
and so let's go ahead and put down our
factors<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.899> equal<00:00:58.289> parts<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:59.340> ten

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
factors we want equal parts of ten

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.759 
factors we want equal parts of ten
milliliter<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:02.210> 15<00:01:03.210> milliliter<00:01:04.019> dispensing

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
milliliter and 15 milliliter dispensing

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.359 
milliliter and 15 milliliter dispensing
cups<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:07.520> we<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:08.760> those<00:01:09.500> equal<00:01:10.500> parts<00:01:10.920> added

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
cups and we want those equal parts added

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.270 
cups and we want those equal parts added
together<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.790> equal<00:01:12.180> five<00:01:12.420> thousand

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
together to equal five thousand

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.870 
together to equal five thousand
milliliter<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> let's<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:17.040> ahead<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
milliliter so let's go ahead and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.039 
milliliter so let's go ahead and
substitute<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.290> answer<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.299> ten

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
substitute in answer a so we have ten

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.710 
substitute in answer a so we have ten
times<00:01:22.770> 200<00:01:24.770> plus<00:01:26.240> 15<00:01:27.799> times<00:01:28.799> 200<00:01:29.509> those<00:01:30.509> are

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
times 200 plus 15 times 200 those are

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.340 
times 200 plus 15 times 200 those are
equal<00:01:31.079> parts<00:01:31.460> 200<00:01:32.460> plus<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:33.240> 200<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.990> equal<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
equal parts 200 plus or 200 is equal to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.350 
equal parts 200 plus or 200 is equal to
200<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.210> let's<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> equals<00:01:36.829> 5,000

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
200 and let's see if that equals 5,000

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
200 and let's see if that equals 5,000
all<00:01:39.360> right<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.659> we've<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:39.840> 10<00:01:40.290> times<00:01:41.040> 200<00:01:41.610> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
all right so we've got 10 times 200 is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.249 
all right so we've got 10 times 200 is
2,000<00:01:43.070> plus<00:01:44.180> 15<00:01:45.180> times<00:01:45.479> 200<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.280> 3000<00:01:48.259> so

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
2,000 plus 15 times 200 is 3000 so

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.249 
2,000 plus 15 times 200 is 3000 so
indeed<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.850> does<00:01:51.299> add<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.619> 5,000<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.450> just

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
indeed it does add up to 5,000 so just

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.490 
indeed it does add up to 5,000 so just
using<00:01:55.409> trial<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.009> error<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:57.079> just<00:01:58.079> figured<00:01:58.380> out

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
using trial and error I just figured out

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.910 
using trial and error I just figured out
that<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.549> correct<00:01:59.820> answer<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.770> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that a is the correct answer and if you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.610 
that a is the correct answer and if you
look<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> other<00:02:02.520> answers<00:02:02.909> anything

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
look at the other answers anything

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.330 
look at the other answers anything
higher<00:02:05.460> than<00:02:05.730> 200<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.620> going<00:02:07.620> to<00:02:07.800> be<00:02:08.070> way<00:02:08.310> more

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
higher than 200 is going to be way more

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.570 
higher than 200 is going to be way more
than<00:02:08.610> 5,000<00:02:09.330> milliliters<00:02:09.750> when<00:02:10.710> you<00:02:10.860> multiply

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
than 5,000 milliliters when you multiply

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.740 
than 5,000 milliliters when you multiply
it<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:12.330> these<00:02:13.430> size<00:02:14.430> dispensing<00:02:15.060> cups<00:02:15.240> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it to these size dispensing cups so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.340 
it to these size dispensing cups so
that's<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.140> way<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.320> do<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.850> now<00:02:17.930> if<00:02:18.930> that's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
that's one way to do it now if that's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.480 
that's one way to do it now if that's
not<00:02:19.590> working<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.640> some<00:02:20.820> reason

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
not working out for you for some reason

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.890 
not working out for you for some reason
another<00:02:23.490> way<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.690> simple

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
another way to do it is just a simple

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.370 
another way to do it is just a simple
algebra<00:02:25.470> equation<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.690> let's<00:02:27.930> say<00:02:28.170> we've

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
algebra equation and so let's say we've

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.220 
algebra equation and so let's say we've
got<00:02:28.620> our<00:02:29.550> 10<00:02:30.000> milliliter<00:02:30.450> dispensing<00:02:31.020> cups

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
got our 10 milliliter dispensing cups

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.470 
got our 10 milliliter dispensing cups
and<00:02:31.820> our<00:02:32.820> 15<00:02:33.360> milliliter<00:02:34.160> dispensing<00:02:35.160> cups

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
and our 15 milliliter dispensing cups

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.230 
and our 15 milliliter dispensing cups
and<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:36.570> need<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.900> know<00:02:37.050> what<00:02:37.320> equal<00:02:37.770> parts<00:02:38.240> of

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
and we need to know what equal parts of

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.740 
and we need to know what equal parts of
each<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.440> equal<00:02:40.740> five<00:02:41.010> thousand

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
each are going to equal five thousand

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.480 
each are going to equal five thousand
milliliters<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.580> since<00:02:44.580> they're<00:02:44.850> equal<00:02:46.490> we

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
milliliters and since they're equal we

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.480 
milliliters and since they're equal we
can<00:02:47.520> use<00:02:48.000> X<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.870> both<00:02:51.830> now<00:02:52.830> if<00:02:53.010> they<00:02:53.160> were<00:02:53.220> not

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
can use X for both now if they were not

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.060 
can use X for both now if they were not
equal<00:02:53.850> parts<00:02:54.210> if<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:55.110> was<00:02:55.320> two<00:02:55.560> thirds<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
equal parts if this was two thirds and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.460 
equal parts if this was two thirds and
this<00:02:56.220> was<00:02:56.370> one<00:02:56.610> third<00:02:56.820> for<00:02:57.060> instance<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:58.320> would

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
this was one third for instance we would

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.630 
this was one third for instance we would
use<00:02:58.650> x<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.280> y<00:02:59.550> and<00:03:01.310> there's<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.400> whole<00:03:02.610> other

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
use x and y and there's a whole other

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.250 
use x and y and there's a whole other
way<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.450> called<00:03:03.720> system<00:03:04.140> of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
way to do that called system of

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 
way to do that called system of
equations<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.910> where<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.180> could<00:03:06.300> figure

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
equations that where you could figure

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.180 
equations that where you could figure
that<00:03:06.720> out<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.260> unnecessary

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
that out but that's unnecessary

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.550 
that out but that's unnecessary
in<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.390> problem<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:12.050> what<00:03:13.050> we've<00:03:13.200> got<00:03:13.380> here

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
in this problem so what we've got here

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:24.530 
in this problem so what we've got here
is<00:03:13.680> 10<00:03:13.950> x<00:03:14.130> +<00:03:16.400> 15<00:03:17.400> x<00:03:20.060> equals<00:03:21.060> 5,000

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.630 

so<00:03:25.540> then<00:03:25.750> add<00:03:25.870> those<00:03:26.050> together<00:03:26.319> we<00:03:26.620> get<00:03:26.709> 25<00:03:27.220> x

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
so then add those together we get 25 x

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.780 
so then add those together we get 25 x
equals<00:03:28.510> 5000<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:31.540> remember<00:03:31.930> on<00:03:32.170> an<00:03:32.380> equation

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
equals 5000 and remember on an equation

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.180 
equals 5000 and remember on an equation
if<00:03:33.790> we<00:03:33.940> want<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.150> isolate<00:03:34.330> this<00:03:34.780> X<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.980> can

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
if we want to isolate this X we can

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.720 
if we want to isolate this X we can
divide<00:03:36.700> both<00:03:36.940> sides<00:03:37.270> by<00:03:37.480> 25<00:03:38.520> it's<00:03:39.520> going<00:03:39.670> to

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
divide both sides by 25 it's going to

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.820 
divide both sides by 25 it's going to
cancel<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.180> out<00:03:40.269> here<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.750> what<00:03:40.959> we<00:03:41.080> did<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.530> x

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
cancel it out here so what we did is x

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.509 
cancel it out here so what we did is x
equals<00:03:42.340> whatever<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:43.810> if<00:03:44.739> we<00:03:44.800> divide

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
equals whatever this is and if we divide

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.990 
equals whatever this is and if we divide
up<00:03:45.849> this<00:03:46.030> fraction<00:03:46.540> we<00:03:46.720> get<00:03:46.900> 200<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.700> what<00:03:48.849> that

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
up this fraction we get 200 so what that

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.240 
up this fraction we get 200 so what that
means<00:03:49.300> is<00:03:49.630> x<00:03:50.349> equals<00:03:51.010> 200<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.480> if<00:03:52.599> we

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
means is x equals 200 so if we

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.590 
means is x equals 200 so if we
substitute<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.400> in<00:03:54.610> right<00:03:54.760> there<00:03:55.060> that

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
substitute that in right there that

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.640 
substitute that in right there that
means<00:03:55.750> we<00:03:56.049> have<00:03:56.260> 200<00:03:56.890> parts<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:59.290> 10

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
means we have 200 parts of the 10

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.830 
means we have 200 parts of the 10
milliliter<00:04:00.100> Cubs<00:04:01.200> boots<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.760> 200<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.510> the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
milliliter Cubs boots and and 200 of the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
milliliter Cubs boots and and 200 of the
15<00:04:05.440> milliliter<00:04:06.209> dispensing<00:04:07.209> cups<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.860> so

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
15 milliliter dispensing cups and so

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.880 
15 milliliter dispensing cups and so
that's<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.190> couple<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.549> ways<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:11.170> do<00:04:11.380> this

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
that's a couple of ways to do this

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.780 
that's a couple of ways to do this
I<00:04:11.920> recommend<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:13.060> on<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.390> test<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:15.400> use<00:04:15.549> the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
I recommend the on a test to use the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.879 
I recommend the on a test to use the
first<00:04:16.030> method<00:04:16.709> which<00:04:17.709> is<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:19.209> like<00:04:19.419> gum

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
first method which is just like gum

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.830 
first method which is just like gum
trial-and-error<00:04:20.889> deductive<00:04:21.669> reasoning<00:04:21.840> so

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
trial-and-error deductive reasoning so

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.969 
trial-and-error deductive reasoning so
let's<00:04:23.020> go<00:04:23.139> back<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.500> take<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.620> look<00:04:23.680> at<00:04:23.919> the

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
let's go back and take a look at the

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.380 
let's go back and take a look at the
question<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:26.550> we<00:04:27.550> know<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.850> a<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:28.210> the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
question and we know that a is the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.539 
question and we know that a is the
answer
