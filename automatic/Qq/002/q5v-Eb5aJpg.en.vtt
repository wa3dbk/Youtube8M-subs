00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
fact I think that's the major motive for

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.600

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.890 
to pay for it myself though I don't
think<00:06:45.820> there<00:06:46.180> ought<00:06:46.270> to<00:06:46.360> beat<00:06:46.509> that<00:06:46.690> ought<00:06:46.870> to

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
think there ought to beat that ought to

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.189 
think there ought to beat that ought to
happen<00:06:47.820> well<00:06:48.820> it's<00:06:49.030> because<00:06:49.479> we're<00:06:49.780> given<00:06:50.110> a

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
happen well it's because we're given a

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.580 
happen well it's because we're given a
set<00:06:50.409> of<00:06:50.440> bad<00:06:50.740> choices<00:06:51.360> so<00:06:52.360> within<00:06:52.990> the<00:06:53.259> set<00:06:53.469> of

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
set of bad choices so within the set of

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.050 
set of bad choices so within the set of
bad<00:06:53.740> choices<00:06:54.009> I<00:06:54.340> think<00:06:54.370> things<00:06:54.759> are<00:06:54.820> just<00:06:54.880> try

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
bad choices I think things are just try

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.480 
bad choices I think things are just try
to<00:06:55.120> make<00:06:55.270> them<00:06:55.389> better<00:06:55.800> not<00:06:56.800> eliminate<00:06:57.460> the

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
to make them better not eliminate the

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.629 
to make them better not eliminate the
good<00:06:57.880> things<00:06:58.150> because<00:06:59.020> in<00:06:59.949> some<00:07:00.190> aspects

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 
good things because in some aspects

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.580 
good things because in some aspects
usually<00:07:01.000> ain't<00:07:01.210> working

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
usually ain't working

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.920 
usually ain't working
I<00:07:02.620> mean<00:07:03.580> in<00:07:03.700> a<00:07:03.880> way<00:07:04.060> it's<00:07:04.240> like<00:07:05.790> you<00:07:06.790> know

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
I mean in a way it's like you know

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.270 
I mean in a way it's like you know
anything<00:07:07.930> you<00:07:08.110> point<00:07:08.560> to<00:07:08.680> it's<00:07:08.830> gonna<00:07:08.950> be<00:07:09.100> like

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
anything you point to it's gonna be like

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.570 
anything you point to it's gonna be like
that<00:07:09.870> every<00:07:10.870> institution<00:07:11.590> that<00:07:11.740> exists<00:07:12.310> is

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
that every institution that exists is

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.190 
that every institution that exists is
distorted<00:07:13.540> by<00:07:14.190> concentration<00:07:15.190> of<00:07:15.280> power<00:07:15.490> and

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
distorted by concentration of power and

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.890 
distorted by concentration of power and
many<00:07:17.200> other<00:07:17.440> things<00:07:18.300> fine<00:07:19.300> so<00:07:19.540> you<00:07:19.600> try<00:07:19.840> to

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
many other things fine so you try to

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.680 
many other things fine so you try to
overcome<00:07:20.200> those<00:07:20.650> distorting<00:07:21.610> effects<00:07:21.940> but

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
overcome those distorting effects but

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.350 
overcome those distorting effects but
you<00:07:22.720> don't<00:07:22.930> throw<00:07:23.410> away<00:07:23.550> whatever<00:07:24.550> is<00:07:24.880> useful

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
you don't throw away whatever is useful

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.120 
you don't throw away whatever is useful
about<00:07:25.630> institutions<00:07:26.320> isn't<00:07:26.710> about<00:07:26.830> the<00:07:26.950> labor

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
about institutions isn't about the labor
