00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.750
 hello and welcome I am 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.359
 She was the end of my tutorials 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.070
 and today it's about something very important 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 edit theme to draw the trick 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.739
 how can I basically under 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.620
 app a trick a hike I 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.460
 before or a bike ride whatever 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.640
 I intend to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.629
 how can I edit this 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.860
 I would now like to example of Pichl 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:55.260
 up on the reichstein and would like 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.070
 Draw me here the track 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:04.040
 I can do that manually now 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.540
 make and genia submenu carry 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.880
 recruit 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.820
 Now the window appears here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.229
 I can now automatically in the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.090
 name can be determined 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.090
 or I just want it all here 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:30.530
 reichstein may take that 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.530
 we still make big 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:40.450
 the whole thing will be a hiking tour 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.430
 and now that the animals I track 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.010
 once back button gives the keyboard 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.990
 gone now if I have the whole thing now 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.540
 I would like to have a video here 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.720
 the arrow up with the stroke then 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.650
 I can hide the menu 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.770
 turn back to show 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.940
 Meditate brings it out but was here 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.750
 on my starting point the bremer on 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:10.760
 the screen if the next point 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:13.720
 the next point is a point 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.390
 straight next point 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.400
 Now I 'm crazy that can 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.740
 do not undo here with the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.200
 arrow back so here i can do that 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.880
 Undo steps 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.900
 there is no more because I have nothing 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.720
 I've drawn here so now 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.630
 with routine the option this 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.090
 works now but only if I 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.130
 so if i am one online 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.070
 We always have internet connection 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.030
 wireless or via mobile networks 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.330
 the ingenious thing about the whole is it 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.640
 works just like the auto routing 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.989
 Here we have the summit cross from the ice 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.470
 Network reach stone 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:09.880
 I get it on it calculates the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:13.700
 route and so now I have the route 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.250
 which I would like but accepted 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.380
 I want theology here 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.880
 So over here how do I do that 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.329
 now with autor voting 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.120
 it was easy too 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:33.799
 I 'm sitting one point this time 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:39.409
 Crossing let the routing report 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:42.349
 set the next point calculated here 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:50.120
 me the routing now goes over here 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:54.650
 this node now at the hut 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.549
 over we drink or whatever 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.930
 and then up to the summit so one 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.879
 quite ingenious thing 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.120
 the outing there now i save it 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:13.930
 press simply save 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:16.759
 only this trick is saved 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.560
 if I do not see the trick anymore 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:23.960
 I want to close here 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.229
 if I now reload the trick 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.419
 I would like to open orders 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.550
 Rich stone and the trick is back 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.380
 available 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.270
 Do not forget the card offline 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.039
 I make believe available 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.199
 over there is not such a good reception 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:48.050
 if you look at the trick here 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:50.840
 her the green arrows in the direction if 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.539
 you put a track, too 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.030
 Of course, curious how long is how 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.220
 much higher if you still do it etc 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.270
 You can do this in the following way 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.449
 show 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.389
 here on the lent under and how he 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.840
 now here is an arrow 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.900
 to the right that meant her art 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.610
 You do not see this wipe on the left 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.880
 not quite again the arrow 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.159
 down and the ad picture on the 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.509
 See full screen here 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:25.219
 We, for example, we do 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:32.050
 1024 meters altitude we have one 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:32.050
 total length of 44 90 kilometers 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:38.949
 So pretty interesting data and the 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.749
 other data time etc 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.869
 the wm only saved if you have one 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:47.599
 trick records if I still have it 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:51.800
 I see now to the left between 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:56.059
 here a height profile that is also one 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:06:01.459
 ingenious thing depending on where I am 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:05.110
 I will be here now 

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:05.110
 position displayed 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:14.389
 and if I want to know now 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:17.259
 Here it goes down to somewhere again 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.259
 be seen 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:26.779
 So here we go we lose 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.279
 a little height then make one again 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:32.860
 height, so to speak 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.860
 more beer is here but said 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:42.709
 that's actually the highest point 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:44.269
 blue our map would have to now 

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:44.919
 summit cross a bit lower 

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:48.169
 lie 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:51.379
 that was another tutorial now though 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:54.079
 you liked it thumbs up 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:55.369
 If you have questions, add them in the comments 

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:57.589
 definitely 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:07:00.319
 thanks for what we see 

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:05.979
 my next tour or my 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:05.979
 next tutorial silva
