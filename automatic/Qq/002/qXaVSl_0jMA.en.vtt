00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone I hope you meet 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.140
 the best today I'm going to make a video that 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.870
 I had hoped to do since I started climbing 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.090
 videos the video is the top 5 of my 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.160
 pokemon favorites of the sixth generation 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.470
 after this top I'm sure I'll do 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.750
 another top 5 that maybe will be that of the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 strongest of the sixth generation this 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.830
 it's my opinion so do not come with me 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.689
 the bullshit that this is cutest 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 this is better and those things 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 before I started I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 I will put if my or anything of that alone 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.180
 I'm going to put those that it seems to me that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.690
 They have better design if you want to leave me your 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.739
 opinion 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 now if we start number 5 this post 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.120
 takes it trump pull this pokemon 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.309
 is based is a T - rex of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 rock type dragon that is my dinosaur 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.899
 favorite this pokemon not only I like 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.640
 why but for its design that is 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.860
 terrific and also that he has a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 brutal appearance the only point in 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.850
 against is that I do not like his beard very much 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.949
 but even so I think it's a very good 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.280
 pokemon and he deserved this post 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.650
 now we continue with the position number 4 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.140
 number 4 in this position are today verne 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.240
 this pokemon I loved this pokemones 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 dragon flying guy since it came out already 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.810
 I decided to put it on my computer 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 this pokemon besides having a good 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.549
 design your colors fit very well 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.649
 here I give you no bad point but the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.649
 next pokemon yes I loved and 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.200
 I would put them on my team number 3 and the 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.750
 bronze medal is for gold pang a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.240
 pokémon based on a panda this pokemon 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 has sinister fight type a good guy 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.080
 since it does not affect the psychic type 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.060
 another thing that I liked is its design 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.460
 this pokemon without a doubt I put it in my 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.289
 team I will not use it for the fights wifi 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.470
 but for the history of the game what 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.619
 I would use number 2 and the silver medal is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.960
 for xbox a steel type pokémon 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.060
 ghost this pokemon I loved to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.200
 Unlike others I did not like them much 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.149
 your pre-evolutions 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.399
 but this pokemon according to me you have 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.259
 deserved this post this pokemon without 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.940
 doubt I put it on my computer in addition 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.700
 thanks to its ability it can be 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.680
 quite useful in a competitive way 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.229
 number 1 and the pokemon that takes the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.629
 gold is a flame heel 'if 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.970
 this flying type pokemon fire this 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.190
 pokemon has a terrific design plus 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.709
 to own my favorite type the fire type 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.690
 another thing is how powerful is what 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.730
 bad is that I will not use it on my computer anymore 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.650
 I prefer to char it but I would have 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.530
 I put it on my computer I put yes or 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.569
 yes this one has according to me the best brief 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.670
 evolutions and not only that also its 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.620
 form without me I like it but not as much as 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.739
 the normal one for me has a very 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.780
 deserved very well here finished this video 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.849
 It's very short but I did not have anything 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.340
 do so I decided to make this video and 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.079
 to be able to rest a little very well now 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.819
 yes, I say goodbye and I hope you have a 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.819
