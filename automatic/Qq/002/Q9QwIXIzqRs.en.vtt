00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
out that can also cause irritation so

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.830 
out that can also cause irritation so
it's<00:01:59.079> one<00:01:59.350> large<00:01:59.740> pattern<00:02:00.219> piece<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:01.479> really

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
it's one large pattern piece so really

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.490 
it's one large pattern piece so really
thin<00:02:02.110> stream<00:02:02.530> line<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> nice<00:02:04.929> split<00:02:05.319> on

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
thin stream line with a nice split on

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.520 
thin stream line with a nice split on
the<00:02:05.619> side<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.909> fabric<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.929> liner<00:02:08.170> is

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
the side the fabric and the liner is

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.490 
the side the fabric and the liner is
also<00:02:08.679> what<00:02:09.369> we<00:02:09.399> use<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.819> minerality<00:02:10.539> fabric<00:02:11.200> so

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
also what we use a minerality fabric so

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.729 
also what we use a minerality fabric so
you'll<00:02:11.680> see<00:02:11.920> there's<00:02:12.519> an<00:02:12.700> embossed<00:02:13.150> pattern

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
you'll see there's an embossed pattern

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.559 
you'll see there's an embossed pattern
minerally<00:02:14.739> dries<00:02:15.340> fifty<00:02:15.910> percent<00:02:16.239> faster

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
minerally dries fifty percent faster

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.289 
minerally dries fifty percent faster
than<00:02:17.049> normal<00:02:17.230> performance<00:02:18.130> polyesters<00:02:19.090> as

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
than normal performance polyesters as

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.270 
than normal performance polyesters as
well<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:19.959> its<00:02:20.140> anti-odor<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.280> antimicrobial

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
well as its anti-odor and antimicrobial

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.580 
well as its anti-odor and antimicrobial
so<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.459> is<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.819> shorter<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.510> see<00:02:25.780> we<00:02:26.410> also

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
so this is the shorter and see we also

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.220 
so this is the shorter and see we also
offer<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.340> longer<00:02:27.879> inseam<00:02:28.329> those<00:02:28.660> looking<00:02:29.170> for

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
offer a longer inseam those looking for

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.800 
offer a longer inseam those looking for
a<00:02:29.410> little<00:02:29.620> bit<00:02:29.860> more<00:02:30.129> compression<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.480> kind

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
a little bit more compression it's kind

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.710 
a little bit more compression it's kind
of<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.110> two-in-one<00:02:32.620> short<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.000> we<00:02:34.269> actually

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
of a two-in-one short so we actually

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.559 
of a two-in-one short so we actually
don't<00:02:34.870> wrap<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.440> entire<00:02:35.560> shell<00:02:36.310> around<00:02:36.819> we

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
don't wrap the entire shell around we

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.020 
don't wrap the entire shell around we
finish<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.110> before<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.650> inseam<00:02:39.250> construction

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
finish it before the inseam construction

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.270 
finish it before the inseam construction
just<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.930> don't<00:02:41.049> have<00:02:41.290> any<00:02:41.349> shaping<00:02:42.160> or

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
just so you don't have any shaping or

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.699 
just so you don't have any shaping or
bunching<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:42.940> in<00:02:43.150> between<00:02:43.629> your<00:02:43.780> legs<00:02:43.989> while

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
bunching up in between your legs while

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.250 
bunching up in between your legs while
running<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.910> definitely<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.569> much<00:02:46.900> longer

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
running so definitely a much longer

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.220 
running so definitely a much longer
inseam<00:02:47.950> compression<00:02:48.819> around<00:02:49.120> your<00:02:49.720> muscles

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
inseam compression around your muscles

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.190 
inseam compression around your muscles
and<00:02:50.590> then<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.130> does<00:02:51.340> have<00:02:51.609> our<00:02:51.819> same<00:02:52.200> patent

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and then it does have our same patent

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.920 
and then it does have our same patent
pending<00:02:53.579> utility<00:02:54.579> construction<00:02:55.359> across<00:02:55.600> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
pending utility construction across the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.229 
pending utility construction across the
back<00:02:56.109> for<00:02:56.440> your<00:02:56.530> gel<00:02:56.799> class<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.459> nice<00:02:57.970> large

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
back for your gel class a nice large

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.420 
back for your gel class a nice large
pocket<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.139> the<00:02:59.230> back<00:02:59.260> you<00:03:00.130> could<00:03:00.280> actually

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
pocket in the back you could actually

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.610 
pocket in the back you could actually
stop<00:03:01.060> some<00:03:01.359> of<00:03:01.389> our<00:03:01.630> vests<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.170> lightweight

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
stop some of our vests and lightweight

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.410 
stop some of our vests and lightweight
jackets<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.459> they'll<00:03:03.609> fit<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.030> this<00:03:04.150> back

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
jackets and they'll fit in this back

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.809 
jackets and they'll fit in this back
pocket

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
pocket

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.119 
pocket
so<00:03:07.299> those<00:03:07.510> are<00:03:07.659> two<00:03:07.870> ultra<00:03:08.469> shorts<00:03:08.829> for<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
so those are two ultra shorts for the

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.250 
so those are two ultra shorts for the
season<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.790> split<00:03:10.090> short<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.629> then<00:03:10.719> ultra

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
season the split short and then ultra

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.560 
season the split short and then ultra
short
