00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hi guys 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.260
 today I'll show you a job that 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.650
 you can do it yourself you are correct 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:19.650
 very simple a little more now you can do 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:21.660
 make the courtesy light work 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.810
 door from opening the door 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.590
 as you all know all 5 goals do n't 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.539
 let's practically not turn on then 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 having disassembled the panels 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.870
 I also had to say the led with from 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:43.430
 the red one this blue also 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.430
 those inside as you see as long 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.460
 the car inside that is brighter 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.460
 change all more 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:14.840
 a very simple job with the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:18.500
 red led strip itself is a place of 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.119
 they applied it below however you must 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.119
 only to express 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.880
 so these these beds you see lit. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.890
 they go out as soon as the door is closed 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.460
 with them that remain connected to the cables 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.460
 the righteous 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:56.960
 as you can see I show you videos at 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.450
 port of this unfortunately cannot 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:15.130
 open because I have not given space I do 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:21.500
 see the front one with the other thing 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:33.410
 because for that it mounts the led of the type 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:37.280
 these like these all surely 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.709
 have encountered problem problem wants 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.550
 say that it is the and just barely remain 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.110
 I turned on instead to solve the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.920
 problem 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:56.420
 here in the center put on all of them 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:02.120
 all four echo to put these 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:05.410
 center omitted or led with only 1 like this 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.410
 so that they are not all turned on 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:21.370
 that's all if you need 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.370
 write me well here all thanks hello
