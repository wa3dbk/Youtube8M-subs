00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:14.500
 here is a silo pit and honor 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.500
 this gray corn is the collected stage 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.260
 milky wax freshness now we 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.630
 let's get closer 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.999
 it means that the pit is covered interestingly 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.619
 poured mixture 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.619
 molasses with some kind of resin and 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:38.469
 respectively, but the fact that that's firmly 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.469
 horror is animals closer now 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:51.970
 here it is possible so now i look like 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.950
 so this is corn gathered in 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:00.010
 dairy stage milky wax 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:02.670
 the freshness and the power of the savanna he and 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.670
 take a look 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:17.460
 so on we go 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:21.360
 silo usually go through now also all 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.840
 it's flooded over with such a resin that is 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.289
 no film it's all eaten up then 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.479
 animals now they have opened now 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:38.159
 it's cold outside so that's why it's all 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:41.520
 it does not spoil here the smell well mold by the way 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.270
 songs a little present if you can 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.610
 see but it is almost dry that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:57.000
 getting practically dry 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:05.850
 there is little to look at mold 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:09.600
 In apparently not on this occasion and listen and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:14.730
 this is not mold this is ice this is not mold and 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.950
 tobet mold no it's ice now 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:24.660
 decent minus is unity which 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:33.510
 apparently remained frozen and the last 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:41.240
 let's go corn residue 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:48.770
 after receiving bioethanol here it is bright 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:53.020
 yellow here is a bunch that is it 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.020
 not even a silo probably all the same and this 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:04.910
 just yes it's wet i mean it after 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.290
 the process of obtaining bioethanol here 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.290
 squeeze now i sniff 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.290
 smell 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.349
 It tastes very good for good
