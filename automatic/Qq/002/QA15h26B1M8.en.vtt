00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:14.219
 today the whole Christian world is celebrating 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.730

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.369
 bright resurrection easter 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.710
 God gave us a personal example 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.410
 my hope of salvation 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.679
 After all, Christ is resurrected, and in this is 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.269
 the whole point of our faith 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.339
 when on good friday on the mountain 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.760
 Calvary was crucified by Christ 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:39.089
 his pupil was asked to remove Pontius Pilate 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.379
 your favorite teacher with christ and 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:45.159
 buried him in a cave 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.500
 the entrance to the grotto was closed with a large stone and 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.820
 order of the high priests and about so 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.040
 guard the warriors 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.059
 lest they steal the body of christ 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.000
 followers 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.809
 and then they did not submit it all so 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.750
 jesus rose after the sabbath 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.560
 coffin came to the Lord mourning maria 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.060
 magdalene and the other mary they brought with 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.540
 an aromatic oil 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.149
 the world and to anoint the body of jesus as 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.600
 it was supposed to but suddenly happened 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:19.719
 earthquake and come down angel of the Lord with 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.850
 heaven pushed the coffin stone sat on it 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.079
 and said no fear 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.280
 for I know that you are seeking Jesus crucified 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.429
 he is not here he was resurrected as he said 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.039
 come up 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.219
 see the place where the Lord lay 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.530
 go rather tell his disciples what 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.049
 he rose from the dead 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.780
 astonished women went to look and 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.210
 surprised even more when they saw that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.240
 the coffin is really empty 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.880
 in the cave there is only cloth in which 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.700
 was wrapped Jesus and his head 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.729
 a handkerchief and they remembered the words of the savior 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.640
 that he spoke to them more than once and resurrection 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.369
 three days after death 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.320
 great sadness replaced great 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.950
 joy indeed is christ 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.580
 resurrected and ran women happy 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.850
 news to the apostles the apostles stayed in 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.600
 deep sorrow for their teacher died and 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.980
 he was dying with terrible words oh my god 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:29.930
 why did you leave me and nothing 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.660
 inspired hope in them and here the student 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.500
 Christ told by the Apostle joyful 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.590
 news 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.470
 but the apostles did not immediately believe in this miracle 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.930
 because she was simply not subject to them 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.850
 human mind they tightly 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.970
 locked in the house in order to discuss 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.150
 what happened and suddenly quite unexpectedly in 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.920
 room came in lord got up my 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.950
 and the world told you the apostles rejoiced 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.690
 and go preach the good news to all 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.660
 peace and christ 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.340
 yet more than once appeared to his students 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.420
 on the fortieth day after his 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.100
 resurrection 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.959
 did not ascend to heaven with your resurrection 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.130
 Christ gave people to comprehend the truth 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.790
 his deity 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.880
 the truth of his high teachings 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.070
 the salvation of his death and 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.579
 resurrection of Christ is the completion of it 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.090
 life feat no other end 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.489
 be 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.150
 for it is a direct consequence of the moral 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.150
 meaning of the life of Christ 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.040
