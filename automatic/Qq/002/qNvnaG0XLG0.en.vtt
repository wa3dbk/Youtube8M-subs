00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hello, we continue our 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.080
 workouts in stock and today we 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.889
 training your legs and biceps to start us 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.540
 need to change clothes 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.120
 because training in this form is not 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.990
 very well we can sweat afterwards 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.830
 smell bad the rest of the workers and 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 so we changed clothes 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.150
 I recommend using just 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.800
 T-shirt that you take to work 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.779
 take off your shirt wear a t-shirt 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.480
 takes 15 seconds to get dressed 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.279
 decent clothes for a tie let's get down to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.200
 our training today we have balance 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.790
 board tell you about it this is such a board 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.239
 made of plywood from both sides 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 stops under did not slide off and as 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.690
 roller we use yoji we will 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.530
 use biceps for training 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:56.699
 we put on an outfit and start to train 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.469
 if you can't stand right away 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:05.790
 use some support and hold 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:08.880
 for example, how do I get when 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.119
 felt confident and she already 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.610
 stopped jumping out from under my feet 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.610
 let go begin 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.220
 do these movements gradually we 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.250
 gain experience usually it comes 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.159
 somewhere for the second or third training and 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:36.840
 we can already move around the board to fall 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:41.990
 not so on so we proceed to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.409
 training biceps take our projectile and 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.590
 we start the ascent and from the vesa offer 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:54.740
 first do the hammer exercise begin 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:00.360
 lift just to the top position 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.140
 do about 5-7 repetitions after which 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.009
 we start at the end to make a U-turn and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.250
 turn feels like we have biceps 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.100
 poured blood after he we 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.050
 we feel that there is no more strength left 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.050
 We do a couple more reps not 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.640
 forget to do the same for another 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.230
 hands then one hand will grow and the second 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.110
 will be a little remind once again 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.420
 doing 10 12 repetitions in the amount of somewhere 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.430
 from 3 to 5 approaches depending on 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.810
