00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
came from a YouTube commenter where they

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.900 
came from a YouTube commenter where they
have<00:00:16.080> ribs<00:00:16.410> 55<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.430> he<00:00:17.520> knows<00:00:17.640> where<00:00:17.820> those

in<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.529> mood<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.830> some<00:00:20.010> good<00:00:20.699> barbecue<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
in the mood for some good barbecue and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.359 
in the mood for some good barbecue and
even<00:00:21.810> he<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:22.050> looking<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:23.340> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
even he was looking for a way to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.220 
even he was looking for a way to
transfer<00:00:24.060> files<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> drive<00:00:24.900> without

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
transfer files to the drive without

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.810 
transfer files to the drive without
having<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.590> go<00:00:25.680> over<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> network<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.550> did

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
having to go over the network so we did

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.000 
having to go over the network so we did
a<00:00:26.849> benchmark<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.539> our<00:00:27.660> last<00:00:27.869> update<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
a benchmark in our last update with the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.250 
a benchmark in our last update with the
network<00:00:29.340> right<00:00:29.550> speeds<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> way

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
network right speeds but there is a way

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
network right speeds but there is a way
actually<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.830> connect<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> drive<00:00:32.759> via<00:00:33.120> its

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
actually to connect to the drive via its

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.120 
actually to connect to the drive via its
USB<00:00:33.690> port<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.380> can't<00:00:34.649> hook<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
USB port and you can't hook it up to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.709 
USB port and you can't hook it up to
your<00:00:35.160> computer<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.390> take<00:00:36.570> an

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
your computer but you can take an

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.630 
your computer but you can take an
external<00:00:37.170> drive<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.710> plug<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.370> so

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
external drive and just plug it in so

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.610 
external drive and just plug it in so
you'll<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.420> over<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:39.899> data<00:00:40.230> center

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you'll see over here in my data center

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
you'll see over here in my data center
if<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.890> call<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
if you call it that I have one of the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.180 
if you call it that I have one of the
solid<00:00:42.780> state<00:00:42.960> disks<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.410> use<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> record<00:00:44.010> this

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
solid state disks I use to record this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
solid state disks I use to record this
show<00:00:44.430> hooked<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> drives<00:00:45.539> USB<00:00:45.989> port

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
show hooked up to the drives USB port

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.440 
show hooked up to the drives USB port
and<00:00:46.469> there's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> couple<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> ways<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.910> transfer

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and there's a couple of ways to transfer

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.000 
and there's a couple of ways to transfer
files<00:00:48.600> without<00:00:48.930> using<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> network<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
files without using the network the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.970 
files without using the network the
first<00:00:50.039> way<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.449> use<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.960> app<00:00:51.989> which<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
first way is to use the app which is the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
first way is to use the app which is the
desktop<00:00:53.579> app<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.149> suppose<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.570> could<00:00:54.719> do

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
desktop app and I suppose you could do

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.760 
desktop app and I suppose you could do
this<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:56.070> other<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.489> also<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.120> that

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
this on the other one also the one that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.930 
this on the other one also the one that
the<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> use<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> mobile

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the one that you use on the mobile

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.970 
the one that you use on the mobile
devices<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.600> basically<00:01:01.410> all<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
devices but basically all you all you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.670 
devices but basically all you all you
need<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.850> select<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.629> file<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
need to do is just select the file go to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.670 
need to do is just select the file go to
copy<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.970> paste<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
copy and then just paste it into the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.200 
copy and then just paste it into the
folder<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> want<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> put<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> into<00:01:09.030> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
folder that you want to put it into so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.850 
folder that you want to put it into so
I'll<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.510> stick<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> into<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:10.170> public<00:01:10.830> folder

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
I'll just stick it into my public folder

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
I'll just stick it into my public folder
here<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.610> paste<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.689> it'll<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:13.049> over

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
here just paste it and it'll go over

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.390 
here just paste it and it'll go over
really<00:01:13.560> quickly<00:01:13.890> because<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> pretty

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
really quickly because it's a pretty

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
really quickly because it's a pretty
small<00:01:14.520> file<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.299> transferred<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
small file that we just transferred and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.410 
small file that we just transferred and
there<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.560> 8.3<00:01:17.100> megabytes<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> flash

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
there it is 8.3 megabytes in in a flash

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.200 
there it is 8.3 megabytes in in a flash
so<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.200> hard<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> benchmark<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
so it's hard to benchmark this because I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
so it's hard to benchmark this because I
don't<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> way<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.409> timing<00:01:22.680> exactly<00:01:23.369> when

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
don't have a way of timing exactly when

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.010 
don't have a way of timing exactly when
the<00:01:23.640> file<00:01:23.820> transfer<00:01:24.090> ends<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.630> doesn't<00:01:24.869> give

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the file transfer ends it doesn't give

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.390 
the file transfer ends it doesn't give
you<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.680> app<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> doesn't<00:01:26.189> give<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> any

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you in the app it doesn't give you any

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
you in the app it doesn't give you any
kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.720> bar<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.140> indicate<00:01:28.530> how<00:01:28.680> long

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
kind of little bar to indicate how long

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100 
kind of little bar to indicate how long

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it's taking for the file to transfer but

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.109 
it's taking for the file to transfer but
there's<00:01:31.290> another<00:01:31.680> way<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.369> let<00:01:32.820> me<00:01:32.880> show<00:01:33.030> you

there's another way and let me show you

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.550 
there's another way and let me show you
how<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> set<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.200> we're<00:01:34.320> going

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
how to set this up and then we're going

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
how to set this up and then we're going
to<00:01:34.590> pop<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.840> I'm

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
to pop in there and get it going and I'm

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
to pop in there and get it going and I'm
doing<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.320> haven't<00:01:37.680> done<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.070> yet<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.490> you're

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
doing I haven't done this yet so you're

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760

going to be stepping along with me as we

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
going to be stepping along with me as we
do<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.280> let's<00:01:41.939> let's<00:01:42.240> skip<00:01:42.479> back<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.930> our

when you have root access to a Linux

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.930 
when you have root access to a Linux
machine<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.260> wipe<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
machine you can wipe it out and and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.970 
machine you can wipe it out and and
wreak<00:02:27.239> all<00:02:27.420> sorts<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.900> havoc<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.319> there<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:28.739> if

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
wreak all sorts of havoc on there so if

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.830 
wreak all sorts of havoc on there so if
you<00:02:29.099> don't<00:02:29.130> really<00:02:29.580> know<00:02:29.940> Linux<00:02:30.300> -<00:02:30.450> well<00:02:30.600> my

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you don't really know Linux - well my

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.170 
you don't really know Linux - well my
suggestion<00:02:31.350> would<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.860> get<00:02:32.069> play<00:02:32.790> around<00:02:33.000> a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
suggestion would be to get play around a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.030 
suggestion would be to get play around a
little<00:02:33.300> bit<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:35.010> know

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
little bit with it and you know

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.680 
little bit with it and you know
somewhere<00:02:35.400> else<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:36.030> something<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.420> can't

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
somewhere else on something you can't

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.570 
somewhere else on something you can't
you're<00:02:37.110> not<00:02:37.140> worried<00:02:37.380> about<00:02:37.500> breaking<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.220> then

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
you're not worried about breaking I then

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.340 
you're not worried about breaking I then
come<00:02:38.819> back<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.239> use<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.540> I'm<00:02:39.660> I'm<00:02:39.870> kind<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.260> a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
come back and use it I'm I'm kind of a

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.870 
come back and use it I'm I'm kind of a
Linux<00:02:40.650> novice<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.310> know<00:02:41.400> enough<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> be

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
Linux novice but I know enough to be

Linux novice but I know enough to be
dangerous<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.600> we're<00:02:42.750> going<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> do<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.230> pop

to<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:56.580> careful<00:02:56.760> here<00:02:57.090> because<00:02:57.120> now<00:02:57.510> we

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
to be really careful here because now we

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.470 
to be really careful here because now we
have<00:02:57.840> root<00:02:58.110> access<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.790> little<00:03:00.180> drive

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
have root access to this little drive

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.600 
have root access to this little drive
here<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.110> we<00:03:01.739> can<00:03:01.890> just<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> directory

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
here so we can just do a directory

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.860 
here so we can just do a directory
search<00:03:02.790> where<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.120> dumps<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.630> kind<00:03:03.810> of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
search where it dumps you is kind of

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.500 
search where it dumps you is kind of
into<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> root<00:03:04.799> user<00:03:05.100> file<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.269> don't

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
into the root user file so you don't

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.640 
into the root user file so you don't
really<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:06.750> anything<00:03:07.049> right<00:03:07.319> when<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.530> get

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
really have anything right when you get

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
really have anything right when you get
in<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.760> run<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> little<00:03:09.180> command<00:03:09.569> here

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
in but you can run a little command here

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.120 
in but you can run a little command here
and<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.989> see<00:03:10.140> what's<00:03:10.319> running<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.860> device

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
and to see what's running on the device

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.970 
and to see what's running on the device
so<00:03:11.400> you'll<00:03:11.940> see<00:03:12.090> we<00:03:12.209> have<00:03:12.239> about<00:03:12.569> 500<00:03:13.200> Meg's<00:03:13.799> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
so you'll see we have about 500 Meg's of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.550 
so you'll see we have about 500 Meg's of
RAM<00:03:14.040> total<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.540> it's<00:03:15.840> got<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.019> web<00:03:16.350> server

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
RAM total and it's got a web server

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.199 
RAM total and it's got a web server
running<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.040> here<00:03:17.190> Apache<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.910> few<00:03:18.090> other

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
running on here Apache and a few other

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.460 
running on here Apache and a few other
things<00:03:18.299> it's<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:19.079> pretty<00:03:19.260> neat<00:03:19.440> little

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
things it's a pretty neat little

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.009 
things it's a pretty neat little
embedded<00:03:20.459> device<00:03:20.760> here<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.269> we're<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:21.959> to

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
embedded device here so we're going to

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.000 
embedded device here so we're going to
do<00:03:22.109> is<00:03:22.200> just<00:03:22.320> go<00:03:22.410> out<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.680> root<00:03:22.890> directory

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
do is just go out to the root directory

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.910 
do is just go out to the root directory
here<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.700> can<00:03:23.820> see<00:03:24.060> all<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.780> our<00:03:25.200> shares

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
here and you can see all of our shares

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.310 
here and you can see all of our shares
here<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.400> think<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.269> files<00:03:27.630> we<00:03:27.900> want<00:03:28.170> are

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
here and I think the files we want are

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.569 
here and I think the files we want are
in<00:03:28.350> data<00:03:28.709> volume<00:03:30.890> shares<00:03:31.890> yep<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.400> go<00:03:32.519> to

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
in data volume shares yep so go to

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.750 
in data volume shares yep so go to
shares<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.980> as<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.070> can<00:03:35.160> see<00:03:35.220> here<00:03:35.609> we<00:03:35.730> have

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
shares and as you can see here we have

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.819 
shares and as you can see here we have
everything<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:36.810> could<00:03:36.989> see<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.500> web

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
everything that we could see on the web

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.580 
everything that we could see on the web
app<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.239> directory<00:03:39.720> structure<00:03:40.049> here<00:03:40.410> so

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
app in the directory structure here so

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.199 
app in the directory structure here so
what<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.040> going<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.340> though<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.519> pop<00:03:41.880> over

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
what I'm going to do though is pop over

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.170 
what I'm going to do though is pop over
to<00:03:42.359> video<00:03:43.160> SSD<00:03:44.160> -<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.980> I'm<00:03:47.880> going<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.150> a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
to video SSD - and I'm going to do a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.789 
to video SSD - and I'm going to do a
directory<00:03:48.690> there<00:03:48.900> alright<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:49.530> I've<00:03:49.620> got<00:03:49.650> a

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
directory there alright so I've got a

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.550 
directory there alright so I've got a
two<00:03:50.070> gigabyte<00:03:50.280> file<00:03:50.820> on<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.450> SSD<00:03:51.810> drive<00:03:52.260> and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
two gigabyte file on the SSD drive and

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.180 
two gigabyte file on the SSD drive and
it's<00:03:52.650> called<00:03:52.950> capture<00:03:53.640> 0<00:03:54.000> 0<00:03:54.269> 3<00:03:54.630> mov<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.829> a<00:03:56.010> plop

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
it's called capture 0 0 3 mov and a plop

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.710 
it's called capture 0 0 3 mov and a plop
a<00:03:56.280> little<00:03:56.459> timer<00:03:56.670> here<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.390> what<00:03:57.510> we're<00:03:57.600> going

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
a little timer here and what we're going

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.130 
a little timer here and what we're going
to<00:03:57.780> do<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.319> copy<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:59.130> file<00:03:59.430> from<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.660> SSD

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
to do is copy that file from the SSD

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.280 
to do is copy that file from the SSD
drive<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.640> public<00:04:03.030> share<00:04:03.269> on<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:04.049> drive

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
drive to the public share on the drive

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.449 
drive to the public share on the drive
and<00:04:04.470> I've<00:04:04.530> got<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> timer<00:04:04.980> here<00:04:05.160> I'm<00:04:05.250> going<00:04:05.370> to

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
and I've got a timer here I'm going to

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.920 
and I've got a timer here I'm going to
hit<00:04:05.700> at<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.970> same<00:04:06.000> time<00:04:06.450> we're<00:04:06.630> going<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.780> see

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
hit at the same time we're going to see

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.990 
hit at the same time we're going to see
how<00:04:07.049> long<00:04:07.109> it<00:04:07.440> takes<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:08.370> copy<00:04:08.579> that<00:04:08.819> 2

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
how long it takes to copy that 2

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:21.420 
how long it takes to copy that 2
gigabyte<00:04:09.480> files<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.170> here<00:04:10.560> we<00:04:10.829> go

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.850 

okay<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.300> looks<00:04:22.479> like<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.870> took<00:04:22.900> just<00:04:23.710> under

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
okay so it looks like it took just under

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.610 
okay so it looks like it took just under
a<00:04:24.040> minute<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.850> copy<00:04:25.330> two<00:04:25.780> gigabytes<00:04:26.410> which

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
a minute to copy two gigabytes which

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.890 
a minute to copy two gigabytes which
isn't<00:04:26.800> too<00:04:26.979> bad<00:04:27.009> and<00:04:27.430> that's<00:04:27.720> completely<00:04:28.720> off

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
isn't too bad and that's completely off

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.290 
isn't too bad and that's completely off
the<00:04:28.930> network<00:04:29.259> so<00:04:29.560> you're<00:04:29.650> able<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.889> do<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:31.060> I

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
the network so you're able to do that I

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.730 
the network so you're able to do that I
think<00:04:31.539> if<00:04:31.900> you<00:04:32.020> were<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.229> do<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:32.470> through<00:04:32.650> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
think if you were to do it through the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.200 
think if you were to do it through the
app<00:04:32.889> it<00:04:33.130> would<00:04:33.190> probably<00:04:33.400> be<00:04:33.639> about<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:34.030> same

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
app it would probably be about the same

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.360 
app it would probably be about the same
amount<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.509> time<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:35.080> also<00:04:35.770> will<00:04:35.949> be<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.100> little

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
amount of time and also will be a little

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.770 
amount of time and also will be a little
bit<00:04:36.460> safer<00:04:36.880> because<00:04:37.060> you're<00:04:37.389> not<00:04:37.539> risking

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
bit safer because you're not risking

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.920 
bit safer because you're not risking
blowing<00:04:38.740> up<00:04:38.889> your<00:04:39.070> entire<00:04:39.400> hard<00:04:39.789> drive<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:40.870> the

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
blowing up your entire hard drive in the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.249 
blowing up your entire hard drive in the
course<00:04:41.259> of<00:04:42.300> doing<00:04:43.300> some<00:04:43.570> quicker<00:04:43.930> file

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
course of doing some quicker file

access with those and I suppose you

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.210 
access with those and I suppose you

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
could go in and use some more Linux

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.830 
could go in and use some more Linux

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
users that don't have root access so you

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.820 
users that don't have root access so you
can<00:05:07.030> more<00:05:07.210> safely<00:05:07.630> move<00:05:07.930> files<00:05:08.169> around<00:05:08.410> on<00:05:08.710> the

drive but Western Digital says you will
void<00:05:11.199> your<00:05:11.410> warranty<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.949> more<00:05:12.130> that<00:05:12.220> you

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
void your warranty the more that you

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.580 
void your warranty the more that you
muck<00:05:12.580> around<00:05:12.729> in<00:05:13.030> there<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.449> I<00:05:13.630> would<00:05:14.139> be<00:05:14.320> very

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
muck around in there so I would be very

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.879 
muck around in there so I would be very
very<00:05:14.770> careful<00:05:15.280> using<00:05:16.150> that<00:05:16.449> terminal<00:05:17.349> option

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
very careful using that terminal option

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.070 
very careful using that terminal option
but<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.400> do<00:05:18.669> have<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.419> does<00:05:19.570> work<00:05:19.870> and

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
but you do have it and it does work and

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.379 
but you do have it and it does work and
it<00:05:20.169> can<00:05:20.199> be<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.220> great<00:05:21.520> way<00:05:21.550> to<00:05:21.729> we're<00:05:22.240> very

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
it can be a great way to we're very

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.900 
it can be a great way to we're very
quickly<00:05:22.780> move<00:05:23.199> your<00:05:23.410> files<00:05:23.680> over<00:05:24.160> when<00:05:24.789> you're

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
quickly move your files over when you're

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.060 
quickly move your files over when you're
first<00:05:25.120> setting<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.660> drive<00:05:25.900> up<00:05:26.139> so<00:05:26.410> I<00:05:26.620> hope

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
first setting the drive up so I hope

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.960 
first setting the drive up so I hope
that<00:05:27.280> answered<00:05:27.639> some<00:05:27.760> of<00:05:27.820> your<00:05:27.880> questions

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
that answered some of your questions

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.850 
that answered some of your questions
will<00:05:28.539> do<00:05:28.690> another<00:05:28.870> follow<00:05:29.169> up<00:05:29.380> in<00:05:29.500> a<00:05:29.560> few<00:05:29.710> days

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
will do another follow up in a few days

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.250 
will do another follow up in a few days
with<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.699> digital<00:05:31.180> camera<00:05:31.449> plugging<00:05:31.930> into<00:05:32.050> it

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
with a digital camera plugging into it

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.110 
with a digital camera plugging into it
also<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.620> see<00:05:32.830> how<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:33.099> works<00:05:33.580> this<00:05:33.820> is<00:05:33.970> LAN

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
also to see how that works this is LAN

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.920 
also to see how that works this is LAN
Simon<00:05:34.599> thanks<00:05:34.780> for<00:05:34.900> watching
