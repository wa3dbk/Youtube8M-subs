00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.800
 Photo La Reja in the Gallen year 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.939
 yes, now I have wonderful too 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.059
 Fortuna Dusseldorf wins against Babelsberg a very important game 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.230
 the last home game in IT your energy that it is not that they still 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.489
 once again welcome here in verse form is Addis Ababa 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.339
 Ethiopia has even taken care of me and that is the coach Uwe 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.569
 Klein and Claus Costa of course want to prepare a few more questions 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:31.659
 Play until 10 o'clock 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.420
 the way over the Anderson the first question goes of course to the coach 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.610
 now wants to have the end game which we all still hoped 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.930
 this even the mood inside 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.060
 right today 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.570
 after the game that was very very positive because 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.830
 This is where the game was going to win today and it will be one 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.600
 Have minimal chance 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 the one in Erfurt where everyone had hoped for it and so rolled one must then the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.690
 Erfurtern sometimes a big thank you saying that they are already 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.190
 always fully reingekniet have us since such a play to allow 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.769
 you have to wait how she knees next week 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640
 that is another topic of the municipality right back Klaus 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.130
 Defense was also a lot 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.140
 Janka switched back and forth you have Sedanplatz doctors suddenly recognizes 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.400
 fourth saw the game today 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.320
 yes, I think we wanted to show percent from the first minute 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 Today we want to make our place there 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.180
 among other things also played forwards powerfully 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.530
 I do not have the penalty then 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.560
 has entered because that is it must be given more peace but 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.310
 Percent Super Rainer Sachse just before halftime around the 1 0 makes me 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.690
 think that has us drive the trust of the look further 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.120
 but that was van der Geest 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.170
 There was a smaller one in between 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.460
 the depth do not want to go into it that way 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.500
 with the games in Almaty way and Aalen had percent still after that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 believed I already feel or 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.040
 In any case, we always knew about the Berliner Wasserwerke 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.080
 should 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.410
 there must have been a bit of blaring flames under Munzel 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.100
 made that in the last few weeks that's going to gas and me 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.320
 just think in Dortmund Lohse 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.640
 another Russell Simmons shown to be good at and around his lock since then 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.689
 or in the storm 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.539
 for it also a luxury problem 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.139
 Since 1 clock play because all strikers are back on board what was then percent 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.459
 Ultimately, it was crucial for everyone to have played 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.079
 the expansion selection will finally yield percent 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.790
 It is certainly always about training and percent today 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.059
 you have seen the underarm but he has made his two goals and in the end 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.569
 It does not matter who percent on the court in the square 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.750
 In the end everybody wants to win and people have shown that to them 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.059
 Guys really well done 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.309
 and of course that certainly starts him at the goalie position 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.980
 The result of this is that baa2 leaves are annoyed again 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.739
 also the training performance 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.379
 Nomos announces that after the injury of Michael Melka their Michael Rapp 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.960
 everyday life 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.769
 got his chance and sat down 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.730
 Percent of the games we played also very successfully contested and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.829
 Percent lost no game so far 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.649
 there are no in the moment 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:02.399
 not great arguments to say something different and accordingly 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.869
 it will also be that Sal Michelle probably finds by until 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:05.659
 ending 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.149
 okay Docs Emscherbruch Boss Erfurt addressed 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.249
 in Erfurt a good old acquaintance of her Dennis Wolf 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.249
 who sends the game classic or SMS 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.639
 yes, I do not just believe the skinny saddle is up and ministers are 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.439
 Come new pieces of Mr. from the whole crew with the Bombardier 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.280
 but were nevertheless nonetheless 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.079
 but the Karsten Baumann after the course to 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.989
 still graduated April gave him was still has a game in Bösinghoven 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.519
 and then spoke again and said her know-how 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.379
 because really really unfortunate on my part from Unna den 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.189
 Great regards that they really did that again 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.719
 soft percent all the time Antenne Düsseldorf heard her about 90 minutes 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.729
 Conference call and am happy 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.719
 in the last few minutes still a few 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.290
 Mr. death could be dead that was very close anyway you have to 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.459
 say 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.299
 Union Berlin also does not have this big runaway victory 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.620
 they are going to try everything that boughs might be such a big advantage 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.989
 for us or 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.449
 yes of course that is an advantage for us but happiness for us he is only 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.979
 decisive that we win in Erfurt that we are on our duty 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.239
 Focus and make countries what we could try to win today 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.099
 after the final whistle Guttenberg left what they mean 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.850
 and that's going to be a lot of Dusseldorp for sure 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.390
 Anyone who told me ten thousand like that should be and I believe very firmly 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.390
 tuned or maybe so small on Sunday is difficult before the last one 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.950
 Game day to man I know what you have achieved but still around the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.129
 Qualification was the first goal 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.129
 The duel it was done relatively sovereign now, of course, you want synonymous 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.129
 the climb how satisfied are you with the course 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.219
 I think if that 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.539
 for expensive probe say that we have a final game on the final day 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.629
 Mr. after after the course of the season like that in the end, then so everything 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.899
 come that process very many team after up to ten teams in the 

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:49.699
 Ear one point two points distance 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.210
 Ada had each other 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.419
 Percent was in the run-up already relatively early clear that the 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.220
 probably on the final day would be decided because of that 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.920
 I'm happy with that and I hope so 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.919
 that now many Dusseldorf 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.639
 to fill the stadium where in Erfurt without us says »strongly support so 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.669
 that we then afterwards just the minimum what valuable or of 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:10.939
 can reach 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.129
 who then for the dream finally then all there then experience what is 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:15.029
 everyone wishes 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.199
 Well we will definitely follow it 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.499
 I can promise you that impossibility many many Düsseldorfer 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:23.430
 the water has been many thanks to both of you i think so nice 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.860
 from which I cover the couple the water can set aside 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.159
 still alcohol-free one understands still right old yes I thank you 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.379
 very much for the small score, of course, for their attention 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.810
 here m verscom follows from the knowledge veltins-arena at this point see us 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:39.919

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.280
