00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.349
 placement and adjustment of the confusion is 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.349
 set off jogging for horses 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.780
 first of all let's prepare the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:42.180
 helmet making sure it's clean 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.180
 both on the floor and the walls 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.280
 then with the shoe already open what 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.640
 we present the toe helmet and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.910
 First 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.130
 ensure that it is the center and the finger is 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.360
 together well to the front 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.460
 then we will support the house on the ground 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.790
 we want the weight of the horses in the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.790
 pasta 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.399
 closing both sides of Velcro 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 taking in the back tape of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.630
 guard we passed it through the ring 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.520
 red through the two rings of 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.119
 metal 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.119
 and then back through a ring 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.250
 now squeeze the tape and pass again 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.250
 through the red and the inside 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 reflective 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.920
 now let's tighten the tapes 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.920
 lead 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.940
 just before the end of squeezing it 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.430
 like to pass on itself in order to 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.519
 keep the excess orderly 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.849
 then we will use the adjustment 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.849
 final 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.200
 here we have the echo in fusion shoes 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.200
 jogging face to horses ready to go 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.340
 to remove the confusion make sure 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.629
 that the horse has its weight in the letter 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.140
 and taking from the side tie simply 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:54.640
 pull gently and the seat of the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.799
 guard opens to the front 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.470
 press the buckle with one hand and 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.980
 raise with the other to facilitate 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.980
 opening 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.150
 Equation can be rinsed with the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.420
 hose or even washing in the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.939
 machine at 40 degrees but it always 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.939
 let dry out of sunlight
