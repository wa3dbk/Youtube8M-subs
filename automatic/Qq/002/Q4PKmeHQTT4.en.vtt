probably<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.960> lot<00:00:01.140> of<00:00:01.290> ways<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.680> do<00:00:01.800> bicep

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
probably a lot of ways to do bicep

tricep<00:00:02.760> on<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.030> playground<00:00:03.510> many<00:00:03.929> ways<00:00:04.110> I

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
tricep on the playground many ways I

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.200 
tricep on the playground many ways I
could<00:00:04.290> show<00:00:04.589> you<00:00:04.620> where<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:04.980> actually

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
could show you where I actually

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.030 
could show you where I actually
incorporate<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> lot<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.779> equipment<00:00:07.040> let

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
incorporate a lot of the equipment let

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.259 
incorporate a lot of the equipment let
me<00:00:08.130> show<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.309> something<00:00:08.700> really<00:00:08.970> basic

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
me show you something really basic

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.209 
me show you something really basic
really<00:00:10.170> easy<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:10.950> at<00:00:11.070> least

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
really easy so you have at least

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.280 
really easy so you have at least
something<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:12.000> use<00:00:12.210> no<00:00:12.420> matter<00:00:12.630> where<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.080> are

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
something to use no matter where you are

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.480 
something to use no matter where you are
because<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.799> could<00:00:14.009> take<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.250> even

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
because you could take this even

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.820 
because you could take this even
traveling<00:00:14.969> right<00:00:15.150> all<00:00:15.630> right<00:00:15.839> basic<00:00:16.619> bicep

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
traveling right all right basic bicep

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.370 
traveling right all right basic bicep
curls<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:18.000> key<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.170> have

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
curls the key on this is that you have

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.620 
curls the key on this is that you have
enough<00:00:19.590> resistance<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> pretty<00:00:21.180> hard

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
enough resistance I have a pretty hard

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.990 
enough resistance I have a pretty hard
tube<00:00:21.990> tight<00:00:22.710> tube<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.279> my<00:00:23.430> feet<00:00:23.640> are<00:00:23.760> close

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
tube tight tube so my feet are close

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.779 
tube tight tube so my feet are close
together<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.289> curling<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.250> my

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
together so just curling up with my

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.620 
together so just curling up with my
elbows<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.869> pretty<00:00:28.470> difficult<00:00:29.300> if<00:00:30.300> this

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
elbows in is pretty difficult if this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.690 
elbows in is pretty difficult if this
was<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> tube<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.619> perhaps<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.399> stretched

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
was a tube that perhaps was stretched

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.190 
was a tube that perhaps was stretched
out<00:00:32.969> I'd<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> step<00:00:33.719> apart<00:00:34.170> further<00:00:36.200> right

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
out I'd have to step apart further right

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
out I'd have to step apart further right
I'd<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.890> step<00:00:38.070> apart<00:00:38.340> further<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.760> get

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
I'd have to step apart further to get

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.720 
I'd have to step apart further to get
more<00:00:39.059> resistance<00:00:39.719> another<00:00:40.590> variation<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
more resistance another variation on the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
more resistance another variation on the
bicep<00:00:41.969> curl<00:00:42.510> would<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.710> take<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> both<00:00:45.530> one

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bicep curl would be to take it both one

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.940 
bicep curl would be to take it both one
arm<00:00:47.539> definitely<00:00:48.539> difficult<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.710> also

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
arm definitely difficult I can also

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
arm definitely difficult I can also
twist<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.730> where<00:00:50.850> my<00:00:50.940> thumb<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.449> top<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
twist it where my thumb is on top and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.340 
twist it where my thumb is on top and
I'm<00:00:52.079> coming<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> hammer<00:00:53.610> curl<00:00:54.350> there's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
I'm coming up with a hammer curl there's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.840 
I'm coming up with a hammer curl there's
a<00:00:55.410> lot<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> variations<00:00:56.250> i<00:00:56.340> could<00:00:56.520> take<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> out

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
a lot of variations i could take it out

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
a lot of variations i could take it out
to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> side<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.829> basic

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
to the side more but this is your basic

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.720 
to the side more but this is your basic
bicep<00:00:59.730> curl<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> tubing<00:01:01.649> let's<00:01:02.309> move<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
bicep curl with the tubing let's move to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.260 
bicep curl with the tubing let's move to
tricep<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> opposing<00:01:04.260> muscle<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
tricep which is the opposing muscle and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
tricep which is the opposing muscle and
i'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> show<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.930> side<00:01:07.049> now

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
i'm going to show you from the side now

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.570 
i'm going to show you from the side now
again<00:01:08.450> resistance<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.630> critical<00:01:10.619> its<00:01:10.799> key<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
again resistance is critical its key it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
again resistance is critical its key it
depends<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.119> where<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> step<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.020> tubing

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
depends on where you step on the tubing

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.600 
depends on where you step on the tubing
if<00:01:13.950> i<00:01:14.130> step<00:01:14.400> closer<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> handle<00:01:16.400> harder<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
if i step closer to the handle harder to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
if i step closer to the handle harder to
do<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.150> i<00:01:18.600> step<00:01:18.869> further<00:01:19.170> away<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
do if i step further away from the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.719 
do if i step further away from the
handle<00:01:21.180> easier<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.380> i'm<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> try

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
handle easier to do i'm going to try

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
handle easier to do i'm going to try
this<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> middle<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> start<00:01:25.200> I'm

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this right in the middle to start I'm

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.010 
this right in the middle to start I'm
going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> keep<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.549> elbow<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.060> by<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.450> side<00:01:27.750> I'm

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
going to keep my elbow in by my side I'm

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.390 
going to keep my elbow in by my side I'm
going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> bend<00:01:28.470> both<00:01:28.680> knees<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
going to bend both knees I'm going to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.520 
going to bend both knees I'm going to
look<00:01:29.520> straight<00:01:29.820> ahead<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.450> I'm<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
look straight ahead and I'm going to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
look straight ahead and I'm going to
simply<00:01:31.890> kick<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> back<00:01:32.460> notice<00:01:33.150> my<00:01:33.360> wrist

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
simply kick it back notice my wrist

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.310 
simply kick it back notice my wrist
position<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:35.540> now<00:01:36.540> notice<00:01:36.930> my<00:01:37.110> wrist

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
position and now notice my wrist

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
position and now notice my wrist
position<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> change<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
position is going to change look at it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.230 
position is going to change look at it
now<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.040> change<00:01:41.659> palm<00:01:42.659> back<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:44.000> then<00:01:45.000> palm

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
now so to change palm back and then palm

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.420 
now so to change palm back and then palm
facing<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> body<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.680> both<00:01:46.979> arms<00:01:47.009> at

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
facing the body can I do both arms at

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
facing the body can I do both arms at
the<00:01:47.520> same<00:01:47.729> time<00:01:48.030> yes<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.720> can't<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> much

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the same time yes I can't is it much

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.499 
the same time yes I can't is it much
harder<00:01:49.579> absolutely<00:01:50.579> bend<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.299> knees

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
harder absolutely bend your knees

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.679 
harder absolutely bend your knees
straight<00:01:52.200> back<00:01:52.649> now<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.850> I'm<00:01:54.090> twisting

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
straight back now for this I'm twisting
