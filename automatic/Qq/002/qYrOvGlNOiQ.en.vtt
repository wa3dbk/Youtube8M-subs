00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
in a vigil of video chat module which is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.609 
in a vigil of video chat module which is
a<00:00:16.470> video<00:00:17.250> chat<00:00:17.760> or<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.119> regular<00:00:18.570> text<00:00:19.320> chat

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.790 
a video chat or just regular text chat
and<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.760> going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> use<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:22.320> some

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and was going to use it for on some

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.950 
and was going to use it for on some
shows<00:00:23.100> stuff<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.570> also<00:00:24.689> thought

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
shows stuff like that but I also thought

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
shows stuff like that but I also thought
it'd<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.529> cool<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> set<00:00:26.460> up<00:00:26.609> some

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it'd be really cool to set up some

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.509 
it'd be really cool to set up some
events<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.539> set<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.990> vent<00:00:28.439> calendar<00:00:29.189> over

events I set up a vent calendar over
there<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.269> was<00:00:30.390> thinking<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.050> could

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
there and was thinking like it could

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.740 
there and was thinking like it could
have<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.679> think<00:00:32.040> tank<00:00:32.340> days<00:00:32.640> where<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.480> just

page into the users lounge and that'll
be<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.519> place<00:02:26.760> probably<00:02:27.090> where<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.599> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
be a place probably where I like the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
be a place probably where I like the
picture<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> week<00:02:28.730> cartoon<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:29.940> week

and much stuff like that's gonna be in
there<00:02:32.989> also<00:02:33.989> probably<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.310> put<00:02:35.489> in

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
there also probably going to put in

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.559

there subscriber a man actually

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.470 
there subscriber a man actually
brilliant<00:02:39.569> idea<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.439> thought<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:42.269> made<00:02:42.450> a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.660 
brilliant idea I thought it made a
suggestion<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.829> kind<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.129> thought<00:02:44.370> about

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
suggestion and I kind of thought about

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.339 
suggestion and I kind of thought about
ours<00:02:44.879> like<00:02:45.030> manage<00:02:45.359> it's<00:02:45.780> definitely<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
ours like manage it's definitely a

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.879 
ours like manage it's definitely a
excellent<00:02:46.829> idea<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.670> having<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:49.459> library<00:02:50.459> built

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
excellent idea is having a library built

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.789 
excellent idea is having a library built
online<00:02:52.889> it<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.609> gives<00:02:53.959> like<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> document

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
online it just gives like a document

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.440 
online it just gives like a document
straight<00:02:56.159> up<00:02:56.280> documents<00:02:56.849> for<00:02:57.000> research

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
straight up documents for research

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.599
