and<00:00:09.559> trying<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.680> grow<00:00:10.860> as<00:00:11.010> much<00:00:11.219> grass<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:11.790> we

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
and trying to grow as much grass as we

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.640 
and trying to grow as much grass as we

couldn't as much coppers we could but

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.589 
couldn't as much coppers we could but
which<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.220> a<00:00:14.250> fictional<00:00:15.150> thing<00:00:15.269> Huntley

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599

grania<00:00:16.460> we<00:00:17.930> watched<00:00:18.930> your<00:00:19.320> progress<00:00:19.740> for

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
grania we watched your progress for

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.830 
grania we watched your progress for
quite<00:00:20.099> a<00:00:20.130> long<00:00:20.340> time<00:00:20.610> and<00:00:20.939> we've<00:00:21.239> been<00:00:21.270> waiting

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
quite a long time and we've been waiting

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.040 
quite a long time and we've been waiting
for<00:00:22.200> cross<00:00:22.410> lot<00:00:25.099> it<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.579> was<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.270> wasn't<00:00:27.720> that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
for cross lot it it was it wasn't that

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.229 
for cross lot it it was it wasn't that
easy<00:00:28.230> making<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.890> our<00:00:29.040> mind<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.550> with

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
easy making up our mind but with

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.880 
easy making up our mind but with
hindsight<00:00:30.419> it<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:30.989> the<00:00:31.140> best<00:00:31.349> thing<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.710> ever

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
hindsight it was the best thing we ever

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.580 
hindsight it was the best thing we ever
did<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:33.090> totally<00:00:33.390> sustainable<00:00:33.809> package

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
did I just totally sustainable package

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.700 
did I just totally sustainable package
and<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> much<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:36.840> productivity<00:00:37.350> we

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and so much more productivity we

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.730 
and so much more productivity we
probably<00:00:38.220> grow<00:00:38.400> twice<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.090> area<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.540> crop<00:00:39.810> on

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
probably grow twice the area of crop on

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.050 
probably grow twice the area of crop on
the<00:00:40.770> same<00:00:41.070> day<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.310> go<00:00:41.490> more<00:00:41.670> than<00:00:41.730> twice

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
the same day and we go more than twice

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.250 
the same day and we go more than twice
the<00:00:42.210> area<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.480> crop<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:42.900> we've<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.230> more

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the area of crop because we've got more

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.370 
the area of crop because we've got more
ground<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.220> we<00:00:44.820> finished<00:00:45.330> more<00:00:45.660> stock<00:00:45.990> on

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
ground now but we finished more stock on

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.310 
ground now but we finished more stock on
the<00:00:47.120> quality<00:00:48.120> grass<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.080> grow<00:00:49.290> more

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the quality grass and we we grow more

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.880 
the quality grass and we we grow more
crop<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:50.160> we're<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.780> least<00:00:52.560> at<00:00:52.710> risk

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
crop because we're the least at risk

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.270 
crop because we're the least at risk
with<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> elements<00:00:54.320> absolutely<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.560> it's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
with the elements absolutely it's it's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420 
with the elements absolutely it's it's
very<00:00:56.370> much<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.760> mixed<00:00:57.150> farm<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.220> across<00:00:59.220> what

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
very much a mixed farm and across what

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
very much a mixed farm and across what
no<00:00:59.610> tillage<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.120> made<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> much<00:01:01.050> better<00:01:01.260> one

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
no tillage of made it a much better one

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.530 
no tillage of made it a much better one
we've<00:01:01.920> probably<00:01:02.190> finishing<00:01:02.880> twice<00:01:03.150> as<00:01:03.360> much

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
we've probably finishing twice as much

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.520 
we've probably finishing twice as much
stock<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:05.220> hit<00:01:05.489> deer<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.390> were<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.810> because

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
stock to hit deer as we were to because

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.499 
stock to hit deer as we were to because
we<00:01:07.650> put<00:01:07.890> everything<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.759> Italian<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
we put everything in Italian for the

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.230 
we put everything in Italian for the
winter<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.679> they<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.069> do<00:01:11.249> cash<00:01:11.939> crop

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
winter and then they can do cash crop

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.260 
winter and then they can do cash crop
for<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.770> spring<00:01:13.770> summer<00:01:14.069> you<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> soil

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
for the spring summer you know the soil

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770 
for the spring summer you know the soil
health<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.719> vastly<00:01:16.530> improved<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:18.299> before<00:01:18.630> we

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
health is vastly improved just before we

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.609 
health is vastly improved just before we
change<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.880> no<00:01:20.880> tillage<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.749> were<00:01:21.929> cultivating

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
change to no tillage we were cultivating

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.849 
change to no tillage we were cultivating
paddocks<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.069> to<00:01:23.249> 13<00:01:23.670> times<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> cloudy

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
paddocks up to 13 times and the cloudy

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.190 
paddocks up to 13 times and the cloudy
soil<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> soil<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.840> structure

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
soil this is a soil that the structure

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.349 
soil this is a soil that the structure
breaks<00:01:28.319> down<00:01:28.590> very<00:01:29.189> quickly<00:01:29.399> with<00:01:29.759> coal

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
breaks down very quickly with coal

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.059 
breaks down very quickly with coal
evasion<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.319> were<00:01:31.469> doing<00:01:31.740> wasn't

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
evasion so what we were doing wasn't

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.539 
evasion so what we were doing wasn't
sustainable<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.289> now<00:01:34.289> house<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.280> seems

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
sustainable and now house all seems

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.510 
sustainable and now house all seems
beautiful<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.299> full<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.630> worms<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.520> lovely
