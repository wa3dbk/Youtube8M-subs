reverse<00:04:00.830> then<00:04:01.070> we<00:04:01.160> get<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.370> backup<00:04:01.940> view<00:04:02.300> right

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
reverse then we get a backup view right

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.510 
reverse then we get a backup view right
over<00:04:02.630> there<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.959> then<00:04:03.410> we<00:04:03.650> of<00:04:03.709> course<00:04:03.980> can

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
over there and then we of course can

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.040 
over there and then we of course can
adjust<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.000> brightness<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.420> contrast<00:04:05.510> on

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
that if we have the camera button again

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.060 
that if we have the camera button again
you<00:04:08.420> get<00:04:08.660> reverse<00:04:09.020> as<00:04:09.260> well<00:04:09.320> as<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.770> side

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
you get reverse as well as that side

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.830 
you get reverse as well as that side

this particular segment I would rank

this particular segment I would rank
this<00:05:07.490> just<00:05:07.880> about<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.240> same<00:05:08.480> as<00:05:08.690> my<00:05:08.930> Ford

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230

it<00:05:11.390> doesn't<00:05:11.660> have<00:05:11.750> quite<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:12.140> same<00:05:12.290> feature

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740

it doesn't have quite the same feature
functionality<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.730> think<00:05:14.270> that<00:05:14.390> you<00:05:14.510> connect

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
functionality I think that you connect

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.540 
functionality I think that you connect
is<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:14.990> little<00:05:15.290> bit<00:05:15.440> better<00:05:15.620> than<00:05:15.920> this<00:05:16.040> just

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
is a little bit better than this just

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.920 
is a little bit better than this just
