was<00:04:02.120> intimate

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
was intimate

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.449 
was intimate
it<00:04:02.870> was<00:04:02.989> very<00:04:03.169> quiet<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.859> was<00:04:03.919> very<00:04:04.160> just

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
it was very quiet it was very just

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.780 
it was very quiet it was very just
dangerous<00:04:05.329> but<00:04:05.690> enclosed<00:04:06.650> in<00:04:06.949> a<00:04:07.040> small<00:04:07.069> circle

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
dangerous but enclosed in a small circle

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.300 
dangerous but enclosed in a small circle
and<00:04:08.199> that<00:04:09.199> was<00:04:09.379> just<00:04:09.500> something<00:04:09.680> different

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
and that was just something different

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.189 
and that was just something different
like<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:10.760> don't<00:04:10.970> always<00:04:11.209> need<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.959> big

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
like you don't always need the big

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.080 
like you don't always need the big
baddie<00:04:12.440> coming<00:04:12.919> down<00:04:13.099> in<00:04:13.310> explosions<00:04:13.970> and

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
baddie coming down in explosions and

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.069 
baddie coming down in explosions and
everything<00:04:14.419> to<00:04:14.540> finish<00:04:14.780> it

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
everything to finish it

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.479 
everything to finish it
sometimes<00:04:15.590> something<00:04:15.829> like<00:04:16.070> this<00:04:16.220> something

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
sometimes something like this something

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.520 
sometimes something like this something
emotional<00:04:17.120> something<00:04:17.419> taking<00:04:17.959> everything<00:04:18.380> in

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
emotional something taking everything in

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.490 
emotional something taking everything in
one<00:04:18.709> but<00:04:19.159> doing<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.519> very<00:04:19.729> small

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
one but doing it very small

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.260 
one but doing it very small
and<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:20.980> contained<00:04:21.370> circle<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.060> that

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
and in a contained circle and that

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.210 
and in a contained circle and that
creepy<00:04:22.480> motherfucker<00:04:22.750> while<00:04:23.290> he<00:04:23.470> was<00:04:23.710> insane

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
creepy motherfucker while he was insane

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.360 
creepy motherfucker while he was insane
ultimately<00:04:25.180> there<00:04:25.420> was<00:04:25.570> some<00:04:26.230> validity<00:04:26.680> to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
ultimately there was some validity to

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.560 
ultimately there was some validity to
where<00:04:27.520> he<00:04:27.730> was<00:04:27.850> going<00:04:28.090> with<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.360> he<00:04:28.450> was

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
where he was going with it he was

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.210 
where he was going with it he was
basically<00:04:28.870> questioning<00:04:29.440> his<00:04:29.560> own<00:04:29.650> humanity

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
basically questioning his own humanity

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.800 
basically questioning his own humanity
I'm<00:04:30.340> stuck<00:04:30.550> between<00:04:30.700> human<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.330> parasite

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
I'm stuck between human and parasite

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.750 
I'm stuck between human and parasite
what<00:04:32.170> the<00:04:32.290> fuck<00:04:32.530> am<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:32.920> Who<00:04:33.130> am<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.460> what<00:04:33.640> is<00:04:33.730> my

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
what the fuck am I Who am I what is my

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.300 
what the fuck am I Who am I what is my
purpose<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.660> was<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.380> ramblings<00:04:35.980> of<00:04:36.190> a

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
purpose so it was the ramblings of a

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.180 
purpose so it was the ramblings of a
madman<00:04:36.970> with<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.360> slight<00:04:37.780> bit<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.110> sanity<00:04:38.560> -<00:04:39.010> and

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
madman with a slight bit of sanity - and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.100 
madman with a slight bit of sanity - and
a<00:04:39.250> slight<00:04:39.520> bit<00:04:39.670> of<00:04:39.730> validity<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.870> but<00:04:41.050> I

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
a slight bit of validity to it but I

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.330 
a slight bit of validity to it but I
think<00:04:41.140> that<00:04:41.380> he<00:04:41.560> was<00:04:41.680> still<00:04:41.800> fucking<00:04:42.040> crazy

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
think that he was still fucking crazy

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.130 
think that he was still fucking crazy
and<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:42.670> honestly<00:04:43.330> just<00:04:43.420> felt<00:04:43.780> bad<00:04:43.900> for<00:04:43.960> the

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
and I honestly just felt bad for the

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.810 
and I honestly just felt bad for the
whole<00:04:44.230> situation<00:04:44.440> because<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.520> was<00:04:45.700> the

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
whole situation because this was the

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.580 
whole situation because this was the
point<00:04:46.000> as<00:04:46.090> well<00:04:46.300> where<00:04:46.540> Morano<00:04:47.200> had<00:04:47.440> to

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
point as well where Morano had to

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.260 
point as well where Morano had to
confess<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.190> she<00:04:48.520> kind<00:04:48.670> of<00:04:48.820> knew<00:04:48.910> something

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
confess that she kind of knew something

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.370 
confess that she kind of knew something
was<00:04:49.360> off<00:04:49.480> for<00:04:49.600> him<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:49.720> she<00:04:49.930> knew<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.230> he's

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
was off for him and she knew that he's

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.990 
was off for him and she knew that he's
not<00:04:50.530> completely<00:04:50.800> human<00:04:51.040> but<00:04:51.520> she<00:04:51.670> any<00:04:51.820> give<00:04:51.970> a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
not completely human but she any give a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.820 
not completely human but she any give a
fuck<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:52.300> again<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.169> way<00:04:53.290> it<00:04:53.410> was<00:04:53.500> approached

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
fuck so again the way it was approached

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.610 
fuck so again the way it was approached
it<00:04:53.950> was<00:04:54.010> like<00:04:54.300> last<00:04:55.300> episode<00:04:55.840> honestly<00:04:56.440> while

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
it was like last episode honestly while

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.800 
it was like last episode honestly while
I<00:04:56.919> was<00:04:57.370> complaining<00:04:57.669> about<00:04:57.850> gödel<00:04:58.360> not<00:04:58.540> being

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
I was complaining about gödel not being

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.390 
I was complaining about gödel not being
built<00:04:59.200> up<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.530> be<00:04:59.620> this<00:04:59.740> final<00:05:00.040> villain<00:05:00.280> and

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
built up to be this final villain and

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.010 
built up to be this final villain and
neither<00:05:00.580> was<00:05:00.730> this<00:05:00.880> guy<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.300> think<00:05:01.510> that<00:05:01.840> it<00:05:01.930> was

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
neither was this guy I think that it was

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.480 
neither was this guy I think that it was
just<00:05:02.200> more<00:05:02.290> appropriate<00:05:02.800> because<00:05:02.890> it<00:05:03.130> handled

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
just more appropriate because it handled

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.150 
just more appropriate because it handled
some<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.060> more<00:05:04.720> ok<00:05:05.260> when<00:05:05.500> she<00:05:05.890> Nietzsche

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
some of the more ok when she Nietzsche

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.920 
some of the more ok when she Nietzsche
has<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.430> deal<00:05:06.610> with<00:05:06.790> real<00:05:06.970> life<00:05:07.000> now<00:05:07.390> how<00:05:07.780> was

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
has to deal with real life now how was

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.450 
has to deal with real life now how was
he<00:05:07.990> gonna<00:05:08.140> handle<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:09.130> think<00:05:09.370> that

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
he gonna handle it and I think that

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.740 
he gonna handle it and I think that
