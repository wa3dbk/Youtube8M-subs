energy lower investment costs I think it

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.270 
energy lower investment costs I think it
will<00:05:19.600> be<00:05:19.780> mainly<00:05:20.070> connected<00:05:21.070> with<00:05:22.230> a

rationalization standardization of the
prices<00:05:28.480> in<00:05:28.750> so<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.710> we<00:05:30.580> are<00:05:30.700> a<00:05:30.940> more

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
prices in so that we are a more

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.620 
prices in so that we are a more
competitive<00:05:31.890> reviewer<00:05:32.890> is<00:05:33.130> a<00:05:33.630> completely

competitive reviewer is a completely

automated process and the speed is
already<00:05:38.230> very<00:05:38.770> high<00:05:39.160> we<00:05:40.090> think<00:05:40.390> that<00:05:40.860> the

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
already very high we think that the

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.290 
already very high we think that the
development<00:05:42.790> will<00:05:43.570> be<00:05:43.750> more<00:05:43.960> in<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.500> area<00:05:44.740> of

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
development will be more in the area of

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.420 
development will be more in the area of
energy<00:05:46.300> conservation<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:47.670> cost<00:05:48.670> reduction
