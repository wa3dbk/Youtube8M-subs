mean you know Goku straining after the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.990 
mean you know Goku straining after the
first<00:01:28.799> episode<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> super<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.909> know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
first episode of super which you know

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
first episode of super which you know
we've<00:01:30.180> already<00:01:30.329> heard<00:01:31.200> about<00:01:31.320> everything

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770

we've already heard about everything
like<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.720> yeah<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.290> that's

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
like that so yeah I just think that's

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.960 
like that so yeah I just think that's
selling<00:01:34.770> more<00:01:34.950> about<00:01:35.100> Pearson<00:01:35.549> weeks<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.939> we

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
selling more about Pearson weeks if we

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
selling more about Pearson weeks if we
can<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.570> some<00:01:36.840> more<00:01:36.990> stuff<00:01:37.259> would<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.650> really

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
can see some more stuff would be really

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.249 
can see some more stuff would be really
cool<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.729> these<00:01:39.119> arcs<00:01:40.049> are

cool because you know these arcs are

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.710 
cool because you know these arcs are
just<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.590> good<00:01:40.829> opportunity<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.490> him<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.939> give

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

like<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.540> appears<00:02:40.599> Toriyama<00:02:41.500> probably<00:02:42.129> wanted

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
like it appears Toriyama probably wanted

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.589 
like it appears Toriyama probably wanted
to<00:02:42.400> bring<00:02:42.549> back<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.819> series<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.120> while<00:02:43.329> ago<00:02:43.569> but

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
time and it's kind of boring to just

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.460 
time and it's kind of boring to just
watch<00:03:21.370> them<00:03:21.609> look<00:03:21.849> at<00:03:22.000> each<00:03:22.090> other<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:22.840> yeah<00:03:23.440> i

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
watch them look at each other so yeah i

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.770 
watch them look at each other so yeah i
know<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.709> there<00:03:23.949> is<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:24.519> one<00:03:24.970> only<00:03:25.449> moment

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
know that there is like one only moment

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.849 
know that there is like one only moment
really<00:03:25.930> but<00:03:26.049> they<00:03:26.109> just<00:03:26.319> look<00:03:26.440> at<00:03:26.590> each<00:03:26.650> other

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859

in<00:03:27.010> battle<00:03:27.040> God's<00:03:27.430> obviously<00:03:27.849> there<00:03:27.940> is

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
in battle God's obviously there is

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.930 
in battle God's obviously there is
talking<00:03:28.510> in<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.810> fight<00:03:29.049> but<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.859> mean<00:03:30.129> like

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
talking in the fight but I mean like

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.449 
talking in the fight but I mean like
that<00:03:31.269> still<00:03:31.599> like<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.379> doesn't<00:03:32.620> do<00:03:32.919> it<00:03:32.949> as<00:03:33.190> bad

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
that still like it doesn't do it as bad

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.330 
that still like it doesn't do it as bad
as<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.730> original<00:03:34.120> dragonball<00:03:34.900> z<00:03:35.530> anime<00:03:36.129> did

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
as the original dragonball z anime did

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.830 
as the original dragonball z anime did
it<00:03:36.459> cuz<00:03:36.639> that<00:03:37.060> would<00:03:37.299> took<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.599> long<00:03:37.810> time

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
it cuz that would took a long time

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.080 
it cuz that would took a long time
Frieza<00:03:38.349> fight<00:03:38.620> was<00:03:38.829> so<00:03:39.129> long<00:03:39.430> in<00:03:39.639> that<00:03:39.819> series

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
Frieza fight was so long in that series

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.300 
Frieza fight was so long in that series
but<00:03:40.419> yeah<00:03:40.629> hopefully<00:03:41.290> now<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.799> was<00:03:42.099> fighting

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
but yeah hopefully now I was fighting

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.430 
but yeah hopefully now I was fighting
anime<00:03:42.669> history<00:03:42.970> actually<00:03:43.269> yeah<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:44.229> hopefully

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
anime history actually yeah so hopefully

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.020 
anime history actually yeah so hopefully
and<00:03:44.889> apparently<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.519> only<00:03:45.639> took<00:03:45.790> five<00:03:45.970> minutes

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
and apparently it only took five minutes
