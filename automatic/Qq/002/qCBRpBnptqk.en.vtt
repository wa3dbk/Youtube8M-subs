00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.070
 high performance 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.840
 now the focus of the gaming industry is 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.670
 to feed this new market these 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.500
 new consoles of course they continue 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.140
 making games for playstation 3 and 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.020
 xbox 360 for now the new focus is the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.730
 playstation 4 xbox hua and the pc's né like 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.010
 always need to continue gives you the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.540
 market but always having an evolution and 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 as there is always evolution of the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.170
 consoles is always when the playstation 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.240
 launch a console he released a 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.280
 cameron slim version that ends up being more 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.380
 with some improvements in some 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.790
 adaptations for a more compact console 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.440
 Because there are people who prefer to buy 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.210
 really that it consumes more compact 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.070
 happened on the playstation that had 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.149
 that version is great, then do it 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.250
 a smaller version 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.600
 In Brazil there are 21 playstation 3 and now 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.909
 will be very different also in the post 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.440
 14 in the galera and an Italian website called 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.270
 multiplayer has announced that it can be a 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.159
 the first images already seen in the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.960
 slim version of playstation 4 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.060
 According to this publication, the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 console is being called monopoly 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.110
 that Portuguese would be something like a 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.210
 monolith which is a large vertical block 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.330
 being specially shaped to serve 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.250
 as a pillar the monument ie they 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.110
 not dubbing the console of a small 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.880
 time the cute little mess so the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.590
 calls it legal placement they did because 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.659
 The console is really cool, okay? 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.130
 well packed cute and enjoy 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.780
 according to the images the wolves were 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.060
 change of position to be able to 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.740
 the opening of the CD or in case the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.299
 burnley and also the buttons win the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.100
 new places and now have a new 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.869
 format that I also found very cool 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.490
 and you realize the proportion of 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.920
 console compared to the common version 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.510
 14 is the half of the console 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.310
 practically it is much smaller 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.490
 he's like those players dvds 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.460
 car that was there in 2004 2005 because it is 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.659
 it's very compact the design reminds 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.429
 totally playstation 4 normal version 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.179
 funk version I already found the console 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.189
 much smaller 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.680
 if you compare for example with xbox 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.950
 one way 1 4 is much smaller than xbox 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.810
 one and up 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.640
 in the middle of the slim playstation 3 then 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.230
 now the slim playstation 4 will be 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.030
 much better guy it will be more or 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.780
 less than the size of a tablet a book 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.670
 it's on 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.349
 it's really compact, the only one 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.840
 thing that worries me if the 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.340
 overheating because the price of 14 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.230
 it already tends to grow a little more in 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.690
 relation to xbox one because it does not have 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.209
 that gigantic block that brick 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.519
 which is the source of xbox one in he has the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.959
 its internal source and in the case of 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.739
 playstation 4 and 5 how is it going 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.610
 to function 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.530
 will they be able to develop 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.030
 better technology to avoid 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.130
 overheating, how is it? 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.750
 operating this area of ​​the source is because 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.430
 these consoles have people who are 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.110
 quite so that's why it's good if 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.700
 you put your console in the air 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.440
 ventilated in a room with air 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.269
 conditioning something like that and learn 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.069
 overheated console decreases the service life 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.870
 and then I just want to see how it goes 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.700
 work now do not need 42 link 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.560
 sony is getting ready for people 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.390
 Of course for now it 's just a rumor 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.400
 As I told you, they're supposed to. 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.380
 images sounds and beautiful images well 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.450
 worked but can be expensive assembly 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.130
 cimentasse in very well done will 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.319
 always true when these 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.090
 leaks thus amusements until the time 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.000
 that is released today 14 are always those 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.250
 mounts well nothing to see my psycho one 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.840
 very futuristic noise and actually the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.519
 The noise is much more down to earth and already 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.109
 this version that made us slow foot well 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.090
 on the floor too, really cool 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.160
 but of course for now is a rumor to sony 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.660
 did not say anything about it and 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.280
 seen it is able that it shows itself 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.620
 playstation 4 slim that really goes 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.870
 go out there at the e3 or the games they go with 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.670
 also knowing how each year happens 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.380
 in my opinion about it all is that the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.209
 console is very nice, he's with 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.470
 design is very cool indeed 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.540
 sony always has to make their 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.280
 consoles with a very nice finish 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.019
 It's just very little guy, man. 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.880
 All the time you're banking, you're tiny. 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.799
 It is true today that she can 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.450
 Put a console there is no car, right? 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.190
 I think this console for expensive car 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.290
 know those guys who are singers 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.239
 They travel in bus vans and always have a 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.920
 console inside the vehicle I think this 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.269
 is an ideal console for you to carry 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.190
 worth for travelers 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.530
 the type at the end of the year goes to the farm 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.630
 going to travel is a great island for you 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.579
 charged for carrying in the backpack without 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.349
 no work because the console is very 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.150
 little when traveling to some 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.769
 place I want to take the consoles I 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.840
 I have to take the flame of the 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.330
 damn, but now with this ps four 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.770
 clean vein will give easy cocaine in the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.840
 play bag 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.060
 exaggeration but really console is very 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.220
 Nice little baby, old man.

 I found it very cool but it 's simply 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.199
