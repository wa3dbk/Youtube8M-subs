this<00:03:02.550> elite<00:03:02.970> does<00:03:03.390> not<00:03:03.810> stand<00:03:04.290> well<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:05.430> took

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
this elite does not stand well it took

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.400 
this elite does not stand well it took
me<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> very<00:03:05.970> long<00:03:06.209> time<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.660> get<00:03:06.930> them<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.170> just

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
me a very long time to get them to just

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.830 
me a very long time to get them to just
stand<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:09.470> if<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.830> see<00:03:11.190> his<00:03:11.310> feet

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
stand like that if you can see his feet

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.540 
stand like that if you can see his feet
it's<00:03:12.840> just<00:03:13.050> kind<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.830> ball<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
it's just kind of like this ball on the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.259 
it's just kind of like this ball on the
back<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.000> then<00:03:15.120> he's<00:03:15.239> got<00:03:15.420> these<00:03:15.620> two<00:03:16.620> hooves

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
back and then he's got these two hooves

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.070 
back and then he's got these two hooves
so<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.630> mean<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.380> doesn't<00:03:19.709> stand<00:03:19.950> well<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:21.080> the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
so I mean it doesn't stand well and the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.960 
so I mean it doesn't stand well and the
feed<00:03:22.290> don't<00:03:22.500> really<00:03:22.709> move<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.100> well<00:03:23.280> like

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
feed don't really move that well like

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.550 
feed don't really move that well like
this<00:03:24.209> that's<00:03:24.480> really<00:03:24.750> Lewis<00:03:25.080> but<00:03:25.320> then<00:03:25.440> this

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
this that's really Lewis but then this

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.009 
this that's really Lewis but then this
one<00:03:25.799> just<00:03:26.580> like<00:03:26.730> refuses<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.420> move<00:03:27.680> online<00:03:30.019> but

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
brought to my attention that some of

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.800 
brought to my attention that some of
these<00:03:52.290> could<00:03:52.560> be<00:03:52.709> kind<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.040> fragile<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.150> kind

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
these could be kind of fragile so I kind

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.289 
these could be kind of fragile so I kind
