marked<00:00:00.359> our<00:00:00.480> system<00:00:00.989> and<00:00:01.829> we're<00:00:02.490> ready<00:00:02.669> to

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
marked our system and we're ready to

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.749 
marked our system and we're ready to
start<00:00:02.879> applying<00:00:03.120> our<00:00:03.570> glue<00:00:03.780> so<00:00:04.620> again<00:00:05.339> each

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
start applying our glue so again each

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.750 
start applying our glue so again each
glue<00:00:06.150> requires<00:00:07.080> different<00:00:07.830> amounts<00:00:08.670> of

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
glue requires different amounts of

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.270 
glue requires different amounts of
layering<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:10.110> instructions<00:00:10.860> are<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
layering the instructions are on the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.270 
layering the instructions are on the
bottle<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.469> again<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.130> half
