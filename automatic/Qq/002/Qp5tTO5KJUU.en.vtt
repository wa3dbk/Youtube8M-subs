this shield thing that makes it pretty
much<00:02:42.750> invincible<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.620> damage<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.819> then<00:02:45.510> it

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
much invincible to damage and then it

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.470 
much invincible to damage and then it
has<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> full<00:02:46.739> heal<00:02:47.099> which<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.879> really<00:02:48.239> cheap
