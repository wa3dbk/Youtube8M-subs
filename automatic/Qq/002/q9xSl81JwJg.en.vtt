00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.640
 And how could it be different? 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.470
 food involved is logical because you 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.320
 They know that I love to eat I 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.029
 I end up researching and adapting things 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.859
 healthy to put on my 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.449
 power supply but before showing the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.119
 food I'll show you something 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.759
 that I'm in love, that's my new 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.489

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.170
 He is very very handsome I had a cup. 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.899
 some videos and it fell out of it broke 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 from me is he leaving me 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.190
 I had to buy a new cup for myself. 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 force baby water because I do not drink water 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 I do not remember drinking water 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.690
 so I need all the time 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.420
 reinforcing that it is always with a glass 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.079
 close by and I like these glasses with 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.210
 because I think it leaves this 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.609
 this time to drink water but more 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.280
 more delicious and beautiful legend of bob water 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.000
 So this is my new glass I bought. 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.619
 a store is do not remember mall but it's a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.960
 decoration shop there in sao paulo 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.439
 called bar and I bought a cup 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 I also bought a little technical bag 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.650
 The item I'm loving at the moment is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.270
 only a little body may not yet be 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.490
 technical bag but maybe in the next 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.290
 video I show you as an item 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 I 'm in love but for now it's just 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.340
 a little cup 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.259
 Let's go to the food everyone likes. 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.850
 food I think my opinion I 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.630
 I like to eat things are walking 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.329
 Anyway, I 'm loving this bar. 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.150
 protein called power franchitti 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.790
 I bought a supplement website 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.939
 came in the mail was not 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.829
 Find it and it's very tasty, you can 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.470
 You see here that it looks like a bis 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.590
 Giants the only problem with this bar 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.229
 It's that she has a lot of calorie is good. 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.659
 so I can only eat half 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.850
 them according to my nourishment or 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.680
 I can eat it whole 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.689
 but if it is in the place of some meal 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.670
 in the afternoon, for example afternoon snack or 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.890
 afternoon coffee i can eat dust 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.160
 You do not have half as much because she has 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.680
 here she has three grams of protein is 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.660
 enough protein but it also has 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.850
 pretty fat and pretty colorful 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.040
 then it's worth it as a meal that is very 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.440
 very very hot, very tasty 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.360
 other things 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.190
 food that I'm in love with and I eat them 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.430
 together these two are here 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.730
 This is the atom I like to charge so 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.300
 gomes of the coast in pieces and in the oil 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.519
 the accepted one he is healthier than 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.080
 in water but it is more caloric than 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.420
 brother in law as I have no problem 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.090
 weight and do not have to lose weight end 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.370
 opting for healthier than this is the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.620
 kino eye because it has omega 3 in the water 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.330
 I do not have 63 so I'd rather have one 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.280
 a little more calories something 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.100
 so absorb all the nutrients 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.120
 He gives me so I get it. 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.730
 easy to do 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.850
 I'll take this can open the whole shot. 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.000
 olive oil, put a little pot there 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.980
 I get chives peak tomato place 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.780
 the chopped reader puts a spoon 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.239
 light mayonnaise 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.250
 I mix everything I turn into a cradle I do not 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.709
 I put a lot more to the point of turning 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.850
 it just becomes a part creminho enough to 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.310
 all and then I run with this rap r 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.019
 little school here is my addiction I like 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.920
 almost every day here at night like 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.859
 dinner 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.260
 I'm just going to change the fillings myself 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.930
 I already have shots I make is chicken 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.630
 mincemeat sometimes i do the complete 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.000
 even sometimes I do sometimes did not 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:46.130
 twice with a smoked salmon 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.519
 formed sheets already made with 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.290
 turkey with various things then you are 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.670
 super easy also know if the package does not 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.400
 puts the first one only to give a 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.780
 look and it's crispy and then I put 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.519
 This one is light but it has the integral 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.310
 which is blue whiting and has normal and 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.380
 orange the side it is healthier 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.810
 nutrients but the calorie is 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.630
 the same as the large only that the inter is 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.670
 very difficult 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.890
 otherwise I almost never think I'm done 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.870
 buying this one from here because he is so 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.900
 as good as it is also a source of 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.660
 fiber and here comes the little school so for 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.720
 You eat there, you eat with 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.700

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.130
 very easy to do very tasty 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.120
 also that the last item that I am 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:37.250
 walking is the spine line that you 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.080

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.420
 looks you 've seen on instagram or 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.100
 be turned around and have not yet seen the look of 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.260
 day but soon they will see in the look of the day 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.210
 that this gang I bought in 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.820
 arezzo she has a very short jump 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.770
 is she seeing this higher leap not 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.470
 It's too loud, that's why I liked it. 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.550
 and she is very comfortable, look how beautiful. 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.280
 take the front I bought and on the day I 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.530
 I bought I already left the store with her I 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.140
 I've been sticking my leg all day 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.430
 shopping in event did not tire my 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.100
 leg did not hurt 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.050
 nothing, nothing, nothing, I'm in love, very much 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.020
 beautiful beyond this print has several 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.790
 other prints in Arezzo and it's news 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.850
 from the new collection so you still do not 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.340
 found this is the priest we have 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.010
 many other prints have an ethic that 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.470
 it is that as well as interests strip is 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.320
 green water have here is more neutral 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.550
 line to cnud has several several several 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.940
 passionate days because it's too much 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.730
 comfortable even I think I deleted 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.920
 159 or 189 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.620
 which I think is okay for a jumping shoe 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.150
 it is so comfortable and so that Arezzo 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.070
 would also be a bit more expensive 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.810
 but I found the price super rock 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.300
 I'm really in love with this 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.820
