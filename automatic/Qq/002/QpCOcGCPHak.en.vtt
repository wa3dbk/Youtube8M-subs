00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.200
 news of with you and is that good yesterday 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.389
 there was a lot of controversy because good 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.529
 pitchers is worth the new 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.170
 unreal engine 4 engine or cream what 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.660
 produced much better as it cooled in already 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.109
 in 4 they had said that it would not be 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.939
 present in will you and wait because 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.699
 many of you take it 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.940
 with me because you say that I do not say 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.150
 news from nintendo always make the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.400
 console to see guys we are not 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.270
 against any console only 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.690
 we give the news that they put us in the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.520
 tray then we tell them and we are 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.870
 totally impartial 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.970
 I also have to say that many times 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.790
 Well given news of nintendo or I do not give 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.790
 news in try because really not 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.019
 I know the interest that there is in the channel that 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.270
 tell yourself that news 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.159
 and for that reason we only say those that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 we consider more important as the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.360
 case of this we are saying that it is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.670
 a new generation console as it is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.729
 willy and that today alenia in 4 that is going to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.500
 be present in the consoles as xbox 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.600
 723 station 4 that is not present 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 he gulped that is what we came to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.329
 means and in the news that we 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.840
 happens comes in a rectification 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.789
 let's say it like this is true since yesterday 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 marc 20 remember that the co-founder of 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.579
 pit game said that a real in cha in 4 does not 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.500
 I would not be present with you 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.229
 so many of you are worth 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.970
 there I am accused stage to me that I do not 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.810
 had developed in a real swell 4 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.020
 for water 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.140
 therefore apologize but no I was not 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.569
 I was mark rein who has wanted 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.560
 clarify these words that I said yesterday 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:01.950
 in the video since then effectively 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.110
 said or has not commented on that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.909
 because it is armed so much commotion not only 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.360
 in the channel we give you what you want to say 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.060
 is that 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.580
 queen have commented that yes you can 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.270
 endure the real one in jane 4 in the wii 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.330
 or 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.060
 only the developers if they want 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.310
 they may have it but yes while not 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.030
 can have is that what it says more 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.360
 reynÃ©s that if developers do 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.430
 feasible to pass the threshold in chain 4 to 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.370
 the uis modifying it 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.409
 he has also made it clear that if 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.329
 there is this possibility there will be a 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.810
 loss in terms of graphic quality or 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:45.799
 it will never be the same real engine and in 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.319
 four in wii in generation consoles 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:54.099
 this is what Mark Rein said 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:56.750
 that will be a real in chain 3.935 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.810
 and what you have to make clear forgive me 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.840
 is that without support without the support of 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.180
 developers will not be able to do 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.599
 this is, no matter how much you say 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.220
 they really made a mistake in the news 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.049
 yes yes of course you can not stand 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.090
 that supports it but that's what he said 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.370
 it is not a real engine 4 but only 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.860
 utility in jane 3.5 but if the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.340
 developers do not support this 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.070
 this is not going to be able to see so 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.480
 so this video was therefore that I 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.200
 I do 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.800
 and we need people doing it and neither 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.800
 nothing like that 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.189
 just really if we do not do more 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.810
 news of attempts because we do not know 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.909
 the nintendo audience that we have 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.260
 neither in the channel if the people are 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.700
 interested in nintendo news 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.219
 It is not that news of 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.250
 nintendo every day but it is 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:53.730
 true that this is evident and I return it 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.159
 to say that the water is crying out for 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.650
 price reduction already above all of 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.560
 consoles and especially that the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.989
 developers support it more since 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.599
 they just have their exclusive games 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.299
 as a sexy care bayonet 2 there was a 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.400
 person who said that we were going with 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.129
 the sale of games and the sales of 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.540
 consoles that had seen the playstation 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.699
 that was worth exactly the same 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.810
 second hand such and such it seems to me 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.630
 great 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.490
 and I really do not say it not only 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.740
 We say for windows and production 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.509
 usually generalized we said it yesterday 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.180
 concluded because we were approach 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.340
 focusing the news towards nintendo but 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.520
 for example the playstation vita one 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.860
 console machine does not buy it or the 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.090
 because it's worth a paste and until 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.160
 do not be low 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.440
 really nobody is going to buy it for 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.020
 a machine because gentlemen we are in 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.300
 crisis around the world but concrete 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.850
 we in Spain are very bad and that 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.820
 it shows and the truth is that they have 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.160
 have to keep an eye on her because the sales 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.320
 international global and end 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.840
 lowered they have come down a lot so 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.210
 well we roll up so you know 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.120
 this is our resemblance some form 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.970
 excuse me because we do not 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.160
 we invent the news and we say it is 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.080
 because they exist because they are there because 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.690
 a website or a developer 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.580
 spoken or someone has spoken and we 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.229
 we communicate it to you, that's what 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.960
 I want you to understand that we do not 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.729
 we make the engine a 20 in 4 or not 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.169
 we want it to come out hopefully it would come out hopefully 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.090
 I will triumph, it gives me a lot of grief because 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.470
 that against which you see up there 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.810
 I have a boxing with all his 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.669
 complements the dreamcast was also gone 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.210
 before time and I have it there because it is 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.919
 my favorite console because because the 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.919
 I want so nothing 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.009
 well we see you guys you know no 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.009
 there are favorites already until next time
