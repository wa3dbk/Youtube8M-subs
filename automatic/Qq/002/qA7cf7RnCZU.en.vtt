Wow them old storm waters didn't break a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.470 
Wow them old storm waters didn't break a
thing<00:03:15.910> did<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.410> again<00:03:17.410> I'll<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:19.120> keep<00:03:19.420> it

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.459 

well<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.489> moved<00:03:31.849> to<00:03:31.909> rocket<00:03:32.329> motor<00:03:32.540> forward<00:03:33.109> to

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:33.469 
well I moved to rocket motor forward to

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.410 
well I moved to rocket motor forward to
the<00:03:33.590> thrust<00:03:33.920> line<00:03:34.159> and<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.909> bottom<00:03:35.269> this

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
the thrust line and to the bottom this

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.599 
the thrust line and to the bottom this
time<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.469> keep<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.829> from<00:03:36.980> rolling<00:03:37.219> over

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
time that you keep it from rolling over

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.509 
time that you keep it from rolling over
then<00:03:38.359> I<00:03:38.450> cut<00:03:38.719> off<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:39.109> trim<00:03:39.409> tab<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:39.950> this

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
then I cut off that trim tab and this

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.309 
then I cut off that trim tab and this
should<00:03:40.700> also<00:03:40.939> prevent<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.599> from<00:03:41.689> rolling<00:03:41.989> on

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
should also prevent it from rolling on

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.440 
should also prevent it from rolling on
takeoff<00:03:42.829> since<00:03:43.159> there's<00:03:43.340> no<00:03:43.519> steering<00:03:43.819> let's

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
takeoff since there's no steering let's

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:55.089 
takeoff since there's no steering let's
try<00:03:44.719> again<00:03:44.900> tomorrow

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.099
