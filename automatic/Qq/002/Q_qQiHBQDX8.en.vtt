00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.820
 Youtube channel 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.010

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.230

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.260

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.420
 so want to share it with you 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.470
 there are two people in the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.320
 comments that says it worked 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.050
 not so they had to make a false 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.689
 manip or something like that so I 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.420
 will actually teach you to have some 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.969
 heads simply with a block of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.010

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.119
 acacia wood 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.460

 that had two wings with capital letters 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 wl era of the small dots of the quotation marks 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.580
