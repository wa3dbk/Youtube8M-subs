 in fact, even if the ingredients are few and natural, research can be 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 on the contrary extremely diversified 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.780
 from the quantitative point of view the wine is certainly the most component 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.700

 flowers and leaves whole stems are used, roots and wood materials are used

 the signs must be shredded or crushed 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:58.689
 the extraction can be cold or hot by distillation depending on 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.609
 the characteristics of the materials you were looking for and the substances you want

 sedimentation aging takes place in steel containers 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.240
 once filtered the extract is then added to other ingredients 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:20.469
 all these operations take place in a closed circuit harley paro from the air 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.139
 so that aromas and flavors can keep their strength intact

 which attracts all the impurities on the bottom of the pine 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.669
 the liquid is then separated from the precipitate obtaining an exchange

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.519
 practically ready for consumption 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.049
 during aging the hypermotard is refined to an optimal level 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.189
 it is in this phase that the aromas and flavors interfere with one another 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.269

 developed its own extraordinary technology 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.990
 it is preferable to pack the vermouth in dark green glasses that shield the
