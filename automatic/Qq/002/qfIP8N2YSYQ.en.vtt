00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.110 
really concentrating on the ends and
leave<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.050> on<00:04:56.080> leaving<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.800> on<00:04:57.009> for<00:04:57.250> up<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.729> 15

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
leave it on leaving it on for up to 15

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.610 
leave it on leaving it on for up to 15
minutes<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.810> think<00:04:59.139> I<00:04:59.199> left<00:04:59.349> it<00:04:59.500> on<00:04:59.560> for

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
minutes so I think I left it on for

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.680 
minutes so I think I left it on for
maybe<00:04:59.919> 10<00:05:00.160> minutes<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.550> first<00:05:00.759> time<00:05:01.030> went<00:05:01.599> on

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
maybe 10 minutes the first time went on

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.920 
maybe 10 minutes the first time went on
with<00:05:01.900> my<00:05:01.930> normal<00:05:03.090> shower<00:05:04.090> routine<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.840> then

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
with my normal shower routine and then

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.860 
with my normal shower routine and then
rinsed<00:05:05.229> it<00:05:05.320> out<00:05:05.410> at<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.710> very<00:05:05.919> end<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.580> I<00:05:07.479> used

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
rinsed it out at the very end and I used

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.450 
rinsed it out at the very end and I used
a<00:05:07.990> little<00:05:08.110> bit<00:05:08.259> too<00:05:08.380> much<00:05:08.470> product<00:05:08.979> so<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.310> was

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
a little bit too much product so it was

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.920 
a little bit too much product so it was
a<00:05:09.490> little<00:05:09.639> bit<00:05:09.849> hard<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.210> work<00:05:10.360> through<00:05:10.690> and

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
a little bit hard to work through and

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.510 
a little bit hard to work through and
did<00:05:11.229> leave<00:05:11.410> my<00:05:11.530> hair<00:05:11.710> filling<00:05:12.039> a<00:05:12.099> little<00:05:12.280> bit

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
did leave my hair filling a little bit

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.760 
did leave my hair filling a little bit
way<00:05:12.639> down<00:05:12.910> that<00:05:13.120> first<00:05:13.300> time<00:05:13.599> so<00:05:13.930> next<00:05:14.500> time

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
way down that first time so next time

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.890 
way down that first time so next time
around<00:05:14.949> and<00:05:15.400> then<00:05:15.550> from<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.330> point<00:05:16.630> forward

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
around and then from that point forward

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.870 
around and then from that point forward
I've<00:05:17.409> just<00:05:17.620> been<00:05:17.770> using<00:05:17.919> about<00:05:18.280> half<00:05:18.580> the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
I've just been using about half the

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.909 
I've just been using about half the
amount<00:05:19.060> that<00:05:19.240> I<00:05:19.419> normally<00:05:19.479> would<00:05:20.080> use<00:05:20.349> really

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
amount that I normally would use really

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.620 
amount that I normally would use really
working<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.430> through<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.699> hands<00:05:21.970> again<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.509> it

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
working it through the hands again so it

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.029 
working it through the hands again so it
kind<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:22.840> distributes<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.500> product<00:05:23.889> because

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
kind of distributes the product because

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.409 
kind of distributes the product because
like<00:05:24.159> I<00:05:24.250> said<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.550> is<00:05:24.580> really<00:05:24.909> thick<00:05:25.180> so<00:05:25.330> you

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
like I said it is really thick so you

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.700 
like I said it is really thick so you
don't<00:05:25.569> just<00:05:25.690> want<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.900> go<00:05:25.990> lob<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:26.319> all<00:05:26.409> on<00:05:26.590> in

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
don't just want to go lob it all on in

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.529 
don't just want to go lob it all on in
one<00:05:26.919> spot<00:05:27.280> by<00:05:27.880> working<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.270> through<00:05:28.300> your

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
one spot by working it through your

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.450 
one spot by working it through your
hands<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.229> then<00:05:29.560> kind<00:05:29.800> of<00:05:29.860> starting<00:05:30.250> at<00:05:30.340> the

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
hands and then kind of starting at the

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.310 
hands and then kind of starting at the
ends<00:05:30.849> first<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:31.449> then<00:05:31.539> kind<00:05:31.750> of<00:05:31.810> working<00:05:32.199> it

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
ends first and then kind of working it

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.159 
ends first and then kind of working it
through<00:05:32.349> the<00:05:32.830> rest<00:05:33.039> of<00:05:33.190> your<00:05:33.250> hair<00:05:33.550> I<00:05:34.419> leave<00:05:35.020> it

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
through the rest of your hair I leave it

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.680 
through the rest of your hair I leave it
on<00:05:35.289> probably<00:05:36.039> for<00:05:36.430> more<00:05:36.610> like<00:05:36.820> 3<00:05:37.090> or<00:05:37.210> 4<00:05:37.449> minutes

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
on probably for more like 3 or 4 minutes

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.960 
on probably for more like 3 or 4 minutes
on<00:05:38.020> an<00:05:38.199> average<00:05:38.380> basis<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.669> little<00:05:39.880> bit

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
on an average basis and a little bit

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.520 
on an average basis and a little bit
longer<00:05:40.120> sometimes<00:05:40.659> if<00:05:40.870> I'm<00:05:41.020> trying<00:05:41.349> to<00:05:41.409> get

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
longer sometimes if I'm trying to get

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.409 
longer sometimes if I'm trying to get
more<00:05:41.740> of<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:41.919> deep<00:05:42.099> conditioning<00:05:42.580> but<00:05:42.820> it

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
more of a deep conditioning but it

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.990 
more of a deep conditioning but it
rinses<00:05:43.900> out<00:05:44.080> perfectly<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:45.099> it<00:05:45.219> totally<00:05:45.820> gets

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
rinses out perfectly and it totally gets

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.180 
rinses out perfectly and it totally gets
the<00:05:46.150> tangles<00:05:46.570> out<00:05:46.750> totally<00:05:47.590> leaves<00:05:47.800> my<00:05:47.949> hair

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
the tangles out totally leaves my hair

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.540 
the tangles out totally leaves my hair
really<00:05:48.400> moisturized<00:05:49.120> really<00:05:49.810> soft<00:05:50.250> but<00:05:51.250> not

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
said it was a little bit skeptical about

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.800 
said it was a little bit skeptical about
getting<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.550> same<00:06:00.789> results<00:06:01.509> from<00:06:01.659> this

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
getting the same results from this

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.200 
getting the same results from this
product<00:06:02.080> that<00:06:02.409> you<00:06:02.530> do<00:06:02.770> from<00:06:03.099> the<00:06:03.699> standard

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
products that have the chemicals in them

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.129 
products that have the chemicals in them
and<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.520> sulfates<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:07.300> silicones<00:06:07.840> that

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
and the sulfates and the silicones that

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.320 
and the sulfates and the silicones that
help<00:06:08.440> give<00:06:08.770> it<00:06:08.889> that<00:06:08.979> slip<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:09.610> everything<00:06:09.969> so

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330
