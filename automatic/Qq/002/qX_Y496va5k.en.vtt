00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
you go from a combo straight into an

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.849 
you go from a combo straight into an
ultimate<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.020> they<00:00:07.109> have<00:00:07.290> no<00:00:07.470> chance<00:00:07.500> to

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
ultimate and they have no chance to

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.020 
ultimate and they have no chance to
block<00:00:08.450> there<00:00:09.450> they're<00:00:10.230> pretty<00:00:10.260> cool<00:00:11.030> however

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
block there they're pretty cool however

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.140 
block there they're pretty cool however
in<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.450> game<00:00:12.719> because<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.530> new

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
in this game because of the new

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.910 
in this game because of the new
substitution<00:00:15.150> mechanic<00:00:15.599> um<00:00:15.750> they<00:00:16.289> are<00:00:16.470> almost

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
substitution mechanic um they are almost

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.279 
substitution mechanic um they are almost
virtually<00:00:17.430> impossible<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.420> pull<00:00:18.690> off<00:00:18.720> online

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
virtually impossible to pull off online

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.950 
virtually impossible to pull off online
because<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.189> many<00:00:20.279> people<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.789> play<00:00:21.480> save<00:00:21.750> with

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
because so many people do play save with

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.429 
because so many people do play save with
their<00:00:22.400> subs<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:24.750> hard<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> get<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
their subs and it's hard to get in

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.480 
their subs and it's hard to get in
before<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.939> subs<00:00:27.300> again<00:00:27.859> because<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
before they have subs again because you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.849 
before they have subs again because you
waste<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.210> your<00:00:30.269> talk<00:00:30.599> about<00:00:30.630> cancelling<00:00:31.500> so

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
waste all your talk about cancelling so

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.910 
waste all your talk about cancelling so

I love the down combo and storm2 because

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.210 
I love the down combo and storm2 because
it's<00:01:28.050> hard<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> sub<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.800> now<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> can

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it's hard to sub and now you can

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.020 
it's hard to sub and now you can
actually<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.820> an<00:01:29.910> ultimate<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.630> yeah<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
actually for an ultimate so yeah this is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
actually for an ultimate so yeah this is
Shikamaru<00:01:33.830> pts<00:01:34.830> this<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.760> is<00:01:35.880> actually

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
Shikamaru pts this one is actually

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700 
Shikamaru pts this one is actually
probably<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.660> hardest<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.050> pull<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.350> because

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
probably the hardest to pull off because

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
probably the hardest to pull off because
of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> timing<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.060> when<00:01:39.390> he

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
of the timing and because of when he

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.780 
of the timing and because of when he
back<00:01:39.720> dashes<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.770> hard<00:01:41.010> to<00:01:41.130> tell<00:01:41.340> when

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
back dashes it's hard to tell when

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.790 
back dashes it's hard to tell when
exactly<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.600> throw<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> Shogun's<00:01:43.410> but<00:01:43.650> yeah

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
exactly to throw the Shogun's but yeah

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.780 
exactly to throw the Shogun's but yeah
looks<00:01:44.610> pretty<00:01:44.670> cool<00:01:45.680> Karen's<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.640> easy

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
looks pretty cool Karen's is really easy

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.990 
looks pretty cool Karen's is really easy
to<00:01:47.970> pull<00:01:48.119> off<00:01:48.150> um<00:01:48.630> kind<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.440> just<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:50.000> obito's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to pull off um kind of just like obito's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.390 
to pull off um kind of just like obito's
go<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.050> up<00:01:52.140> combo<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> second<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
go for the up combo and on the second to

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.219 
go for the up combo and on the second to
last<00:01:53.430> hit<00:01:53.880> back<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.050> use

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
two but it still works in this game but
i<00:02:07.290> think<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.740> ground<00:02:08.130> one<00:02:08.310> looks<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
i think the ground one looks just to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.470 
i think the ground one looks just to
school<00:02:10.400> personal<00:02:11.400> foul<00:02:11.520> gate<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.820> down<00:02:11.850> combo

school personal foul gate is down combo
as<00:02:12.600> well<00:02:12.780> before<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.380> second<00:02:13.709> blast<00:02:13.950> hit<00:02:14.190> stop

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
as well before the second blast hit stop

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.640 
as well before the second blast hit stop
hitting<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.570> use<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.930> ultimate<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.560> it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
hitting and then use the ultimate and it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.320 
hitting and then use the ultimate and it
will<00:02:16.890> hit<00:02:17.100> them<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.340> cannot<00:02:17.790> take<00:02:18.030> out<00:02:18.209> of
