shopping<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.670> running<00:00:15.030> shoes<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.480> that's

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
shopping for running shoes and that's

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.140 
shopping for running shoes and that's
pronation<00:00:16.439> control<00:00:16.949> by<00:00:17.579> matching<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
pronation control by matching the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.329 
pronation control by matching the

motion control shoe the second type of
test<00:01:21.350> would<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.380> known<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.250> where<00:01:23.790> test

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
test would be known as the where test

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
test would be known as the where test
most<00:01:25.830> people<00:01:26.100> land<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> outside<00:01:26.909> heel

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
most people land on the outside heel

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.090 
most people land on the outside heel
area<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.600> their<00:01:27.720> shoe<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.620> is<00:01:28.770> why<00:01:28.890> there's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
area of their shoe which is why there's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
area of their shoe which is why there's
a<00:01:29.159> high<00:01:29.400> abrasion<00:01:29.700> area<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.420> portion<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
a high abrasion area in that portion of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.719 
a high abrasion area in that portion of
the<00:01:31.080> shoe<00:01:31.260> so<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.040> don't<00:01:32.130> look<00:01:32.280> at<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.549> so

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the shoe so we don't look at that so

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.820 
the shoe so we don't look at that so
much<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.120> we<00:01:33.450> look<00:01:33.600> at<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> forefoot<00:01:34.200> area<00:01:34.530> if

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
much as we look at the forefoot area if

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.610 
much as we look at the forefoot area if
the<00:01:35.760> where<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> outside<00:01:36.750> pinky<00:01:37.350> area

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
the where is on the outside pinky area

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.380 
the where is on the outside pinky area
of<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.830> shoe<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.060> would<00:01:39.090> indicate

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
of the shoe then that would indicate

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.789 
of the shoe then that would indicate
that<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.810> would<00:01:39.930> need<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.110> neutral<00:01:40.500> type<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that you would need a neutral type of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.490 
that you would need a neutral type of
shoe<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.370> it<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> center<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
shoe if it was in the center then that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.990 
shoe if it was in the center then that
would<00:01:43.530> indicate<00:01:43.799> you'd<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.369> looking<00:01:44.700> at<00:01:44.940> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
would indicate you'd be looking at a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
would indicate you'd be looking at a
support<00:01:45.360> shoe<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:46.710> underneath<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
support shoe if it was underneath the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
support shoe if it was underneath the
big<00:01:47.460> toe<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> ball<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> foot<00:01:48.299> that

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
big toe or the ball of the foot that

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.530 
big toe or the ball of the foot that
would<00:01:49.110> indicate<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.560> motion<00:01:50.010> control<00:01:50.340> shoe<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
would indicate a motion control shoe the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240
