 psv b1 to take on roda jc at home 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.550
 The team from Kerkrade is the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 we can find PSV in the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.969
 average with 8 points out of six 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.199
 matches creation here from the video 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.020
 of the engine with the overview and at the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.900
 second pole mountain wine but his shot 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.550
 steel keeper problem the rebound then 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.289
 of panels 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:33.360
 there has come the roo there none 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:35.790
 problems with making it in play 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.309
 caro to get out how busy putting 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 psv b 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.360
 we hear playing under it but is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.750
 the loss of lucas 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.120
 and therefore the acquisition of psv met berden 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.120
 broker half an hour play a role of 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.160
 the justified lead for the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.160
 home team 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.059
 Berden here overview 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:11.380
 they are hidden in these shorts 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:13.640
 levels pull-back than roda with large 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.410
 brothers in pursuit the shot of 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.380
 big 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.910
 your finger tips are not ours 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.040
 but the code that looks like for the would be nothing 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.710
 deliver 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.980
 Paul rested lundqvist with the deep 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.480
 ball on beds that is faster to code 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.850
 from the overview 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.510
 at the second pole that is the mole 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.440
 it simple 2 0 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.820
 [Applause] 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.660
 were thus in the first half with the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:49.880
 cabbage and now with the artist and psv b1 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:52.460
 at 2 0 the good viewer of berden 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.830
 the fogging of sportback and it 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.290
 simply finish off dani van der moot we 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.210
 man strong 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.530
 mountain wine you will find here from the maud van 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.479
 der moot with the overview back on 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.190
 weimans 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.480
 which we return or other beautiful and van der 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.790
 moot already has something very beautiful in it 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:20.019
 thoughts and can still perform it too 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.019
 great goal from dani van der moot 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.709
 just look sink on the floor 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.709
 nailed 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.790
 and so it is 3 0 and again weimans with 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.849
 the space 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.159
 luke kick kicked the rescue this time 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.080
 from railroad to the want to return 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.080
 but that ball is taken out 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:54.129
 Rio and Wijmans 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:54.129
 the shot from us basket and so it is 4 0 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.000
 Marco Leemans has plenty of room to relax 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.230
 get links for you to celebrate 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.230
 he must still owe the answer 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.690
 daneels of the moat failed shot 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.560
 were still at the back of the rimor of 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.560
 lambs who goes on the pole 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.640
 then that ball apparently has been behind 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.540
 doing is a good opportunity for psv 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.409
 [Music] 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.040
 carpentry with the bad replay ball 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.220
 from the maud o what does the 30 do again 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.220
 fantastic 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:47.480
 what an overview does this dani from 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.480
 der moot you all see so far see this 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.030
 then it is consternation because 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.329
 Referee also found after this goal 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.329
 rejected 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.810
 the reason is still 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.810
 unclear 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:05.150
 green quist with the shot and the rescue 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.150
 from rail back 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.550
 and the man must be put right by soot 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.550
 frist 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.989
 now with the overview to the circle 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.100
 in frog and for berden 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.100
 and therefore the five zero 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.190
 excellent lundquist competition 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.720
 berden made five zero but he made 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.710
 obviously the nicest goals of this 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.050
 duel 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.200
 so psv int with five zero from roda jc 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.380
 and light utrecht az in three two 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.030
 fc twente against ajax becomes 2 2 that is 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.130
 first point loss for feyenoord that 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.480
 no further visit to Heerenveen 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.790
 then comes a one a draw so this 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.590
 file feyenoord is the leader in 19 points 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.600
 from 7 matches 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.660
 PSV is trapped by that victory over Roda 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.810
 jc to place 5 and has 11 points out of 7 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.810
 matches
