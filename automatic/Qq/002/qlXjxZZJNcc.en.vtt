good quality nylon and also another

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.010 
good quality nylon and also another
another<00:01:19.640> nice<00:01:19.909> feature<00:01:20.180> on<00:01:20.330> there<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.810> that

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
another nice feature on there is that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.780 
another nice feature on there is that
you<00:01:21.170> see<00:01:21.350> on<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.650> front<00:01:21.860> here<00:01:22.159> on<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.430> buckle

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
you see on the front here on the buckle

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.240 
you see on the front here on the buckle
they<00:01:22.970> both<00:01:23.210> angled<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.770> don't<00:01:24.979> know<00:01:25.190> if

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
they both angled it and I don't know if

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.830 
they both angled it and I don't know if
the<00:01:25.340> light<00:01:25.460> will<00:01:25.640> show<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.850> but<00:01:26.330> they<00:01:26.479> will

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
the light will show you but they will

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840 
the light will show you but they will
they<00:01:27.170> just<00:01:27.409> pressed<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.800> with<00:01:27.920> heat<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:28.640> that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
they just pressed it with heat so that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.790 
they just pressed it with heat so that
this<00:01:29.000> front<00:01:29.420> portion<00:01:29.840> here<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.620> you're

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
this front portion here that you're

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.110 
this front portion here that you're
actually<00:01:31.040> feeding<00:01:31.250> through<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.610> buckle<00:01:31.790> is

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
actually feeding through the buckle is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.690 
actually feeding through the buckle is
really<00:01:32.630> rigid<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.260> it<00:01:33.320> feeds<00:01:33.560> nicely<00:01:34.490> through

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
really rigid so it feeds nicely through

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700 
really rigid so it feeds nicely through
there<00:01:35.440> now

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
there now

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.130 
there now
the<00:01:37.130> buckle<00:01:37.490> on<00:01:37.580> here<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.090> another<00:01:38.630> high<00:01:38.900> point

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the buckle on here is another high point

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.680 
the buckle on here is another high point
it's<00:01:39.470> a<00:01:40.040> polymer<00:01:40.640> buckle<00:01:41.090> which<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.450> really

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
it's a polymer buckle which I really

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.300 
it's a polymer buckle which I really
like<00:01:41.930> because<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.440> keeps<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.920> belt<00:01:43.070> very

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
like because it keeps the belt very

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.210 
like because it keeps the belt very
lightweight<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.180> it's<00:01:45.020> also<00:01:45.229> just<00:01:45.620> a<00:01:45.770> good

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
lightweight and it's also just a good

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.640 
lightweight and it's also just a good
durable<00:01:46.880> buckle<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.900> actually<00:01:48.200> prefer

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
durable buckle and I actually prefer

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.380 
durable buckle and I actually prefer
this<00:01:48.830> over<00:01:48.890> some<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.490> steel<00:01:49.850> buckles<00:01:50.299> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
this over some of the steel buckles that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.480 
this over some of the steel buckles that
you<00:01:50.510> find<00:01:50.750> on<00:01:50.900> like<00:01:51.080> instructor<00:01:51.650> belts<00:01:51.979> now

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
you find on like instructor belts now

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.700 
you find on like instructor belts now
I'm<00:01:52.760> not<00:01:53.420> going<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.570> totally<00:01:54.080> criticise<00:01:54.500> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
I'm not going to totally criticise the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.620 
I'm not going to totally criticise the
steel<00:01:54.950> buckles<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:55.490> those<00:01:55.760> belts<00:01:56.060> because

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
steel buckles on those belts because

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.480 
steel buckles on those belts because
they're<00:01:56.780> much<00:01:56.960> more<00:01:57.140> rigid<00:01:57.440> belts<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.340> have

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
they're much more rigid belts that have

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.100 
they're much more rigid belts that have
a<00:01:58.520> little<00:01:58.700> bit<00:01:58.880> different<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.420> know<00:01:59.540> intended

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
a little bit different you know intended

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.469 
a little bit different you know intended
use<00:02:00.409> but<00:02:01.159> for<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.909> really<00:02:02.119> like<00:02:02.330> the

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
use but for this I really like the

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.660 
use but for this I really like the
polymer<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.920> other<00:02:04.070> nice<00:02:04.430> thing<00:02:04.460> about

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
polymer and the other nice thing about

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.039 
polymer and the other nice thing about
it<00:02:04.820> is<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.420> just<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.689> little<00:02:05.780> bit<00:02:05.930> more

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
it is that it's just a little bit more

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.440 
it is that it's just a little bit more
comfortable<00:02:06.500> on<00:02:06.619> your<00:02:06.740> skin<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:08.060> know<00:02:08.179> some

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
comfortable on your skin you know some

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.539 
comfortable on your skin you know some
of<00:02:08.479> those<00:02:08.629> steel<00:02:09.110> buckles<00:02:09.769> are<00:02:10.099> just<00:02:10.369> very

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
of those steel buckles are just very

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.750 
of those steel buckles are just very
cold<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.330> hard<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.740> know<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.520> cold

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
cold and hard and you know it's so cold

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.280 
cold and hard and you know it's so cold
sometimes<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> comes<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.870> contact<00:02:14.900> with

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
sometimes if it comes in contact with

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.690 
sometimes if it comes in contact with
your<00:02:15.410> skin<00:02:15.500> will<00:02:15.920> kind<00:02:16.069> of<00:02:16.130> bite<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.520> little

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
your skin will kind of bite you a little

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.260 
your skin will kind of bite you a little
bit

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
bit

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.670 
bit
it's<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.690> not<00:02:17.810> comfortable<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.440> really

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's just not comfortable so I really

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.830 
it's just not comfortable so I really
like<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.010> polymer<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:20.030> good<00:02:20.270> design

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
like this polymer it's a good design

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.470 
like this polymer it's a good design
it's<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.440> friction<00:02:21.890> fit<00:02:22.100> design<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.270> just

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
it's a friction fit design so just

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.510 
it's a friction fit design so just
slides<00:02:24.020> through<00:02:24.290> there<00:02:24.500> goes<00:02:25.190> through<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
slides through there goes through the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.890 
slides through there goes through the
other<00:02:25.610> side<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:28.610> know<00:02:28.730> attaches<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.630> in

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
other side and you know attaches to in

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.170 
other side and you know attaches to in
that<00:02:30.230> way<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.640> other<00:02:31.670> good<00:02:31.970> thing<00:02:32.150> about

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
that way and the other good thing about

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.810 
that way and the other good thing about
that<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.960> that<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:33.890> infinitely

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
that is is that it's infinitely

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.670 
that is is that it's infinitely
adjustable<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.140> adjust<00:02:36.320> this

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
adjustable so you can you adjust this

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.830 
adjustable so you can you adjust this
wherever<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.190> want<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.550> if<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.970> gain<00:02:38.480> or<00:02:38.720> lose

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
wherever you want it if you gain or lose

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.210 
wherever you want it if you gain or lose
weight<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.440> if<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.620> want<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:39.860> tighter<00:02:40.100> or

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
weight and if you want it tighter or

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.700 
weight and if you want it tighter or
looser<00:02:40.490> whatever<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.660> can<00:02:41.810> get<00:02:42.020> exactly<00:02:42.530> how

that's<00:03:19.310> good<00:03:19.580> value<00:03:19.970> it's<00:03:20.420> definitely<00:03:20.870> worth

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
that's good value it's definitely worth

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.200 
that's good value it's definitely worth
it<00:03:21.230> it's<00:03:21.440> very<00:03:21.620> durable<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.340> if<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.850> do<00:03:23.060> end

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
it it's very durable and if you do end

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.000 
it it's very durable and if you do end
up<00:03:23.300> getting<00:03:23.570> in<00:03:23.660> any<00:03:23.870> fraying<00:03:24.410> on<00:03:24.650> there<00:03:24.890> or

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
up getting in any fraying on there or

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.310 
up getting in any fraying on there or
anything<00:03:25.220> which<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.630> have<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.900> use<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.170> lot

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
anything which you have to use it a lot

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.750 
anything which you have to use it a lot
I've<00:03:27.680> been<00:03:27.920> using<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.400> year<00:03:28.460> and<00:03:28.700> I've

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
I've been using it for a year and I've

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.190 
I've been using it for a year and I've
just<00:03:28.970> started<00:03:29.120> getting<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.690> little<00:03:29.900> bit<00:03:30.110> of

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
just started getting a little bit of

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.750 
just started getting a little bit of
fraying<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.830> know<00:03:30.950> kind<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.250> where<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.490> feeds

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
fraying you know kind of where it feeds

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.790 
fraying you know kind of where it feeds
through<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.000> buckle<00:03:32.260> it's<00:03:33.260> easy<00:03:33.530> enough<00:03:33.650> to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
through the buckle it's easy enough to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.650 
through the buckle it's easy enough to
just<00:03:33.980> take<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> lighter<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.820> you<00:03:35.300> know<00:03:35.420> burn

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
just take a lighter to it you know burn

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.270 
just take a lighter to it you know burn
off<00:03:35.870> some<00:03:36.050> of<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.440> nylon<00:03:36.980> and

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
off some of that in that nylon and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.070 
off some of that in that nylon and
you're<00:03:37.370> good<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.640> go<00:03:37.760> again<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.570> really<00:03:38.930> like

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
you're good to go again so I really like

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.780 
you're good to go again so I really like
this<00:03:39.290> bag<00:03:39.530> guys<00:03:39.740> so<00:03:39.950> this<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.250> double<00:03:40.490> duty

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
this bag guys so this is the double duty

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.630 
this bag guys so this is the double duty
belt<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.390> so<00:03:42.140> it's<00:03:42.290> very<00:03:42.740> similar<00:03:43.160> features

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
belt and so it's very similar features

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.610 
belt and so it's very similar features
to<00:03:43.790> this<00:03:43.910> one<00:03:44.210> but<00:03:44.750> what<00:03:44.930> they<00:03:45.080> did<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.380> they

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
to this one but what they did is they

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.530 
to this one but what they did is they
sandwich<00:03:46.220> two<00:03:46.520> layers<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.240> nylon

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
sandwich two layers of the nylon

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.330 
sandwich two layers of the nylon
together<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.200> then<00:03:48.410> they<00:03:48.530> did<00:03:48.710> five<00:03:48.950> rows<00:03:49.160> of

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
together and then they did five rows of

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.490 
together and then they did five rows of
stitching<00:03:49.820> down<00:03:50.060> there<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.510> title<00:03:51.320> together

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
stitching down there to title together

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.100 
stitching down there to title together
so<00:03:52.130> there's<00:03:52.280> no<00:03:52.460> plastic<00:03:52.790> liner<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:53.780> there<00:03:53.960> or

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
so there's no plastic liner in there or

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.870 
so there's no plastic liner in there or
anything<00:03:54.320> it's<00:03:54.620> essentially<00:03:55.130> just<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.460> nylon

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
anything it's essentially just the nylon

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.700 
anything it's essentially just the nylon
so<00:03:56.390> it's<00:03:56.510> really<00:03:56.690> more<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.960> mid<00:03:57.230> weight<00:03:57.440> belt

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
so it's really more of a mid weight belt

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.430 
so it's really more of a mid weight belt
it's<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.300> belt<00:03:59.300> that's<00:03:59.540> rigid<00:03:59.840> enough<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.380> you

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
it's a belt that's rigid enough that you

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.110 
it's a belt that's rigid enough that you
could<00:04:00.680> carry<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.070> gun<00:04:01.310> or<00:04:01.520> something<00:04:01.700> on<00:04:01.970> the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
could carry a gun or something on the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.610 
could carry a gun or something on the
here<00:04:02.390> something<00:04:02.960> has<00:04:03.080> some<00:04:03.260> more<00:04:03.380> weight<00:04:03.590> to

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
here something has some more weight to

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.440 
here something has some more weight to
it<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.100> this<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.280> going<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.640> support<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.240> lot

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
it and this is going to support it a lot

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.810 
it and this is going to support it a lot
better<00:04:05.660> than<00:04:05.990> you<00:04:06.650> know<00:04:06.740> something<00:04:07.100> it's<00:04:07.640> more

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
better than you know something it's more

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.970 
better than you know something it's more
floppy<00:04:08.150> like<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:09.830> is<00:04:09.950> a

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
floppy like this so this this is a

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.290 
floppy like this so this this is a
really<00:04:10.190> nice<00:04:10.280> option<00:04:10.580> if<00:04:10.910> you're<00:04:11.060> like<00:04:11.270> a

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
really nice option if you're like a

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.870 
really nice option if you're like a
concealed<00:04:12.290> carry<00:04:12.470> permit<00:04:12.860> holder<00:04:13.160> you<00:04:13.610> carry

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
concealed carry permit holder you carry

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.539 
concealed carry permit holder you carry
a<00:04:13.970> gun<00:04:14.209> everyday<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:15.410> want<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:16.010> know<00:04:16.310> belt

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
a gun everyday you want you know belt

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.620 
a gun everyday you want you know belt
that's<00:04:16.730> going<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:16.940> provide<00:04:17.150> some<00:04:17.359> rigidity

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
that's going to provide some rigidity

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.690 
that's going to provide some rigidity
but<00:04:18.260> not<00:04:18.410> something<00:04:18.680> that's<00:04:18.770> too<00:04:19.190> overly

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
but not something that's too overly

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.780 
but not something that's too overly
heavier<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.239> overly<00:04:21.020> rigid<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.580> good

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
heavier to overly rigid this is a good

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.210 
heavier to overly rigid this is a good
option<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.410> one<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.710> offered<00:04:24.950> just<00:04:25.040> in

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
option so this one is offered just in

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.030 
option so this one is offered just in
two<00:04:25.400> colors<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.210> coyote<00:04:27.020> Brown<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.890> the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
two colors the coyote Brown and the

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
two colors the coyote Brown and the
olive<00:04:28.340> drab

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
olive drab

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.400 
olive drab
but<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.330> nice<00:04:29.630> feature<00:04:29.870> is<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.139> it's

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
but a nice feature is that it's

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.680 
but a nice feature is that it's
reversible<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.370> could<00:04:31.760> wear<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.480> with

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
reversible so you could wear this with

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.620 
reversible so you could wear this with
the<00:04:32.720> black<00:04:32.990> side<00:04:33.230> out<00:04:33.470> or<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:35.330> colored

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
the black side out or the the colored

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.230 
the black side out or the the colored
side<00:04:36.139> out<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:36.919> that's<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.310> really<00:04:37.790> nice<00:04:38.030> feature

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
side out so that's a really nice feature

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.540 
side out so that's a really nice feature
the<00:04:38.870> buckle<00:04:39.230> is<00:04:39.380> essentially<00:04:39.889> just<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.310> same

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
the buckle is essentially just the same

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.040 
the buckle is essentially just the same
just<00:04:40.880> with<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.060> little<00:04:41.150> bit<00:04:41.330> bigger<00:04:41.540> openings

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
just with a little bit bigger openings

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.870 
just with a little bit bigger openings
for<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.440> thicker<00:04:42.680> material<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.370> fit<00:04:43.550> through

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
for the thicker material to fit through

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.740 
for the thicker material to fit through
and<00:04:44.380> so<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.650> think<00:04:45.710> it's<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:46.010> good<00:04:46.160> option<00:04:46.570> if<00:04:47.570> you

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
and so I think it's a good option if you

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.360 
and so I think it's a good option if you
like<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.200> design<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:48.980> just<00:04:49.160> want<00:04:49.340> a

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
like the design and you just want a

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.120 
like the design and you just want a
little<00:04:49.430> bit<00:04:49.610> more<00:04:49.669> rigid<00:04:50.530> version<00:04:51.530> of<00:04:51.620> it<00:04:51.770> it's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
little bit more rigid version of it it's

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.850 
little bit more rigid version of it it's
not<00:04:52.370> super<00:04:53.210> super<00:04:53.389> rigid<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:54.200> know<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.350> have

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
not super super rigid you know I have

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.530 
not super super rigid you know I have
stuff<00:04:55.160> like<00:04:55.430> this<00:04:55.669> one<00:04:55.910> this<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.180> an<00:04:56.270> Uncle

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
stuff like this one this is an Uncle

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.360 
stuff like this one this is an Uncle
Mike's<00:04:56.720> instructor<00:04:57.320> belt<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:58.100> has<00:04:58.340> a

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
Mike's instructor belt this has a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.879 
Mike's instructor belt this has a
plastic<00:04:59.030> insert<00:04:59.389> in<00:04:59.600> it<00:04:59.750> this<00:05:00.200> has<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.440> big

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
plastic insert in it this has a big

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.360 
plastic insert in it this has a big
steel<00:05:01.250> buckle<00:05:01.729> this<00:05:02.150> is<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.389> heavier<00:05:02.960> belt<00:05:03.380> but

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
steel buckle this is a heavier belt but

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.260 
steel buckle this is a heavier belt but
it's<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.729> little<00:05:04.970> bit<00:05:05.120> more<00:05:05.389> rigid<00:05:05.630> even<00:05:06.620> still

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
it's a little bit more rigid even still

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.610 
it's a little bit more rigid even still
so<00:05:08.270> you'll<00:05:08.750> see<00:05:08.930> review<00:05:09.169> on<00:05:09.260> this<00:05:09.410> in<00:05:09.530> the

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
so you'll see review on this in the

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.340 
so you'll see review on this in the
future<00:05:09.950> that's<00:05:10.850> it's<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.570> pretty<00:05:11.780> decent<00:05:12.169> belt

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
future that's it's a pretty decent belt

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.250 
future that's it's a pretty decent belt
as<00:05:12.530> well<00:05:12.560> but<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.490> like<00:05:14.060> this<00:05:14.240> a<00:05:14.300> lot<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.810> it's

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
as well but I like this a lot and it's

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.870 
as well but I like this a lot and it's
not<00:05:15.500> all<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:15.740> expensive<00:05:16.250> this<00:05:16.580> is<00:05:16.700> going

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
not all that expensive this is going

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.520 
not all that expensive this is going
right<00:05:17.000> around<00:05:17.120> 20<00:05:17.540> bucks<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.020> it's<00:05:18.139> really<00:05:18.350> not

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
right around 20 bucks so it's really not

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.770 
right around 20 bucks so it's really not
all<00:05:18.590> that<00:05:18.860> much<00:05:18.979> more<00:05:19.280> than<00:05:19.460> this<00:05:19.610> one<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.150> I

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
all that much more than this one and I

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.800 
all that much more than this one and I
think<00:05:21.410> it's<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.560> really<00:05:21.740> good<00:05:21.919> value<00:05:22.130> and

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
think it's a really good value and

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.450 
think it's a really good value and
another<00:05:23.810> nice<00:05:24.020> feature<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.680> this<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:25.190> I

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
another nice feature of this that I

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.090 
another nice feature of this that I
didn't<00:05:25.940> really<00:05:26.060> mention<00:05:26.240> is<00:05:27.020> that<00:05:27.350> with<00:05:28.040> that

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
didn't really mention is that with that

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.490 
didn't really mention is that with that
polymer<00:05:28.639> buckle<00:05:29.120> not<00:05:29.389> only<00:05:29.690> is<00:05:29.840> it<00:05:29.870> is<00:05:30.229> it

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
polymer buckle not only is it is it

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.890 
polymer buckle not only is it is it
lightweight<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:31.070> comfortable<00:05:31.510> but<00:05:32.510> it's

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
lightweight and comfortable but it's

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.560 
lightweight and comfortable but it's
safe<00:05:33.740> if<00:05:34.010> you're<00:05:34.160> on<00:05:34.310> an<00:05:34.460> EOD<00:05:34.700> team<00:05:35.120> you<00:05:35.450> know

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
safe if you're on an EOD team you know

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.090 
safe if you're on an EOD team you know
if<00:05:35.780> you're<00:05:35.930> somebody<00:05:36.229> that's<00:05:36.289> working<00:05:36.680> around

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
if you're somebody that's working around

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.950 
if you're somebody that's working around
an<00:05:37.340> environment<00:05:38.060> where<00:05:38.479> you<00:05:38.570> can't<00:05:38.780> have<00:05:38.900> a

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
an environment where you can't have a

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.500 
an environment where you can't have a
lot<00:05:39.110> of<00:05:39.169> sparks<00:05:39.740> that's<00:05:40.490> a<00:05:40.669> that's<00:05:41.000> a<00:05:41.150> big<00:05:41.180> plus

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
lot of sparks that's a that's a big plus

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.510 
lot of sparks that's a that's a big plus
and<00:05:41.840> it's<00:05:42.200> also<00:05:42.350> easy<00:05:42.650> to<00:05:42.890> go<00:05:42.979> through<00:05:43.010> things

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
and it's also easy to go through things

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.820 
and it's also easy to go through things
like<00:05:43.640> airport<00:05:44.150> security<00:05:44.720> with<00:05:44.870> this<00:05:45.110> you

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
like airport security with this you

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.750 
like airport security with this you
don't<00:05:46.010> worry<00:05:46.220> about<00:05:46.310> setting<00:05:46.640> off<00:05:46.729> metal

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
don't worry about setting off metal

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.050 
don't worry about setting off metal
detectors<00:05:47.090> or<00:05:47.990> anything<00:05:48.919> like<00:05:49.160> that<00:05:49.220> so

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
detectors or anything like that so

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.400 
detectors or anything like that so
overall<00:05:50.390> it's<00:05:50.720> a<00:05:50.840> really<00:05:51.080> nice<00:05:51.200> design

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
there's not that much to it I mean it's

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.290
