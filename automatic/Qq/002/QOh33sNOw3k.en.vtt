puts<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.939> little<00:01:42.150> bit<00:01:42.299> more<00:01:42.450> pressure<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
puts a little bit more pressure on the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.600 
puts a little bit more pressure on the
knee<00:01:43.590> joint<00:01:43.619> than<00:01:44.009> let's<00:01:44.159> say<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.460> leg

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
knee joint than let's say that leg

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.700 
knee joint than let's say that leg
extension<00:01:45.060> machine<00:01:45.149> does<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.500> have

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
extension machine does so if you have

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.740 
extension machine does so if you have
any<00:01:46.979> worries<00:01:47.310> about<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:48.060> knee<00:01:48.240> joint<00:01:48.450> itself

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
any worries about the knee joint itself

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
any worries about the knee joint itself
or<00:01:49.079> any<00:01:49.200> pain<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.310> want<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> do

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
or any pain in there what you want to do

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.219 
or any pain in there what you want to do
is<00:01:50.909> find<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> leg<00:01:51.360> extension<00:01:51.780> machine<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
is find a leg extension machine and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.010 
is find a leg extension machine and
stick<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.880> extra<00:01:53.880> tip<00:01:54.149> dudes<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.930> you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
stick with that extra tip dudes what you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
stick with that extra tip dudes what you
want<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.770> want<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> focus<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
want to do if you want to focus on a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
want to do if you want to focus on a
certain<00:01:57.030> area<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> quads<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.170> you're

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
certain area of the quads is you're

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.620 
certain area of the quads is you're
actually<00:01:58.500> gonna<00:01:58.799> move<00:01:59.159> your<00:01:59.670> toes<00:01:59.909> outward<00:02:00.210> as

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
actually gonna move your toes outward as

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.630 
actually gonna move your toes outward as
you<00:02:00.689> extend<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> legs<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.549> gonna

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you extend the legs and you're gonna

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.219 
you extend the legs and you're gonna
work<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.149> bit<00:02:03.390> more<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.719> vastus

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
work a little bit more of vastus

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.980 
work a little bit more of vastus
medialis<00:02:04.560> or<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.670> pull<00:02:05.909> your<00:02:06.060> toes<00:02:06.270> inward<00:02:06.600> as

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
medialis or you pull your toes inward as

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.479 
medialis or you pull your toes inward as
you<00:02:07.170> extend<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> legs<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.009> you're<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
you extend the legs and you're going to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.559 
you extend the legs and you're going to
work<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.849> little<00:02:09.119> bit<00:02:09.239> more

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
work a little bit more

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.630 
work a little bit more
that's<00:02:09.749> lateralis<00:02:10.469> muscles<00:02:10.859> and<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.489> your

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that's lateralis muscles and if your

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.130 
that's lateralis muscles and if your
toes<00:02:11.939> are<00:02:12.120> straight<00:02:12.299> you're<00:02:12.780> gonna<00:02:12.900> basically

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
toes are straight you're gonna basically

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.009 
toes are straight you're gonna basically
work<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.280> overall<00:02:14.730> section<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.510> also<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
work the overall section and also the

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.259 
work the overall section and also the
rectus<00:02:16.290> femoris<00:02:16.499> as<00:02:16.709> well<00:02:16.889> so<00:02:17.579> that's<00:02:17.969> going

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
rectus femoris as well so that's going

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.649 
rectus femoris as well so that's going
to<00:02:18.329> be<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.689> good<00:02:19.049> tip<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:20.459> variable<00:02:21.030> angles

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
to be a good tip is the variable angles

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.190 
to be a good tip is the variable angles
of<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.620> toes<00:02:22.889> much<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.969> you<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.359> in<00:02:24.599> calves

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
of the toes much like you do in calves

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.860 
of the toes much like you do in calves
or<00:02:25.650> arms<00:02:26.639> so<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.269> kind<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.540> equates<00:02:27.780> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
or arms so that kind of equates to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.209 
or arms so that kind of equates to
different<00:02:28.200> muscle<00:02:28.260> groups<00:02:28.439> as<00:02:28.650> well<00:02:28.799> but

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
different muscle groups as well but

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.860 
different muscle groups as well but
specifically<00:02:29.760> if<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.180> really<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.719> focus

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
specifically if you really want to focus

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.869 
specifically if you really want to focus
on<00:02:31.260> an<00:02:31.379> area<00:02:31.469> of<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.889> tear<00:02:32.099> drops<00:02:32.400> you're

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
on an area of the tear drops you're

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.580 
on an area of the tear drops you're
gonna<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.120> changing<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.540> angles<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.379> toes

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
gonna be changing the angles of the toes

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.709 
gonna be changing the angles of the toes
so<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.099> remember<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.549> get<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> nice<00:02:36.269> burn<00:02:36.510> on

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
so you remember that get a nice burn on

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.869 
so you remember that get a nice burn on
the<00:02:36.900> inside<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.409> those<00:02:37.469> quads<00:02:37.769> or<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.519> outside

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
the inside of those quads or the outside

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.539 
the inside of those quads or the outside
tip<00:02:39.810> number<00:02:39.989> two<00:02:40.319> choose<00:02:40.739> your<00:02:40.889> exercises

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
tip number two choose your exercises

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.339 
tip number two choose your exercises
wisely<00:02:41.969> so<00:02:42.239> instead<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.540> doing<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.930> full<00:02:43.169> range

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
wisely so instead of doing a full range

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.110 
wisely so instead of doing a full range
of<00:02:43.439> motion<00:02:43.620> squat<00:02:44.159> which<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.549> gonna<00:02:44.639> work<00:02:44.849> more

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
of motion squat which is gonna work more

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.030 
of motion squat which is gonna work more
the<00:02:45.269> entire<00:02:45.569> leg<00:02:45.870> what<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.439> want<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:46.859> is

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the entire leg what you want to do is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.250 
the entire leg what you want to do is
specifically<00:02:47.549> choose<00:02:47.879> exercises<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.139> are

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
specifically choose exercises that are

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.750 
specifically choose exercises that are
going<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.469> help<00:02:49.739> isolate<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.250> quads<00:02:50.459> even

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
going to help isolate the quads even

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.789 
going to help isolate the quads even
more<00:02:50.939> which<00:02:51.449> let's<00:02:51.719> say<00:02:51.780> would<00:02:52.019> be<00:02:52.079> front

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
more which let's say would be front

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.679 
more which let's say would be front
squats<00:02:53.099> getting<00:02:53.849> all<00:02:53.969> the<00:02:54.090> way<00:02:54.150> down<00:02:54.359> it's

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
squats getting all the way down it's

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.270 
squats getting all the way down it's
gonna<00:02:54.810> be<00:02:54.900> front<00:02:55.139> loaded<00:02:55.230> put<00:02:55.799> more<00:02:55.980> pressure

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
gonna be front loaded put more pressure

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.879 
gonna be front loaded put more pressure
on<00:02:56.519> those<00:02:57.359> quads<00:02:57.689> and<00:02:57.959> also<00:02:58.349> let's<00:02:58.560> say<00:02:58.680> hack

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
on those quads and also let's say hack

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.470 
on those quads and also let's say hack
squats<00:02:59.219> hack<00:02:59.699> squats<00:02:59.969> are<00:03:00.060> gonna<00:03:00.150> work<00:03:00.329> a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
squats hack squats are gonna work a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.550 
squats hack squats are gonna work a
little<00:03:00.569> bit<00:03:00.719> more<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.989> quad<00:03:01.169> based<00:03:01.409> because

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
little bit more the quad based because

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.259 
little bit more the quad based because
you<00:03:01.769> put<00:03:01.949> more<00:03:02.099> pressure<00:03:02.310> through<00:03:02.969> the<00:03:03.000> balls

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
you put more pressure through the balls

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.640 
you put more pressure through the balls
of<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.480> feet<00:03:03.510> get<00:03:04.019> more<00:03:04.260> squeezing<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
of the feet get more squeezing the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.890 
of the feet get more squeezing the
client<00:03:05.010> or<00:03:05.340> even<00:03:05.639> let's<00:03:05.790> say<00:03:05.849> lunges<00:03:06.329> so<00:03:06.719> what

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
client or even let's say lunges so what

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.599 
client or even let's say lunges so what
you<00:03:06.989> want<00:03:07.139> to<00:03:07.230> do<00:03:07.379> is<00:03:07.739> always<00:03:08.250> build<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
you want to do is always build the

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.970 
you want to do is always build the
program<00:03:08.849> specific<00:03:09.719> to<00:03:09.750> your<00:03:10.049> goal<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:10.859> want

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
program specific to your goal you want

to build quads use exercises that help
focus<00:03:13.889> on<00:03:14.009> the<00:03:14.220> koalas<00:03:14.519> tip<00:03:15.090> number<00:03:15.269> three<00:03:15.569> is

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
focus on the koalas tip number three is

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.569 
focus on the koalas tip number three is
going<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.139> priority<00:03:16.500> training<00:03:17.099> principle

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
going to be priority training principle

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.280 
going to be priority training principle
your<00:03:17.790> priority<00:03:18.239> at<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.509> point<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.079> build

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
your priority at this point is to build

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.439 
your priority at this point is to build
the<00:03:19.500> quads<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:19.889> develop<00:03:20.310> them<00:03:20.489> more<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.299> what

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
the quads and develop them more so what

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.629 
the quads and develop them more so what
you<00:03:21.569> want<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.229> in<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.099> first<00:03:23.370> part<00:03:23.579> of

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
you want to do is in the first part of

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.059 
you want to do is in the first part of
the<00:03:23.729> program<00:03:23.909> contain<00:03:24.870> exercises<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.859> hit

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
the program contain exercises that hit

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.649 
the program contain exercises that hit
those<00:03:26.189> quads<00:03:26.519> let's<00:03:26.879> say<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.090> start<00:03:27.540> with

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
those quads let's say you start with

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.719 
those quads let's say you start with
extensions<00:03:28.319> first<00:03:28.560> really<00:03:29.189> pre-exhaust

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
extensions first really pre-exhaust

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.219 
extensions first really pre-exhaust
those<00:03:29.939> quantities<00:03:30.269> before<00:03:30.629> hitting<00:03:30.870> squats

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
those quantities before hitting squats

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.649 
those quantities before hitting squats
because<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.949> don't<00:03:32.220> want<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.579> neglect<00:03:32.729> a<00:03:33.150> lift

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
because you don't want to neglect a lift

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.399 
because you don't want to neglect a lift
like<00:03:33.840> squats

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
like squats

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.140 
like squats
yes<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.709> develops<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.189> entire<00:03:35.489> leg<00:03:35.699> but<00:03:35.909> it<00:03:36.030> is

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
yes it develops the entire leg but it is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.729 
yes it develops the entire leg but it is
still<00:03:36.389> helping<00:03:36.629> develop<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.290> mass<00:03:37.500> and

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
still helping develop the mass and

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.039 
still helping develop the mass and
strength<00:03:37.889> of<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.340> quad<00:03:38.609> as<00:03:38.790> well<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.659> you

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
strength of the quad as well but you

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.809 
strength of the quad as well but you
want<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.229> also<00:03:40.439> have<00:03:41.009> that<00:03:41.040> nice<00:03:41.340> detailed

want to also have that nice detailed
look<00:03:42.000> in<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.209> quad<00:03:42.419> so<00:03:42.810> you're<00:03:42.900> gonna<00:03:42.989> hit

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
look in the quad so you're gonna hit

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.780 
look in the quad so you're gonna hit
those<00:03:43.349> extensions<00:03:43.829> first<00:03:44.040> do<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.609> little

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
those extensions first do a little

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.399 
those extensions first do a little
pre-exhaustion<00:03:45.419> make<00:03:45.840> sure<00:03:45.959> they<00:03:46.109> get<00:03:46.259> the
