 a quarter cup of brandy and half a cup 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.860
 of peeled peanuts without salt and we're going to 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.040
 think prepare this this cold pay of 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.620
 peanut that is super simple what 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.710
 first thing we're going to do is and when the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.540
 filling and of course the base then 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.420
 for the base we are going to mix the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.050
 butter with the cookies that I have 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.110
 here already previously ground we go here to 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.770
 make that famous putty let's put 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.350
 that mass that we made of biscuit in this 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.540
 refractory mold nothing else covered with 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.720
 aluminum foil so that it is mold 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.630
 much easier 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 and we are going to see that it is moistened 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.070
 the whole cookie we are going to pour this 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.870
 mix here is already ready and we are going to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.870
 think a little with your hand 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.580
 clean ' that is more or less even 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.790
 all the background 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.260
 is ready and now if we are going to 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.940
 refrigerate so that it is refrigerated in the 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.670
 moment when it is refrigerated of course 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.560
 the butter at that time 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.000
 hardens and that makes at the time that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.310
 let's put the filling in the part of 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.860
 above the little groups of the cookie do not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 come off if they can not get to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.890
 detachment came to put is who 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.830
 I fixed it or is going to take out this one that I have 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.480
 here list there and refrigerated so that 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.490
 you can see that there is a lot more 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.260
 sign the filling because it is something very 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.600
 simple let's put the milk 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.590
 condensed in the blender 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.590
 to this list 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.790
 perfect let's now add the cream 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.770
 of sweetened peanut 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.610
 previously sweetened 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.420
 let's add the cream cheese that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.100
 we have here and all this is going to liquefy 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.700
 and finally the cream to beat 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.480
 this cream to beat we are going to liquefy 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.000
 All this 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.900
 to go doing the filling that's going to go 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.200
 about the cookie 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.790
 and let's now do the coverage of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.920
 chocolate for chocolate coverage 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.280
 it's also something super simple we have 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.069
 here the cream that we give here to put in 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.720
 a container we are going to also put the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.780
 coffee a little bit of coffee so that 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.730
 dissolve a little bit of liquor 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.770
 or brandy can be also let's 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.080
 start mixing all this to that 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.300
 integrates perfectly fine and will 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.010
 add chocolate now 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.319
 melted we have chocolate here 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.180
 previously cast so we're going 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.310
 adding what 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.750
 let's go here nothing else support talk there the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.170
 chocolate that we have here previously 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.590
 molten 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.480
 perfect can be bittersweet bitter the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.930
 that you like more 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.659

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.700
 perfectly well with the cream for 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.700
 beat the coffee 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.459
 the liquor or the brandy and practically 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.470
 our coverage is ready and now 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.569
 it's cold that it's important that it's 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.000
 cold not hot because remember that 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.910
 this is going to be frozen right now 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.580
 I 'm this peanut mix that sees more 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.220
 rich to have excellent consistency and 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.349
 you can see taste before you from 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.540
 that freeze taste test is 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.190
 spectacular 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.599
 let's go here to put it what can 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.459
 they know that this mixture also 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.220
 sandwich and you put it individual by 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.080
 example in individual cutters that 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.690
 it is also wonderful to put the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.549
 cookie after the cola refrigerates 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.019
 after putting a little bit of the mixture what 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.510
 they freeze again like the wache I 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.180
 right now and you can put it up a little 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.639
 more cookie or chocolate mix and 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.380
 make this dessert a dessert as a 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.180
 little more formal you can take that I 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.810
 I have frozen here 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.449
 let's put this is ready 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.500
 there it is and that little one that is not us 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.820
 go to fall perfect 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.810
 let's close the freezer 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.150
 I bring this here that you see is already 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.680
 frozen is already firm we are going to 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.990
 stay about 10 minutes before bringing 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.870
 the table just for that to be 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.210
 softens a little and I'm not so so so 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.370
 cold let's unmold what also 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:02.150
 aluminum foil is wonderful 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.010
 because it is very easy to remove it and it is 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.720
 much easier to overflow unmold 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.400
 our our parents 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.490
 desserts 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.699
 once we have removed the aluminum 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.740
 let's now cover with chocolate in 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.930
 the top part idea nothing else what 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.880
 thing so richer the combination of 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.090
 chocolate with the peanut is 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.220
 wonderful is already going to go 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.220
 extending so that it also falls to 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.170
 shores 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.200
 especially that is covered in the part of 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.690
 up with all the chocolate 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.370

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.750
 water the mouth with this dessert is a 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.060
 delight and excellent combination of 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.710
 chocolate with the peanut we are going to 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.610
 end of the cover to fall 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.620
 shores a little and of course this this 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.250
 we're going to take it to the refrigerator for 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.050
 that at the top hardens 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.900
 that the chocolate is firm so that 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.210
 get more crispy and with this we're going 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.980
 direct to interesting information 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.280
