00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.169
 caraquet - 20 h at the box richard gasquet could well explain 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.169
 eradicate all elements of his load 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.789
 yes and then because there are different 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.839
 two tanks this one was a little export class 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.390
 then take it can already be noticed that the wheels 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 these are different from one support to another oklahoma drop down holders 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.990
 that are narrow and to expectations 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 in relation to the body 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 the ethical charter 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.320
 when we have already signed 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.570
 a person too big for example 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.250
 the chassis is under the breakage 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.250
 there it allows more close to the ground and to remember is that his group 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.300
 other advanced a redemption 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.570
 a suspension system at the front 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.610
 which improves 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.719
 the driving 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.100
 he held a dormitory in 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.260
 on how to say of holding the euro before on the beach 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.310
 not sure about its members 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.230
 it's one of the most complete tanks 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.230
 so we do not allege the age of 4 as we find on them 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.650
 change the orientation of mans 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.250
 in terms of costs 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.370
 the cashier 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.750
 that lets you vary to the blue and white blue of tyrone downie costs relative to 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.500
 sailing 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.670
 the ch a on which one finds settings 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.030
 attention places 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 when he also aims to play above the king 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 tensions and so on the group 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.630
 The direction 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.630

 kite tank fire 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.010
 directly on the roissy airport 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.000
 why the foreground system 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 most of the tanks almost all charentes this system 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.059
 return from elsewhere 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.729
 without the brake it's true 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989
 Richard Hunt Sharks 1-4 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.450
 it will stop it just serves to stabilize and carmignac coal 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.709
 when we arrive 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.709
 hours after the arrivals at the bottom stabilizes 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.999
 that's basically not next 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.709
 maybe the starting point 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.709
 the night owls 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.150
 we are alive as on the echoes on the sails the cutting of the system 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.229
 of sail restraint so sometimes it goes forward without looking into 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.109
 back but good for this purpose 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.369
 about the same 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:04.369
 with material subjected to severe stress because of the sand 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.059
 paul fragility of the whole 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.349
 but apparently the bins 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.200
 16h 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.530
 she is naive with the three girls terra 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.380
 because that's how ben arfa fears to know that he specified the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.939
 group 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.209
 since the helmet is required 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.389
 take the team 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.129
 in estuaries a protection 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.449
 luc alphand 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:32.439
 if the champagne 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.629
 a helmet is mandatory one for the practice of sand yachting and then 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:36.080
 glasses 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.770
 protect projections of its value again one is today in 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.709
 driving conditions 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.109
 the beach is particularly wet 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.519
 it's not like that every day and then it's not like that on all 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.519
 beaches of France 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.229
 we will test with heroin 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.219
 In summary 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.439
 the essential rules 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.360
 so something that makes sense 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.360
 first thing is that when two tanks cross each other 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.509
 we catch up with another tank it's always the one who goes faster so whoever 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.249
 come 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.409
 who owes his cards and water 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.150
 when two tanks arrives the man in front of the other 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.139
 we always cross each other by moving to the right 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.120
 normally on the courses on the first monitor sessions gets organized 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.550
 always for more expensive do not intersect to prevent a situation 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.219
 difficult so normally none of these rules anymore really needed 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:10.319
 it's just enough 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.099
 to move in the same direction 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.360
 that which is indicated by the monitor so that we do not have 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.580
 chartrons upside down on the circuit 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.580
 that things are going very well 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.490
 then the security elements 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.759
 if we will say essential 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:22.800
 to make the chariot 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.020
 it may be equipped with closed shoes 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.469
 think that ben we can 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:30.469
 the palm tree can be a bit aggressive 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.610
 decorated in situations where the sand a bit wet or the lyrics 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.610
 projection advises people not to come 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:45.449
 just a week 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.520
 because to face to m 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.219
 while there is nothing special 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.960
 the monop 'it's the same fight 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.520
 the gybes 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.539
 eight rounds facing the English half-round 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.889
 you'll see things go well in both directions 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.059
 in fact the only manosquin uncomplicated to learn 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:04.979
 who quickly knew how to stop 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.650
 as you could notice the brake 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.289
 we do not stop there we could 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.520
 water that is a necessary maneuver this morning of sales 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 you have to plan a little distance there too 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:20.499
 the first sessions provide that all these elements 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:22.719
 and it's very easy 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:23.759
