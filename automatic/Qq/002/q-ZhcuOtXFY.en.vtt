we're<00:01:26.060> going<00:01:26.179> to<00:01:26.299> do<00:01:26.420> about<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:27.409> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
we're going to do about it that the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.410 
we're going to do about it that the
vehicle<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:28.100> still<00:01:29.049> is<00:01:30.049> still<00:01:30.770> fine<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:32.030> pad

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
vehicle is still is still fine and pad

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.690 
vehicle is still is still fine and pad
systems<00:01:32.929> are<00:01:33.170> still<00:01:33.470> fine<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.100> now<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.429> is<00:01:34.549> just

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
systems are still fine so now it is just

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.090 
systems are still fine so now it is just
going<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.030> take<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:36.319> little<00:01:36.679> bit<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:36.950> time

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
going to take the a little bit of time

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.069 
going to take the a little bit of time
for<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.340> launch<00:01:37.520> crew<00:01:37.819> to<00:01:38.060> look<00:01:38.270> at<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.810> data

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
for the launch crew to look at the data

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.160 
for the launch crew to look at the data
and<00:01:39.409> decide<00:01:39.950> what<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.729> do<00:01:40.909> with<00:01:41.179> may<00:01:41.720> be<00:01:41.780> able

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
and decide what to do with may be able

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.770 
and decide what to do with may be able
to<00:01:42.259> do<00:01:42.409> another<00:01:42.560> launch<00:01:42.890> attempt<00:01:43.539> shortly<00:01:44.539> I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
to do another launch attempt shortly I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.830 
to do another launch attempt shortly I
would<00:01:45.649> remind<00:01:46.580> people<00:01:47.000> who<00:01:47.090> have<00:01:47.209> seen<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:47.720> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
would remind people who have seen so the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.539 
would remind people who have seen so the
second<00:01:48.140> launch<00:01:48.259> without<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.860> one<00:01:49.069> that<00:01:49.340> this

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
second launch without the one that this

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.490 
second launch without the one that this
happened<00:01:50.030> on<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.299> occasion<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.229> with<00:01:51.349> the

happened on that occasion to in with the

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.550 
happened on that occasion to in with the
engine<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.009> we<00:01:52.310> aborted<00:01:52.819> at<00:01:53.659> t<00:01:53.929> minus<00:01:54.080> half<00:01:54.439> a

launched<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.039> vehicle<00:01:58.369> successfully<00:01:58.970> so

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
launched the vehicle successfully so
