creating<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.870> walk-in<00:00:01.199> animation<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.250> one<00:00:02.550> of

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
creating a walk-in animation is one of

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.539 
creating a walk-in animation is one of
the<00:00:02.700> most<00:00:02.879> basic<00:00:03.210> exercises<00:00:04.220> it's<00:00:05.220> also<00:00:05.310> one

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
the most basic exercises it's also one

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.600 
the most basic exercises it's also one
of<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.700> most<00:00:05.850> difficult<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.839> get<00:00:07.319> there<00:00:07.610> if

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
of the most difficult to get there if

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.520 
of the most difficult to get there if
once<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.910> master<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> walk<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.260> do

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
once you master a walk you can do

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.410 
once you master a walk you can do
probably<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.099> about<00:00:11.190> anything<00:00:11.550> when

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
probably just about anything when

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.940 
probably just about anything when
someone<00:00:12.690> walks<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.290> almost<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.620> series<00:00:13.920> of

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
someone walks it's almost a series of

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.560 
someone walks it's almost a series of
Falls<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.490> lean<00:00:14.670> forward<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:15.059> little<00:00:15.150> bit<00:00:15.299> and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
Falls you lean forward a little bit and

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.540 
Falls you lean forward a little bit and
each<00:00:15.929> step<00:00:16.230> kind<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.560> catches<00:00:16.949> yourself<00:00:17.310> from

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
each step kind of catches yourself from

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.550 
each step kind of catches yourself from
from<00:00:18.090> falling<00:00:18.420> over<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.869> if<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.350> have<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
from falling over so if you have a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:31.060 
from falling over so if you have a
character<00:00:21.380> who's<00:00:22.380> walking<00:00:24.140> one<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> first

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.340 

poses<00:00:32.070> he's<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> hit<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:34.290> of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
poses he's going to hit is the one of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.510 
poses he's going to hit is the one of
the<00:00:34.410> first<00:00:34.590> poses<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.010> want<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.219> draw<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:36.170> the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
the first poses you want to draw is the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.430 
the first poses you want to draw is the
destroyed<00:00:38.520> that's<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> legs<00:00:39.930> are<00:00:40.200> at

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
destroyed that's when the legs are at

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.150 
destroyed that's when the legs are at
their<00:00:40.800> their<00:00:41.129> farthest<00:00:41.579> apart<00:00:42.110> okay<00:00:43.160> let's

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
other arm is coming forward and I can go

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.140 
other arm is coming forward and I can go
back<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.220> forth<00:01:38.640> between<00:01:38.759> those<00:01:39.090> two

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
back and forth between those two

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.490 
back and forth between those two
drawings<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.110> he's<00:01:40.290> starting

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
drawings and you can see he's starting

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.730 
drawings and you can see he's starting
the<00:01:40.680> step<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.380> then<00:01:43.380> there's<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the step I think and then there's the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.679 
the step I think and then there's the
push<00:01:43.950> off<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:46.020> foot<00:01:47.689> is

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
push off and this is a right foot is

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.889 
push off and this is a right foot is
starting<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.200> push<00:01:49.380> off<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> little<00:01:49.829> bit<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
starting to push off a little bit and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:59.050 
starting to push off a little bit and
his<00:01:51.899> left<00:01:52.229> leg<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:53.119> swinging<00:01:54.119> forward

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:08.120 

and<00:02:00.060> his<00:02:05.689> arm<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.960> coming<00:02:07.229> back<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.979> his

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
and his arm is coming back there and his

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.809 
and his arm is coming back there and his
other<00:02:08.280> arm<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:09.200> swinging<00:02:10.200> forward<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:13.819> and

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
other arm is swinging forward that and

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.500 
other arm is swinging forward that and
again<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.540> say<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:17.970> see<00:02:18.150> him<00:02:18.239> step

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
again I can say you can see him step

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.010 
again I can say you can see him step
forward<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.260> huh<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:21.300> that's<00:02:21.810> just

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
forward like that huh and that's just

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.570 
forward like that huh and that's just
half<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.230> steps<00:02:22.709> now<00:02:22.950> when<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.190> want<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.370> do

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
half the steps now when you want to do

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.259 
half the steps now when you want to do
the<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.060> next<00:02:24.360> part<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:26.030> you're<00:02:27.030> basically

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
the the next part of it you're basically

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.110 
the the next part of it you're basically
going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:28.250> tracing<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.489> your<00:02:29.880> first

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
going to be tracing the your first

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.280 
going to be tracing the your first
drawings<00:02:31.610> only<00:02:32.610> reversing<00:02:33.300> all<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.569> arms<00:02:33.840> all

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
drawings only reversing all the arms all

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.729 
drawings only reversing all the arms all
the<00:02:34.319> other<00:02:34.980> limbs<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.989> if<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.170> stack<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
the other limbs so if you stack the

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.420 
the other limbs so if you stack the
first<00:02:40.980> drawing<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.549> then<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.360> next<00:02:42.390> one

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
first drawing and then the the next one

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.640 
first drawing and then the the next one
and<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.700> first<00:02:44.910> drawing<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.200> one<00:02:46.410> they

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
and the first drawing and this one they

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.070 
and the first drawing and this one they
should<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:47.010> almost<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.400> same<00:02:47.430> silhouette<00:02:51.080> but

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
should be almost the same silhouette but

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.320 
should be almost the same silhouette but
just<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.500> arms<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.069> legs<00:02:53.280> are<00:02:53.510> are<00:02:54.510> reversed

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
just the arms and legs are are reversed

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.500 
just the arms and legs are are reversed
see<00:02:58.549> see<00:02:59.549> he's<00:02:59.670> starting<00:02:59.819> to<00:03:00.030> walk<00:03:00.180> there

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:19.080 

again<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.930> recoil<00:03:04.470> here<00:03:05.900> or<00:03:06.900> this

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.300 

and<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.600> push<00:03:20.870> off<00:03:21.080> of<00:03:21.380> his<00:03:21.710> left<00:03:22.070> leg

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
and this is the push off of his left leg

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.140 
and this is the push off of his left leg
his<00:03:23.120> his<00:03:23.420> right<00:03:23.720> legs<00:03:23.990> coming<00:03:24.260> forward<00:03:28.150> and

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
his his right legs coming forward and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.730 
his his right legs coming forward and
his<00:03:29.480> arms<00:03:29.900> here<00:03:30.550> heads<00:03:31.550> up<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:31.910> top<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.020> now

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.040 

this<00:03:36.740> is<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.950> very<00:03:37.220> quick<00:03:38.030> very<00:03:38.270> rough<00:03:38.780> version

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
this is a very quick very rough version

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.590 
this is a very quick very rough version
of<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.380> walk
