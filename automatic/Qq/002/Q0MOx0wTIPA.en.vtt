00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
view holes and the cool thing is is that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.510 
view holes and the cool thing is is that
this<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> also<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.780> power<00:02:04.079> unit<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.770> well<00:02:05.399> as

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
this is also a power unit as well as

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.919 
this is also a power unit as well as
this<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.880> there's<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.179> motor<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.719> one

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
this one so there's a motor in this one

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.230 
this one so there's a motor in this one
and<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.140> motor<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.679> one<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.090> thought

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
and the motor in this one and I thought

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.520 
and the motor in this one and I thought
that<00:02:09.420> was<00:02:09.539> cool<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:09.929> now<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.289> gets<00:02:10.350> more

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that was cool because now it gets more

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.420 
that was cool because now it gets more
pulling<00:02:10.830> power<00:02:11.510> moving<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:13.220> we<00:02:14.220> have
