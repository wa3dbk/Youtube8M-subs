00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:05.380
 Welcome back to David Buck and the JEM member of the holiday buying season 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.139
 With hot keys dot com Amazon for any purchases first go in style today 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.959
 Dot com Click on the best black on the right side of the page and use that up 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.590
 I will send the seven percent that I bought for the show 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.519
 Instead of Amazon's great stuff for a nice time 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.899
 You can also become a member of the David Packard show which is partly possible through 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:24.769
 Liberal bias dot com 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.730
 While the facts are not consistent with Fox News it's tough to see which one is right 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.160
 Because they can not start by calling the books they are doing but in part 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.009
 Always a good step 

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.079
 But you can learn more liberal bias dot com to get more answers there today 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.610
 New member of the day is Jason Shirley 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.860
 It's great to have Jason certainly 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.800
 As David Bacard show and member oh ... We welcome him and look forward to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 His membership continued from everyone 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.100
 I am sure that uh ... he is looking forward to a bone mission 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.170
 at all 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.410
 No doubt about it 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.910
 I got a spam voice mail 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.930
 If he says he is sixteen years old, he is from Kansas City 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.270
 I put this on display because I do not have a way to get hold of a tag to 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.890
 Follow these 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.140
 Again we have not been able to devote any event but it is disturbing 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.230
 Voice mail about what is going on 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.200
 Tagged with a marker on the plate for you and the tag if you are listening 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.870
 What's cool is this 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.630
 Who is the teacher the reason we need more information "I think we need to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.260
 Consider taking this listening 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.350
 Markham doubt 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.760
 From Kansas City and our special call because of uh ... a fact 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.890
 Happened at my school today with a professor we were discussing a book 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.160
 Finnish Mulberry by Mark Twain 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.890
 The ... 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.000
 The main personal end in not being a slave can 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.840
 Oh ... It's a comparison because uh ... uh ... 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.210
 Abortion says that 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.360
 And what was already not necessarily with the moral right to say 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.150
 He said that what the community in that time period to please him write to us 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.230
 Turn this wave when uh ... what is morally right tomorrow 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.570
 Oh ... Dan Ministry of Agriculture 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.250
 What society has the right to conduct an immoral abortion right I would like to 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.769
 That uh ... 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.509
 Get your thoughts on this uh ... 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.949
 The lift was fine until we got to know more about this clearly 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.529
 It is complete if not I have no reason to believe that this 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:23.449
 Not necessarily illegal in the city of Kansas City not but we know it is cool 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.280
 Too immoral to pay the teacher to be 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.590
 He added that ethics rules when it comes to abortion on students 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.440
 Especially calcheng it is a simple comparison to a bit of berry 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.440
 Vin uses spam and we know it is being hopefully marked 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.880
 It can actually have a service uh ... in Informa content and a certain situation 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.620
 Obviously this is not the goal to discuss in any way the teacher 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.239
 You see there is a reason 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.749
 Replacing RENAULT with its paying room 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.139
 Ethics on students 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.469
 Hopefully the time we can get more information about the market look at this 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.599
 Further this certainly means this 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.479
 Nothing should happen 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.619
 It now seems like Mark Twain probably did not have to research that 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.819
 I realize the mind when writing a book I would certainly appreciate it 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.290
 Interestingly the army what happened is the opposite is Anne-Mark Twain 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.609
 Long time ago 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.699
 Yes the society changed to write that it might be immoral to do it then that 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.339
 While the truth is good but now this is the opposite of a long time ago 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.979
 Abortion of course in all areas was considered moral at the moment people 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.369
 Change their minds here so they do not even have a really good analogy even if 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.610
 Even if you put aside the fact that this 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.629
 Beliefs are pushed here 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.579
 It's not so good measurement 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.779
 Which really brings concerns about how safe this teacher is oh ... there 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.079
 A number of issues here uh ... 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.389
 But we need we need more information sure that this is a big sign please email me 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.699
 Especially if you can now go to our David packing website above dot com on
