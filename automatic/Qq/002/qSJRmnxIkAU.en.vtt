00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
surprise Thomas and look at this it very

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.789

beautifully<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.970> fits<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.500> what

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
beautifully it fits here but what

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.260 
beautifully it fits here but what
happens<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.880> money<00:01:09.590> look<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:13.260> falls<00:01:13.560> off

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
happens you know money look it falls off

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
happens you know money look it falls off
the<00:01:15.270> reason<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.750> because<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.350> doesn't

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the reason is that because it doesn't

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.660 
the reason is that because it doesn't
have<00:01:16.680> anything<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:18.770> block<00:01:19.770> Thomas<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
have anything to block Thomas so it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.429 
have anything to block Thomas so it
doesn't<00:01:20.909> fall<00:01:21.060> off<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.320> do

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
I'm going to make something here with

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.020 
I'm going to make something here with
play-doh<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:27.840> fall<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.560> easy
