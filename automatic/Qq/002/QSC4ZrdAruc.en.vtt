sprinting so you want to take note of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520 
sprinting so you want to take note of
that<00:00:35.700> while<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.480> running<00:00:36.719> around<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that while you are running around and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you can also deploy the shield as you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.850 
you can also deploy the shield as you
can<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.870> complete<00:00:40.350> cover<00:00:40.649> with

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
can see here you get complete cover with

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.830 
can see here you get complete cover with
it<00:00:41.010> while<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.700> crouched<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.629> then

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
it while you are crouched and then

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
it while you are crouched and then
obviously<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.710> standing<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.309> at

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
obviously when you are standing up at

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
obviously when you are standing up at
the<00:00:44.670> top<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.120> head<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.079> shot<00:00:46.379> but

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the top of your head can be shot but

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
the top of your head can be shot but
that's<00:00:46.800> actually<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> bad<00:00:47.820> way<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> play<00:00:48.390> at

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that's actually not a bad way to play at

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
that's actually not a bad way to play at
all<00:00:48.719> you'll<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.020> some<00:00:49.379> clips<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.739> where<00:00:50.280> I

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
all you'll see some clips here where I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.580 
all you'll see some clips here where I
actually<00:00:50.430> use<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.180> tactic<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:52.020> now

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
actually use that tactic as well now

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110 
actually use that tactic as well now
it's<00:00:52.710> worth<00:00:52.829> noting<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.399> while<00:00:53.610> using<00:00:54.030> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it's worth noting that while using this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
it's worth noting that while using this
weapon<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:55.020> break<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.800> hand

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
weapon it will not break in your hand

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
weapon it will not break in your hand
you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.520> take<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> dip<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.539> hand

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
you can take a dip with it in your hand

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
you can take a dip with it in your hand
from<00:00:58.260> someone<00:00:58.649> sticking<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.160> with<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.520> semtex

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
from someone sticking it with a semtex

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
from someone sticking it with a semtex
or<00:01:00.449> obviously<00:01:00.809> sticking<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.410> crossbow

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
or obviously sticking it with a crossbow

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
or obviously sticking it with a crossbow
but<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.850> can't<00:01:03.120> stick<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.570> force<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
but they can't stick see force to it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
but they can't stick see force to it
although<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> c4<00:01:05.040> will<00:01:05.369> probably<00:01:05.790> kill<00:01:06.060> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
although a c4 will probably kill you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
although a c4 will probably kill you
just<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> blast<00:01:07.770> radius<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
just because of the blast radius of the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.670 
just because of the blast radius of the
c4<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.299> basically<00:01:09.630> they<00:01:09.689> can't<00:01:09.990> shoot<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
c4 but basically they can't shoot it and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
c4 but basically they can't shoot it and
break<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.549> actual<00:01:11.790> thing<00:01:11.970> itself<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.420> can

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
break the actual thing itself they can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.140 
break the actual thing itself they can
shoot<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.020> from<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> side<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.650> maybe<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
shoot you from the side or maybe get you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
shoot you from the side or maybe get you
at<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.420> nice<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.840> angle<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.530> no<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:16.950> can

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
at a nice little angle but no one can

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
at a nice little angle but no one can
shoot<00:01:17.310> through<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.360> won't<00:01:18.570> break<00:01:18.900> now

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
shoot through it and it won't break now

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.719 
shoot through it and it won't break now
you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.500> deploy<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.950> shoot<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.580> see

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
you can deploy the shoot as you can see

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.520 
you can deploy the shoot as you can see
I'm<00:01:20.970> doing<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> I'll<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.320> few

however from explosive rounds that
includes<00:01:31.439> c4<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.090> broken<00:01:33.299> by

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
includes c4 and it can be broken by

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
includes c4 and it can be broken by
using<00:01:34.259> melee<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.280> many<00:01:35.430> people

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
using melee on it but not many people

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
using melee on it but not many people
are<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> come<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.390> melee<00:01:36.780> your

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
are going to come up and melee your

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.270 
are going to come up and melee your
shield<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.350> you're<00:01:37.470> near<00:01:37.680> excel<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.130> you're

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
shield if you're near excel so you're

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.499 
shield if you're near excel so you're
probably<00:01:38.520> gonna<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.880> able<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> shot<00:01:39.479> on

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
probably gonna be able to get a shot on

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
probably gonna be able to get a shot on
them<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.930> you're<00:01:40.110> using<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.590> secondary<00:01:41.369> weapon

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
them if you're using a secondary weapon

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
them if you're using a secondary weapon
so<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.509> me<00:01:42.630> getting<00:01:42.810> an

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
so here you can see me getting an

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.569 
so here you can see me getting an
objective<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.100> always<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
objective of it and this is always a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.160 
objective of it and this is always a
good<00:01:45.000> idea<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.479> probably<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:45.930> it's

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
good idea and probably the way it's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.410 
good idea and probably the way it's
meant<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.530> used<00:01:46.880> now<00:01:47.880> when<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> deploy

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
meant to be used now when you deploy

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.480 
meant to be used now when you deploy
this<00:01:48.659> weapon<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.290> enemy<00:01:49.649> can't<00:01:49.979> run<00:01:50.250> through

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
this weapon the enemy can't run through

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490 
this weapon the enemy can't run through
it<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.689> they'd<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:51.990> good<00:01:52.259> for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it so do you think they'd be good for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
it so do you think they'd be good for
blocking<00:01:52.950> off<00:01:53.070> doorways<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.700> objective<00:01:54.149> game

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
blocking off doorways in objective game

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.149 
blocking off doorways in objective game
modes<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:55.049> they're<00:01:55.200> programmed<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.890> such<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
modes but they're programmed in such a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.459 
modes but they're programmed in such a
way<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> can't<00:01:57.030> deploy<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.229> place

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
way that you can't deploy in a place

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
way that you can't deploy in a place
where<00:01:58.799> there's<00:01:59.549> not<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> be<00:01:59.969> enough

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
where there's not going to be enough

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.639 
where there's not going to be enough
space<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.570> someone<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.170> run<00:02:01.320> through<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
space for someone to run through the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.289 
space for someone to run through the
vents<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.250> quite<00:02:02.490> well<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.969> manage<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
vents to do that quite well to manage to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
vents to do that quite well to manage to
avoid<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.780> being<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> little<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.590> overpowered

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
avoid it being a little bit overpowered

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.620 
avoid it being a little bit overpowered
imagine<00:02:05.579> hardpoint<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.149> something<00:02:06.450> you'd<00:02:06.540> be

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
imagine hardpoint or something you'd be

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.850 
imagine hardpoint or something you'd be
a<00:02:06.659> bit<00:02:06.810> ridiculous<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.409> everyone<00:02:07.649> had

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
a bit ridiculous for everyone had

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.160 
a bit ridiculous for everyone had
assault<00:02:08.759> shields<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.239> they<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.479> closed<00:02:09.959> off

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
assault shields and they just closed off

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.720 
assault shields and they just closed off
all<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> exits<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:11.400> only<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
all of the exits and not only that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.280 
all of the exits and not only that
obviously<00:02:12.060> they<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.660> destroy<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.140> with

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
obviously they can destroy it with

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.850 
obviously they can destroy it with
explode

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
explode

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.130 
explode
as<00:02:14.070> well<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.360> sounds<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.750> that's<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.050> good

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
as well so it sounds like that's a good

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.320 
as well so it sounds like that's a good
idea<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.310> practically<00:02:17.850> something

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
idea but it's not practically something

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.210 
idea but it's not practically something
you<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.290> let's<00:02:19.410> go<00:02:19.620> through<00:02:19.860> some<00:02:19.890> of

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
you can do so let's go through some of

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.590 
you can do so let's go through some of
the<00:02:20.340> statistics<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.000> I've<00:02:21.150> got<00:02:21.360> ramp

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
the statistics that I've got ramp

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.780 
the statistics that I've got ramp
outside<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.710> screen<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.730> to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
outside of the screen here it is a to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.940 
outside of the screen here it is a to
bash<00:02:24.270> kill<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:25.140> think<00:02:25.350> it's<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.710> this

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
bash kill and I think it's like this

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.260 
bash kill and I think it's like this
because<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.460> really<00:02:26.820> meant<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.240> a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
because it's not really meant to be a

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.520 
because it's not really meant to be a
weapon<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.810> meant<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.050> try<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.320> kill

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
weapon that you meant to try and kill

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.170 
weapon that you meant to try and kill
people<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.430> meant<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> bit<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
people with you meant to be a bit of a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.000 
people with you meant to be a bit of a
distraction<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> enemies<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.500> help<00:02:31.830> your

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
distraction for the enemies to help your

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.790 
distraction for the enemies to help your
team<00:02:32.280> get<00:02:32.790> objectives<00:02:33.480> or<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:34.050> be<00:02:34.200> defensive

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
team get objectives or just be defensive

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.500 
team get objectives or just be defensive
with<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.070> it's<00:02:35.220> not<00:02:35.250> meant<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.670> actually<00:02:35.850> get

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
with it it's not meant to actually get

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.910 
with it it's not meant to actually get
killed<00:02:36.810> otherwise<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.350> think<00:02:37.560> they<00:02:37.650> would<00:02:37.800> have

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
killed otherwise I think they would have

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.040 
killed otherwise I think they would have
made<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.490> bash<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.060> people<00:02:39.480> would<00:02:39.570> say

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
made it a one bash but people would say

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.090 
made it a one bash but people would say
maybe<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.470> would<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.710> little<00:02:41.010> bit

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
maybe that would be a little bit

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.800 
maybe that would be a little bit
overpowered<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.000> don't<00:02:42.180> know<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.270> think<00:02:42.450> one

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
overpowered but I don't know I think one

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.300 
overpowered but I don't know I think one
batch<00:02:43.020> would<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.440> fair<00:02:43.710> but<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:43.980> think<00:02:44.190> they've

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
batch would be fair but I think they've

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.830 
batch would be fair but I think they've
more<00:02:44.490> done<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.240> they<00:02:45.330> don't<00:02:45.480> want<00:02:45.600> you

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
more done it because they don't want you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.110 
more done it because they don't want you
to<00:02:45.960> be<00:02:46.080> aggressive<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:47.010> thing<00:02:47.250> now<00:02:48.000> it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
to be aggressive with this thing now it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.270 
to be aggressive with this thing now it
has<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> very<00:02:48.660> slow<00:02:48.930> switch<00:02:49.320> between<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.950> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
has a very slow switch between this and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680 
has a very slow switch between this and
a<00:02:50.430> secondary<00:02:50.880> weapons<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.390> say<00:02:51.540> you're

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
a secondary weapons to say you're

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.150 
a secondary weapons to say you're
running<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.990> pistol<00:02:52.410> or<00:02:52.709> you're<00:02:52.980> using

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
running a pistol or you're using

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.250 
running a pistol or you're using
overkill<00:02:53.880> which<00:02:54.030> means<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.810> primary

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
overkill which means you have a primary

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.230 
overkill which means you have a primary
and<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.830> assault<00:02:56.160> shield<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.940> case<00:02:57.120> you

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
and the assault shield in case you

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.580 
and the assault shield in case you
didn't<00:02:57.450> know<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.690> assault<00:02:57.959> shield<00:02:57.990> counts<00:02:58.470> as

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
didn't know the assault shield counts as

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.680 
didn't know the assault shield counts as
a<00:02:58.650> primary<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.550> without<00:02:59.820> using<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> wild<00:03:00.450> card

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
a primary so without using a wild card

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.020 
a primary so without using a wild card
you<00:03:01.080> can't<00:03:01.350> use<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.040> say<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> submachine

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
you can't use this and say a submachine

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.340 
you can't use this and say a submachine
gun<00:03:03.209> or<00:03:03.360> something<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.900> you'd<00:03:04.050> have<00:03:04.080> to

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
gun or something like that you'd have to

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.650 
gun or something like that you'd have to
use<00:03:04.470> overkill<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.580> get<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.910> effect<00:03:06.270> but<00:03:06.480> to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
use overkill to get that effect but to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.780 
use overkill to get that effect but to
be<00:03:06.780> honest<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.410> pistols<00:03:07.890> are<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.280> strong<00:03:08.640> in

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
be honest the pistols are so strong in

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.190 
be honest the pistols are so strong in
this<00:03:08.880> game<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.450> doesn't<00:03:09.840> really<00:03:09.959> matter

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
this game that it doesn't really matter

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.560 
this game that it doesn't really matter
you'll<00:03:10.950> see<00:03:11.160> what<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.340> suggest<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.150> my<00:03:12.180> create

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
you'll see what I suggest in my create

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.050 
you'll see what I suggest in my create
class<00:03:12.810> setups<00:03:13.200> at<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.470> end<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.890> video<00:03:14.130> but

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
class setups at the end of the video but

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.210 
class setups at the end of the video but
any<00:03:15.270> pistol<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.959> obviously<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> good<00:03:16.680> idea<00:03:17.070> for

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
any pistol is obviously a good idea for

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.560 
any pistol is obviously a good idea for
this<00:03:17.340> but<00:03:17.520> because<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:17.970> slow<00:03:18.269> switch

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
this but because of this slow switch

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.630 
this but because of this slow switch
you're<00:03:19.050> gonna<00:03:19.230> need<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.620> use<00:03:19.680> fast<00:03:20.100> hands<00:03:20.430> but

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
you're gonna need to use fast hands but

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.600 
you're gonna need to use fast hands but
fast<00:03:20.940> hands<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.450> absolutely<00:03:22.320> made<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
fast hands is absolutely made for the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.890 
fast hands is absolutely made for the
assault<00:03:23.940> shield<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.360> not<00:03:24.600> only<00:03:24.630> do<00:03:24.840> you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
assault shield because not only do you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.540 
assault shield because not only do you
get<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.170> benefit<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:26.070> quick<00:03:26.280> switch

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
get the benefit of a quick switch

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.520 
get the benefit of a quick switch
between<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.390> another<00:03:27.570> weapon<00:03:28.080> but<00:03:28.410> you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
between this and another weapon but you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.320 
between this and another weapon but you
get<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> benefit<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.220> whatever<00:03:29.519> equipment<00:03:30.030> or

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
get the benefit of whatever equipment or

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.150 
get the benefit of whatever equipment or
tactical<00:03:30.810> equipment<00:03:31.110> you're<00:03:31.200> using<00:03:31.440> be<00:03:31.950> able

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
tactical equipment you're using be able

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.880 
tactical equipment you're using be able
to<00:03:32.280> thrown<00:03:32.580> out<00:03:32.850> really<00:03:33.390> fast<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.080> c4<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.830> a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
to thrown out really fast so a c4 is a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.500 
to thrown out really fast so a c4 is a
great<00:03:35.070> one<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.340> use<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:35.640> this<00:03:35.820> if<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.360> need

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
great one to use with this if you need

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.120 
great one to use with this if you need
to<00:03:36.600> get<00:03:36.690> some<00:03:36.900> tomahawk<00:03:37.350> kills<00:03:37.709> using<00:03:38.040> an

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
to get some tomahawk kills using an

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.160 
to get some tomahawk kills using an
assault<00:03:38.459> shield<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.209> great<00:03:39.510> idea<00:03:39.690> and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
assault shield is a great idea and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.900 
assault shield is a great idea and
obviously<00:03:40.680> you're<00:03:40.920> using<00:03:41.100> your<00:03:41.310> concussions

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
obviously you're using your concussions

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.000 
obviously you're using your concussions
or<00:03:42.060> assists<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:43.080> can<00:03:43.230> throw<00:03:43.380> them<00:03:43.530> out<00:03:43.680> really

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
or assists you can throw them out really

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.470 
or assists you can throw them out really
quickly<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.580> even<00:03:44.820> if<00:03:44.910> you're<00:03:45.030> just<00:03:45.060> trying<00:03:45.450> to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
quickly so even if you're just trying to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.729 
quickly so even if you're just trying to
get<00:03:45.570> kills<00:03:45.870> with<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.110> thing<00:03:46.350> trying<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> get

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
get kills with this thing trying to get

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.070 
get kills with this thing trying to get
shield<00:03:47.070> bashes<00:03:47.430> with<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.760> using<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.540> tactical

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
shield bashes with it using a tactical

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.540 
shield bashes with it using a tactical
couple<00:03:49.350> of<00:03:49.410> tactical<00:03:49.830> grenades<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.310> gonna

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
couple of tactical grenades is gonna

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.160 
couple of tactical grenades is gonna
leave<00:03:50.760> them<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.060> little<00:03:51.540> bit<00:03:51.660> dazed<00:03:51.930> and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
leave them a little bit dazed and

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.910 
leave them a little bit dazed and
confused

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
confused

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.040 
confused
so<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:53.820> these<00:03:53.970> clips<00:03:54.180> you'll<00:03:54.360> see<00:03:54.540> me<00:03:54.660> using<00:03:54.900> a

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
so in these clips you'll see me using a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.020 
so in these clips you'll see me using a
few<00:03:55.320> different<00:03:55.620> techniques<00:03:55.790> here<00:03:56.790> I'm<00:03:56.910> just

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
few different techniques here I'm just

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.640 
few different techniques here I'm just
using<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.390> technique<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.900> deploying<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.560> as

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
using the technique is deploying it as

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.860 
using the technique is deploying it as
cover<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.280> then<00:03:59.670> just<00:03:59.940> defending<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.720> a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
cover and then just defending this a

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.960 
cover and then just defending this a
checkpoint<00:04:01.350> as<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.739> can<00:04:01.890> see<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.280> works<00:04:02.730> quite

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
checkpoint as you can see it works quite

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.759 
checkpoint as you can see it works quite
well<00:04:03.090> if<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.050> can<00:04:04.200> get<00:04:04.350> into<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.560> position

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
well if you can get into a position

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.350 
well if you can get into a position
where<00:04:05.070> people<00:04:05.370> aren't<00:04:05.700> going<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:05.940> be<00:04:06.090> able<00:04:06.269> to

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
where people aren't going to be able to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.390 
where people aren't going to be able to
shoot<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.630> in<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.750> side<00:04:07.019> too<00:04:07.560> easily<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:08.160> can

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
shoot you in the side too easily you can

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.850 
shoot you in the side too easily you can
get<00:04:08.610> some<00:04:08.820> really<00:04:09.060> decent<00:04:09.450> results<00:04:09.900> doing

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
get some really decent results doing

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.410 
get some really decent results doing
this<00:04:11.100> but<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.519> know<00:04:11.670> it's<00:04:11.910> not<00:04:12.090> really<00:04:12.360> an

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
this but you know it's not really an

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.780 
this but you know it's not really an
assault<00:04:12.720> shield<00:04:12.989> kind<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.500> play<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.580> more

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
assault shield kind of play this is more

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.330 
assault shield kind of play this is more
an<00:04:15.000> LMG<00:04:15.780> setup<00:04:16.290> rather<00:04:16.620> than<00:04:16.830> an<00:04:17.010> assault

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
an LMG setup rather than an assault

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.550 
an LMG setup rather than an assault
shield<00:04:17.549> setup<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.390> is<00:04:18.540> good<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:19.470> a

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
shield setup so this is good for a

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.469 
shield setup so this is good for a
general<00:04:19.919> LMG<00:04:20.340> setup<00:04:20.640> although<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:20.910> could<00:04:21.239> use

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
general LMG setup although you could use

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.000 
general LMG setup although you could use
another<00:04:21.660> weapon<00:04:22.049> but<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.410> best<00:04:22.590> ones<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.890> use

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
another weapon but the best ones to use

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.130 
another weapon but the best ones to use
while<00:04:23.640> doing<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.060> are<00:04:24.300> probably<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.720> LMGs

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
while doing this are probably the LMGs

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.350 
while doing this are probably the LMGs
in<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.590> smaller<00:04:25.890> map<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.430> people<00:04:27.150> can't

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
in the smaller map so that people can't

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.770 
in the smaller map so that people can't
get<00:04:27.479> in

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
get in

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.210 
get in
around<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.440> some<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> bigger<00:04:28.950> maps

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
around you in some of the bigger maps

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.590 
around you in some of the bigger maps
it's<00:04:29.400> gonna<00:04:29.490> be<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.639> lot<00:04:29.820> easier<00:04:29.850> for<00:04:30.150> people<00:04:30.360> to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
it's gonna be a lot easier for people to

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.510 
it's gonna be a lot easier for people to
get<00:04:30.720> around<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.020> side<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:31.889> that's<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
get around the side of you so that's the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.010 
get around the side of you so that's the
only<00:04:32.670> reason<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.180> was<00:04:33.389> so<00:04:33.570> effective

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
only reason that I was so effective

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.100 
only reason that I was so effective
there<00:04:34.680> now<00:04:35.550> here<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.910> can<00:04:36.030> see<00:04:36.240> me<00:04:36.389> using

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
there now here you can see me using

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.570 
there now here you can see me using
Seaforth<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.040> it's<00:04:38.190> very<00:04:38.370> good<00:04:38.520> for

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
Seaforth of it it's very good for

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.490 
Seaforth of it it's very good for
getting<00:04:38.730> see<00:04:39.090> for<00:04:39.389> kills<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.810> only<00:04:40.020> problem

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
getting see for kills the only problem

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.740 
getting see for kills the only problem
is<00:04:40.650> with<00:04:41.010> getting<00:04:41.190> c4<00:04:41.760> kills<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.630> if

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
is with getting c4 kills is that if

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.840 
is with getting c4 kills is that if
you're<00:04:42.900> using<00:04:42.930> fast<00:04:43.500> hands<00:04:44.100> there's<00:04:44.669> no

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
you're using fast hands there's no

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.280 
you're using fast hands there's no
scavenger<00:04:45.389> perk<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:45.780> you're<00:04:45.900> not<00:04:46.020> gonna<00:04:46.139> be

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
scavenger perk so you're not gonna be

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.320 
scavenger perk so you're not gonna be
able<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.530> get<00:04:46.680> more<00:04:46.950> C<00:04:47.190> fours<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.700> if<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.090> kill

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
able to get more C fours and if you kill

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.480 
able to get more C fours and if you kill
people<00:04:48.480> with<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.960> c4<00:04:49.410> they<00:04:49.830> don't<00:04:50.070> actually

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
people with the c4 they don't actually

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.850 
people with the c4 they don't actually
drop<00:04:50.700> a<00:04:50.730> scavenger<00:04:51.270> packs<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:51.810> c4<00:04:52.410> teas<00:04:52.590> good

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
drop a scavenger packs so c4 teas good

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.950 
drop a scavenger packs so c4 teas good
but<00:04:53.639> it's<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.820> little<00:04:53.850> bit<00:04:54.150> limited<00:04:54.540> whereas<00:04:54.840> if

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
but it's a little bit limited whereas if

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.450 
but it's a little bit limited whereas if
you<00:04:55.050> go<00:04:55.200> with<00:04:55.350> tomahawks<00:04:55.889> although<00:04:56.250> it's<00:04:56.400> a

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
you go with tomahawks although it's a

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.280 
you go with tomahawks although it's a
little<00:04:56.580> bit<00:04:56.700> trickier<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.240> use<00:04:57.480> if<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:58.020> kill

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
little bit trickier to use if you kill

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.780 
little bit trickier to use if you kill
someone<00:04:58.590> with<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.770> tomahawk<00:04:59.160> they<00:04:59.370> will<00:04:59.550> drop

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
someone with the tomahawk they will drop

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.730 
someone with the tomahawk they will drop
a<00:04:59.850> scavenger<00:05:00.330> pack<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.110> can<00:05:01.380> continue

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
a scavenger pack and so you can continue

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.170 
a scavenger pack and so you can continue
streak<00:05:02.160> like<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:02.520> so<00:05:02.700> that's<00:05:02.880> interesting

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
streak like that so that's interesting

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.390 
streak like that so that's interesting
now<00:05:03.990> this<00:05:04.200> thing<00:05:04.410> has<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.800> ninety<00:05:05.220> percent

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
now this thing has a ninety percent

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.340 
now this thing has a ninety percent
movement<00:05:05.820> speed<00:05:06.240> which<00:05:06.419> isn't<00:05:06.630> too<00:05:06.900> bad<00:05:07.080> in

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
movement speed which isn't too bad in

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.200 
movement speed which isn't too bad in
previous<00:05:07.770> Call<00:05:07.950> of<00:05:07.980> Duty's<00:05:08.400> it's<00:05:08.790> been<00:05:09.000> around

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
previous Call of Duty's it's been around

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.870 
previous Call of Duty's it's been around
80<00:05:09.570> or<00:05:09.930> 85<00:05:10.500> so<00:05:10.830> although<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.280> is<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.430> little<00:05:11.760> bit

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
80 or 85 so although it is a little bit

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.730 
80 or 85 so although it is a little bit
slower<00:05:12.150> it's<00:05:12.570> not<00:05:12.750> too<00:05:13.020> bad<00:05:13.200> I<00:05:13.260> wouldn't<00:05:13.560> say

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
slower it's not too bad I wouldn't say

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.320 
slower it's not too bad I wouldn't say
it's<00:05:13.890> essential<00:05:14.460> that<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:14.640> loot<00:05:15.000> use

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
it's essential that you loot use

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.000 
it's essential that you loot use
lightweight<00:05:15.750> it's<00:05:16.200> probably<00:05:16.560> gonna<00:05:16.650> be<00:05:16.830> more

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
lightweight it's probably gonna be more

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.800 
lightweight it's probably gonna be more
favorable<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.850> use<00:05:17.940> flak<00:05:18.240> jacket<00:05:18.660> because

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
favorable to use flak jacket because

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.690 
favorable to use flak jacket because

being the salt shield people are just

non-stop to try and get rid of you so I

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.440 
non-stop to try and get rid of you so I
would<00:05:25.560> maybe<00:05:25.770> recommend<00:05:26.460> using<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:27.120> assault

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
would maybe recommend using the assault

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.060 
would maybe recommend using the assault
shield<00:05:27.660> if<00:05:27.930> either<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.500> you're<00:05:28.740> having<00:05:28.979> a

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
really bad time or maybe you're just not

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.180 
really bad time or maybe you're just not
the<00:05:30.960> greatest<00:05:31.350> play<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.680> you'd<00:05:31.770> like<00:05:31.919> to<00:05:31.979> get

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
the greatest play and you'd like to get

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.950 
the greatest play and you'd like to get
quite<00:05:32.490> a<00:05:32.520> lot<00:05:32.700> of<00:05:32.729> points<00:05:33.090> if<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.600> run<00:05:33.810> this

quite a lot of points if you run this

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.950 
quite a lot of points if you run this

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
you say EMP grenades support streaks go

create-a-class<00:06:02.789> setup<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:03.570> think<00:06:03.840> this<00:06:03.930> is

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
create-a-class setup I think this is

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.230 
create-a-class setup I think this is
great<00:06:04.200> the<00:06:04.380> tac-45<00:06:04.800> is<00:06:05.220> so<00:06:05.430> strong<00:06:05.760> and<00:06:06.060> I've

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
great the tac-45 is so strong and I've

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.700 
great the tac-45 is so strong and I've
chosen<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:06.810> because<00:06:07.050> it's<00:06:07.260> very<00:06:07.380> good<00:06:07.620> at

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
chosen that because it's very good at

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.140 
chosen that because it's very good at
close<00:06:08.010> range<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.460> you're<00:06:08.610> normally<00:06:09.000> going<00:06:09.030> to

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
close range and you're normally going to

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.120 
close range and you're normally going to
be<00:06:09.240> close<00:06:09.539> range<00:06:09.900> when<00:06:10.470> approaching<00:06:10.979> people

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
be close range when approaching people

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.100 
be close range when approaching people
and<00:06:11.490> then<00:06:11.729> here<00:06:11.970> is<00:06:12.120> just<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.419> general<00:06:12.780> good<00:06:12.960> one

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
and then here is just a general good one

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.290 
and then here is just a general good one
to<00:06:13.289> use<00:06:13.470> with<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.770> LMG<00:06:14.100> which<00:06:14.520> will<00:06:14.760> I<00:06:14.910> used<00:06:15.150> on
