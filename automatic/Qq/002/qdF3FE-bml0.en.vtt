00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
using the measurements provided our

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.470 
using the measurements provided our
first<00:00:37.380> measurement<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.850> find<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> center

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
first measurement is to find the center

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
first measurement is to find the center
point<00:00:39.750> between<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.920> two<00:00:41.329> fascia<00:00:42.329> tabs<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.440> can

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
point between the two fascia tabs we can

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.569 
point between the two fascia tabs we can
do<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.920> two<00:00:44.070> ways

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
do this in two ways

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.170 
do this in two ways
the<00:00:44.910> measurement<00:00:45.390> provided<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.829> six<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.489> 5/8

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the measurement provided is six and 5/8

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.080 
the measurement provided is six and 5/8
inches<00:00:48.469> from<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> center<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.520> fascia<00:00:50.760> tab

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
inches from the center of the fascia tab

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.279 
inches from the center of the fascia tab
the<00:00:51.840> other<00:00:51.989> way<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.410> could<00:00:52.590> measure<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.340> by

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
the other way we could measure it is by

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.610 
the other way we could measure it is by
going<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.710> taking<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> distance<00:00:57.620> between

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
going and taking the distance between

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.670 
going and taking the distance between
the<00:00:58.980> two<00:00:59.160> fascia<00:00:59.430> tabs<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.899> dividing<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.530> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the two fascia tabs and dividing it in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.830 
the two fascia tabs and dividing it in
half<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.149> they're<00:01:03.390> both<00:01:03.570> within

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
half as you can see they're both within

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.130 
half as you can see they're both within
1/8<00:01:04.229> inch<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.739> each<00:01:04.860> other<00:01:05.150> next<00:01:06.150> working<00:01:06.990> off

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
1/8 inch of each other next working off

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.670 
1/8 inch of each other next working off
our<00:01:07.380> Center<00:01:07.710> point<00:01:09.200> we're<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> mark<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
our Center point we're going to mark the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.640 
our Center point we're going to mark the
outside<00:01:11.070> edges<00:01:11.360> at<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.450> total<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> three<00:01:13.260> inches

next we need to mark the top edge which

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
next we need to mark the top edge which
is<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.729> two<00:01:17.939> inches<00:01:18.150> from<00:01:18.720> the
