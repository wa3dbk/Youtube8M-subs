00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.780 
is boiling water boils at 212 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.979> chocolate<00:01:55.979> will<00:01:56.219> scorch

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
Fahrenheit and chocolate will scorch

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.450 
Fahrenheit and chocolate will scorch
above<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.930> hundred<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.500> thirty-two<00:01:58.829> degrees

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
above a hundred and thirty-two degrees

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.639 
above a hundred and thirty-two degrees
so<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.210> decide<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:01.079> double<00:02:01.500> boiler

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
chocolate but it is a little bit more

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.920 
chocolate but it is a little bit more
temperamental<00:02:16.459> because<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.420> high<00:02:17.569> dairy

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
temperamental because of the high dairy

video for the time being i melted it in
the<00:02:24.290> microwave<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.890> poured<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.490> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
the microwave I poured it in the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580 
the microwave I poured it in the
fountain<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:26.090> my<00:02:26.540> fountain<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:27.050> running<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.560> I

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
fountain and my fountain is running so I

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.440

right temperature I know that that my
fountain<00:02:32.030> has<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.920> minimum<00:02:34.310> amount<00:02:34.880> of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
fountain has the minimum amount of

turns out I love this part it's really
actually<00:02:58.940> pretty<00:02:59.269> exciting

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.600 

as<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:03.209> add<00:03:03.420> my<00:03:03.959> pink<00:03:04.319> oil<00:03:04.590> based<00:03:04.860> food<00:03:05.069> coloring

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
as I add my pink oil based food coloring

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.670 
as I add my pink oil based food coloring
to<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.120> crown<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.870> chocolate<00:03:07.319> fountain

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
to the crown of the chocolate fountain

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.860 
to the crown of the chocolate fountain
I'm<00:03:07.799> only<00:03:08.099> dripping<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.480> reason

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
I'm only dripping it in and the reason

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.809 
I'm only dripping it in and the reason
for<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.470> I'm<00:03:10.620> looking<00:03:10.799> for<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> specific

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
for that is I'm looking for a specific

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.660 
for that is I'm looking for a specific
color<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.900> only<00:03:13.140> go<00:03:13.440> slowly<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.370> ensure

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
color and so I only go slowly to ensure

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.119 
color and so I only go slowly to ensure
that<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.420> oil<00:03:15.750> based<00:03:16.019> food<00:03:16.230> coloring<00:03:16.709> can<00:03:16.860> mix

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
that the oil based food coloring can mix

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.979 
that the oil based food coloring can mix
in<00:03:17.310> with<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.610> chocolate<00:03:17.819> and<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.659> end<00:03:18.840> up

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
in with the chocolate and I end up

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.899 
in with the chocolate and I end up
getting<00:03:19.379> the<00:03:19.530> exact<00:03:19.829> color<00:03:20.159> that<00:03:20.310> I'm<00:03:20.549> hoping

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
getting the exact color that I'm hoping

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.020 
getting the exact color that I'm hoping
for<00:03:21.110> once<00:03:22.110> I've<00:03:22.349> gotten<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.250> chocolate<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.909> be

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
for once I've gotten the chocolate to be

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.210 
for once I've gotten the chocolate to be
the<00:03:24.150> color<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.599> I'd<00:03:24.690> like<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.260> there's

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the color that I'd like it to be there's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.949 
the color that I'd like it to be there's
white<00:03:26.640> chocolate<00:03:27.180> that's<00:03:27.360> sitting<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.810> the

white chocolate into the pink curtain
that's<00:03:34.859> flowing<00:03:35.459> down<00:03:35.700> when<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.510> do<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:37.049> that

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
that's flowing down when I do that that

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.289 
that's flowing down when I do that that
chocolate<00:03:37.829> will<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.160> mix<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.700> with<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:38.970> pink
