00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.530
 hall lie I'm back part ii 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.360
 point in this video you will learn everything 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.370
 for a stroke of how to make them 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.910
 and what we different strokes one 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 there and I hope I can then 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.580
 still help 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.449
 I wish you a lot of fun and mine 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:29.010
 top team and first rule for one 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.960
 perfect each other's line is on each one 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.390
 fall the position as you mirror 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.489
 many of them are positioned 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.140
 Women when they make-up frontal 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.410
 in front of the mirror 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 but ideally it is when you have the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.090
 Mirror further offset down 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.039
 and of course that such a small 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.620
 hand game ideal 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.860
 yes that means you just sit down 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.719
 your desk or even on 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.230
 any table and then put it 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.530
 just on it and that she 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.539
 then look down is your song 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.470
 automatically streamlined and you see 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.770
 anyway you do what you do 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.630
 Of course , using mine again today is mine 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 favorite liquid opposite of a tommy 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.960
 sands but of course i can do anybody 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.960
 wanted to take any 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.179
 just really stroked that 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.549
 Eyelash Wreath should stop 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.770
 I would also always from the inside 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.140
 pull the neat out because 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.780
 I think that is the result of it 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.200
 becomes more even instead of when you go to 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.149
 example 1000 small points then do 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.409
 until then connecting so i find that 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.239
 totally useless but I think so too 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.579
 Again, everyone does it differently 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.989
 Everyone has a completely different hand motor 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.500
 I'll do the other side too 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.500
 fast again 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.160
 the classic one maybe 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.650
 from thin to thick and still has in the end 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.879
 times so small quiet season small 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.879
 philips little tick 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.070
 not the classic one stroke 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.920
 exactly as a small help I can you 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:35.510
 Still say that is mostly useful 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.380
 if you try the back before you 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.640
 to make a hook that we again the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.740
 lower dash before records so that you 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:59.420
 you have a limit, so to speak 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:03:02.590
 want to lead each one now 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.590
 you are from 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:17.330
 because not so practiced therein is 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.810
 you simply again a couple 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.820
 tips next to a table and 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.500
 cleansing milk so that he if that 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.180
 correct something that is not on 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.310
 made a good speech I know exactly 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.710
 that many of you do 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.390
 This irritates your eyes parts 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.340
 even more so I would 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.990
 cleansing milk so take my love 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.520
 but that's about it I hope 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.690
 video I would have liked because I 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.400
 he has fallen again then he will 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.110
 just a thumb up and still 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.300
 It would be better for me to subscribe 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.710
 have leisure in even more questions 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.720
 then please comment below again 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.580
 here in my video then I do if 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.430
 but sometimes a separate video 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.020
 Information on my top hat 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.490
 and all the styling you have too 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.470
 again in the formation spox 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.600
 listed i hope we will meet next 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.140
