the<00:02:30.900> science<00:02:31.290> club<00:02:31.530> has<00:02:31.890> been<00:02:32.390> pretty<00:02:33.390> much

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the science club has been pretty much

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.930 
the science club has been pretty much
restricted<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.740> what<00:02:35.160> people<00:02:35.520> think<00:02:35.760> about

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
restricted to what people think about

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.930 
restricted to what people think about
science<00:02:36.870> clubs<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.380> terms<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.980> science

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
science clubs in terms of science

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.200 
science clubs in terms of science
projects<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.320> there<00:02:40.440> was<00:02:40.530> always<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.790> County

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
projects and there was always the County

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.050 
projects and there was always the County
Science<00:02:42.780> Fair<00:02:43.260> where<00:02:43.740> our<00:02:44.430> students<00:02:44.850> would

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
Science Fair where our students would

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.910 
Science Fair where our students would
prepare<00:02:45.450> something<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.110> present<00:02:46.290> during<00:02:46.800> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
prepare something to present during the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.360 
prepare something to present during the
science<00:02:47.310> fair<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:49.260> was<00:02:49.410> about<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.770> but

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
science fair and that was about it but

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.350 
science fair and that was about it but
over<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.330> years<00:02:51.360> things<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.290> progressed

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
over the years things have progressed

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.020 
over the years things have progressed
ideas<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:54.570> changed<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.440> lot<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.460> energy<00:02:56.670> has

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
ideas have changed a lot of energy has

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.890 
ideas have changed a lot of energy has
been<00:02:57.470> infused<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.370> science<00:02:59.730> club<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.210> now

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
been infused in the science club and now

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.820 
been infused in the science club and now
we<00:03:00.960> have<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.740> science<00:03:02.370> club<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:03.330> is

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
we have a science club that really is

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.440 
we have a science club that really is
encompassing<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:05.430> totally<00:03:06.120> encompassing

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
encompassing it's totally encompassing

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.979 
encompassing it's totally encompassing
all<00:03:06.980> disciplines<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:09.480> that's

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
all disciplines and and I think that's

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.590 
all disciplines and and I think that's
the<00:03:10.170> vision<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.610> current<00:03:11.910> sponsor<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
the vision of the current sponsor of the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.850 
the vision of the current sponsor of the
science<00:03:12.959> club<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.380> would<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.680> miss

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
science club and that would be miss

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.729 
science club and that would be miss
angular<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.630> efforts<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.050> Miss<00:03:16.230> bermudez

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
angular and the efforts of Miss bermudez

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.160 
angular and the efforts of Miss bermudez
to<00:03:16.950> change<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:17.850> very<00:03:18.660> very<00:03:18.750> positive

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
to change that so very very positive

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.530 
to change that so very very positive
things<00:03:20.040> have<00:03:20.280> come<00:03:20.489> out<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.790> being<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.209> science

thought that was really amazing was they

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.130 
thought that was really amazing was they
took<00:05:09.830> that<00:05:10.070> space<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.700> took<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.690> from<00:05:11.840> just

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
being this sort of trash area and turned

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.890 
being this sort of trash area and turned
it<00:05:13.520> into<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.790> beautiful<00:05:14.180> garden<00:05:14.330> the

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
think the science club that has done

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.330 
think the science club that has done
that<00:05:25.910> I<00:05:26.030> think<00:05:26.270> is<00:05:26.420> amazing<00:05:27.320> is<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.890> recycling
