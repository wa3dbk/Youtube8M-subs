00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
right there we're playing on hardcore so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.640 
right there we're playing on hardcore so
again<00:01:21.060> obviously<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.720> bullets<00:01:22.170> count<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> lot

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
again obviously your bullets count a lot

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.170 
again obviously your bullets count a lot
more<00:01:22.920> than<00:01:23.250> they<00:01:23.340> would<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> normal<00:01:24.060> game

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
more than they would in the normal game

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
more than they would in the normal game
mode<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.320> makes<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.799> lot<00:01:25.920> more

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
mode but it also makes it a lot more

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
mode but it also makes it a lot more
difficult<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.820> break<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.170> situation

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
difficult to break out of a situation

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
difficult to break out of a situation
like<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.090> were<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.390> in

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
like you know the one we were just in

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.179 
like you know the one we were just in
right<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.020> once<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.590> pinned<00:01:31.860> into<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
right there once you're pinned into a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.310 
right there once you're pinned into a
corner<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.299> can't<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.780> very<00:01:33.930> much<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
corner you really can't do very much in

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.870 
corner you really can't do very much in
hardcore<00:01:34.770> especially<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
hardcore especially if they have you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
hardcore especially if they have you
fully<00:01:36.119> surrounded<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
fully surrounded so it can you know it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.080 
fully surrounded so it can you know it
kind<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.040> comes<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.400> goes<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.939> can

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
kind of comes and goes and as you can

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.770 
kind of comes and goes and as you can
see<00:01:39.119> through<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.140> gameplay<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
see through this gameplay right here I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.149 
see through this gameplay right here I
sort<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.960> situations<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.829> onto<00:01:43.979> an

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
sort of have situations I got onto an

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.980 
sort of have situations I got onto an
enemy<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.390> shot<00:01:45.720> from<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
enemy and then I just get shot from the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.389 
enemy and then I just get shot from the
side<00:01:46.229> or<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.500> back<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:46.950> pinned<00:01:47.220> or

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
side or in the back or pinned or

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
side or in the back or pinned or
whatever<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.899> deer

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
whatever like right there just get deer

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.990 
whatever like right there just get deer
marred<00:01:49.380> down<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.920> again<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.610> when<00:01:50.880> you're

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
marred down and again that's when you're

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.280 
marred down and again that's when you're
playing<00:01:51.149> hardcore<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
playing hardcore you just have that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.410 
playing hardcore you just have that
difficulty<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.310> course<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.820> drop<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> lot

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
difficulty that of course you drop a lot

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.090 
difficulty that of course you drop a lot
easier<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.229> means<00:01:55.470> you're<00:01:55.619> much<00:01:55.860> more

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
easier it means you're much more

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.560 
easier it means you're much more
vulnerable<00:01:56.340> than<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> normally<00:01:57.119> would<00:01:57.329> be

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
vulnerable than you normally would be

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.010 
vulnerable than you normally would be
from<00:01:57.780> multiple<00:01:58.320> different<00:01:58.530> directions

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
from multiple different directions

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.850 
from multiple different directions
something<00:02:02.020> else<00:02:02.140> that<00:02:02.229> made<00:02:02.500> me<00:02:02.590> think<00:02:02.800> about

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
something else that made me think about

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.370 
something else that made me think about
as<00:02:03.250> well<00:02:03.520> with<00:02:03.790> this<00:02:03.940> was<00:02:04.360> from<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.140> lot<00:02:05.260> of

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
as well with this was from a lot of

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.930 
as well with this was from a lot of
games<00:02:05.500> I've<00:02:05.650> been<00:02:05.770> playing<00:02:05.950> lately<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.490> guess

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
games I've been playing lately I guess

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.150 
games I've been playing lately I guess
it's<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.540> fairly<00:02:07.780> obvious<00:02:08.289> conclusion<00:02:08.950> but<00:02:09.069> I

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
it's a fairly obvious conclusion but I

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.199 
it's a fairly obvious conclusion but I
guess<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.429> just<00:02:09.459> never<00:02:09.729> really<00:02:10.000> sort<00:02:10.179> of

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
guess I just never really sort of

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.199 
guess I just never really sort of
verbalized<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:10.990> very<00:02:11.350> well<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.740> that<00:02:12.370> the

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
verbalized it very well is that the

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.449 
verbalized it very well is that the
difference<00:02:13.660> i<00:02:13.810> noted<00:02:14.260> between<00:02:14.459> public

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
difference i noted between public

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.490 
difference i noted between public
players<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.090> objective<00:02:16.959> players<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.440> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
players and objective players and the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.830 
players and objective players and the
differentiation<00:02:18.100> i<00:02:18.310> make<00:02:18.520> there<00:02:18.820> is<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.420> public

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
differentiation i make there is a public

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.600 
differentiation i make there is a public
player<00:02:20.080> would<00:02:20.350> be<00:02:20.470> one<00:02:20.650> hunit<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:21.459> know

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
player would be one hunit we know

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.100 
player would be one hunit we know
perhaps<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.120> not<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.600> interested<00:02:23.020> in

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
perhaps is not so interested in

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.570 
perhaps is not so interested in
necessarily<00:02:23.620> breaking<00:02:24.040> out<00:02:24.160> getting<00:02:24.490> two

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
necessarily breaking out getting two

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.400 
necessarily breaking out getting two
objectives<00:02:24.910> making<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.810> push<00:02:25.989> forward

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
objectives making that push forward

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.140 
objectives making that push forward
they're<00:02:26.830> more<00:02:27.010> interested<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.880> what's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
they're more interested in just what's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.820 
they're more interested in just what's
happening<00:02:28.270> directly<00:02:28.989> in<00:02:29.319> front<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.620> them<00:02:29.709> at

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
happening directly in front of them at

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.490 
happening directly in front of them at
any<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.220> time<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.840> was<00:02:32.020> kind<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.320> from

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
any one time and this was kind of from

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.410 
any one time and this was kind of from
what<00:02:32.620> I'd<00:02:32.709> seen<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.070> games<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.730> conclusion

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
what I'd seen in games the conclusion

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.360 
what I'd seen in games the conclusion
that<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.600> took<00:02:34.690> forward<00:02:35.260> which<00:02:35.440> was<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
that I took forward which was that the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.340 
that I took forward which was that the
difference<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:38.110> was<00:02:38.200> we

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
difference that you see and it was we

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.690 
difference that you see and it was we
actually<00:02:38.470> playing<00:02:38.800> locker<00:02:39.070> we<00:02:39.430> were<00:02:39.550> playing

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
actually playing locker we were playing

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.009 
actually playing locker we were playing
locker<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.209> I've<00:02:40.300> actually<00:02:40.390> got<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.780> round

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
locker and I've actually got that round

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.570 
locker and I've actually got that round
so<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.470> potentially<00:02:41.800> post<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.310> up<00:02:42.430> as

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
so I can potentially post that up as

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.400 
so I can potentially post that up as
well<00:02:42.610> as<00:02:43.209> playing<00:02:43.480> locker<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.050> we<00:02:44.140> had<00:02:44.260> like

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
well as playing locker and we had like

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.620 
well as playing locker and we had like
four<00:02:44.709> guys<00:02:45.250> from<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.519> clan<00:02:45.820> we<00:02:46.239> were<00:02:46.390> pushing

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
four guys from the clan we were pushing

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.300 
four guys from the clan we were pushing
forward<00:02:47.019> we<00:02:47.170> were<00:02:47.260> getting<00:02:47.530> through<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.130> was<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
forward we were getting through it was a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.790 
forward we were getting through it was a
small<00:02:49.030> congress<00:02:49.450> said<00:02:49.630> three<00:02:49.870> bases<00:02:50.290> we<00:02:50.709> were

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
small congress said three bases we were

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.680 
small congress said three bases we were
pushing<00:02:51.040> through<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:51.730> we<00:02:52.180> were<00:02:52.269> capping

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
pushing through and we were capping

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.540 
pushing through and we were capping
their<00:02:52.840> rear<00:02:53.019> position<00:02:53.200> but<00:02:53.980> even<00:02:54.250> though<00:02:54.370> we

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
their rear position but even though we

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.340 
their rear position but even though we
had<00:02:54.700> managed<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.000> flank<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.570> push<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.050> cap

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
had managed to flank and push and cap

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.870 
had managed to flank and push and cap
the<00:02:56.950> rest<00:02:57.130> of<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.250> team<00:02:57.430> are<00:02:57.550> not<00:02:57.670> pushing

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
the rest of the team are not pushing

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.360 
the rest of the team are not pushing
forward<00:02:58.300> and<00:02:58.450> what<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.290> made<00:02:59.440> me<00:02:59.530> realize<00:02:59.950> was

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
forward and what it made me realize was

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.759 
forward and what it made me realize was
that<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:01.239> difference<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.110> an<00:03:02.350> objective

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
that the difference is that an objective

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.890 
that the difference is that an objective
player<00:03:03.010> will<00:03:03.340> take<00:03:03.580> risks<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.180> break<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.660> line

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
player will take risks to break the line

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.660 
player will take risks to break the line
you'll<00:03:05.350> you'll<00:03:05.680> try<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.070> push<00:03:06.220> forward<00:03:06.250> by

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
you'll you'll try and push forward by

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.220 
you'll you'll try and push forward by
any<00:03:06.880> means<00:03:07.150> necessary<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.840> means<00:03:08.019> dropping

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
any means necessary that means dropping

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.050 
any means necessary that means dropping
the<00:03:08.440> flashbang<00:03:08.890> smoke<00:03:09.250> running<00:03:09.820> through

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
the flashbang smoke running through

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.759 
the flashbang smoke running through
sometimes<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.750> live<00:03:10.959> sometimes<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.620> don't

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
sometimes you live sometimes you don't

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.740 
sometimes you live sometimes you don't
but<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.160> try<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.579> try<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.090> make<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.480> break

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
but you try you try to make that break

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.289 
but you try you try to make that break

forward a normal public player won't do

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.060 
forward a normal public player won't do
that<00:03:16.329> because<00:03:16.870> what<00:03:17.260> they<00:03:17.470> will<00:03:17.650> do<00:03:17.860> from

that because what they will do from

that because what they will do from
their<00:03:18.220> point<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.549> view<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.910> they<00:03:19.329> look<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.870> if

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
their point of view is they look and if

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.199 
their point of view is they look and if
their<00:03:21.010> enemies<00:03:21.430> in<00:03:21.579> front<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:21.910> them<00:03:22.030> if

their enemies in front of them if

their enemies in front of them if
they're<00:03:22.420> still<00:03:22.690> there<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:22.959> front<00:03:23.079> of<00:03:23.230> them

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
they're still there in front of them

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.979 
they're still there in front of them
they<00:03:23.829> won't<00:03:24.010> move<00:03:24.280> they<00:03:24.880> want<00:03:24.910> it<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.510> be<00:03:25.630> clear

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
they won't move they want it to be clear

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.960 
they won't move they want it to be clear
and<00:03:26.170> safe<00:03:26.530> before<00:03:26.950> they<00:03:27.220> move<00:03:27.400> forward<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.880> if

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
and safe before they move forward and if

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.210 
and safe before they move forward and if
it's<00:03:28.150> not<00:03:28.390> safe<00:03:28.660> they'll<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:29.350> think<00:03:29.530> okay

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
it's not safe they'll just think okay

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.130 
it's not safe they'll just think okay
well<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.269> know<00:03:31.360> there's<00:03:31.570> people<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.870> Sue's

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
well you know there's people to Sue's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.140 
well you know there's people to Sue's
shoot<00:03:32.620> still<00:03:32.890> so<00:03:33.220> why<00:03:33.400> should<00:03:33.579> I<00:03:33.670> move<00:03:33.820> forward

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
shoot still so why should I move forward

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.120 
shoot still so why should I move forward
and<00:03:34.269> that's<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.959> difference<00:03:35.320> it's<00:03:35.680> just<00:03:35.950> that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
and that's the difference it's just that

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.130 
and that's the difference it's just that
a<00:03:36.280> totally<00:03:36.790> different<00:03:37.120> point<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.450> view<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.840> I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
a totally different point of view and I

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.020 
a totally different point of view and I
say<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:39.040> more<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.250> started<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.730> think<00:03:39.760> about

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
say the more I started to think about

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.280 
say the more I started to think about
that<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.480> more<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.660> looked<00:03:40.959> at<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.200> in

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
that and the more I looked at it in

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.900 
that and the more I looked at it in
games<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.829> start<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.250> see<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.519> all<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.730> time

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
games you start to see it all the time

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.610 
games you start to see it all the time
look<00:03:43.510> for<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.750> yourself<00:03:43.780> when<00:03:44.320> you're<00:03:44.470> in<00:03:44.530> a

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
look for it yourself when you're in a

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.470 
look for it yourself when you're in a
game<00:03:44.769> next<00:03:44.980> look<00:03:45.519> at<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:46.180> can<00:03:46.329> identify

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
game next look at and you can identify

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.210 
game next look at and you can identify
the<00:03:46.959> players<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.500> players<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.829> are<00:03:47.980> really

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the players the players that are really

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.500 
the players the players that are really
pushing<00:03:48.430> for<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.730> objective<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.239> the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
pushing for the objective and the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.120 
pushing for the objective and the
players<00:03:49.720> they're<00:03:49.930> not<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.350> just<00:03:50.799> played<00:03:50.980> a

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
players they're not I just played a

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.310 
players they're not I just played a
round<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.700> gold<00:03:52.540> mode<00:03:52.690> as<00:03:52.810> well<00:03:52.840> we're<00:03:53.110> playing

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
round of gold mode as well we're playing

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.229 
round of gold mode as well we're playing
gohmert<00:03:53.709> domination<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.400> managed<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.120> get

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
gohmert domination I managed to get

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.699 
gohmert domination I managed to get
halfway<00:03:55.690> through<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.140> game<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.590> was

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
halfway through the game and I was

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.410 
halfway through the game and I was
second<00:03:57.010> or<00:03:57.100> third<00:03:57.280> on<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.519> board<00:03:57.730> yet<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.180> only

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
second or third on the board yet I only

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.599 
second or third on the board yet I only
had<00:03:58.630> two<00:03:58.870> kills<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.590> reason<00:03:59.890> being<00:04:00.010> was<00:04:00.250> there

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
had two kills the reason being was there

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.520 
had two kills the reason being was there
were<00:04:00.700> literally<00:04:01.239> very<00:04:01.720> few<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.049> our<00:04:02.109> team<00:04:02.350> that

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
were literally very few of our team that

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.110 
were literally very few of our team that
were<00:04:02.799> actually<00:04:02.950> pushing<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.640> objectives

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
were actually pushing to the objectives

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.240 
were actually pushing to the objectives
and<00:04:04.209> controlling<00:04:04.690> them<00:04:04.810> our<00:04:04.959> squad<00:04:05.739> were<00:04:06.010> we

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
and controlling them our squad were we

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.349 
and controlling them our squad were we
were<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.430> ones<00:04:06.579> that<00:04:06.670> were<00:04:06.760> controlling<00:04:07.209> the

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
were the ones that were controlling the

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.850 
were the ones that were controlling the
objectives<00:04:07.750> by<00:04:07.870> moving<00:04:08.170> flanking<00:04:08.739> and

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
objectives by moving flanking and

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.410 
objectives by moving flanking and
capping<00:04:09.220> but<00:04:09.550> everybody<00:04:09.849> else<00:04:10.000> was<00:04:10.150> just<00:04:10.180> in

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
capping but everybody else was just in

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.660 
capping but everybody else was just in
the<00:04:10.480> middle<00:04:10.569> going<00:04:10.930> for<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.170> KD<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:11.769> so<00:04:12.430> again

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
the middle going for the KD and so again

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.410 
the middle going for the KD and so again
it's<00:04:12.910> just<00:04:13.239> that

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
it's just that

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.210 
it's just that
kind<00:04:13.630> of<00:04:13.690> point<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.020> view<00:04:14.200> but<00:04:14.770> anyway<00:04:15.010> this

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
kind of point of view but anyway this

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.860 
kind of point of view but anyway this
whole<00:04:15.610> round<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:15.970> actually<00:04:16.209> 15<00:04:16.480> minutes<00:04:16.750> and

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
whole round is actually 15 minutes and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.120 
whole round is actually 15 minutes and
although<00:04:17.139> it<00:04:17.260> looks<00:04:17.410> like<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.650> got<00:04:17.680> horribly

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
although it looks like I got horribly

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.560 
although it looks like I got horribly
slaughtered<00:04:18.700> at<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.000> beginning<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.389> here<00:04:19.540> I

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
gameplay i do still have that round for

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.610 
gameplay i do still have that round for
you<00:04:37.240> on<00:04:37.330> go<00:04:37.510> mad<00:04:37.720> rush<00:04:37.960> that<00:04:38.230> one's<00:04:38.380> come<00:04:38.530> up

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
that's the defense gameplay and I

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.820 
that's the defense gameplay and I
probably<00:04:40.690> do<00:04:40.930> this<00:04:41.050> one<00:04:41.260> as<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.410> full<00:04:41.680> round

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
probably do this one as a full round

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.050 
probably do this one as a full round
breakdown<00:04:42.220> as<00:04:42.310> well<00:04:42.490> cuz<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.850> very

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
breakdown as well cuz this is very

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.610 
breakdown as well cuz this is very
interesting<00:04:43.330> game<00:04:43.720> from<00:04:43.870> start<00:04:44.139> to<00:04:44.350> finish

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
interesting game from start to finish

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.320 
interesting game from start to finish
and<00:04:44.650> as<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.919> say<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.250> latter<00:04:45.700> part<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.180> this

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
and as I say the latter part of this

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.060 
and as I say the latter part of this
round<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.810> quite<00:04:47.020> interesting<00:04:47.560> I've<00:04:47.889> got<00:04:48.040> a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
round is quite interesting I've got a

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.590 
round is quite interesting I've got a
few<00:04:48.250> hardcore<00:04:48.729> grounds<00:04:48.970> actually<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.270> post<00:04:49.450> up

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
few hardcore grounds actually to post up

few hardcore grounds actually to post up
and<00:04:49.750> perhaps<00:04:49.870> talk<00:04:50.290> about<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:51.400> i<00:04:51.460> always

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
and perhaps talk about and I i always

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.129 
and perhaps talk about and I i always
get<00:04:52.030> calls<00:04:52.240> from<00:04:52.300> people<00:04:52.419> saying<00:04:52.750> like<00:04:52.960> when

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
get calls from people saying like when

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.990 
get calls from people saying like when
you<00:04:53.229> place<00:04:53.470> more<00:04:53.680> hardcore<00:04:54.160> do<00:04:54.729> you<00:04:54.790> play<00:04:54.970> a

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
you place more hardcore do you play a

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.540 
you place more hardcore do you play a
hardcore<00:04:55.510> i<00:04:55.690> I<00:04:55.870> do<00:04:56.139> play<00:04:56.410> hardcore<00:04:56.680> but<00:04:57.190> it

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
hardcore i I do play hardcore but it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.129 
hardcore i I do play hardcore but it
really<00:04:57.790> varies<00:04:58.060> on<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.600> kind<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.870> gameplay

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
really varies on the kind of gameplay

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.170 
really varies on the kind of gameplay
that<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.410> get<00:04:59.620> because<00:04:59.950> sometimes<00:05:00.729> that's

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
that you get because sometimes that's

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.520 
that you get because sometimes that's
why<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:01.450> don't<00:05:01.600> go<00:05:01.720> for<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:01.990> rest<00:05:02.169> by<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.410> way

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
why you don't go for the rest by the way

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.530 
why you don't go for the rest by the way
before<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:03.010> check<00:05:03.580> for<00:05:03.610> enemies<00:05:04.060> as<00:05:04.270> people

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
before you check for enemies as people

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.719 
before you check for enemies as people
are<00:05:04.630> always<00:05:04.780> criticizing<00:05:05.320> me<00:05:05.470> for<00:05:05.580> but<00:05:06.580> yeah

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
are always criticizing me for but yeah

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.610 
are always criticizing me for but yeah
hardcore<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.570> really<00:05:07.780> varies<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.410> kind<00:05:08.590> of

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
hardcore it really varies on the kind of

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.200 
hardcore it really varies on the kind of
gameplay<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:08.979> get<00:05:09.220> we've<00:05:09.400> had<00:05:09.580> we<00:05:09.790> had<00:05:09.940> many

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
we had several rounds like that as well

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.070 
we had several rounds like that as well
which<00:05:24.640> would<00:05:24.789> just<00:05:25.090> not<00:05:25.390> enjoyable<00:05:25.570> because

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
which would just not enjoyable because

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.840 
which would just not enjoyable because
you<00:05:26.320> just<00:05:26.500> everybody<00:05:27.190> else<00:05:27.460> we're<00:05:27.640> trying<00:05:27.789> to

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
you just everybody else we're trying to

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
you just everybody else we're trying to
get<00:05:27.940> on<00:05:28.030> with<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.210> game<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.419> just<00:05:28.660> do<00:05:28.780> the

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
get on with the game and just do the

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.360 
get on with the game and just do the
normal<00:05:29.020> stuff<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:29.560> you<00:05:29.620> just<00:05:29.800> couldn't<00:05:30.130> move

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
normal stuff and you just couldn't move

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.550 
normal stuff and you just couldn't move
it<00:05:30.729> just<00:05:31.030> makes<00:05:31.180> it<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.419> misery<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.169> again

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
it just makes it a misery and again

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.860 
it just makes it a misery and again
that's<00:05:32.650> really<00:05:33.039> why<00:05:33.190> I<00:05:33.250> don't<00:05:33.870> necessarily

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
that's really why I don't necessarily

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.290 
that's really why I don't necessarily
hardcore<00:05:35.410> because<00:05:35.830> of<00:05:35.979> them<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.520> ones<00:05:36.760> you

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
hardcore because of them the ones you

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.880 
hardcore because of them the ones you
know<00:05:37.419> there's<00:05:37.600> stylistic<00:05:38.229> differences<00:05:38.440> that

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
know there's stylistic differences that

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.550 
know there's stylistic differences that
just<00:05:39.070> kind<00:05:39.340> of<00:05:39.400> negate<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.240> gameplay<00:05:40.870> anyway

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
just kind of negate that gameplay anyway
