00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
in here to the battery and then the

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.430 
in here to the battery and then the
outside<00:04:20.969> the<00:04:21.479> generator

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
outside the generator

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.310 
outside the generator
comes<00:04:22.590> right<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:22.980> from<00:04:23.190> outside<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.320> charger

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
comes right in from outside to a charger

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.710 
comes right in from outside to a charger
I<00:04:25.350> have<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> charger<00:04:26.130> under<00:04:26.400> here<00:04:26.700> there's<00:04:27.630> your

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
charger and that will charge the battery

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.470 
charger and that will charge the battery
