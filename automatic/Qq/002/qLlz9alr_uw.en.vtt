00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
had heated the head install the guides

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.599 
had heated the head install the guides
and<00:00:17.119> actually<00:00:18.119> had<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:19.490> reamer<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and actually had to use a reamer of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.550 
and actually had to use a reamer of
sorts<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.359> through<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.260> close<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
sorts to go through it get it close to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.769 
sorts to go through it get it close to
size<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:23.760> balls<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.300> wish<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.630> would

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
size and then some balls I wish I would

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.179 
size and then some balls I wish I would
have<00:00:24.810> had<00:00:24.990> time<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.289> show<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.099> on

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
have had time to show you that but on

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.620 
have had time to show you that but on
another<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.760> will<00:00:27.590> anyway<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:30.240> gets<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
another one will anyway this gets a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.560 
another one will anyway this gets a
three<00:00:30.869> angle<00:00:31.199> by<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.410> job<00:00:31.710> too<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.570> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
three angle by out job too just like the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.150 
three angle by out job too just like the
majority<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.230> stuff<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.950> I'm<00:00:35.100> not

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
majority of stuff that I do I'm not

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.889 
majority of stuff that I do I'm not
going<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.880> fourth<00:00:36.120> angle<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.780> this

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
going for a fourth angle because this

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.360 
going for a fourth angle because this
thing<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> combustion<00:00:38.129> chamber

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
thing don't have a combustion chamber

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.630 
thing don't have a combustion chamber
but<00:00:39.270> any<00:00:39.600> time<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.410> put<00:00:40.680> God's<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> head

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
but any time you put God's in the head

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.139 
but any time you put God's in the head
you<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> three<00:00:43.170> angle<00:00:43.440> bow<00:00:43.590> job

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
you have to do a three angle bow job

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.020 
you have to do a three angle bow job
they<00:00:45.149> don't<00:00:45.300> work<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.930> art<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:47.820> do

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
they don't work on art like this to do

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.590 
they don't work on art like this to do
to<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.809> would<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.289> sacrilege<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.610> here

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to not do it would be sacrilege so here

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.420 
to not do it would be sacrilege so here
we<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.500> ahead<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.980> start<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
we go I'm going to go ahead and start it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
we go I'm going to go ahead and start it
and<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:53.670> fly<00:00:54.510> through<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.140> everything

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
to watch the head and put her together

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.929 
to watch the head and put her together
done<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:02.570> what<00:01:03.570> we've<00:01:03.750> got<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:05.159> asked

done now what we've got here is I asked
my<00:01:06.150> customers<00:01:06.810> brain<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.740> stock<00:01:08.220> head<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.909> here

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
my customers brain a stock head up here

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
my customers brain a stock head up here
so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> could<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> beside<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.130> was

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
you know what I might ought to move that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
you know what I might ought to move that
head<00:01:24.240> over<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.259> ports

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
head over there because that one ports

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.100 
head over there because that one ports
blocked<00:01:25.950> off<00:01:26.220> hold<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:28.080> of

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
blocked off hold on then just out of

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.340 
blocked off hold on then just out of
curiosity<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.130> took<00:01:29.490> my<00:01:29.670> snap<00:01:30.090> finalised<00:01:30.900> just

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
curiosity I took my snap finalised just

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.010 
curiosity I took my snap finalised just
to<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.650> from<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> other<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.689> come

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to go from one to the other and I come

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.130 
to go from one to the other and I come
up<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.259> an<00:01:34.650> inch<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.299> forty<00:01:36.299> seven<00:01:36.659> thousand

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
up with an inch and forty seven thousand

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.350 
up with an inch and forty seven thousand
sore<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.470> point<00:01:37.829> zero<00:01:37.920> forty<00:01:38.579> seven<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
sore one point zero forty seven on the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.289 
sore one point zero forty seven on the
stop<00:01:39.680> when<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> went<00:01:41.009> over<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.909> can

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
stop when I went over here which you can

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.770 
stop when I went over here which you can
see<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.189> it's<00:01:44.189> quite<00:01:44.460> dramatic<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.299> ends<00:01:45.479> up

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
see that it's quite dramatic it ends up

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
see that it's quite dramatic it ends up
being<00:01:46.200> almost<00:01:46.670> 200<00:01:47.670> thousands<00:01:48.270> bigger<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:50.000> one

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
being almost 200 thousands bigger at one

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.280 
being almost 200 thousands bigger at one
point<00:01:51.829> or<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.189> point<00:01:54.439> 207<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.950> almost<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
point or one point 207 so it's almost a

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.380 
point or one point 207 so it's almost a
quarter<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> an<00:01:58.649> inch<00:01:58.979> now<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.820> here<00:02:00.180> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
quarter of an inch now right here this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.840 
quarter of an inch now right here this
is<00:02:00.570> right<00:02:00.780> before<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> two<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.490> bring<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
is right before the two if you bring it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
is right before the two if you bring it
here<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.210> won't<00:02:03.360> even<00:02:03.689> fit<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> first<00:02:04.380> few

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
here it won't even fit in the first few

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.230 
here it won't even fit in the first few
thousands<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> port<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.790> has<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
thousands of the port it has to have a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240 
thousands of the port it has to have a
total<00:02:06.689> cover<00:02:06.960> has<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> total

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
total cover has to have a total

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
total cover has to have a total
when<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> start<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.660> bring<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.080> look<00:02:10.289> how<00:02:10.319> I

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
when you start to bring it in look how I

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.500 
when you start to bring it in look how I
have

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
have

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.060 
have
so<00:02:12.580> cross-sectionally<00:02:13.580> speaking<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:15.860> need<00:02:16.040> a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
so cross-sectionally speaking we need a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.550 
so cross-sectionally speaking we need a
bigger<00:02:16.310> vowel<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:17.750> that's<00:02:17.990> okay<00:02:18.380> because

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
bigger vowel but that's okay because

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.130 
bigger vowel but that's okay because
that<00:02:19.010> means<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.670> anytime<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.870> flow

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
that means that anytime you flow

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.380 
that means that anytime you flow
significant<00:02:22.010> high<00:02:22.250> numbers<00:02:22.730> with<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> smaller

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
significant high numbers with a smaller

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.300 
significant high numbers with a smaller
valve<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.990> makes<00:02:24.200> for<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.500> more<00:02:24.680> efficient<00:02:25.130> head

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
valve it makes for a more efficient head

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.730 
valve it makes for a more efficient head
and<00:02:25.490> remember<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.600> name<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.960> this<00:02:27.080> game<00:02:27.410> is

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
and remember the name of this game is

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.230 
and remember the name of this game is
gas<00:02:28.010> mileage<00:02:28.900> some<00:02:29.900> power<00:02:30.230> increase<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.340> it's

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
gas mileage some power increase but it's

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.730 
gas mileage some power increase but it's
going<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.570> interesting<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.140> see<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:33.410> believe

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
going to be interesting to see I believe

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.020 
going to be interesting to see I believe
he<00:02:33.890> said<00:02:34.100> he<00:02:34.280> got<00:02:34.490> 52<00:02:34.970> miles<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.110> gallon

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
he said he got 52 miles to a gallon

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.790 
he said he got 52 miles to a gallon
before<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.270> head<00:02:38.510> work<00:02:38.750> was<00:02:38.990> done<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.590> this

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
before this head work was done so this

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.470 
before this head work was done so this
has<00:02:39.980> been<00:02:40.130> arresting<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.760> see<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:41.270> let<00:02:41.390> me

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
daylight where there's where the swirl

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.110 
daylight where there's where the swirl
starts<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.730> twist<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.330> begin<00:02:53.630> it's<00:02:54.070> HELOCs

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
starts to twist and begin it's HELOCs

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.000 
starts to twist and begin it's HELOCs
right<00:02:56.120> here<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.870> then<00:02:57.140> when<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.440> come<00:02:57.709> over

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
here to this head boom right there I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.960 
here to this head boom right there I
mean<00:03:02.690> man<00:03:03.050> we're<00:03:03.320> wide<00:03:03.560> open<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:04.340> mean<00:03:04.520> I'd<00:03:04.940> be

mean man we're wide open I mean I'd be
venturing<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.660> say<00:03:05.870> there's<00:03:06.110> almost<00:03:06.290> a

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
venturing to say there's almost a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.380 
venturing to say there's almost a
quarter<00:03:06.920> inch<00:03:07.100> movement<00:03:07.580> from<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.850> god<00:03:08.060> over

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
quarter inch movement from the god over

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.930 
quarter inch movement from the god over
there<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.380> basically<00:03:09.860> we<00:03:10.160> do<00:03:10.340> what<00:03:10.520> we<00:03:10.640> do<00:03:10.790> with

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
there so basically we do what we do with

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.500 
there so basically we do what we do with
the<00:03:11.060> TBI<00:03:11.510> heads<00:03:12.020> we<00:03:12.320> take<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.890> twists<00:03:13.280> out<00:03:13.640> you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
the TBI heads we take the twists out you

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.290 
the TBI heads we take the twists out you
unscrew<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.709> screw<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.550> keeps<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.060> from

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
unscrew the screw and it keeps you from

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
being screwed all right now you can see

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.190 
being screwed all right now you can see
the<00:03:20.540> brass<00:03:20.780> tubing<00:03:21.410> lay<00:03:22.060> on<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.510> head<00:03:23.840> pretty

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
what we don't know is volume although

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.890 
what we don't know is volume although
looks<00:04:03.380> or<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.620> thousand<00:04:04.160> words<00:04:05.030> we<00:04:05.330> need<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.630> get

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900

looks or a thousand words we need to get
a<00:04:05.930> volume<00:04:06.470> on<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:06.830> thing<00:04:07.070> at<00:04:07.250> least<00:04:07.400> one<00:04:07.730> port
