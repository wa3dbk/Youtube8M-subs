the forest of stones deals is cool but

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.310 
the forest of stones deals is cool but
it's<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.850> little<00:02:22.030> expensive<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.750> if<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.110> can't

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
it's a little expensive and if you can't

read<00:02:23.470> chinese<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:24.010> probably<00:02:24.430> not<00:02:24.670> worth<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030

price tag but guess what you can get for

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.680 
price tag but guess what you can get for
much<00:02:27.280> cheaper<00:02:27.310> than<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.000> admission<00:02:28.480> price
