fast as Natalie's in wall charger what

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.889 
fast as Natalie's in wall charger what
gives<00:00:30.619> that's<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:31.669> great<00:00:31.880> question<00:00:32.119> but<00:00:32.660> first

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
gives that's a great question but first

gives that's a great question but first
we<00:00:33.199> got<00:00:33.379> to<00:00:33.410> talk<00:00:33.649> a<00:00:33.680> little<00:00:33.949> bit<00:00:34.129> about

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
we got to talk a little bit about

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.939 
we got to talk a little bit about
electricity<00:00:35.530> for<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.620> most<00:00:36.770> part

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
electricity for the most part

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.610 
electricity for the most part
electricity<00:00:37.609> comes<00:00:37.820> in<00:00:37.940> two<00:00:38.059> different<00:00:38.090> forms

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
electricity comes in two different forms

electricity comes in two different forms
alternating<00:00:39.620> current<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.250> stuff<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:40.579> comes

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
alternating current the stuff that comes

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.939 
alternating current the stuff that comes
out<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:40.969> your<00:00:41.090> wall<00:00:41.390> virtually<00:00:42.199> everywhere<00:00:42.800> in

the world and direct current direct
current<00:00:45.859> is<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:46.250> stuff<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:46.699> we<00:00:46.789> use<00:00:47.030> inside

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
current is the stuff that we use inside

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.970 
current is the stuff that we use inside
batteries<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.170> inside<00:00:48.559> of<00:00:48.590> our<00:00:48.739> mobile

batteries and inside of our mobile

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.549 
batteries and inside of our mobile
devices<00:00:49.629> somehow<00:00:50.629> we've<00:00:50.870> got<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.109> convert

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
devices somehow we've got to convert

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.299 
devices somehow we've got to convert
that<00:00:51.710> AC<00:00:52.300> into<00:00:53.300> DC<00:00:53.440> so<00:00:54.440> that<00:00:54.559> we<00:00:54.649> can<00:00:54.800> charge<00:00:55.070> up

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
that AC into DC so that we can charge up

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.020 
that AC into DC so that we can charge up
our<00:00:55.429> phones<00:00:55.730> I'll<00:00:56.089> use<00:00:56.899> them<00:00:57.579> this<00:00:58.579> conversion

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
our phones I'll use them this conversion

our phones I'll use them this conversion
happens<00:00:59.329> through<00:00:59.749> what<00:00:59.929> we<00:01:00.079> usually<00:01:00.289> just

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
happens through what we usually just

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.680 
happens through what we usually just
call<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.829> charger<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:01.999> really<00:01:02.269> it<00:01:02.390> comes

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
call a charger but really it comes

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.299 
call a charger but really it comes
through<00:01:02.960> something<00:01:03.320> called<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.710> rectifier

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
through something called a rectifier

that some people erroneously call an

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.319 
that some people erroneously call an
inverter<00:01:06.619> what<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.430> does<00:01:07.549> is<00:01:07.729> it<00:01:07.880> takes<00:01:08.060> that

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
inverter what it does is it takes that

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.969 
inverter what it does is it takes that
alternating<00:01:08.930> current<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:09.380> through<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.680> series

essentially the same thing as USB when
it<00:01:23.960> comes<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.259> power<00:01:24.790> what's<00:01:25.790> different

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
it comes to power what's different

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.399 
it comes to power what's different
however<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:27.399> voltage<00:01:28.399> and<00:01:28.700> amperage<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.780> you

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
however is voltage and amperage and you

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.499 
however is voltage and amperage and you
know<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.860> other<00:01:31.070> stuff<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:32.060> what<00:01:32.270> are<00:01:32.299> those

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
know that other stuff so what are those

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.139 
know that other stuff so what are those
and<00:01:33.009> how<00:01:34.009> do<00:01:34.070> they<00:01:34.189> affect<00:01:34.430> how<00:01:34.610> fast<00:01:34.909> your

volts<00:01:58.789> five<00:01:59.420> volts<00:01:59.719> is<00:01:59.840> great<00:02:00.049> that's<00:02:00.200> what

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
volts five volts is great that's what

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.740 
volts five volts is great that's what
comes<00:02:00.740> out<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.070> our<00:02:01.159> computers<00:02:01.759> through<00:02:02.659> the

when<00:02:05.479> we're<00:02:05.630> transferring<00:02:06.020> data<00:02:06.320> we<00:02:06.829> can

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
when we're transferring data we can

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.830 
when we're transferring data we can

laptop there all kinds of fun stuff but

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.690 
laptop there all kinds of fun stuff but
now<00:02:11.629> we<00:02:11.690> have<00:02:12.019> these<00:02:12.200> direct<00:02:12.650> plugs<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.489> plug

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
now we have these direct plugs that plug

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
now we have these direct plugs that plug
into<00:02:13.940> our<00:02:14.360> wall

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
into our wall

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.560 
into our wall
convert<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.650> power<00:02:15.830> from<00:02:16.310> AC<00:02:16.610> into<00:02:17.060> DC<00:02:17.090> like

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
convert the power from AC into DC like

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.660 
convert the power from AC into DC like
we've<00:02:17.750> been<00:02:17.900> talking<00:02:18.290> about<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.680> then<00:02:19.370> send

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
we've been talking about and then send

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.110 
we've been talking about and then send
it<00:02:19.730> across<00:02:19.930> again<00:02:20.930> at<00:02:21.170> five<00:02:21.740> volts<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.000> if

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
it across again at five volts so if

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.080 
it across again at five volts so if
everything's<00:02:23.510> five<00:02:24.080> volts<00:02:24.590> why<00:02:25.040> do<00:02:25.820> some

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
everything's five volts why do some

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.110 
everything's five volts why do some
charge<00:02:26.360> faster<00:02:26.810> than<00:02:27.290> others<00:02:27.880> that's<00:02:28.880> where

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
charge faster than others that's where

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.720 
charge faster than others that's where
resistance<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.140> amperage<00:02:31.070> come<00:02:31.310> into<00:02:31.520> play

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
resistance and amperage come into play

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.030 
resistance and amperage come into play
now<00:02:32.450> resistance<00:02:32.960> really<00:02:33.380> shouldn't<00:02:33.710> be<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.830> big

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
now resistance really shouldn't be a big

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.220 
now resistance really shouldn't be a big
deal<00:02:34.070> unless<00:02:34.490> you've<00:02:34.760> got<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:34.970> really<00:02:35.510> cheap

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
table or a cheap charger so it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.840 
table or a cheap charger so it
resistance<00:02:39.830> just<00:02:40.040> like<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.280> sounds<00:02:40.460> that's

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
resistance just like it sounds that's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.360

mind<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.820> that<00:03:46.989> charger<00:03:47.989> can<00:03:48.890> only<00:03:49.040> do<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:49.280> much

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
mind is that charger can only do so much

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.449 
mind is that charger can only do so much
so<00:03:50.720> let's<00:03:51.320> take<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.560> look<00:03:51.799> at<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.950> charger<00:03:52.340> and

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
so let's take a look at the charger and

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.590 
so let's take a look at the charger and
see<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.730> i'm<00:03:52.790> going<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:52.970> read<00:03:53.150> right<00:03:53.390> off<00:03:53.570> of

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
see and i'm going to read right off of

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.420 
see and i'm going to read right off of
this<00:03:53.840> there<00:03:54.110> are<00:03:54.200> two<00:03:54.380> different<00:03:54.739> sections<00:03:55.250> on

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
this there are two different sections on

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.400 
this there are two different sections on
this<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.760> one<00:03:55.910> happens<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.299> be<00:03:56.390> an<00:03:56.540> LG<00:03:56.959> travel

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
this this one happens to be an LG travel

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.949 
this this one happens to be an LG travel
charger<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.790> if<00:03:58.910> I<00:03:59.000> look<00:03:59.269> down<00:03:59.450> at<00:03:59.570> this<00:03:59.720> it

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
charger so if I look down at this it

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.050 
charger so if I look down at this it
says<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.570> 100<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.739> 240<00:04:03.739> volts<00:04:03.769> 50<00:04:04.730> to

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
says that it is a 100 to 240 volts 50 to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.990 
says that it is a 100 to 240 volts 50 to
60<00:04:05.540> Hertz<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.920> what<00:04:07.070> that<00:04:07.220> means<00:04:07.459> that's<00:04:07.790> the

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
60 Hertz and what that means that's the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.030 
60 Hertz and what that means that's the
alternating<00:04:08.540> current<00:04:08.840> I<00:04:09.019> can<00:04:09.470> plug<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:09.799> in

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
alternating current I can plug this in

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.039 
alternating current I can plug this in
anywhere<00:04:10.519> from<00:04:10.820> a<00:04:11.000> socket<00:04:11.420> that<00:04:11.600> outputs<00:04:11.930> a

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
anywhere from a socket that outputs a

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.930 
anywhere from a socket that outputs a
hundred<00:04:12.470> volts<00:04:12.799> all<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.130> way<00:04:13.220> up<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.340> 120

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
hundred volts all the way up to 120

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.110 
hundred volts all the way up to 120
volts<00:04:14.209> ac<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:16.130> covers<00:04:16.519> an<00:04:16.729> awful<00:04:17.000> lot<00:04:17.060> of

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
volts ac that covers an awful lot of

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.630 
volts ac that covers an awful lot of
people<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.690> as<00:04:18.350> long<00:04:18.530> as<00:04:18.739> your<00:04:19.010> outlet<00:04:19.459> has

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
people and as long as your outlet has

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.310 
people and as long as your outlet has
prongs<00:04:20.180> that<00:04:20.359> look<00:04:20.540> just<00:04:20.570> like<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:21.080> you're

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
prongs that look just like that you're

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.040 
prongs that look just like that you're
probably<00:04:21.470> safe<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:23.330> know<00:04:23.479> better<00:04:23.690> than<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:23.990> do

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
probably safe you know better than I do

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.450 
probably safe you know better than I do
in<00:04:24.380> your<00:04:24.560> country<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.099> there<00:04:25.220> are<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.310> lot<00:04:25.430> of

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
in your country and there are a lot of

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.920 
in your country and there are a lot of
countries<00:04:25.820> with<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:25.970> lot<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.210> standards<00:04:26.720> so

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
countries with a lot of standards so

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.730 
countries with a lot of standards so
don't<00:04:27.590> take<00:04:27.979> this<00:04:28.039> as

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
don't take this as

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.740 
don't take this as
we'll<00:04:28.979> just<00:04:29.190> keep<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:29.789> in<00:04:29.849> mind<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.330> next

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
we'll just keep that in mind the next

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.379 
we'll just keep that in mind the next
part<00:04:31.139> is<00:04:31.319> the<00:04:31.680> frequency<00:04:32.160> 50<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.819> 60<00:04:33.150> Hertz

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
part is the frequency 50 to 60 Hertz

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.150 
part is the frequency 50 to 60 Hertz
different<00:04:34.259> places<00:04:34.440> in<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.770> world<00:04:34.860> use

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
different places in the world use

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.589 
different places in the world use
different<00:04:35.520> frequencies<00:04:36.030> for<00:04:36.120> alternating

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
different frequencies for alternating

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.420 
different frequencies for alternating
current<00:04:36.990> that's<00:04:37.440> how<00:04:37.650> fast<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.130> current

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
current that's how fast the current

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.820 
current that's how fast the current
moves<00:04:38.610> back<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.090> forth<00:04:39.150> in<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.539> line<00:04:39.750> 50<00:04:40.710> to

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
moves back and forth in the line 50 to

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.370 
moves back and forth in the line 50 to
60<00:04:41.190> Hertz<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.509> charger<00:04:42.900> will<00:04:43.110> handle

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
60 Hertz so that charger will handle

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.140 
60 Hertz so that charger will handle
anything<00:04:43.680> in<00:04:43.979> that<00:04:44.220> range<00:04:44.490> which<00:04:44.759> is<00:04:44.940> good

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
anything in that range which is good

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.510 
anything in that range which is good
because<00:04:45.660> even<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.650> United<00:04:46.979> States<00:04:47.009> where

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
because even in the United States where

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.999 
because even in the United States where
we're<00:04:47.699> 60<00:04:48.090> Hertz<00:04:48.560> sometimes<00:04:49.560> we<00:04:49.710> get<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:49.860> bit

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
we're 60 Hertz sometimes we get a bit

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.969 
we're 60 Hertz sometimes we get a bit
less<00:04:50.220> than<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.490> after<00:04:51.449> 30<00:04:52.440> power<00:04:52.740> and

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
less than that after 30 power and

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.439 
less than that after 30 power and
whatnot<00:04:53.250> comes<00:04:53.460> through<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:53.849> it's<00:04:54.270> nice<00:04:54.419> to

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
whatnot comes through so it's nice to

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.240 
whatnot comes through so it's nice to
have<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.720> little<00:04:54.780> bit<00:04:55.050> of<00:04:55.080> wiggle<00:04:55.259> room<00:04:55.380> the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
have a little bit of wiggle room the

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.430 
have a little bit of wiggle room the
next<00:04:56.580> part<00:04:56.759> and<00:04:57.000> this<00:04:57.360> might<00:04:57.569> confuse<00:04:57.990> people

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
next part and this might confuse people

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.520 
next part and this might confuse people
it<00:04:59.220> says<00:04:59.849> right<00:04:59.880> here<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:00.630> is<00:05:01.400> 0.2<00:05:02.400> amps

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
it says right here that this is 0.2 amps

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.830 
it says right here that this is 0.2 amps
well<00:05:04.530> crap<00:05:05.039> that<00:05:05.880> doesn't<00:05:06.060> sound<00:05:06.419> like<00:05:06.569> a<00:05:06.599> lot

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
well crap that doesn't sound like a lot

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.760 
well crap that doesn't sound like a lot
0.2<00:05:07.800> that's<00:05:08.430> hardly<00:05:08.699> any<00:05:08.970> amps<00:05:09.539> I'd<00:05:10.409> throw

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
0.2 that's hardly any amps I'd throw

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.659 
0.2 that's hardly any amps I'd throw
that<00:05:10.979> out<00:05:11.009> right<00:05:11.599> no<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:12.900> here's<00:05:13.620> why<00:05:13.830> that's

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
that out right no and here's why that's

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.770 
that out right no and here's why that's
the<00:05:14.970> AC<00:05:15.150> side<00:05:15.720> of<00:05:15.930> things<00:05:16.169> so<00:05:16.650> it's<00:05:16.949> drawing

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
the AC side of things so it's drawing

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.290 
the AC side of things so it's drawing
0.2<00:05:18.780> amps<00:05:19.139> alternating<00:05:20.039> current<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:20.669> then

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
0.2 amps alternating current and then

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.700 
0.2 amps alternating current and then
it's<00:05:21.419> going<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.630> convert<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:22.169> into<00:05:22.319> direct

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
it's going to convert it into direct

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.070 
it's going to convert it into direct
current<00:05:23.099> so<00:05:23.220> let's<00:05:23.759> see<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.300> next<00:05:24.330> line<00:05:24.810> down

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
current so let's see the next line down

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.770 
current so let's see the next line down
what<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.710> direct<00:05:25.949> current<00:05:26.280> does<00:05:26.780> reading

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
what the direct current does reading

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.480 
what the direct current does reading
here<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.080> says<00:05:28.229> output<00:05:28.979> is<00:05:29.180> 5<00:05:30.180> volts<00:05:31.039> 5<00:05:32.039> volts

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
here it says output is 5 volts 5 volts

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.129 
here it says output is 5 volts 5 volts
direct<00:05:33.150> current<00:05:33.599> that's<00:05:33.930> good<00:05:34.259> at<00:05:35.930> 0.85<00:05:36.930> amps

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
direct current that's good at 0.85 amps

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.610 
direct current that's good at 0.85 amps
0.85<00:05:40.139> so<00:05:40.620> not<00:05:41.070> quite<00:05:41.280> 1<00:05:41.669> amp<00:05:41.940> that's<00:05:42.750> just<00:05:43.289> fine

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620
