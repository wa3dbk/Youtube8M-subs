00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 in the eyes and compass and welcome another 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.560
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.380
 title new information on holdups 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.300
 to banks of big cars 5 online ok 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.040
 let's start with this video today 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.839
 a little while ago I had brought you a video in 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 which told them about some things but 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.170
 found more information which is 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.289
 perfect so let's go 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.210
 mentioning the user recently 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.760
 the well-known former mouse that has filtered 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.670
 some things he was the one in his 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.590
 times out and days before 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.899
 Christmas he had said it was what 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.940
 was going to come in the Christmas dlc and he 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.860
 He also assured that with all of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 Christmas as a Christmas gift and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.910
 compensation to users were not going to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 give bank robberies but 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.039
 recently in his bonus he told us 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.180
 they were insured but to the last 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.770
 hour on December 23 rockstargames 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.420
 he simply moved the dates and the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.350
 dates that used to say December 23 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.690
 they have changed them in 1999 what does it mean 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.760
 This is because I do not know, but more or less 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.120
 is what tells us that it is just put 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.240
 well but 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.100
 even if he has done what he has done 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.170
 he just knew everything that is going to 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.910
 come in the dlc he said that the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.250
 snow and many more things and also 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.440
 had secured the date as a little 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.060
 but good and without looking so much in this 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.130
 let's continue with what really 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.110
 we are interested as they have been revealed 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.480
 some new codes which to 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.030
 Then you can see them in 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.010
 screen as you see it says here 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.590
 they are just starting the codes to 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.770
 come out and as they see us we get the first 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.380
 that says jane green because if the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.380
 alcohol bank that we are going to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.330
 performing the robbery is totally 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.690
 remodeled we could not say it's 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.060
 processed and it says this type of calls 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.370
 native to the game it seems that the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.200
 Interior files required for 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.760
 a robbery mission to banks located 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.680
 near by rock hill if 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.540
 totally remodeled as you will know 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.210
 currently if they enter with a click or 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.710
 any little thing to bank robberies 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.840
 you may notice that when they enter 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.400
 basically the textures have nothing 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.470
 in fact there are places where yes 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.880
 you shoot there is not an action or anything 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.420
 like that then I think it's 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.000
 refer 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.830
 nothing this and the bank that is in 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.810
 rock by giles is the one that is 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.180
 right next to the cinema in the northern part 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.330
 of the saints that with pretty almost almost 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.670
 with the part to go out into the desert not 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.060
 we could say and right after it does not come out 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.190
 client if context and says more or 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.860
 less accessible this native checks 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.510
 is the customer or has synchronized the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.330
 play with others for example if a 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.849
 car if it is destroyed or if the action of the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.760
 client to see is you can only 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.830
 create a blind eye situation that 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.200
 it could be a function known as 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.810
 so the blind eye just after 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.630
 we should see one that is free ok 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.910
 grindr point that says more or less easy 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.670
 those native calls for the next 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.269
 point of rendering that are used 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.730
 for the guide that would be like this 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.910
 thing of the computer or the system 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.569
 of the brain of the console on which 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.400
 let's play and say give in during a mission 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.980
 from a bank robbery this I did not understand 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.930
 very good but I guess it will be the point 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.689
 rendering what 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.730
 our character is quite strange 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.370
 now he did not have enough and just 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.769
 after we found and jet contact in a 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.659
 blair that would be the jet contact that 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.730
 will be active then as they see it 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.560
 had already leaked just before this 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.599
 video had told them who was the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.040
 iev that was maybe the character which 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.980
 he was going to assure us of bank robberies 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.540
 and this one was going to have some skills 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.969
 specials that were going to be enabled 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.519
 in the contact list when you do not 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.769
 he calls this person not fair 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.099
 then we see what nec vision in speak 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.230
 that basically is the night view what 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.290
 which will be perfect and right after 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.269
 we see that active 6 apartment that would be 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.159
 as the planning board of the 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.560
 bank robberies depending on the 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.599
 robbery development that would be fine 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.639
 planned just in the apartment and 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.859
 where would you say how much you are going to earn each 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.760
 player and many more things than maybe 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.530
 we could be together yesterday the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.229
 character that maybe he can organize 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.479
 bank robberies there are many things in 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.680
 this forum of facts from the description will 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.449
 I'm going to leave them in case one of you 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.480
 wants to read the other ways 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.790
 I will have taken some letters 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.350
 but I know there are people who will not be enough 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.390
 just to see the catches there are people who 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.310
 you want to see completely you tell me 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.470
 What do you think of all this? I see that each 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.210
 the time is getting much closer 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.800
 robberies to the banks and the truth that is 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.870
 something that I quite hope not because they are 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.820
 promised for a long time and 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.310
 I think that they will arrive with the 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.640
 computer generation just after 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.320
 we are seeing other other codes by 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.510
 say it some way but basically 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.300
 they are some little things more not as they see it 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.700
 says case planning that it would be like 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.340
 planned from bank robberies then 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.950
 we see with printer what the function would be 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.990
 to use the printer you 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.490
 we see many more things from planning 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.610
 perhaps you can be carried through 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.040
 of the phone to select people 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.800
 of breeding one no longer just your friends 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.410
 put then we see another one that says the 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.360
 planning menu are basically 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.970
 textures and here comes something interesting 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.880
 like below this textures says 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.560
 ruth and is the application that we have in 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.600
 mobile phones and it seems that 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.610
 We can also send messages from 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.750
 email related to 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.120
 robberies 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.950
 virtually from the application the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.410
 You can send a friend from your 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.970
 iphone to your friend that simply 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.920
 is connected to the servers of 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.620
 big auto online and just after 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.050
 we see another one that tells us of flower course is 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.690
 most effective I did this is a function 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.820
 again to feel the rumble of the 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.550
 ground as something explodes in the mission 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.590
 also to see a hole or break 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.960
 violent on the ground let us suppose that 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.460
 you grab a grenade and throw it if 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.170
 now we are going to see how the 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.540
 mink or something that the truth is going to give 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.860
 great realism but I do not know if it only 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.110
 find in robbery missions to 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.290
 banks and you can only do this 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.210
 well where we throw the grenade in 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.090
 the bank can not be that in the city 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.980
 nothing happens but right after we see 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.710
 one that does not say blood building that says 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.050
 It is the function of new function and good 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.510
 they're kind of weird they are to see water 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.880
 when a central pipeline burst 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.750
 water or something similar would also mean 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.130
 a building that can be flooded 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.720
 absolutely all of water not which 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.220
 it would be perfect so we throw these 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.200
 they are the codes that I wanted to teach them 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.590
 you tell me what you think of this I know 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.270
 How are you 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.010
 they have explained a little bit wrong but 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.900
 until now it can be what there is not 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.720
 there are many there are not many things that we 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.250
 they are explaining perfectly but of 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.750
 all forms in the description are the 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.540
 I'm going to leave any of you 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.220
 he wants to read it with more tranquility 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.600
 I do not hope you like this video 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.920
 forget to leave your light favorites 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.450
 subscribe to the channel if they are not 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.550
 subscribed in the inscription is that my 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.170
 twitter to follow me and share 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.000
 this video so that more people see it 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:06.820
 I hope you liked it and without more 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.820
 say goodbye goodbye
