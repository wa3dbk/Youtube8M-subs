00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it's got its strengths and its

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
it's got its strengths and its
weaknesses<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.920> well<00:00:53.180> one<00:00:54.180> thing<00:00:54.360> that's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
weaknesses as well one thing that's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.819 
weaknesses as well one thing that's
really<00:00:54.660> strong<00:00:54.930> about<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.199> guys<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.680> town

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
really strong about it guys is your town

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
really strong about it guys is your town
hall<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.550> touched<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.390> know

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
hall is not going to be touched you know

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.049 
hall is not going to be touched you know
I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.289> only<00:00:58.379> weaknesses<00:00:58.949> base<00:00:59.520> has<00:00:59.760> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I think the only weaknesses base has is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.290 
I think the only weaknesses base has is
a<00:01:00.120> air<00:01:00.770> defence<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.070> somebody<00:01:02.699> taxing<00:01:03.149> from

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a air defence if somebody taxing from

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
a air defence if somebody taxing from
the<00:01:03.390> top<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.680> her<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.189> my<00:01:05.519> air

bombs<00:01:06.060> over<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:07.380> seeking<00:01:08.070> air<00:01:08.220> mines

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.030 
bombs over here and my seeking air mines
up<00:01:08.700> top<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:10.020> air<00:01:10.439> defenses<00:01:10.890> are

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
up top but down here my air defenses are

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
up top but down here my air defenses are
on<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.340> line<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.150> anything<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.659> attacks<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
these Tesla's here's to where if they

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
these Tesla's here's to where if they
attack<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> top<00:01:45.060> though<00:01:45.689> head<00:01:45.899> towards

guys<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.540> did<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.810> find<00:01:49.020> these<00:01:49.140> bases<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.680> I'm

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
guys I did not find these bases so I'm

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.020 
guys I did not find these bases so I'm
not<00:01:49.890> claiming<00:01:50.040> i<00:01:50.250> found<00:01:50.430> these<00:01:50.520> spaces<00:01:50.729> these

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
not claiming i found these spaces these

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.609 
not claiming i found these spaces these
are<00:01:51.149> high-level<00:01:51.299> basis<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.020> I've<00:01:52.140> seen<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
are high-level basis that I've seen and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.460 
are high-level basis that I've seen and
that<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> fact<00:01:53.640> work<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that I know for a fact work so if you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.840 
that I know for a fact work so if you
guys<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> level<00:01:56.219> 10<00:01:56.369> i<00:01:56.399> definitely

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
guys are down to level 10 i definitely

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.899 
guys are down to level 10 i definitely
recommend<00:01:56.909> trying<00:01:57.329> out<00:01:57.540> these<00:01:57.689> bases<00:01:58.909> but

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
recommend trying out these bases but

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.340 
recommend trying out these bases but
yeah<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> base<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.479> really<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.020> strong

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
yeah this base is really really strong

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
yeah this base is really really strong
you<00:02:01.920> will<00:02:02.130> however<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.700> weakness<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
you will however the weakness of this

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
you will however the weakness of this
base<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.619> start<00:02:04.920> pretty

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
base is you can get one start pretty

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.889 
base is you can get one start pretty
easily<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:06.000> got<00:02:06.180> about<00:02:06.299> forty<00:02:06.719> five<00:02:06.750> percent

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
easily you got about forty five percent

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.809 
easily you got about forty five percent
of<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.439> base<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> outside<00:02:08.459> so

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
of your base here on the outside so

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.059 
of your base here on the outside so
anybody<00:02:09.450> who<00:02:09.720> attacks<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
anybody who attacks you can get the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.470 
anybody who attacks you can get the
forty<00:02:11.280> five<00:02:11.430> percent<00:02:11.459> would<00:02:12.120> say<00:02:12.300> just

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
forty five percent would say just

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.110 
forty five percent would say just
archers

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
archers

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.160 
archers
however<00:02:13.480> they're<00:02:13.659> still<00:02:13.810> going<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.989> have<00:02:14.049> some

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
however they're still going to have some

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.920 
however they're still going to have some
trouble<00:02:14.349> if<00:02:14.650> your<00:02:15.069> mortars<00:02:15.340> can<00:02:15.519> reach<00:02:15.670> them

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
trouble if your mortars can reach them

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.059 
trouble if your mortars can reach them
and<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:17.140> exposé<00:02:17.500> going<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.769> be<00:02:17.830> able<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
and your exposé going to be able to

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.949 
and your exposé going to be able to
pretty<00:02:18.220> much<00:02:18.340> attack<00:02:18.940> anything<00:02:19.209> at<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> top<00:02:19.629> I

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
pretty much attack anything at the top I

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.380 
pretty much attack anything at the top I
expose<00:02:20.769> our<00:02:20.920> out<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.099> reach<00:02:21.220> here<00:02:21.549> but<00:02:22.330> if

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
expose our out of reach here but if

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.869 
expose our out of reach here but if
someone<00:02:22.540> put<00:02:22.870> some<00:02:23.049> archers<00:02:23.409> down<00:02:23.620> here

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
someone put some archers down here

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.369 
someone put some archers down here
they'll<00:02:24.879> be<00:02:24.970> able<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.269> get<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.599> with<00:02:25.870> only<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
they'll be able to get it with only the

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.140 
they'll be able to get it with only the
mortars<00:02:26.680> getting<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.010> their<00:02:27.129> way<00:02:27.159> so<00:02:27.280> somebody

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
mortars getting in their way so somebody

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.550 
mortars getting in their way so somebody
could<00:02:28.269> drop<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> lightning<00:02:28.900> spell<00:02:29.170> on<00:02:29.409> these

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
could drop a lightning spell on these

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.589 
could drop a lightning spell on these
mortars<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.129> get<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.940> one<00:02:31.060> star<00:02:31.329> on<00:02:31.360> you

however you're only going to get one

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.110 
however you're only going to get one
start<00:02:33.069> which<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.340> better<00:02:33.489> than<00:02:33.700> getting<00:02:33.970> to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
start which is better than getting to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.149 
start which is better than getting to
start<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.629> strong<00:02:35.319> trophy<00:02:35.680> base<00:02:35.860> if<00:02:36.040> you're

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
start so strong trophy base if you're

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.649

just looking to get one start Town Hall
will<00:02:37.989> not<00:02:38.140> be<00:02:38.319> touched<00:02:38.560> with<00:02:38.829> this<00:02:39.010> base<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.879> if

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
will not be touched with this base so if

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.490 
will not be touched with this base so if
you<00:02:40.180> guys<00:02:40.299> aren't<00:02:40.510> champions<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.049> recommend

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
you guys aren't champions I recommend

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.530 
you guys aren't champions I recommend
trying<00:02:41.680> out<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.010> base<00:02:42.250> let's<00:02:43.030> move<00:02:43.180> on<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.390> a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
trying out this base let's move on to a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.910 
trying out this base let's move on to a
base<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.200> think<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> little<00:02:44.680> bit

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
base that I think is a little bit

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.500 
base that I think is a little bit
stronger<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.549> I'll<00:02:45.670> show<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:45.879> guys<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.120> in

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
stronger and I'll show you guys that in

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.319 
stronger and I'll show you guys that in
the<00:02:46.569> next<00:02:46.720> clip<00:02:47.670> alright<00:02:48.670> guys<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.030> here<00:02:49.209> we

are<00:02:49.450> with<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.660> second<00:02:49.989> base<00:02:50.109> now<00:02:50.379> I<00:02:50.410> like<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
are with the second base now I like to

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.619 
are with the second base now I like to
call<00:02:50.859> this<00:02:51.010> base<00:02:51.220> my<00:02:51.400> little<00:02:51.640> scarab<00:02:52.030> base<00:02:52.180> or

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
call this base my little scarab base or

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
look at these rows and it's got this

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.680 
look at these rows and it's got this
little<00:03:00.190> leg<00:03:00.519> corners<00:03:00.909> over<00:03:01.030> here<00:03:01.329> but<00:03:01.540> this

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
little leg corners over here but this

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.170 
little leg corners over here but this
base<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:01.930> actually<00:03:02.440> really<00:03:02.680> really<00:03:02.980> good<00:03:03.180> what

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
base is actually really really good what

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.220 
base is actually really really good what
it<00:03:04.269> does<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.599> kind<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.989> southern

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
it does is kind of like a southern

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.380 
it does is kind of like a southern
teaser<00:03:05.650> base<00:03:05.920> where<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.640> draws<00:03:06.940> people<00:03:07.269> into

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
teaser base where it draws people into

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.640 
teaser base where it draws people into
attack<00:03:07.690> from<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.959> bottom<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.349> they<00:03:08.440> think

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
attack from the bottom and they think

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.020 
attack from the bottom and they think
they're<00:03:08.769> going<00:03:08.859> to<00:03:08.920> do<00:03:09.129> so<00:03:09.400> well<00:03:09.430> because<00:03:09.790> it's

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
they're going to do so well because it's

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.360 
they're going to do so well because it's
more<00:03:10.180> open<00:03:10.599> but<00:03:11.140> in<00:03:11.409> reality<00:03:11.950> when<00:03:12.280> they

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
more open but in reality when they

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.039 
more open but in reality when they
attack<00:03:12.640> here<00:03:12.879> they're<00:03:13.030> going<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.209> get<00:03:13.599> met<00:03:13.870> by

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
attack here they're going to get met by

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.229 
attack here they're going to get met by
some<00:03:14.379> gold<00:03:14.650> storages<00:03:15.099> with<00:03:15.280> 2,000<00:03:15.790> hit<00:03:15.909> points

with 3400 hit points and they're just

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.420 
with 3400 hit points and they're just
gonna<00:03:23.349> have<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.560> rough<00:03:23.769> time<00:03:23.829> getting<00:03:24.010> through

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
gonna have a rough time getting through

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.220 
gonna have a rough time getting through
it<00:03:24.579> while<00:03:25.030> my<00:03:25.209> cannons<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.780> expose<00:03:26.200> just

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
it while my cannons and expose just

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.420 
it while my cannons and expose just
ripped<00:03:26.680> through<00:03:26.829> anything<00:03:27.069> that<00:03:27.310> gets

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
ripped through anything that gets

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.400 
ripped through anything that gets
through<00:03:27.639> there<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.750> got<00:03:29.049> some<00:03:29.230> extra

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
through there and I got some extra

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.349 
through there and I got some extra
cannons<00:03:29.859> down<00:03:29.980> here<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:30.609> it's<00:03:30.790> just<00:03:30.970> made<00:03:31.120> to

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
cannons down here but it's just made to

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.210 
cannons down here but it's just made to
make<00:03:31.959> people<00:03:32.109> want<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.379> attack<00:03:32.620> down<00:03:32.799> here<00:03:33.010> and

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
make people want to attack down here and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.250 
make people want to attack down here and
what<00:03:33.910> they<00:03:34.030> realize<00:03:34.389> is<00:03:34.599> once<00:03:34.780> they<00:03:34.930> get<00:03:35.079> here

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
what they realize is once they get here

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.080 
what they realize is once they get here
they're<00:03:35.379> going<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.620> follow<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:36.090> defense's

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
they're going to follow the defense's

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.520 
they're going to follow the defense's
again<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.599> then<00:03:38.079> they're<00:03:38.200> going<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.379> head

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
again and then they're going to head

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.500 
again and then they're going to head
towards<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.859> cannon<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.489> then<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.269> hidden

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
towards the cannon and then the hidden

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.509 
towards the cannon and then the hidden
Tesla<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.440> air<00:03:41.680> defense<00:03:42.040> instead<00:03:42.400> of

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
Tesla and the air defense instead of

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.569 
Tesla and the air defense instead of
going<00:03:42.730> straight<00:03:42.790> through<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.049> town<00:03:44.349> hall

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
going straight through to the town hall

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.339 
going straight through to the town hall
so<00:03:45.579> it's<00:03:45.699> just<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:46.030> bad<00:03:46.329> time<00:03:46.599> for<00:03:46.629> any<00:03:47.049> troops

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
so it's just a bad time for any troops

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.500 
so it's just a bad time for any troops
that<00:03:47.620> want<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:48.040> attack<00:03:48.459> from<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.790> ground<00:03:49.030> as

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
that want to attack from the ground as

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.360 
that want to attack from the ground as
far<00:03:49.810> as<00:03:49.930> air<00:03:50.139> defense<00:03:50.440> goes<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.040> base<00:03:51.190> has

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
far as air defense goes this base has

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.339 
far as air defense goes this base has
really<00:03:51.609> good<00:03:51.730> air<00:03:51.910> defense<00:03:52.209> pretty<00:03:53.049> much<00:03:53.199> all

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
really good air defense pretty much all

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.930 
really good air defense pretty much all
around<00:03:53.650> except<00:03:54.190> down<00:03:54.519> here<00:03:54.730> on<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:54.849> bottom

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
around except down here on the bottom

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.569 
around except down here on the bottom
but<00:03:55.329> that's<00:03:55.480> why<00:03:55.599> we<00:03:55.750> got<00:03:55.870> our<00:03:56.079> expose<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.859> our

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
but that's why we got our expose and our

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.360 
but that's why we got our expose and our
in<00:03:57.940> front<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.239> towers<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:59.500> place<00:03:59.889> most<00:04:00.220> of

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
in front of towers and I place most of

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.789 
in front of towers and I place most of
my<00:04:00.489> air<00:04:00.669> traps<00:04:00.970> down<00:04:01.150> here<00:04:01.419> at<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.569> bottom

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
my air traps down here at the bottom

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.020 
my air traps down here at the bottom
puts<00:04:02.799> them<00:04:02.919> at<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.160> top<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.370> course<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
puts them at the top of course and

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.939 
puts them at the top of course and
anything<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.840> attacks<00:04:05.199> on<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.410> top<00:04:05.590> guys<00:04:05.799> is

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
anything that attacks on the top guys is

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.979 
anything that attacks on the top guys is
just<00:04:06.129> going<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.280> go<00:04:06.459> around<00:04:07.000> again<00:04:07.389> it's<00:04:07.840> going

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
just going to go around again it's going

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.300 
just going to go around again it's going
to<00:04:08.019> head<00:04:08.139> towards<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.470> archer<00:04:08.859> tower<00:04:09.069> than
