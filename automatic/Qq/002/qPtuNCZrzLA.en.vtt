running<00:04:37.199> around<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.949> military<00:04:38.460> finds

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
running around and the military finds

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.370 
running around and the military finds
you<00:04:39.060> your<00:04:39.240> code<00:04:39.419> name<00:04:39.570> is<00:04:39.750> Zeus<00:04:40.020> because

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
you your code name is Zeus because

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.080 
you your code name is Zeus because
you're<00:04:40.530> originally<00:04:40.979> a<00:04:41.009> military<00:04:41.460> project<00:04:41.970> and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
you're originally a military project and

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.790 
you're originally a military project and
then<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.930> end<00:04:43.020> up<00:04:43.139> with<00:04:43.199> all<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.380> superpower

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
then you end up with all the superpower

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.870 
then you end up with all the superpower
so<00:04:44.009> obviously<00:04:44.250> they're<00:04:44.370> not<00:04:44.400> very<00:04:44.639> happy

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
so obviously they're not very happy

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.969 
so obviously they're not very happy
about<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.150> so<00:04:45.840> they<00:04:46.020> try<00:04:46.259> to<00:04:46.320> send<00:04:46.620> out<00:04:46.710> teams

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
about that so they try to send out teams

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.230 
about that so they try to send out teams
that<00:04:47.310> try<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.580> kill<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:47.909> these<00:04:48.030> are<00:04:48.180> the

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
that try and kill you and these are the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.670 
that try and kill you and these are the
strike<00:04:48.479> teams<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:48.930> either<00:04:49.020> have<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.380> evade

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
strike teams so you either have to evade

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.189 
strike teams so you either have to evade
those<00:04:49.979> or<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.280> have<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.490> kill<00:04:50.729> them<00:04:50.820> so<00:04:51.570> to

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
those or you have to kill them so to

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.540 
those or you have to kill them so to
kill<00:04:52.380> them<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.650> know<00:04:52.740> obviously<00:04:52.889> you<00:04:53.250> just<00:04:53.430> go

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
kill them you know obviously you just go

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.040 
kill them you know obviously you just go
and<00:04:53.699> use<00:04:53.849> all<00:04:54.000> your<00:04:54.090> superpowers<00:04:54.630> take<00:04:54.870> time

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
and use all your superpowers take time

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.960 
and use all your superpowers take time
and<00:04:55.080> helicopters<00:04:55.710> or<00:04:55.860> hijack<00:04:56.280> them<00:04:56.520> or<00:04:56.669> hijack

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
and helicopters or hijack them or hijack

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.640 
and helicopters or hijack them or hijack
a<00:04:57.000> tank<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.509> then<00:04:57.570> kill<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.870> helicopters<00:04:58.409> or

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
a tank and then kill the helicopters or

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.830 
a tank and then kill the helicopters or
what<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.340> can<00:04:59.490> do<00:04:59.610> is<00:04:59.880> you<00:05:00.060> can<00:05:00.090> fly<00:05:00.570> because

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
what you can do is you can fly because

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.330 
what you can do is you can fly because
you<00:05:00.960> can<00:05:01.080> run<00:05:01.289> super<00:05:01.470> fast<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.949> you<00:05:02.070> can<00:05:02.220> use

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
you can run super fast and you can use

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.370 
you can run super fast and you can use
like<00:05:02.490> you're<00:05:02.610> gliding<00:05:02.820> powers<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.080> can

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
like you're gliding powers so you can

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.810 
like you're gliding powers so you can
either<00:05:04.470> run<00:05:04.740> or<00:05:04.800> glide<00:05:05.159> to<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:05.460> place<00:05:05.669> where

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
either run or glide to a place where

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.279 
either run or glide to a place where
they<00:05:05.909> can't<00:05:06.150> see<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:06.720> then<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.080> can

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
they can't see you and then you can

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.320 
they can't see you and then you can
disguise<00:05:07.949> yourself<00:05:08.430> is<00:05:08.639> all<00:05:08.940> these<00:05:09.180> people

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
disguise yourself is all these people

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.779 
disguise yourself is all these people
that<00:05:09.449> you<00:05:09.539> consume<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:10.289> actually<00:05:10.979> have<00:05:11.280> every

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
that you consume you actually have every

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.430 
that you consume you actually have every
single<00:05:12.090> one<00:05:12.210> of<00:05:12.240> them<00:05:12.479> inside<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.139> so<00:05:13.320> what

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
single one of them inside you so what

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.439 
single one of them inside you so what
you<00:05:13.590> do<00:05:13.740> is<00:05:13.949> once<00:05:14.610> there<00:05:14.849> you're<00:05:15.030> out<00:05:15.060> of<00:05:15.210> sight

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
you do is once there you're out of sight

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.270 
you do is once there you're out of sight

or whatever you just go to your disguise

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.370 
or whatever you just go to your disguise
menu<00:05:17.759> and<00:05:17.970> you<00:05:18.060> just<00:05:18.330> pick<00:05:18.539> the<00:05:18.690> last<00:05:18.900> person

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
menu and you just pick the last person

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.660 
menu and you just pick the last person
that<00:05:19.469> you<00:05:19.620> consumed<00:05:20.099> and<00:05:20.430> then

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
that you consumed and then

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.130 
that you consumed and then
you'll<00:05:20.910> just<00:05:21.090> look<00:05:21.180> like<00:05:21.240> an<00:05:21.480> average<00:05:21.750> citizen

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
you'll just look like an average citizen

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.060 
you'll just look like an average citizen
that<00:05:22.230> was<00:05:22.350> walking<00:05:22.680> down<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.800> street<00:05:23.040> a

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
that was walking down the street a

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.070 
that was walking down the street a

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
something called EP EP is evolutionary

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.710 
something called EP EP is evolutionary
points<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.010> with<00:05:32.790> those<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.180> can<00:05:33.330> unlock<00:05:33.690> new

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
points and with those you can unlock new

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.960 
points and with those you can unlock new
powers<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:34.860> stuff<00:05:35.010> such<00:05:35.250> as<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.640> big<00:05:35.820> ass

throw people around like the piledriver

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.030 
throw people around like the piledriver
we<00:05:42.480> did<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.750> very<00:05:42.960> beginning<00:05:43.380> of<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.680> video

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
we did the very beginning of the video

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.690 
we did the very beginning of the video
and<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:46.020> just<00:05:46.230> adds<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.710> whole<00:05:46.740> new<00:05:47.040> point<00:05:47.490> of

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
and it just adds a whole new point of

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.980 
and it just adds a whole new point of
the<00:05:47.760> game<00:05:47.790> so<00:05:48.060> you're<00:05:48.150> not<00:05:48.270> just<00:05:48.330> stuck<00:05:48.960> with
