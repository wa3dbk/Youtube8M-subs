that<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:04.980> actually<00:01:05.129> double<00:01:05.489> stuff<00:01:05.640> cause<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that was actually double stuff cause I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.970 
that was actually double stuff cause I
was<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.870> with<00:01:07.050> a<00:01:07.080> dick<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.800> other

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
was one with a dick and the other

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.810 
was one with a dick and the other
with<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.160> finger<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> lot<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.080> guys

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
with a finger but I see a lot of guys

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.320 
with a finger but I see a lot of guys
described<00:01:13.070> hitting<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> pic<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.729> both<00:01:15.120> nose

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
described hitting the pic with both nose

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.040 
described hitting the pic with both nose
with<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> pic<00:01:18.800> as<00:01:19.800> a<00:01:19.890> double<00:01:20.340> stop<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:21.270> guess

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
with a pic as a double stop I guess

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.450 
with a pic as a double stop I guess
technically<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.860> double<00:01:23.100> stop<00:01:23.280> that's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
technically that's a double stop that's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.930 
technically that's a double stop that's
now<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.820> call<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> double<00:01:24.420> stop<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.820> mean<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
now what I call a double stop I mean to

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.230 
now what I call a double stop I mean to
me<00:01:27.060> they're<00:01:27.240> milliseconds<00:01:27.900> apart<00:01:28.820> which<00:01:29.820> in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
me they're milliseconds apart which in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.790 
me they're milliseconds apart which in
my<00:01:30.360> mind<00:01:30.390> makes<00:01:30.660> them<00:01:30.930> an<00:01:31.050> interval<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
my mind makes them an interval right I

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.410 
my mind makes them an interval right I
would<00:01:32.100> consider<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.520> an<00:01:32.820> interval<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.300> know

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
would consider that an interval you know

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.260 
would consider that an interval you know
one<00:01:33.690> two<00:01:34.560> three<00:01:36.710> five<00:01:38.210> two<00:01:39.210> oh<00:01:39.240> four<00:01:39.540> whatever

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
one two three five two oh four whatever

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.010 
one two three five two oh four whatever
so<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:43.740> say<00:01:43.890> technically<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> guess<00:01:44.430> that's

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
so like say technically I guess that's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.170 
so like say technically I guess that's
that's<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.200> double<00:01:46.500> stop<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.729> me<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> country

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that's a double stop to me a country

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
that's a double stop to me a country
double<00:01:48.479> stop<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.869> playing<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> same

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
double stop is playing about at the same

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.240 
double stop is playing about at the same
time<00:01:50.100> using<00:01:50.910> these<00:01:51.030> two<00:01:51.300> fingers<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:52.250> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
time using these two fingers here that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730 
time using these two fingers here that
riff<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.880> play<00:01:54.140> off<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.350> Brooks<00:01:55.560> &amp;<00:01:55.710> Dunn

double stops stops nobody knows up there
but<00:02:22.470> more<00:02:22.590> double<00:02:22.860> stops<00:02:23.069> here

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.050 

going<00:02:30.640> back<00:02:30.849> into<00:02:31.090> double<00:02:31.450> stops<00:02:31.690> again

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.729

right there to show you what double

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.569 
right there to show you what double

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
stops were this a little more advanced

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.830 
stops were this a little more advanced
so<00:03:02.640> I'll<00:03:03.640> try<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.879> get<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.120> cab<00:03:04.359> dat<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.720> put

so I'll try to get that cab dat and put

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.410 
so I'll try to get that cab dat and put
here<00:03:04.989> on<00:03:05.049> this<00:03:05.230> page<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.420> that's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
here on this page so you can that's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.860 
here on this page so you can that's
pretty<00:03:07.690> advanced<00:03:08.079> exercise<00:03:08.560> there<00:03:09.870> yeah

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
pretty advanced exercise there yeah

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.149 
pretty advanced exercise there yeah
let's<00:03:11.079> just<00:03:11.230> load<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.470> with<00:03:11.890> double<00:03:12.250> stops<00:03:14.159> see

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
let's just load it with double stops see

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.890 
let's just load it with double stops see
off<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.519> top<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:15.819> my<00:03:15.879> head<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.180> should<00:03:16.420> have

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
off the top of my head I should have

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.059 
off the top of my head I should have
thought<00:03:16.989> of<00:03:17.109> this<00:03:17.170> before<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.530> started<00:03:17.890> rolling

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
thought of this before I started rolling

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.509 
thought of this before I started rolling
the<00:03:18.609> film<00:03:19.180> here<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:21.810> guess<00:03:22.810> an<00:03:23.470> exercise<00:03:24.069> in

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
the film here I guess an exercise in

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.750 
the film here I guess an exercise in
double<00:03:24.909> stops<00:03:25.180> could<00:03:25.780> be<00:03:26.079> let's<00:03:27.069> see<00:03:27.280> let's<00:03:27.640> do

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
double stops could be let's see let's do

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.210 
double stops could be let's see let's do
that<00:03:27.970> escale<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:29.530> know<00:03:29.650> it's<00:03:29.799> just<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:30.040> major

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
that escale you know it's just a major

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.190 
that escale you know it's just a major
scale<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:34.569> neck<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:36.549> I'm<00:03:36.700> going<00:03:37.030> to

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
scale the neck and I'm going to

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.099 
scale the neck and I'm going to
alternate<00:03:39.359> open<00:03:40.359> he<00:03:40.569> I'm<00:03:40.750> going<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.959> throw

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
alternate open he I'm going to throw

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.839 
alternate open he I'm going to throw
knee<00:03:41.169> opening<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.739> top<00:03:41.889> and<00:03:42.160> then<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.430> then

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
knee opening on top and then and then

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.849 
knee opening on top and then and then
hit<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.060> with<00:03:43.180> these<00:03:43.660> two<00:03:43.870> fingers<00:03:44.109> so<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:44.650> you

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
hit it with these two fingers so if you

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:58.530 
hit it with these two fingers so if you
know<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.099> flat<00:03:45.310> peckers<00:03:45.669> there<00:03:45.879> you<00:03:46.450> can

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.970 

you<00:03:59.540> wouldn't<00:03:59.780> use<00:03:59.870> that<00:03:59.900> money<00:04:00.290> in<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.560> song<00:04:00.800> in

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
you wouldn't use that money in a song in

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.270 
you wouldn't use that money in a song in
context<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.840> an<00:04:02.990> exercise<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.590> get

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
context but this is an exercise to get

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.460 
context but this is an exercise to get
you<00:04:04.580> using<00:04:05.420> those<00:04:05.570> two<00:04:05.720> fingers<00:04:05.930> that's<00:04:06.260> good

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
you using those two fingers that's good

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.990 
you using those two fingers that's good
little<00:04:06.680> stress<00:04:06.950> they're<00:04:07.220> alternating

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
little stress they're alternating

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.660 
little stress they're alternating
between<00:04:08.330> those<00:04:08.660> fingers<00:04:09.430> that's<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.550> good

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
between those fingers that's a good

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.650 
between those fingers that's a good
stretch<00:04:10.940> for<00:04:10.970> flat<00:04:11.660> Pickers<00:04:12.970> or<00:04:13.970> it'd<00:04:14.060> be<00:04:14.120> more

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
stretch for flat Pickers or it'd be more

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.490 
stretch for flat Pickers or it'd be more
to<00:04:15.170> go<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:16.810> top<00:04:17.810> stringing<00:04:18.290> in<00:04:18.410> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
to go that the top stringing in the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.849 
to go that the top stringing in the
second<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.130> third<00:04:20.290> let's<00:04:21.290> see<00:04:21.470> can<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.769> think

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
second and third let's see can I think

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:29.230 
second and third let's see can I think
of<00:04:22.070> an<00:04:22.190> exercise<00:04:22.610> doing<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:27.820> no<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:29.060> really

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
of an exercise doing that no I really

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.480 
of an exercise doing that no I really
can't<00:04:29.510> not<00:04:30.350> at<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.560> top<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.830> my<00:04:30.919> head<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.310> give

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
can't not at the top of my head and give

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
can't not at the top of my head and give
me<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.640> couple<00:04:31.820> minutes<00:04:31.940> I'll<00:04:32.150> come<00:04:32.360> up<00:04:32.480> with

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
me a couple minutes I'll come up with

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.530 
me a couple minutes I'll come up with
something<00:04:33.760> but<00:04:34.760> anyway<00:04:34.880> yeah<00:04:35.180> that's<00:04:35.419> a

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
something but anyway yeah that's a

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.900 
something but anyway yeah that's a
that's<00:04:36.440> an<00:04:36.740> exercise<00:04:37.010> there<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:37.760> can

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
that's an exercise there that you can

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.630 
that's an exercise there that you can
use<00:04:37.940> there<00:04:38.780> again<00:04:39.020> do<00:04:39.169> this<00:04:39.350> with<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.640> metronome

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
use there again do this with a metronome

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.000 
use there again do this with a metronome
I<00:04:41.090> mentioned<00:04:41.450> in<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.690> previous<00:04:42.410> lessons<00:04:42.919> you

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
I mentioned in the previous lessons you

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.010 
I mentioned in the previous lessons you
know<00:04:43.100> use<00:04:43.310> use<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.640> metronome<00:04:44.000> very<00:04:44.270> important

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:05:01.150 

you<00:04:51.020> know<00:04:51.110> pick<00:04:52.060> two<00:04:53.060> fingers<00:04:59.890> now<00:05:00.890> I<00:05:00.919> was

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
you know pick two fingers now I was

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.550 
you know pick two fingers now I was
feeling<00:05:01.400> rolls<00:05:01.580> there<00:05:01.940> which<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.660> don't<00:05:03.020> reason

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
feeling rolls there which I don't reason

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.810 
feeling rolls there which I don't reason
I<00:05:03.620> threw<00:05:03.830> that<00:05:03.860> in<00:05:04.010> here<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.400> give<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.610> an<00:05:04.700> idea

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
I threw that in here to give you an idea

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.930 
I threw that in here to give you an idea
even<00:05:05.120> though<00:05:05.240> this<00:05:05.419> is<00:05:05.570> just<00:05:05.750> an<00:05:05.870> exercise

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
even though this is just an exercise

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.159 
even though this is just an exercise
that's<00:05:07.940> something<00:05:08.150> we<00:05:08.210> can<00:05:08.360> do<00:05:08.450> later<00:05:08.660> on<00:05:08.930> when

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
that's something we can do later on when

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.659 
that's something we can do later on when
we<00:05:09.200> get<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.560> double<00:05:09.800> stops<00:05:10.010> down<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.580> we'll

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
we get the double stops down and we'll

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.790 
we get the double stops down and we'll
start<00:05:10.880> doing<00:05:10.910> rolls<00:05:11.240> with<00:05:11.450> them<00:05:11.630> so<00:05:11.960> it's

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
start doing rolls with them so it's

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.420 
start doing rolls with them so it's
important<00:05:13.100> to<00:05:13.190> learn<00:05:13.700> to<00:05:13.760> use<00:05:13.970> both<00:05:14.180> fingers

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
important to learn to use both fingers

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.740 
important to learn to use both fingers
but<00:05:16.430> what's<00:05:16.610> obviously<00:05:17.060> what<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.240> double<00:05:17.570> stop

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
but what's obviously what a double stop

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.790 
but what's obviously what a double stop
is<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.560> went<00:05:19.190> over<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:20.320> hybrid<00:05:21.320> picking<00:05:21.500> in

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
is I went over a hybrid picking in

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.640 
is I went over a hybrid picking in
another<00:05:22.100> lesson<00:05:22.340> here<00:05:22.880> earlier<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:26.650> the

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
another lesson here earlier so the

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.080 
another lesson here earlier so the
hybrid<00:05:27.800> picking<00:05:28.070> same<00:05:28.460> thing<00:05:28.729> you<00:05:28.850> know<00:05:28.940> it's

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
hybrid picking same thing you know it's

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.520 
hybrid picking same thing you know it's
good<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.270> use<00:05:29.479> these<00:05:29.660> these<00:05:29.720> fingers<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.500> I

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
good to use these these fingers and I

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.320 
good to use these these fingers and I
did<00:05:30.680> an<00:05:30.800> exercise<00:05:31.100> there<00:05:31.640> are<00:05:31.820> a<00:05:31.850> couple

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
did an exercise there are a couple

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.690 
did an exercise there are a couple
exercises<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:33.169> get<00:05:33.290> those<00:05:33.440> fingers<00:05:33.650> get<00:05:34.520> some

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
exercises to get those fingers get some

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.350 
exercises to get those fingers get some
coordination<00:05:35.090> built<00:05:35.450> up<00:05:35.600> on<00:05:35.720> those<00:05:35.840> fingers

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
coordination built up on those fingers

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.969 
coordination built up on those fingers
so<00:05:38.360> working<00:05:38.660> on<00:05:38.720> these<00:05:38.840> exercises<00:05:39.169> here<00:05:39.800> and

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
so working on these exercises here and

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.030 
so working on these exercises here and
then<00:05:40.100> we'll<00:05:40.190> get<00:05:40.310> in<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.520> do<00:05:40.640> some<00:05:40.940> some<00:05:41.390> rolls

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
then we'll get in to do some some rolls

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.469 
then we'll get in to do some some rolls
the<00:05:43.040> rolls<00:05:43.220> is<00:05:43.370> where<00:05:43.520> it<00:05:43.610> gets<00:05:43.700> really<00:05:44.210> hard

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
the rolls is where it gets really hard

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.080 
the rolls is where it gets really hard
so<00:05:44.750> I<00:05:44.990> say<00:05:45.350> really<00:05:45.500> hard<00:05:45.770> it's<00:05:46.000> anything<00:05:47.000> is

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
so I say really hard it's anything is

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.340 
so I say really hard it's anything is
hard<00:05:47.270> at<00:05:47.390> first<00:05:47.570> but<00:05:47.780> after<00:05:48.020> a<00:05:48.050> while<00:05:48.140> it's

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
hard at first but after a while it's

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.370 
hard at first but after a while it's
just<00:05:48.440> second<00:05:48.830> nature<00:05:49.570> but<00:05:50.570> get<00:05:50.900> these<00:05:51.050> double

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
just second nature but get these double

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.580 
just second nature but get these double
stops<00:05:51.590> down<00:05:52.930> let's<00:05:53.930> see<00:05:54.050> if<00:05:54.169> I<00:05:54.260> can<00:05:54.410> come<00:05:54.560> up

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
stops down let's see if I can come up

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.740 
stops down let's see if I can come up
with<00:05:54.710> something<00:05:54.979> else<00:05:55.220> here<00:05:55.520> double<00:05:56.479> stop
