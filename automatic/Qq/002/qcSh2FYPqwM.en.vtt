two colors to naturally blend and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.649 
two colors to naturally blend and
transition<00:01:53.310> together<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.179> how<00:01:57.479> by

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
transition together you can see how by

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.469 
transition together you can see how by
using<00:01:57.899> enough<00:01:58.380> water<00:01:58.460> I'm<00:01:59.460> able<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.999> actually

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
using enough water I'm able to actually

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.999 
using enough water I'm able to actually
direct<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> flow<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.289> color<00:02:03.259> if<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.469> didn't<00:02:04.799> use

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
direct the flow of color if I didn't use

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.429 
direct the flow of color if I didn't use
enough<00:02:05.369> water<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:06.240> color<00:02:06.479> wouldn't<00:02:06.869> move<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
enough water the color wouldn't move and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.730 
enough water the color wouldn't move and
if<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.220> use<00:02:08.399> too<00:02:08.610> much<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.810> color<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.289> easily

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
if I use too much the color can easily

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.850 
if I use too much the color can easily
dissipate<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.720> if<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.870> feel<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.350> too<00:02:13.709> much

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
dissipate and if I feel I have too much

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.730 
dissipate and if I feel I have too much
water<00:02:14.100> all<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.480> do<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.900> pull<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:16.470> color

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
water all I have to do is pull my color

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.350 
water all I have to do is pull my color
and<00:02:17.069> lift<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.120> color<00:02:18.330> out<00:02:19.880> then<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.240> move

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
and lift the color out then I can move

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.130 
and lift the color out then I can move
on<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> next<00:02:22.170> rectangle<00:02:23.480> I'll<00:02:24.480> repeat<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
on to the next rectangle I'll repeat the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.530 
on to the next rectangle I'll repeat the
same<00:02:25.380> process<00:02:25.650> by<00:02:26.550> first<00:02:26.880> filling<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.510> with

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
same process by first filling it with

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.220 
same process by first filling it with
water<00:02:27.740> then<00:02:28.740> adding<00:02:29.220> my<00:02:29.370> color

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
water then adding my color

then<00:02:43.920> I'll<00:02:44.099> use<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.580> same<00:02:44.849> permanent

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510

alizarin crimson and mix it on my

alizarin crimson and mix it on my

allow the two to meet and blend this may

allow the two to meet and blend this may
seem<00:02:55.860> simple<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:57.209> may<00:02:57.390> take<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> few

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
seem simple but it may take you a few

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.229 
seem simple but it may take you a few
tries<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.920> get<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.099> feel<00:02:59.370> for<00:02:59.610> how<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.819> water

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
tries to get a feel for how the water

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.229 
tries to get a feel for how the water
and<00:03:00.510> color<00:03:00.660> moves<00:03:04.280> if<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.519> mixed<00:03:05.970> these

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
and color moves if you mixed these

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.780 
and color moves if you mixed these
colors<00:03:06.660> together<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.230> your<00:03:07.380> palette<00:03:07.790> you'd

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
colors together on your palette you'd

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.390 
colors together on your palette you'd
actually<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.360> entirely<00:03:10.319> different<00:03:10.590> results

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
actually have entirely different results

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.940 
actually have entirely different results
the<00:03:12.299> advantage<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.989> using<00:03:13.049> water<00:03:13.650> and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the advantage of using water and

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.039 
the advantage of using water and
blending<00:03:14.430> color<00:03:14.700> directly<00:03:15.239> on<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.510> paper<00:03:15.690> is

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
blending color directly on the paper is

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.650 
blending color directly on the paper is
that<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.069> gradual<00:03:17.730> transitioning

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
that you get a gradual transitioning

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.199 
that you get a gradual transitioning
before<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.349> blends<00:03:22.549> then<00:03:23.549> continue<00:03:24.180> on

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
before it blends then continue on

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.110 
before it blends then continue on
working<00:03:24.930> your<00:03:25.049> way<00:03:25.079> down<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.739> paper<00:03:26.120> adding

working your way down the paper adding

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.940 
working your way down the paper adding
only<00:03:27.269> two<00:03:27.569> colors<00:03:27.989> at<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> time<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.769> each

only two colors at a time to each
rectangle<00:03:30.319> this<00:03:31.319> way<00:03:31.560> you'll<00:03:31.799> be<00:03:31.829> able<00:03:32.160> to

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
rectangle this way you'll be able to

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.100 
rectangle this way you'll be able to
keep<00:03:32.400> your<00:03:32.610> colors<00:03:32.910> cleaner

you may even want to refer to a color

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.620 
you may even want to refer to a color
chart<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.890> see<00:03:43.070> which<00:03:43.280> combination<00:03:43.640> blend<00:03:44.420> you
