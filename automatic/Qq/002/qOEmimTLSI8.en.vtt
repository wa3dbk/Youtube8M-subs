00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.910
 so set yourself daytime running 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.910
 base lights 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.390
 high beam to floor channels 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.800
 built on the pwm diagram show now how 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:25.440
 working means working conditions 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:30.109
 handbrake lowered light off dimensions 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.920
 ignition on 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:38.220
 icon lights up 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 driving light on a tidy he barely 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.870
 noticeable when turn on the far he 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 lights up full of energy 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.340
 This means that daytime running 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.629
 lights 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.950
 running raise the handbrake and they 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.680
 turn on let 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.190
 enough to include the dimensions either yes 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.640
 or dipped daytime running lights 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.640
 gas 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:28.710
 what it looks like on the street light bulbs are burning 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:34.290
 high beam filament distant right now 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:43.410
 weak glow is set 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:51.680
 governed by our regulator here you can 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:51.680
 see brightly dim 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.649
 that's how high beam all the way up 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.400
 I shot myself 20 percent from the brightness 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.630
 this is enough to extract 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.630
 see me stream cars 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.330
 thanks to all 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.110
 but
