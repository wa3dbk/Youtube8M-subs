the<00:01:34.860> finishing<00:01:35.190> moves<00:01:35.640> instead<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.330> just

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the finishing moves instead of just

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.180 
the finishing moves instead of just
shooting<00:01:36.780> someone<00:01:37.110> even<00:01:37.890> though<00:01:38.010> you're

shooting someone even though you're

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
shooting your guns in the finishing

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.860 
shooting your guns in the finishing

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
moves it doesn't actually use any ammo

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.260 
moves it doesn't actually use any ammo
so<00:01:42.870> if<00:01:43.800> you're<00:01:43.980> out<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> ammo<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.490> only<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.240> a

bullet or two left just run up to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.170 
bullet or two left just run up to
someone<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.730> you<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
someone and then if you do that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.940 
someone and then if you do that
finishing<00:01:48.750> move<00:01:48.870> reshoot<00:01:49.230> them<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.560> five<00:01:49.770> or

six times in the chest it doesn't

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.219 
six times in the chest it doesn't
actually<00:01:51.750> use<00:01:52.050> ammo<00:01:52.410> so<00:01:53.990> that's<00:01:54.990> pretty

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
