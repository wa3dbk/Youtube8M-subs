that<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> series<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.100> longer<00:02:02.280> will

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that the series can be a bit longer will

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
that the series can be a bit longer will
be<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> bit<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.240> interesting<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.899> we're<00:02:04.350> not

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
be a bit more interesting and we're not

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.319 
be a bit more interesting and we're not
so<00:02:04.710> bottleneck<00:02:05.219> likely<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> moment<00:02:06.210> with

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
so bottleneck likely on the moment with

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.510 
so bottleneck likely on the moment with
the<00:02:06.509> stroke<00:02:06.810> force<00:02:07.079> being<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.560> high<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the stroke force being so high and the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.330 
the stroke force being so high and the
defense<00:02:08.849> being<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.360> low<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.629> i<00:02:10.140> might<00:02:11.099> change

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
defense being so low so i might change

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.860 
defense being so low so i might change
