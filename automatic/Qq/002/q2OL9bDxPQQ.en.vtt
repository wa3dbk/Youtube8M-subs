00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
about pvp power versus strength which

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.170 
about pvp power versus strength which
one's<00:00:29.689> better<00:00:29.869> um<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:31.279> I<00:00:31.310> spent<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:31.880> last<00:00:32.000> few

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.430 
one's better um so I spent the last few
days<00:00:32.300> trying<00:00:32.599> to<00:00:32.629> figure<00:00:32.870> this<00:00:33.020> out<00:00:33.200> and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
days trying to figure this out and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.020 
days trying to figure this out and
basically<00:00:34.190> what<00:00:34.400> it<00:00:34.430> is<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:34.760> when<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.940> Wow

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
basically what it is and when to Wow

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.880 
basically what it is and when to Wow
head<00:00:35.239> calm<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:36.140> abilities<00:00:36.500> that<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:36.739> could

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
head calm the abilities that I could

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.920 
head calm the abilities that I could
find<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.370> mathematical<00:00:37.970> calculations<00:00:38.540> for<00:00:38.720> I

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
find the mathematical calculations for I

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.770 
find the mathematical calculations for I
use<00:00:39.800> that<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.370> other<00:00:40.519> ones<00:00:40.850> me<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.360> my<00:00:41.480> friend

figured<00:00:42.199> them<00:00:42.379> out<00:00:42.530> with<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.010> use<00:00:43.129> of<00:00:43.160> some

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
figured them out with the use of some

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.810 
figured them out with the use of some
clever<00:00:43.640> add-ons<00:00:44.120> etc<00:00:45.019> so<00:00:45.769> while<00:00:46.370> I'd<00:00:46.489> love<00:00:46.519> to

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
clever add-ons etc so while I'd love to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.729 
clever add-ons etc so while I'd love to
show<00:00:46.970> you<00:00:47.000> all<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.420> math<00:00:47.570> involved<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.589> was

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
show you all the math involved it was

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.380 
show you all the math involved it was
way<00:00:48.890> too<00:00:48.920> complex<00:00:49.400> I<00:00:49.580> couldn't<00:00:49.850> even<00:00:49.910> come<00:00:50.360> up

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
way too complex I couldn't even come up

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.750 
way too complex I couldn't even come up
with<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.660> visual<00:00:51.019> for<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.589> i<00:00:51.800> am<00:00:52.339> not<00:00:52.550> even

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
with a visual for it so i am not even

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.890 
with a visual for it so i am not even
going<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:52.910> cover<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.210> math<00:00:53.360> you're<00:00:53.720> just

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
going to cover the math you're just

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.600 
going to cover the math you're just
going<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.140> take<00:00:54.260> my<00:00:54.320> word<00:00:54.500> for<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:54.860> but

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
basically here's how i came up with my

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.680 
basically here's how i came up with my
conclusions<00:00:58.040> look<00:00:58.670> at--look<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.210> all<00:00:59.510> the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
conclusions look at--look and all the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.869 
conclusions look at--look and all the
abilities<00:01:00.140> for<00:01:00.409> arms<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:00.860> fury<00:01:01.159> I<00:01:01.430> didn't

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
abilities for arms and fury I didn't

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.609 
abilities for arms and fury I didn't
even<00:01:01.909> take<00:01:02.150> praten<00:01:02.570> deck<00:01:02.720> out<00:01:02.869> sorry<00:01:03.199> problem

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
even take praten deck out sorry problem

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.830 
even take praten deck out sorry problem
or<00:01:03.710> use<00:01:03.860> but<00:01:04.670> I<00:01:04.699> looked<00:01:04.909> at<00:01:05.030> arms<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.420> fury<00:01:05.630> I

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
or use but I looked at arms and fury I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.289 
or use but I looked at arms and fury I
did<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.470> calculations<00:01:07.189> attack<00:01:07.610> power<00:01:07.850> versus

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
did the calculations attack power versus

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.660 
did the calculations attack power versus
the<00:01:08.390> pvp<00:01:08.869> power<00:01:08.900> how<00:01:09.860> much<00:01:10.010> attack<00:01:10.280> power<00:01:10.520> do

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
the pvp power how much attack power do

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.490 
the pvp power how much attack power do
you<00:01:10.760> need<00:01:10.970> to<00:01:11.390> gain<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.570> percent<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.049> damage<00:01:12.380> how

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
you need to gain a percent of damage how

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.469 
you need to gain a percent of damage how
much<00:01:12.619> pvp<00:01:13.130> power<00:01:13.159> do<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.670> need<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.939> gain<00:01:14.090> %<00:01:14.450> of

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
much pvp power do you need to gain % of

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.510 
much pvp power do you need to gain % of
damage<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:14.840> I<00:01:15.020> had<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.260> do<00:01:15.409> that<00:01:15.560> for<00:01:15.799> every

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
damage and I had to do that for every

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.590 
damage and I had to do that for every
signal<00:01:16.909> ability<00:01:17.409> then<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:18.740> went<00:01:19.490> back<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:20.330> arms

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
signal ability then I went back to arms

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.090 
signal ability then I went back to arms
of<00:01:20.750> fury<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.110> looked<00:01:21.259> at<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.500> core<00:01:21.680> abilities

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
of fury and looked at the core abilities

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.649 
of fury and looked at the core abilities
which<00:01:22.250> ones<00:01:22.460> do<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.670> hit<00:01:22.880> most<00:01:23.060> often<00:01:23.450> within

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
which ones do you hit most often within

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.240 
which ones do you hit most often within
a<00:01:23.960> battleground<00:01:24.259> where<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.040> did<00:01:25.159> the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
a battleground where you did the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.010 
a battleground where you did the
calculations<00:01:25.820> for<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.510> here's<00:01:26.750> the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
calculations for that and here's the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.410 
calculations for that and here's the
surprise<00:01:27.290> result<00:01:27.760> arms<00:01:28.760> warriors<00:01:29.090> better

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
surprise result arms warriors better

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.070 
surprise result arms warriors better
strength<00:01:29.780> fury<00:01:30.200> Wars<00:01:30.500> better<00:01:30.800> pvp<00:01:31.340> power<00:01:32.080> not

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
strength fury Wars better pvp power not

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.390 
strength fury Wars better pvp power not
sure<00:01:33.320> why<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:33.560> think<00:01:34.010> it's<00:01:34.100> because<00:01:34.160> we're

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
sure why I think it's because we're

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.950 
sure why I think it's because we're
holding<00:01:34.700> two<00:01:34.820> weapons<00:01:35.150> I<00:01:35.360> don't<00:01:35.660> know<00:01:35.780> why

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
holding two weapons I don't know why

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.440 
holding two weapons I don't know why
that<00:01:35.990> ended<00:01:36.470> up<00:01:36.560> that<00:01:36.710> way<00:01:36.770> but<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.130> did<00:01:37.450> so

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
that ended up that way but it did so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.510 
that ended up that way but it did so

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
things worked out a little bit different

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.330 
things worked out a little bit different
that's<00:02:05.350> because<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.770> was<00:02:05.800> taking<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.250> account

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
that's because I was taking in account

that's because I was taking in account
survivability<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:07.210> did<00:02:07.450> with<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.690> arms<00:02:07.960> were

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
but it was still better for them to

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.380 
but it was still better for them to
stack<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.550> strength<00:02:09.820> because<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.150> didn't

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
stack the strength because they didn't

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.130
