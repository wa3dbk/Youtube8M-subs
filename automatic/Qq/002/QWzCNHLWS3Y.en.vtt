00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.849
 violet purse with another 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.500
 video here on my channel was coming 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.500
 Today is worth a video again 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.330
 And it is today about the fight of 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.890
 Dear team has asked me on skype whether 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.500
 I can not do such a video where 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.539
 I like the controller a bit more 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.820
 imagine and then I thought so 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.089
 okay then I'll start recording 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.129
 and aim you what is actually bringing 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.870
 yes people I thought so soon ever 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.909
 a video window will bring france 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.739
 only then did micha thiemann write 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.390
 and yes, why should I? 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.339
 no video if there was need bring 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.290
 I mean people celebrate my videos 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.820
 so or this kind of videos and me 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.830
 Mine if you want any 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.089
 have which videos freak will bring 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.670
 or even that drives me under the 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.650
 comments or as a private message 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.180
 or do not yell at whatsapp 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.479
 who know my number or so from 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.549
 clear or so you know her 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.960
 and then just write me which 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.210
 Wish you have I am busy 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.400
 so that's the topic or say my own 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.170
 experience with it and then I bring 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.580
 the videos and it's not just worth it 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.200
 videos of his can 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.140
 any kind of videos like that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.670
 pure entertainment and tell you otherwise 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.300
 Let's start with the topic 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.060
 on 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.730
 in principle offers that was already great 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.500
 advantages but as a small player where you 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.150
 not so good then I would you 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.800
 Do not recommend it because so much money 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.980
 spend for a bad player 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.270
 Well, I'll say so if you already 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.430
 a good player if you are already 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.900
 a nuclear dhabi nuclear or in 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.640
 Since then I would already have been in this field 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.680
 say that you could give one to one another 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.440
 but can such a bad player yes 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.050
 As I said, but I can just you 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.140
 Do not say when a good or off 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.610
 could get through when one cup that gives 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.800
 it is not so decide for yourself 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.690
 when is good for you as is eg want 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.790
 I now also feel and my star 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.710
 which gave just only offers the advantages 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.810
 that you jump and m at the same time 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.940
 can and indeed has the skv behind the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.290
 actual controller still two panels 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.300
 once on the left and one on the 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.310
 on the right side there are buttons like 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.410
 ickx and circle publish eg you have 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.300
 and the left field the iks button and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.510
 on the right with paddle the Kreislers 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.150
 so we can do it for you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.620
 then faster with the circle class 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.660
 resist if of course the tactics 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.610
 Setting used and middle ecstasy 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.470
 can you then spring and to be able to 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.030
 at the same time jump and m and the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.440
 opponent pulls the befits you know 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.030
 probably from you on the construction 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.970
 and if you jump at the same time and 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.709
 has the opponents simply less chance 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.269
 So you want to go away because he is at the same time 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.690
 on your legs shoots upwards 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.000
 jumps and yes you have better then 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.530
 fighting one-on-one and that is 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.510
 actually only the great advantage in 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.280
 a controller is still there 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.220
 the sgw gaming website still different 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.340
 to set which you can recover to 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.530
 your sketch eg grip the stop old yours 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.090
 shit or for slips not so easy 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.160
 from the controller that's so easier too 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.380
 Some people put the game a little bit 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.660
 but it is really necessary 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.280
 but not if I climb one 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.680
 I'm up to you if you have one 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.260
 foil then I want an expensive one 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.609
 or one of the many things has 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.599
 but then I will forever 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 will use 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.859
 as long as he does not break of course 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.430
 in what it freaked out as often as I did 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.079
 I'm skeptical but people are mine 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 I think I would prefer one 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.290
 get more expensive where I really say 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.269
 okay that was worth it 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.010
 and then of course there will be 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.480
 lengthened sticks and better as well 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.010
 but that's what I say then 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.609
 another is worthwhile again and that 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.659
 which I do not mean like the 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.280
 moreover, not extension and up 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.560
 in any case one writes under the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.409
 Comments if you buy one who 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.239
 outdated or what it looks like at present if their 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.859
 already once graf have and how her 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.139
 video takes place so rate comment 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.769
 Do not forget three people until the skin 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.970
 next time 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.970
 and bye
