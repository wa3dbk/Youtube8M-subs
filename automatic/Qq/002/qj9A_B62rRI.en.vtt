00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.210
 new video from my video series by 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.919
 day for 30 days as did at the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.389
 united kingdom and ireland 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.309
 so today I tried to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.420
 answer the question our readers on 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.549
 last articles that I put on the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.690
 blog to summarize the videos that we 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.420
 ask when are we should not 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.830
 use the stabilization that there is other 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 thing apart with us our goals 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.119
 so first of all small reminder for 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.460
 those who would not necessarily know 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.050
 really the device the stabilization 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 it's something that is installed 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.759
 either in the goal or in the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.590
 housing and that is made to compensate 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.090
 open it only when you photograph 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.160
 even if he comes this talent you go 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.300
 necessarily small movements to you 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 tremble necessarily a little bit 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.370
 even if you do not smoke coffee and its 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.020
 small movements can cause you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.280
 move at low shutter speeds 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.469
 as I talked about it not very 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.329
 long time in this series the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.430
 lula stabilization for actually 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.870
 detect your movements and make a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.860
 exactly opposite movement it's up to 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.360
 to say that this guy is a movement tool 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.350
 down the little motor that's from in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.910
 make a small upward movement 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.829
 to compensate and therefore keep some 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.170
 stable thing and so basically you 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 allow you to take pictures with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.400
 shutter speeds lower it's up to 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.020
 say slower and despite everything have 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.320
 still a sharp picture 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.090
 so this device it can be installed 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.920
 as said either in the lens 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.299
 either in the device in both cases 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.200
 it even has effect on your fault in the end 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.030
 the difference is that in everything 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.600
 case for devices that have a viewfinder 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.820
 optics the majority of reflexes the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.800
 difference it's just that 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.870
 if stabilization is installed in 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.250
 the goal is well it's going to stabilize 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.229
 in your viewfinder also ie 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.680
 in the long run if you are a gap enough 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.650
 long 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.880
 what goals do you have a big zoom 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.260
 if you have the eye in the viewfinder you 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.340
 go see micro movements greenhouse that 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.170
 you will see the picture a little bit 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 move this as we are a very good focal 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.310
 we see many more small 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.869
 movements and you'll see the picture 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.550
 bull say you're never going to have a 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.250
 really keep a frame that's going to be 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.060
 very stable with stabilization in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.450
 the goal 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.300
 and well you're going to have this framework 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.440
 that it stays much more stable and 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.149
 you will be able to see why we are going 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.070
 say more specifically if the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.479
 stabilization and in the new teaser 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.970
 on a quasi stabilization of the sensor in 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.500
 done is well there you do not see 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.650
 the facts in the objective 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.820
 unless an electronic viewfinder what 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.290
 happens in some reflexes but who 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.590
 is not necessarily the most 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.019
 current that said it's the fac sony and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.970
 pentax which notes a stabilization of 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.440
 case and sony it is weird 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.450
 is starting to be fluently electronic 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.190
 so 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.200
 there you will see as TVs 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.050
 explain since I live with tronic 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.819
 transmits an image captured by the sensor 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.560
 so the image already stabilized when they 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.690
 arrive in your viewfinder whatever it is 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.580
 ask us when is it 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.480
 must disable these stabilization then 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.120
 the answer is 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.920
 I often had a single case is when 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.470
 we can bet on very quiet on 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.580
 tripod it is supposed to be stable at 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.349
 vegetables aubine if you have chosen well 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.440
 your tripod as I said in 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.650
 a previous video and also the stable 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.569
 and still the stabilization will try 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.840
 to stabilize a movement that does not exist 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.370
 not and not looking for a movement and 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.890
 to understand that you have the device 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.849
 in hand and that you move she is going 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.500
 look for that moment sought to 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.640
 stabilize as it does not exist she is going 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.110
 necessarily seeks to stabilize 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.400
 thing 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.860
 that does not exist and so she goes 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.690
 create movement and fear you 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.870
 can higher than the small then 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.269
 some stabilization are supposed to be 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.980
 smart enough to detect 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.010
 when this on tripod and at this 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.750
 moment stopped working then he 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.730
 seems to me that it works well on our 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.260
 objectives enough to hell I do not 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.940
 seems not what is also meant 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.069
 slightly simple stabilization everything 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.299
 little noise but if you have the ear 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.130
 a little bit of china had to hear 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:50.670
 destabilization to work a little 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:53.639
 engine in fact and on high goals 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.920
 range that I of course tripod 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:59.560
 apparently sinifying his debt 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.580
 that said it does not cost anything to cut 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.680
 mediated to be absolutely sure 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.060
 that she does not work that she does not 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.290
 create no crazy about your images or like 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.489
 you are without a tripod I advise 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.840
 strongly to cut off the stabilization 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.430
 it may be less true if you are 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.709
 look out in the wind 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.120
 because if the tripod live a little 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.130
 some little stabilization that we think about 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.299
 these movements there by cons where he 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.400
 there is no simple answer it depends 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.730
 a lot of the situation and jong it takes 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.590
 test 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.610
 that's where ever you're often this 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.440
 association with you ask yourself the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.240
 question of property to test take a 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.460
 photo with and without affiliation was waiting 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.960
 if you see the difference in years zoom 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.910
 online it's pretty likely that you 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.770
 do not send me elsewhere then in the 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.180
 other situations even at speeds 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.080
 very fast shutter of the same if 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.160
 for example you have a lot of 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.050
 light that you can tone yourself 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.780
 game by a thousand - 2 1000th to the waves 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.820
 is well activated as stabilization 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.280
 because then of a cost nothing that does not 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.120
 can not tack your image 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.770
 it's safe and it stabilized me well the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.000
 so referred as the wind said and 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.139
 you'll see a frame that's going to be 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.810
 more stable you will be able to fit 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.950
 more precisely so we see there for 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.050
 answer this question it takes 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.380
 disable stabilization only when we 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.940
 is on real estate tripods if you 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.419
 liked this video click on I like 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.410
 on 2 km and click on I do not like and 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.030
 see you tomorrow for the next 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.110
 video if you want to see not hesitate 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.610
 not to click on the little button in 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.419
