farming time in Diablo 3 so now before

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
farming time in Diablo 3 so now before
that<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.580> actually<00:01:29.850> pretty<00:01:30.030> simple

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that it's actually pretty simple

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.930 
that it's actually pretty simple
they're<00:01:30.750> only<00:01:30.869> free<00:01:31.289> points<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.979> but

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
they're only free points to it but

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.430 
they're only free points to it but
before<00:01:33.000> I'm<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> talk<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.840> these

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
before I'm going to talk about these

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.100 
before I'm going to talk about these
three<00:01:34.740> points<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.570> from<00:01:36.570> general<00:01:36.899> flame

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
three points just from general flame

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
three points just from general flame
because<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.950> everyone<00:01:38.250> who's

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
because I know not everyone who's

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.820 
because I know not everyone who's
watching<00:01:39.090> me<00:01:39.179> is<00:01:39.270> playing<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.600> same<00:01:39.630> class<00:01:40.050> so

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
watching me is playing the same class so

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.690 
watching me is playing the same class so
I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:43.399> demon<00:01:44.399> hunter

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I think you can do this the demon hunter

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.899 
I think you can do this the demon hunter
with<00:01:44.850> Ward<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.420> need<00:01:45.570> high<00:01:45.750> movement<00:01:46.170> speed

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
with Ward you need high movement speed

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.430 
with Ward you need high movement speed
barb<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.179> tornado<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.720> course<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.289> also

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
barb with tornado of course that also

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.230 
barb with tornado of course that also
visit<00:01:49.860> Estella<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:50.909> sure<00:01:51.149> about

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
visit Estella but I'm not sure about

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.580 
visit Estella but I'm not sure about
monk<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> witch<00:01:51.899> doctor<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.440> might<00:01:52.560> be

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
monk and witch doctor so there might be

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.279 
monk and witch doctor so there might be
I<00:01:53.039> might<00:01:53.729> find<00:01:54.000> slightly<00:01:54.479> less<00:01:54.659> legendaries

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
I might find slightly less legendaries

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.639 
I might find slightly less legendaries
but<00:01:56.750> for<00:01:57.750> most<00:01:57.840> classes<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.409> should<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
but for most classes it should be a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
but for most classes it should be a
really<00:01:58.950> efficient<00:01:59.399> way<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.579> farm<00:01:59.939> legendaries

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
really efficient way to farm legendaries

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.770 
really efficient way to farm legendaries
and<00:02:00.750> i<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.619> if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.829> play<00:02:01.860> 10<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.820> 12<00:02:03.060> hours

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and i think if you play 10 to 12 hours

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.260 
and i think if you play 10 to 12 hours
even<00:02:04.530> without<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.189> best<00:02:05.369> gear<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.820> say

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
even without the best gear like say

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.940 
even without the best gear like say
average<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.899> even<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.200> perfect<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
average or even with perfect here you

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.880 
average or even with perfect here you
can<00:02:08.369> find<00:02:08.700> 15<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.720> 20<00:02:10.019> legendre's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> day

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
can find 15 to 20 legendre's a day

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.420 
can find 15 to 20 legendre's a day
so<00:02:11.579> let<00:02:12.510> me<00:02:12.630> tell<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.380> three<00:02:13.650> important

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
so let me tell you the three important

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.789 
so let me tell you the three important
farming<00:02:14.760> tips<00:02:14.940> now<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:15.989> first<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.769> need

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
farming tips now the first is you need

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.759 
farming tips now the first is you need

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
to have an optimized route so this means

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.199 
to have an optimized route so this means

high amount of release high mob density
in<00:02:24.209> my<00:02:24.450> opinion<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> best<00:02:25.049> place<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.799> filled

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
in my opinion the best place is filled

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
out case around funny that is two months

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.479 
out case around funny that is two months
old<00:02:28.769> but<00:02:28.950> still<00:02:29.100> considered<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:29.940> best<00:02:31.489> so

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
old but still considered the best so

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.039 
old but still considered the best so
that<00:02:32.519> case<00:02:32.850> around<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.180> know<00:02:33.299> there<00:02:33.480> are<00:02:33.570> many

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
that case around you know there are many

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.440 
that case around you know there are many
videos<00:02:34.290> also<00:02:34.799> a<00:02:34.829> one<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.220> myself<00:02:35.579> how<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.940> run

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
videos also a one for myself how the run

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.830 
videos also a one for myself how the run
exactly<00:02:36.720> works<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.400> yeah<00:02:38.480> field<00:02:39.480> has<00:02:39.630> high

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
exactly works and yeah field has high

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.080 
exactly works and yeah field has high
mob<00:02:40.079> density<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.799> takes<00:02:40.980> place<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.220> x3<00:02:41.760> and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
mob density and it takes place in x3 and

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.759 
mob density and it takes place in x3 and
their<00:02:42.359> additional<00:02:42.780> advantages<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.410> freeze

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
their additional advantages like freeze

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.280 
their additional advantages like freeze
you<00:02:44.070> can<00:02:44.220> play<00:02:44.430> at<00:02:44.700> three<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.269> month<00:02:45.690> supply<00:02:45.780> 0

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
you can play at three a month supply 0

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.090 
you can play at three a month supply 0
and<00:02:46.560> still<00:02:46.980> get<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> best<00:02:47.430> drops<00:02:48.739> but<00:02:49.739> if<00:02:49.980> you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
and still get the best drops but if you

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.610 
and still get the best drops but if you
choose<00:02:50.940> your<00:02:51.209> farming<00:02:51.810> route<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.380> need<00:02:52.500> to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
choose your farming route you need to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.819 
choose your farming route you need to
make<00:02:52.769> sure<00:02:53.359> that<00:02:54.359> if<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.900> actually<00:02:55.320> choose<00:02:55.530> at

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
make sure that if you actually choose at

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.949 
make sure that if you actually choose at
one<00:02:56.070> like<00:02:56.280> two<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:57.090> set<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.540> monster<00:02:57.690> power

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
one like two you set the monster power

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.900 
one like two you set the monster power
to<00:02:58.290> at<00:02:58.350> least<00:02:58.470> one<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:59.040> think<00:02:59.310> multiple<00:02:59.700> one

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
to at least one I think multiple one

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.540 
to at least one I think multiple one
next<00:03:00.150> one<00:03:00.329> is<00:03:00.690> harder<00:03:01.140> than<00:03:01.290> most<00:03:01.530> about<00:03:01.769> zero

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
next one is harder than most about zero

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.120 
next one is harder than most about zero
and<00:03:02.880> that's<00:03:03.150> already<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.510> second<00:03:04.130> important

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
and that's already the second important

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.400 
and that's already the second important
thing<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.820> month<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.210> power<00:03:06.450> now<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.290> you

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
thing the month the power now if you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.260 
thing the month the power now if you
want<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.710> maximize<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.370> Legendary's<00:03:09.120> per

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
want to maximize your Legendary's per

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.680 
want to maximize your Legendary's per
hour

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
hour

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.500 
hour
you're<00:03:10.110> gonna<00:03:10.260> maximize<00:03:10.740> your<00:03:11.100> elites<00:03:11.610> kill

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
you're gonna maximize your elites kill

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.280 
you're gonna maximize your elites kill
power<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.830> also<00:03:14.040> white<00:03:14.310> mobs<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.050> that's<00:03:16.050> why

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
power and also white mobs and that's why

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
power and also white mobs and that's why
I'm<00:03:16.530> using<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.980> free<00:03:17.250> arcades<00:03:17.580> around<00:03:17.850> for

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
I'm using that free arcades around for

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.360 
I'm using that free arcades around for
it<00:03:18.090> because<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.740> has<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.130> highest

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
it because it's it has the highest

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.730 
it because it's it has the highest
amount<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.970> elites<00:03:21.270> per<00:03:21.510> game<00:03:21.720> or<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:22.020> very<00:03:22.500> high

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
amount of elites per game or a very high

time to kill and on top of that the mob
density<00:03:27.930> net<00:03:28.080> free<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.620> high<00:03:28.830> in<00:03:29.100> their

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
density net free is so high in their

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.550 
density net free is so high in their
special<00:03:29.610> areas<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.810> are<00:03:30.960> being<00:03:30.990> covered<00:03:31.440> by

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
the kaiser run that you also kill many

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.360 
the kaiser run that you also kill many
white<00:03:33.750> mobs<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.950> legendary
