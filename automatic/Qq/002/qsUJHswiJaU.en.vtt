00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello to all this is morgane and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.200
 so we meet to see on 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.320
 for this week of 28 November 30 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.730
 November 2014 and so this week it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.509
 is in the middle so it's pretty 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.750
 easy it's here on the left here it is 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.460
 a very easy time access to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 look at a nickname of the other who's getting 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 were therefore phasing in at the level of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.759
 staff down I'm a little disappointed 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.460
 personally since he sells to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.550
 new 3 3 torso armor 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 I think the chalice lizards have to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.730
 to really get really fed up knowing 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 that in all this the most interesting 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.070
 it's the mint arrion of the titans 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.500
 since he gives a grenade in addition to the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.170
 plan c which is therefore a fusion rifle 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.430
 to dgac rio which is very very good i 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 do a video on it so if you 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.210
 want to see it in action for you 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.860
 whether you want to buy it or not 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.600
 but I have a video on the rifle the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.100
 fusion plan is that I did everything 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.439
 start of the game since I had had it 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.179
 early in the legendary g ring i 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.450
 believe where I am more I say I believe 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:13.920
 in the video so and so you can 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.780
 see in action what gives everything 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.219
 so just like that you can 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.600
 make you a little idea 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.979
 and then good exotic ram language 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.330
 cantley so that's a good 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.920
 new since it's not a helmet 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.390
 this week for those who miss 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.799
 gauntlets and that we could have had 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.710
 the opportunity to make the banner of doing 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.220
 last week it can be that can 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.820
 be useful 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.970
 and then always the same little ones say m 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.280
 if you want to improve your equipment 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.810
 so here is dad a week very 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.240
 rich if only plan the plan c 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.360
 is a very very good rifle the fusion to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.250
 my sense he helped me well in 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.009
 assaults when the trio damage was 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.500
 precisely increased even though I had also 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.250
 a bridge like this but the fusion gun 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.409
 plan is not bad even in pvp 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.170
 it's true I feel them there is no in 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.569
 the video I used a lot of pvp at 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.850
 middle of my destiny adventure if one 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.530
 can say and it's true that in low pvp it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.870
 sent a heavy one too I get to 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.130
 one shot a lot of people have of course 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.810
 it's like the blow pump must be 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.150
 bringing people together is another 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.980
 how to play in a PVP with a 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.489
 assault rifle but but that's enough 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.890
 interesting 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.440
 so I advise you and so if you 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.510
 did not take it and otherwise it's 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.630
 rather a bad week for measurement 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.239
 but here I hope that it will have you 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.130
 interested that at least it will have you 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.540
 learned or exclude dodging and I 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.989
 found quickly on the channel for 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.989
 other videos 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.930
 it's lost
