running apps that aren't on your ignore
list<00:06:23.530> all<00:06:24.190> seems<00:06:24.910> like<00:06:25.000> a<00:06:25.060> lot<00:06:25.330> of<00:06:25.360> space<00:06:25.660> used

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
list all seems like a lot of space used

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.360 
list all seems like a lot of space used
for<00:06:26.169> little<00:06:26.380> functionality

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
for little functionality

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.189 
for little functionality
so<00:06:27.940> there<00:06:28.060> you<00:06:28.150> have<00:06:28.180> it<00:06:28.330> three<00:06:28.720> apps<00:06:28.900> that<00:06:29.080> all

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
so there you have it three apps that all

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.659 
so there you have it three apps that all
pretty<00:06:29.470> much<00:06:29.620> do<00:06:29.770> the<00:06:29.889> same<00:06:30.070> thing<00:06:30.280> with<00:06:30.430> a<00:06:30.460> few

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
pretty much do the same thing with a few

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:31.950 
pretty much do the same thing with a few
differences<00:06:30.970> here<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.360> there<00:06:31.510> so<00:06:31.810> let's

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
differences here and there so let's

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.409 
differences here and there so let's
break<00:06:32.080> it<00:06:32.199> down<00:06:32.820> advanced<00:06:33.820> task<00:06:34.030> killer<00:06:34.120> is<00:06:34.389> a

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
break it down advanced task killer is a

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.210 
break it down advanced task killer is a
simple<00:06:34.780> app<00:06:34.900> does<00:06:35.350> what<00:06:35.500> it<00:06:35.590> says<00:06:35.620> it<00:06:35.860> will<00:06:35.889> and

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
simple app does what it says it will and

simple app does what it says it will and
is<00:06:36.460> easy<00:06:36.610> to<00:06:36.790> use<00:06:36.970> there's<00:06:37.540> a<00:06:37.630> free<00:06:37.840> version

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.629 
is easy to use there's a free version
that<00:06:38.229> doesn't<00:06:38.560> limit<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.800> functionality<00:06:39.430> and

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
that doesn't limit the functionality and

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:40.860 
that doesn't limit the functionality and
unfortunately<00:06:40.330> it<00:06:40.419> doesn't<00:06:40.600> have<00:06:40.690> any

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
unfortunately it doesn't have any

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.390 
unfortunately it doesn't have any

task killers paid version is cheaper

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.150
