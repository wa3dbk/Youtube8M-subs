00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.730
 for the girls 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.760
 today I come to make you a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.190
 review on the new collection which 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.530
 just out at kiko and over 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.610
 especially their varnish so 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
 the other time I went past 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.670
 that sticks to the cohesion was out I 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.880
 looked a little bit ago that the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 varnish that attracted me after the rest 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 I did not find that top top I did not 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
 not especially need but I 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.989
 had to do a review on their 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.850
 polish because they are super before 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.250
 so the varnish collection that come 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.610
 to go out she's called denim 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 in fact I asked what it was I 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.800
 asked a saleswoman is actually these are 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.480
 matte varnish 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.120
 so these are matte varnishes and they have 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.010
 really super color so I have not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.649
 could resist and I took four 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 I will introduce them right away 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.520
 one after the other telling you the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.309
 positive points the negative points and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.979
 showing a swatch so for 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.270
 start I'll talk about the number 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.409
 4,161 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.710
 so this is this one it's a girex and a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.049
 coral red is really super pretty 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.640
 is very very flash 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.700
 the plus point and that's the point 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.460
 positive of all these varnishes there is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.189
 need only one layer and that's already 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.540
 super super covering to the pastries not 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.159
 need to pass two layers 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.710
 it's really nice and especially 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.650
 a super super quick dry 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.380
 so really only positive points and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.970
 so the rendering is dull and I find that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 it's really cool it changes 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.710
 a lot of all the other varnishes and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.079
 otherwise yes I forgot to tell you all 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.729
 these little varnishes are 5 euros 90 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.399
 india so here I find it rather 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.399
 Dernis reasonable for this quality 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.430
 at 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.580
 then I took to numbers 462 so 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.210
 it's this one so it's a purple 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.460
 dark purple plum which is also 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.090
 super pretty necessarily you I have 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.630
 cracked above such ease 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.500
 ultra drying top 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.709
 quick 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.800
 against this one I think it is 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.260
 much prettier with two layers a 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.910
 layer might be enough but two it's 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.910
 really better 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.150
 I then took the number 460 so 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.489
 it is this one I the prices in anticipation 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.129
 from summer to what is really very very 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.939
 flash hang out have done that's it's a 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:47.930
 pink neon pink actually that is really 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:50.060
 once again super pretty matte I 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.790
 prefers it with two layers but a 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.670
 layer that's enough so one year they 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.560
 are very very poor is it too 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.560
 necessarily a very fast dry 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.129
 m 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.700
