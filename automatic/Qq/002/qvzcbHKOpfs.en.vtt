stayed<00:00:44.700> alive<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.210> long<00:00:45.270> time<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:45.930> clips

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
stayed alive for a long time but clips

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.220 
stayed alive for a long time but clips
like<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.250> don't<00:00:47.579> stay<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
like this don't stay with you for the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
like this don't stay with you for the
most<00:00:49.440> part<00:00:49.800> what's<00:00:50.250> unfortunate<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.030> plays

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
most part what's unfortunate is plays

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.250 
most part what's unfortunate is plays
like<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.690> should<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:52.920> running<00:00:53.789> away

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
like that should because running away

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.420 
like that should because running away
tactical<00:00:55.260> play<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.980> probably<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
tactical play like that is probably the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.819 
tactical play like that is probably the
biggest<00:00:56.699> reason<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.390> am<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.230> better<00:00:58.500> than

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
biggest reason I am a bit better than

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.979 
biggest reason I am a bit better than
the<00:00:58.980> average<00:00:59.309> person<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.850> there<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.239> because

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the average person out there is because

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.009 
the average person out there is because
I<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> run<00:01:01.890> away<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.430> yes<00:01:03.270> landing<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I know how to run away and yes landing a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
I know how to run away and yes landing a
snipe<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> important<00:01:05.159> yes<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:05.939> playing

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
snipe is important yes out playing

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
snipe is important yes out playing
someone<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:07.290> primary<00:01:07.740> weapon<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
someone with your primary weapon is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
someone with your primary weapon is
important<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.270> gun<00:01:09.510> skill<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.960> important<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
important and gun skill is important in

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.230 
important and gun skill is important in
a<00:01:10.680> first-person<00:01:11.040> shooter<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.909> mean<00:01:12.090> that's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
a first-person shooter I mean that's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.760 
a first-person shooter I mean that's
what<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> game<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.689> called<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.200> shooter

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
what the game is called it's the shooter

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.219 
what the game is called it's the shooter
but<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.180> understand<00:01:15.780> core

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
but if you don't understand core

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
but if you don't understand core
mechanics<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> game<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.520> never<00:01:17.729> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
mechanics of the game you will never be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.170 
mechanics of the game you will never be
as<00:01:18.240> good<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> take<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> clone<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.729> people

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
as good so if you take a clone to people

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
as good so if you take a clone to people
that<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> exact<00:01:21.869> same<00:01:21.900> brain<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> exact

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that have the exact same brain the exact

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.300 
that have the exact same brain the exact
same<00:01:23.220> capacity<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.450> learn<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.750> grow<00:01:25.310> you're

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
same capacity to learn and grow you're

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.429 
same capacity to learn and grow you're
gonna<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.939> very<00:01:27.600> interesting<00:01:28.049> situation

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
gonna have a very interesting situation

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.460 
gonna have a very interesting situation
so<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.220> one<00:01:29.430> player<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:30.509> he<00:01:30.780> does<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> play<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
so if one player all he does is play the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.710 
so if one player all he does is play the
game<00:01:31.619> shoot<00:01:32.070> learn<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> fly<00:01:33.180> doesn't

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
game shoot learn on the fly doesn't

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
game shoot learn on the fly doesn't
understand<00:01:34.229> even<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.590> every<00:01:34.770> class<00:01:35.009> does

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
understand even what every class does

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.370 
understand even what every class does
yet<00:01:35.490> he<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> improve<00:01:36.750> mechanically

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
yet he is going to improve mechanically

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.499 
yet he is going to improve mechanically
his<00:01:37.590> shot<00:01:37.890> will<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.430> good<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.240> gonna<00:01:39.360> be

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
his shot will be very good it's gonna be

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
his shot will be very good it's gonna be
fantastic<00:01:39.710> but<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> take<00:01:41.070> his<00:01:41.220> clone

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
fantastic but if you take his clone

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.630 
fantastic but if you take his clone
brother<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.780> show<00:01:43.680> him<00:01:43.829> gameplays<00:01:44.369> like

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
brother and you show him gameplays like

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.929 
brother and you show him gameplays like

that if you hit someone with a thorn and
an<00:02:13.290> arc

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
an arc

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.940 
an arc
Boult<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.950> kills<00:02:14.250> them<00:02:14.489> did<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.209> know<00:02:15.510> that
