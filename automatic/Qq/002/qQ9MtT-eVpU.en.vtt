excited about this I will see if there's

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.510 
excited about this I will see if there's
any<00:02:18.810> cheese<00:02:19.050> going<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.410> past<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.920> because

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
any cheese going on past this because

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.369 
any cheese going on past this because
really<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.599> get<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.780> ramp<00:02:22.140> block

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
really it's you can get that ramp block

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.809 
really it's you can get that ramp block
off<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> lot<00:02:22.830> more<00:02:22.950> effectively<00:02:23.340> than<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.640> can

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
off a lot more effectively than you can

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.390 
off a lot more effectively than you can
in<00:02:23.849> one<00:02:24.180> versus<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.510> map<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.739> have<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.190> for

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
in one versus one map we have that for

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
in one versus one map we have that for
spawns<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.629> just<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.050> know<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.230> got<00:02:28.410> asked

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
spawns you just you know you got asked

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.809 
spawns you just you know you got asked
out<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.739> lot<00:02:28.950> further<00:02:29.129> out<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.550> think<00:02:29.730> it

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
out a lot further out so I think it

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.160 
out a lot further out so I think it
opens<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:30.150> opportunities<00:02:30.330> for<00:02:30.720> cheese<00:02:30.989> in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
opens up opportunities for cheese in

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.780 
opens up opportunities for cheese in
such<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.379> large<00:02:31.650> map<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.040> zodiac<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.519> think<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
such a large map like zodiac I think it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.280 
such a large map like zodiac I think it
also<00:02:32.970> opens<00:02:33.330> up<00:02:33.420> opportunities<00:02:33.629> in<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
also opens up opportunities in that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.229 
also opens up opportunities in that
regard<00:02:34.590> looks<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.459> probes<00:02:35.700> passing<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.209> the

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
regard looks like probes passing in the

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.550 
regard looks like probes passing in the
night<00:02:36.420> though<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:36.870> they're<00:02:37.230> probably<00:02:37.260> going

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
night though so they're probably going

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
night though so they're probably going
to<00:02:37.650> scout<00:02:37.830> across<00:02:38.069> each<00:02:38.280> other<00:02:38.420> about<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
to scout across each other about the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.210 
to scout across each other about the
same<00:02:39.690> time<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:40.019> Jamie<00:02:40.470> decided<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.950> scout

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
same time like Jamie decided to scout

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.949 
same time like Jamie decided to scout
clockwise<00:02:41.910> unfortunately<00:02:42.540> set<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> Scout

you<00:02:57.480> at<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:58.409> high<00:02:58.709> level<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.909> difference

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
you at that high level the difference

you at that high level the difference
the<00:03:00.780> difference<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:02.010> between<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.400> little

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
the difference just between the little

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.300 
the difference just between the little
mistakes<00:03:03.349> just<00:03:04.349> kind<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.590> certain<00:03:05.190> things

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310

like<00:03:05.610> cow<00:03:06.000> just<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> little<00:03:06.629> bit<00:03:06.750> of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
like cow just a little bit of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.809 
like cow just a little bit of
micromanagement<00:03:07.379> nervousness<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.400> think<00:03:08.610> he

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
micromanagement nervousness I think he

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.790 
micromanagement nervousness I think he
also<00:03:08.970> was<00:03:09.239> going<00:03:09.540> into<00:03:09.750> Jamie's<00:03:10.200> hold

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
also was going into Jamie's hold

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.780 
also was going into Jamie's hold
position<00:03:11.129> looks<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.400> he's<00:03:11.519> putting<00:03:11.670> that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
position looks like he's putting that

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.520 
position looks like he's putting that
said<00:03:12.030> gay<00:03:12.209> way<00:03:12.330> down<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.050> think<00:03:13.110> Jamie's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
said gay way down so I think Jamie's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.899 
said gay way down so I think Jamie's
thinking<00:03:13.769> about<00:03:13.950> some<00:03:14.190> higher<00:03:14.430> tech<00:03:14.700> maybe

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
thinking about some higher tech maybe

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.820 
thinking about some higher tech maybe
thinking<00:03:15.180> about<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.360> new<00:03:16.260> expansion<00:03:16.739> where

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
thinking about a new expansion where

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.920 
thinking about a new expansion where
that<00:03:16.920> second<00:03:17.190> gateways<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.610> down<00:03:17.730> for<00:03:18.690> Cal

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
that second gateways going down for Cal

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.210 
that second gateways going down for Cal
so<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.170> looks<00:03:19.290> like<00:03:19.349> he'll<00:03:19.590> might<00:03:19.860> be<00:03:19.980> thinking

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
so it looks like he'll might be thinking

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.680 
so it looks like he'll might be thinking
about<00:03:20.310> ending<00:03:20.519> this<00:03:20.700> little<00:03:20.940> early<00:03:21.150> almost

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690

he's not gonna see that second gateway
he's<00:03:27.120> only<00:03:27.269> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.540> assume<00:03:27.659> that<00:03:27.720> there's<00:03:27.989> a

unfortunately<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.840> looks<00:04:07.870> like<00:04:08.020> Jamie's

going<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.500> push<00:04:08.680> up<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.040> think<00:04:09.250> when<00:04:09.400> he

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
going to push up and I think when he

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.490 
going to push up and I think when he
sees<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:10.060> guess<00:04:10.660> actually<00:04:10.959> know<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.170> timing

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
would be off on that so we'll see you if

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.479 
would be off on that so we'll see you if
he<00:04:13.780> pushes<00:04:13.989> up<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.290> unit<00:04:14.680> fast<00:04:14.860> enough<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.280> see

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
he pushes up the unit fast enough to see

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.740 
he pushes up the unit fast enough to see
that<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.730> driving<00:04:16.030> range<00:04:16.239> hasn't<00:04:16.510> been

upgrade<00:04:46.510> it's<00:04:46.600> going<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.780> be<00:04:46.840> actually<00:04:46.960> a

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
upgrade it's going to be actually a

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.450 
upgrade it's going to be actually a
little<00:04:47.410> bit<00:04:47.620> difficult<00:04:47.770> from<00:04:48.040> cal<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.310> hold

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
little bit difficult from cal to hold

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.250 
little bit difficult from cal to hold
this<00:04:48.580> off<00:04:48.760> little<00:04:49.570> things<00:04:49.750> like<00:04:49.840> range

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
this off little things like range

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.379 
this off little things like range
upgrade<00:04:50.680> can<00:04:51.490> make<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.639> big<00:04:51.940> difference<00:04:52.090> in

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
upgrade can make a big difference in

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.610 
upgrade can make a big difference in
protesters<00:04:52.810> with<00:04:52.930> protocols<00:04:53.380> fights

especially<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:54.370> lamp<00:04:54.610> especially<00:04:55.389> at<00:04:55.450> this

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
especially this lamp especially at this

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.820 
especially this lamp especially at this
level<00:04:55.570> looks<00:04:56.169> like<00:04:56.290> he's<00:04:56.410> putting<00:04:56.530> down<00:04:56.740> an

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
level looks like he's putting down an

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.430 
level looks like he's putting down an
observatory<00:04:57.630> instead<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.660> anything<00:04:59.110> else<00:04:59.260> and

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
observatory instead of anything else and

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.540 
observatory instead of anything else and
now<00:04:59.530> getting<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.919> range<00:05:00.070> upgraded

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
now getting the range upgraded

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.250 
now getting the range upgraded
interesting<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:01.450> i<00:05:01.479> guess<00:05:01.690> he<00:05:01.900> felt<00:05:02.080> like

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
interesting so i guess he felt like

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.570 
interesting so i guess he felt like
james<00:05:02.440> ii<00:05:02.530> might<00:05:02.710> be<00:05:02.860> doing<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.160> really<00:05:03.400> quick

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
james ii might be doing a really quick

james ii might be doing a really quick
dark<00:05:03.880> templar<00:05:04.240> rush<00:05:04.390> that's<00:05:04.800> interesting

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
dark templar rush that's interesting

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.340 
dark templar rush that's interesting
maneuver<00:05:06.070> I'm<00:05:06.160> surprised<00:05:06.610> by<00:05:06.789> that<00:05:06.910> honestly

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350

maneuver I'm surprised by that honestly
we'll<00:05:08.350> see<00:05:08.500> what<00:05:08.620> Jenkees<00:05:08.919> up<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.220> in<00:05:09.280> the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
we'll see what Jenkees up to in the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.800 
we'll see what Jenkees up to in the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
meantime but putting down the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.390 
meantime but putting down the
observatory<00:05:11.350> maybe<00:05:11.530> he's<00:05:11.650> producing<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.160> the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
observatory maybe he's producing the the

observatory maybe he's producing the the
drop<00:05:12.580> shuttle<00:05:12.880> alongside<00:05:13.690> will<00:05:14.110> see<00:05:14.260> robotics

three drew goons at the front door to

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.529 
three drew goons at the front door to
not<00:05:27.400> kind<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.610> reveal<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.970> size<00:05:28.150> of<00:05:28.270> his<00:05:28.360> horse

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
not kind of reveal the size of his horse

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:29.580 
not kind of reveal the size of his horse
and<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.690> guess<00:05:28.840> he's<00:05:28.960> just<00:05:29.080> going<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.260> pop<00:05:29.410> some

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
and I guess he's just going to pop some

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.830 
and I guess he's just going to pop some
dragoons<00:05:29.919> in<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.700> bak<00:05:30.940> and<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.510> back<00:05:31.630> door

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
dragoons in the bak and the back door

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.240 
dragoons in the bak and the back door
and<00:05:31.930> try<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.139> disrupt<00:05:32.470> some<00:05:32.680> economy<00:05:33.100> there

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
and try to disrupt some economy there

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.029 
and try to disrupt some economy there
interestingly<00:05:34.060> enough<00:05:34.600> so<00:05:34.960> that's<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:35.950> now

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
interestingly enough so that's and now

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:36.960 
interestingly enough so that's and now
putting<00:05:36.310> down<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.550> robotics<00:05:36.880> facility

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
putting down the robotics facility

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.120 
putting down the robotics facility
actually<00:05:37.570> so<00:05:37.990> this<00:05:38.139> Reavers<00:05:38.800> actually<00:05:39.039> going

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
actually so this Reavers actually going

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.920 
actually so this Reavers actually going
to<00:05:39.250> come<00:05:39.340> out<00:05:39.430> much<00:05:39.610> later<00:05:39.910> than<00:05:40.000> i<00:05:40.389> guess<00:05:40.810> he

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
to come out much later than i guess he

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.360 
to come out much later than i guess he
just<00:05:40.960> wanted<00:05:41.139> to<00:05:41.380> cover<00:05:41.470> all<00:05:41.650> his<00:05:41.680> bases<00:05:41.800> and

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
just wanted to cover all his bases and

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.860 
just wanted to cover all his bases and
that's<00:05:42.669> a<00:05:42.729> little<00:05:42.940> bit<00:05:43.060> conservative<00:05:43.360> on<00:05:43.690> his

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
that's a little bit conservative on his

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.270 
that's a little bit conservative on his
part<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.229> i<00:05:44.289> feel<00:05:44.470> because<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.919> that<00:05:45.039> a

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
part and i feel because of that a

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.879 
part and i feel because of that a
conservative<00:05:46.350> maneuver<00:05:47.350> I<00:05:47.380> think<00:05:47.650> he<00:05:47.770> might

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
conservative maneuver I think he might

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.320 
conservative maneuver I think he might
end<00:05:48.100> up<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.610> this<00:05:48.850> I<00:05:49.000> don't<00:05:49.060> think<00:05:49.270> this

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
end up that this I don't think this

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.909 
end up that this I don't think this
travelbee<00:05:49.780> is<00:05:49.870> effective<00:05:50.350> putting<00:05:50.620> a<00:05:50.680> pylon

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
travelbee is effective putting a pylon

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.560 
travelbee is effective putting a pylon
down<00:05:51.160> that<00:05:51.400> corner<00:05:51.639> so<00:05:51.760> now<00:05:52.180> you<00:05:52.240> see<00:05:52.419> those

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
down that corner so now you see those

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.180 
down that corner so now you see those
pylons<00:05:52.840> out<00:05:53.110> for<00:05:53.289> Jamie<00:05:53.470> so<00:05:53.680> Jenkees<00:05:53.979> going<00:05:54.130> to

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
pylons out for Jamie so Jenkees going to

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.219 
pylons out for Jamie so Jenkees going to
be<00:05:54.250> able<00:05:54.310> to<00:05:54.460> react<00:05:54.700> this<00:05:54.970> drop<00:05:55.720> a<00:05:55.750> little<00:05:56.110> bit

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
be able to react this drop a little bit

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:57.270 
be able to react this drop a little bit
faster<00:05:56.350> than<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.710> would<00:05:56.800> have<00:05:56.830> been<00:05:56.979> able<00:05:57.100> to

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
faster than it would have been able to

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.279 
faster than it would have been able to
otherwise<00:05:57.460> an<00:05:58.419> observer<00:05:58.750> going<00:05:59.020> out<00:05:59.139> so<00:05:59.229> I

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
otherwise an observer going out so I

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.840 
otherwise an observer going out so I
guess<00:05:59.440> Cal<00:06:00.039> just<00:06:00.250> wants<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.490> make<00:06:00.520> sure<00:06:00.610> that

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
guess Cal just wants to make sure that

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.550 
guess Cal just wants to make sure that
his<00:06:00.940> bases<00:06:01.240> are<00:06:01.360> covered<00:06:01.479> I'm<00:06:02.080> sorry<00:06:02.350> if<00:06:02.470> I

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
his bases are covered I'm sorry if I

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.710 
his bases are covered I'm sorry if I
keep<00:06:02.710> mixing<00:06:02.950> up<00:06:03.190> the

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
keep mixing up the

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.210 
keep mixing up the
so<00:06:04.080> it's<00:06:04.200> going<00:06:04.290> to<00:06:04.350> be<00:06:04.410> two<00:06:04.590> salts<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:04.950> Reever

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
so it's going to be two salts and Reever

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.210 
so it's going to be two salts and Reever
here<00:06:05.400> it<00:06:06.240> looks<00:06:06.450> like<00:06:06.510> an<00:06:06.750> that<00:06:06.870> now<00:06:07.650> upgrading

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
here it looks like an that now upgrading

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.710 
here it looks like an that now upgrading
range<00:06:08.430> and<00:06:08.610> so<00:06:08.700> and<00:06:08.940> Jane<00:06:09.090> be<00:06:09.210> still<00:06:09.390> has<00:06:09.600> some

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
range and so and Jane be still has some

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.380 
range and so and Jane be still has some
throwing<00:06:09.960> unit<00:06:10.290> into<00:06:10.950> cows<00:06:11.700> horses<00:06:12.060> to

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
throwing unit into cows horses to

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.940 
throwing unit into cows horses to
realize<00:06:12.660> that<00:06:12.870> that<00:06:12.990> range<00:06:13.140> upgrade<00:06:13.500> has<00:06:13.680> not

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
realize that that range upgrade has not

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.500 
realize that that range upgrade has not
been<00:06:14.160> finished<00:06:14.700> yet<00:06:14.850> that<00:06:15.000> observer<00:06:15.330> now

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
been finished yet that observer now

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.240 
been finished yet that observer now
pushing<00:06:15.930> in<00:06:16.050> I<00:06:16.230> guess<00:06:16.650> he<00:06:16.770> just<00:06:16.800> wanted<00:06:17.040> to

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
pushing in I guess he just wanted to

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.680 
pushing in I guess he just wanted to
scope<00:06:17.550> out<00:06:17.670> the<00:06:17.820> base<00:06:18.030> to<00:06:18.240> make<00:06:18.360> sure<00:06:18.510> that

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
scope out the base to make sure that

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.150 
scope out the base to make sure that
there<00:06:18.810> wasn't<00:06:18.990> any<00:06:19.230> cannon<00:06:19.530> out<00:06:19.650> there<00:06:19.830> wasn't

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
there wasn't any cannon out there wasn't

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.590 
there wasn't any cannon out there wasn't
anything<00:06:20.340> down<00:06:20.550> as<00:06:20.940> soon<00:06:21.120> as<00:06:21.240> his<00:06:21.300> fever

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
anything down as soon as his fever

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.270 
anything down as soon as his fever
produced<00:06:22.530> basically<00:06:22.860> he's<00:06:22.980> gonna<00:06:23.070> have<00:06:23.250> a

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
produced basically he's gonna have a

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.250 
produced basically he's gonna have a
really<00:06:23.490> good<00:06:23.730> shot<00:06:23.790> looks<00:06:24.300> like<00:06:24.480> at<00:06:25.080> the

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
really good shot looks like at the

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.380 
really good shot looks like at the
secondary<00:06:25.590> so<00:06:25.800> timing<00:06:26.160> not<00:06:26.850> hurting<00:06:27.150> him<00:06:27.240> at

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
secondary so timing not hurting him at

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.210 
secondary so timing not hurting him at
all<00:06:27.510> putting<00:06:28.290> down<00:06:28.410> the<00:06:28.500> secondary<00:06:28.920> now<00:06:29.100> and

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
all putting down the secondary now and

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.500 
all putting down the secondary now and
we'll<00:06:29.310> see<00:06:29.460> if<00:06:29.550> Khal<00:06:29.760> decides<00:06:29.880> to<00:06:30.150> do<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.330> same

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
we'll see if Khal decides to do the same

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.510 
we'll see if Khal decides to do the same
gonna<00:06:31.410> be<00:06:31.530> a<00:06:31.560> little<00:06:31.710> bit<00:06:31.890> behind<00:06:32.010> obviously

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
gonna be a little bit behind obviously

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.010 
gonna be a little bit behind obviously
because<00:06:32.730> he<00:06:32.820> again<00:06:33.450> is<00:06:33.570> producing<00:06:33.930> a

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
because he again is producing a

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.120 
because he again is producing a
different<00:06:34.290> units<00:06:34.530> and<00:06:34.650> it's<00:06:34.770> a<00:06:34.800> little<00:06:35.010> bit

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
different units and it's a little bit

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.770 
different units and it's a little bit
head<00:06:35.310> technologically<00:06:35.940> loading<00:06:36.510> up<00:06:36.570> three

head technologically loading up three
for<00:06:36.930> now<00:06:37.020> and<00:06:37.080> we'll<00:06:37.170> see<00:06:37.320> how<00:06:37.410> successful

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
for now and we'll see how successful

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.340 
for now and we'll see how successful
this<00:06:37.980> attack<00:06:38.280> is<00:06:38.310> if<00:06:38.640> it's<00:06:38.810> successful<00:06:39.810> enough

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
this attack is if it's successful enough
