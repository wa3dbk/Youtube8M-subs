shadow bolt as soon as it goes red I
know<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.460> out<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.609> range<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.150> want<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.510> on

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
know I'm out of range I want to be on

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.310 
know I'm out of range I want to be on
the<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:30.869> edge<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.309> what<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.430> range<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.320> do

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the very edge of what my range is I do

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
the very edge of what my range is I do
my<00:00:34.500> cast<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:35.309> soon<00:00:35.460> as<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> timer<00:00:35.880> breaks<00:00:36.210> down

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
my cast as soon as the timer breaks down

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.369 
my cast as soon as the timer breaks down
I<00:00:36.800> cast<00:00:37.800> again<00:00:38.719> see<00:00:39.719> how<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> went<00:00:40.050> red<00:00:40.230> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
I cast again see how I went red that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.750 
I cast again see how I went red that
means<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.680> went<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.920> range<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.399> second

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
means it went out of range for a second

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.200 
means it went out of range for a second
there<00:00:42.620> by<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> got<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.670> was

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
there by the time it got to me I was

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.729 
there by the time it got to me I was
able<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> well<00:00:45.629> take<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.960> down<00:00:46.110> without<00:00:46.320> doing

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
able to well take it down without doing

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.580 
able to well take it down without doing
very<00:00:47.190> much<00:00:47.250> damage<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.379> that's<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
very much damage to me at all that's the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590 
very much damage to me at all that's the
reason<00:00:49.710> why<00:00:49.860> you'd<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> distance<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
reason why you'd go for the distance you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.920 
reason why you'd go for the distance you
can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.750> how<00:00:51.930> much<00:00:52.079> XP<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> got<00:00:52.680> from<00:00:52.829> that

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:57.499 
like I've hunted down another level five

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.469 
like I've hunted down another level five

and help us looks like my looks a little

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:15.910 
and help us looks like my looks a little
higher<00:05:07.439> on<00:05:07.469> this<00:05:07.740> one

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.990 

yes<00:05:16.920> I<00:05:17.040> spoke<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.460> sooner<00:05:19.100> so<00:05:20.100> I<00:05:20.130> got<00:05:20.340> 10<00:05:20.760> more

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
yes I spoke to sooner so I got 10 more

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.360 
yes I spoke to sooner so I got 10 more
points<00:05:21.620> because<00:05:22.620> of<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.830> fact<00:05:23.010> that<00:05:23.130> they

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
points because of the fact that they

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.960 
points because of the fact that they
were<00:05:23.450> four<00:05:24.450> levels<00:05:24.750> higher<00:05:24.780> than<00:05:24.930> me<00:05:25.220> so<00:05:26.220> if<00:05:26.820> I

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
were four levels higher than me so if I

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.430 
were four levels higher than me so if I
it<00:05:27.030> looks<00:05:27.240> like<00:05:27.450> this<00:05:27.570> is<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.720> last<00:05:27.810> chance<00:05:28.260> I

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
it looks like this is the last chance I

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.320 
it looks like this is the last chance I
have<00:05:28.470> at<00:05:28.950> level<00:05:29.280> one<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.820> be<00:05:29.880> able<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.060> do<00:05:30.180> this

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
have at level one to be able to do this

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.520 
have at level one to be able to do this
so<00:05:30.660> we're<00:05:30.810> going<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:30.990> try<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.140> take<00:05:31.320> out<00:05:31.470> a

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
so we're going to try to take out a

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.910 
so we're going to try to take out a
level<00:05:31.830> six<00:05:32.210> without<00:05:33.210> pulling<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:34.260> second<00:05:34.680> level

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
level six without pulling a second level

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.640 
level six without pulling a second level
six<00:05:35.190> so<00:05:35.490> I've<00:05:35.610> got<00:05:35.730> to<00:05:35.760> find<00:05:36.410> you<00:05:37.410> know<00:05:37.470> as<00:05:37.620> soon

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
six so I've got to find you know as soon

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.930 
six so I've got to find you know as soon
as<00:05:37.860> he<00:05:37.980> goes<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.280> other<00:05:38.340> direction<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.760> guess

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
as he goes the other direction I guess

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:48.290 
as he goes the other direction I guess
we<00:05:39.030> can<00:05:39.150> do<00:05:39.270> this<00:05:41.660> okay<00:05:45.320> missed<00:05:46.320> mmm<00:05:47.300> this

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
we can do this okay missed mmm this

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.860 
we can do this okay missed mmm this
could<00:05:48.570> turn<00:05:48.750> ugly

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.230 

so<00:05:56.870> this<00:05:57.020> is<00:05:57.139> really<00:05:57.319> just<00:05:57.440> a<00:05:57.680> gamble<00:05:58.069> to<00:05:58.250> see

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
so this is really just a gamble to see

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.800
