00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
Burnett connected at the back and this

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.499 
Burnett connected at the back and this
is<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> new<00:00:13.259> type<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> nine<00:00:14.190> watt<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.880> it

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
is a new type this is a nine watt and it

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.950 
is a new type this is a nine watt and it
has<00:00:15.750> these<00:00:16.170> elongated<00:00:17.359> LEDs<00:00:18.359> which<00:00:18.720> are

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
has these elongated LEDs which are

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.580 
has these elongated LEDs which are
described<00:00:19.410> as<00:00:19.880> three<00:00:20.880> oh<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.060> four<00:00:21.750> which

means that there are three millimeters
by<00:00:24.840> 1.4<00:00:25.769> millimeters<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:27.150> I'll<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.420> put

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
by 1.4 millimeters and I'll just put

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.849 
by 1.4 millimeters and I'll just put
this<00:00:27.689> magnifying<00:00:28.230> glass<00:00:29.449> in<00:00:30.449> close<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
this magnifying glass in close so you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.830 
this magnifying glass in close so you
can<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.279> where<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.640> two<00:00:32.820> wires<00:00:33.090> come

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
can see there where the two wires come

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.780 
can see there where the two wires come
onto<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> circuit<00:00:34.800> board<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:37.790> elongated

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
onto the circuit board and the elongated

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.619 
onto the circuit board and the elongated
shape<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> LEDs<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:41.090> there<00:00:42.090> are<00:00:42.180> sixty

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
shape of the LEDs there there are sixty

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.220 
shape of the LEDs there there are sixty
surface-mount<00:00:43.620> LEDs<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.660> described<00:00:46.050> as

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
surface-mount LEDs and it's described as

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.420 
surface-mount LEDs and it's described as
being<00:00:46.440> equivalent<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.730> 100<00:00:48.690> watt<00:00:49.430> halogen

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
being equivalent to a 100 watt halogen

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
being equivalent to a 100 watt halogen
so<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.600> I'm<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.170> put<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
so what I'm going to do is put it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.369 
so what I'm going to do is put it
side-by-side<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> 50<00:00:54.149> watt<00:00:54.270> halogen<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
side-by-side with a 50 watt halogen and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.029 
side-by-side with a 50 watt halogen and
we'll<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.039> look<00:00:56.190> like

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
we'll see what they look like

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.130 
we'll see what they look like
unfortunately<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.690> cameras<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.840> really

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
unfortunately the cameras not really

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.590 
unfortunately the cameras not really
suited<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.280> showing<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> difference<00:01:03.420> between

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
suited to showing the difference between

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
suited to showing the difference between
these<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.080> bulbs<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:05.280> does<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.820> funny

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
these two bulbs it does all this funny

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
these two bulbs it does all this funny
strobing<00:01:06.689> business<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.380> um<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.340> gonna

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
strobing business but um so I'm gonna

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.130 
strobing business but um so I'm gonna
have<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> sort<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.119> describe<00:01:09.600> them

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
have to sort of describe them

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
have to sort of describe them
the<00:01:10.650> halogen<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> Left<00:01:11.700> isn't<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.090> 50<00:01:12.390> watt

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the halogen on the Left isn't a 50 watt

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000 
the halogen on the Left isn't a 50 watt
as<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.840> thought<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> was<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.830> only<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
as I thought it was it's actually only a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.749 
as I thought it was it's actually only a
35<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.750> LED<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> right<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.860> extremely

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
35 the LED on the right is extremely

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.330 
35 the LED on the right is extremely
bright<00:01:18.439> it's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.650> cooler<00:01:20.210> white<00:01:21.210> color<00:01:21.900> it's

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
bright it's a cooler white color it's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
bright it's a cooler white color it's
not<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.490> yellow<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.150> halogen<00:01:24.810> although

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
not as yellow as the halogen although

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
not as yellow as the halogen although
it's<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> warm<00:01:26.100> white<00:01:26.430> version<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> bulb

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's the warm white version of the bulb

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800 
it's the warm white version of the bulb
the<00:01:28.680> cool<00:01:29.159> white<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.670> probably<00:01:30.090> very<00:01:30.390> blue

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the cool white is probably very blue

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.170 
the cool white is probably very blue
probably<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:31.950> suitable<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> halogen

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
probably not suitable as a halogen

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.840 
probably not suitable as a halogen
replacement<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.159> it's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
replacement this one I think is it's

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.920 
replacement this one I think is it's
kind<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> day<00:01:36.750> white<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.380> describe<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
kind of day white I would describe it

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.330 
kind of day white I would describe it
because<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> surface<00:01:40.350> mount<00:01:40.530> LED<00:01:40.680> he's<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
because the surface mount LED he's if I

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.789 
because the surface mount LED he's if I
get<00:01:41.490> very<00:01:41.579> close<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.060> will<00:01:42.329> see<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:45.799> because

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
get very close you will see them because

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.030 
get very close you will see them because
they're<00:01:46.920> mounted<00:01:47.390> right<00:01:48.390> at<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> front<00:01:49.079> of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
they're mounted right at the front of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
they're mounted right at the front of
the<00:01:50.369> well<00:01:50.970> they<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> quite<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> wide

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the well they have a quite a wide

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.770 
the well they have a quite a wide
dispersion<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> spread<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> light<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
dispersion so the spread of light on the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.380 
dispersion so the spread of light on the
LED<00:01:55.170> bulb<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> certainly<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> lot<00:01:56.549> wider<00:01:56.909> than

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
LED bulb is certainly a lot wider than

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.100 
LED bulb is certainly a lot wider than
the<00:01:57.570> spread<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.890> halogen<00:01:59.540> in<00:02:00.540> terms<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the spread on the halogen in terms of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.719 
the spread on the halogen in terms of
heat<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.680> halogen<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.159> course<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.490> extremely

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
heat the halogen of course is extremely

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.760 
heat the halogen of course is extremely
hot<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.780> LED<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.430> running<00:02:05.430> quite<00:02:05.700> cool<00:02:06.770> really

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
hot the LED is running quite cool really

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.639 
hot the LED is running quite cool really
the<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> big<00:02:08.459> test<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.940> these<00:02:09.319> bulbs<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.500> how

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the the big test with these bulbs is how

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.300 
the the big test with these bulbs is how
long<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.009> last

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
long do they last

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.070 
long do they last
the<00:02:12.700> real<00:02:12.849> thing<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.150> want<00:02:13.360> from<00:02:13.569> an<00:02:13.720> LED

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
the real thing you want from an LED

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.030 
the real thing you want from an LED
halogen<00:02:15.069> equivalent<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:16.380> long<00:02:17.380> life<00:02:17.680> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
halogen equivalent is long life the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.760 
halogen equivalent is long life the
halogens<00:02:18.370> really<00:02:18.580> don't<00:02:18.760> last<00:02:18.940> very<00:02:19.090> long<00:02:19.770> you

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
halogens really don't last very long you

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.110 
halogens really don't last very long you
don't<00:02:20.860> have<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.099> problem<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.550> connectors

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
don't have the problem of connectors

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.059 
don't have the problem of connectors
burning<00:02:22.599> out<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.959> LEDs<00:02:23.380> because<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.890> heat

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
burning out the LEDs because the heat

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.680 
burning out the LEDs because the heat
really<00:02:24.370> doesn't<00:02:24.640> get<00:02:24.730> back<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.239> connector

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
really doesn't get back to the connector

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.070 
really doesn't get back to the connector
very<00:02:26.530> much<00:02:26.770> at<00:02:26.920> all<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:28.300> time<00:02:28.660> will<00:02:28.810> tell<00:02:29.019> but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
very much at all so time will tell but

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.750 
very much at all so time will tell but
certainly<00:02:29.860> I'm<00:02:29.950> very<00:02:29.980> impressed<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.519> very

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
certainly I'm very impressed it's very

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.150 
certainly I'm very impressed it's very
bright<00:02:31.410> as<00:02:32.410> for<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.650> hundred<00:02:32.920> watt<00:02:33.010> equivalent

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
bright as for a hundred watt equivalent

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.440 
bright as for a hundred watt equivalent
well<00:02:33.819> who<00:02:34.720> knows<00:02:35.160> 80<00:02:36.160> watt<00:02:36.430> maybe<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.330> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
well who knows 80 watt maybe but it is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.900 
well who knows 80 watt maybe but it is
brightest<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.980> good<00:02:39.160> deal<00:02:39.340> brighter<00:02:39.610> than

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
brightest it's a good deal brighter than

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.900 
brightest it's a good deal brighter than
the<00:02:40.709> 35<00:02:41.709> watt<00:02:41.920> halogen<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.430> because<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
the 35 watt halogen and because of the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.910 
the 35 watt halogen and because of the
very<00:02:42.940> wide<00:02:43.360> spread<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.050> just<00:02:44.230> get<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.380> lot<00:02:44.680> more

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
very wide spread you just get a lot more

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.460 
very wide spread you just get a lot more
light<00:02:45.130> into<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.580> room<00:02:45.810> rather<00:02:46.810> than<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.350> a

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
light into the room rather than just a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.250 
light into the room rather than just a
narrow<00:02:47.799> pool<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.489> light<00:02:48.730> I'll<00:02:49.540> try<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:49.930> find<00:02:50.080> a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
narrow pool of light I'll try and find a

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.449 
narrow pool of light I'll try and find a
way<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.940> getting<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:52.030> better<00:02:53.010> way<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.130> showing

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
way of getting a better way of showing

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.250 
way of getting a better way of showing
this<00:02:54.549> on<00:02:54.760> camera<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:55.330> at<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.870> moment<00:02:56.049> this

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
this on camera but at the moment this

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.330 
this on camera but at the moment this
iPod<00:02:57.190> isn't<00:02:57.519> really<00:02:57.730> playing<00:02:58.030> ball
