00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:17.190
 this is the record they have taken back 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.220
 he said is a collection pile of the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.860
 another two that he has made and is from yogurt and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.660
 non-verbal and here is your mother as 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.660
 It has always giving deception 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:40.429
 to see this album called new 6 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:47.350
 that's how I said right now because 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:47.350
 look what color of the network 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:59.020
 the remixing cut me a strong fear 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.020
 to hurt the earth and you have to turn 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:08.720
 but give nothing to the girl 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.720
 to the law 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.680
 good to see here is again and already 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.710
 you know that the disc is sold in the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.010
 stores in record stores in 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.400
 they all only cost and make them I know 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:32.460
 that life is very bad very bad very badly 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:35.060
 very bad but man what are you going to do 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.790
 areas 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.110
 they do not go anywhere though for 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.200
 some that's a lot of money no longer what 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.930
 I understand but man an effort 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.000
 we do again to see if in truth 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.540
 look you recite this one 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.190
 pretty and that is now clear lightly 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:06.880
 the truth 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:06.880
 I would throw it into the sea to see the earth 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:18.540
 by cited MadrileÃ±os of the league already came 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.140
 To nothing 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.260
 of the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.760
 the moon has cost me a lot to sing 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.400
 very much very much and press not 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.720
 I'm worth nothing I do not know what happens to me 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.610
 throat I have sung every j every jota 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.750
 in the slip I shit in the milk more 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.810
 those who lifted the turn 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.819
 but now they always forget the songs 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.189
 before 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.049
 the first time I heard in the canteen and 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.420
 so it was left and I stayed and now 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.310
 I do not have anything left is that I do not know 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.889
 nothing is left of nothing 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.519
 so look how beautiful to be with 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.409
 my little ears and I 've seen myself inside 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.359

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.530
 true because they are falling a lot 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:09.980
 hair so soon 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.209
 the moon gets the ball 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.209
 to go on stage 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.489
