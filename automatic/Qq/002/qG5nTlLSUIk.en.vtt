00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.049
 Hi, I'm going to make them 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.320
 a tutorial how to take care of your pockets 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:14.559
 The first thing you should do is have your 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.300
 guardiola ready and prepared because if 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:22.140
 has yes if you grab the fish tank and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.039
 at the beginning the fish may you always 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.329
 choose despite the little ones 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:33.230
 because they are more practical and more and more 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:36.309
 cheap but that's bad that you do not have 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.309
 a fish tank like this 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.000
 big because if the fish does not have 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:47.490
 enough oxygenation can die 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.060
 and you have to buy a filter so that 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.060
 exists 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.430
 their droppings and the food they leave 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.110
 our little fish you can also have 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 plants 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.430
 natural plants 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.790
 artificial plants I would recommend the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.170
 natural because they extend the life of the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.920
 weight 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.540
 I have different varieties of fish 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.030
 this this 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.450
 s 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 is 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.800
 this 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.590
 this 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.330
 you can have the fish that they 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.750
 but like raising fish tanks 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.750
 ball 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.780
 useless why 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 you do not do not need it because the fish 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.960
 do not grow these so small 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.350
 the golfers who are very big 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.259
 as 12 centimeters without counting the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.060
 fins that are very large 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.950
 this is one they are going to grow very large 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.270
 I'll keep making videos for the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.270
 see or for 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.960
 I have streaks 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.960
 and then I'll do another one on sales 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.100
 it's golf and they eat these kinds of 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.460
 of meals you can buy from 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.460
 is 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.049
 which are flakes 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.340
 or was the sword for tropical fish 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:40.340
 the blows are freshwater 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:44.420
 something you should not do is to put veins 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.420
 with fish goal because they are very aggressive me 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.420
 I put my fish without knowing that 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.970
 could happen and if they ate them 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.180
 I saw some who had the scales 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.200
 all this 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.370
 like this sweet tooth that had the scales 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.370
 all destroyed 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.370
 and something so that your plants are healthy 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.610
 is to put soil or substrate the substrate 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.730
 It is expensive but it does but it extends the life of 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.540
 plant 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.780
 the prisoners are happier 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.599
 something I recommend is not to put sand in myself 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.420
 I have sand because it is a heavier area and 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.910
 it does not stay down it's not flying in the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.940
 fishbowl 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.319
 and it can hurt and then also the 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.380
 light 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.740
 for the first the light 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.850
 here is a lid with light for the 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.370
 photosynthesis 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.220
 photosynthesis is necessary 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:56.670
 in plants for their food 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.290
 these plants do not occupy occupies rather 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.290
 they take many care 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.380
 I recommend you have lights 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.100
 have substrate have you been a 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.200
 co2 device 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.060
 to make them live longer 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.889
 the wolves 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.870
 they do not need a lot of care 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:31.370
 if you well if you well 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.919
 they will be alive and healthy for a long time I do not 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.979
 I would recommend that for diseases 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:40.930
 as it says it has knitted white purchased 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.930
 in this green bay 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.400
 to stop the diseases of the disabled 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.400
 and contradicts h 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:58.160
 here we have also 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.160
 methylene blue also for the same 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:11.510
 we also have this that is the 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:14.870
 neutral stress that takes away stress if you 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:20.129
 you have many fish do not give me overpopulate 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.669
 the fish tank should have at most about 10 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:27.239
 because they need space to grow 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:29.940
 this does not stress that grow 

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:34.200
 so live longer 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:38.160
 this is the redoubt ph if you want it 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.260
 have with fish that are this 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.120
 different species but be careful 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:48.380
 because the aggressive ones can hurt them 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.350
 how the blows are peaceful 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.000
 they may not attack them also for 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.060
 defend yourself this 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.780
 you need it for other species because 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.390
 if you have another fish with a 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.900
 precious dose may affect them the 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.900
 ph 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.000
 and another thing that is the ph 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.020
 the ph 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.020
 is this 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.610
 Well, I'll tell you 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.310
 but these do not need many 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:31.080
 how are you doing? 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:34.400
 detecting they are very pig 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.910
 this is that it affected a lot 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:41.270
 He does a lot of bathing and they eat a lot 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.220
 something I would recommend is not to give them no 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.800
 give them a lot of food 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.280
 and have them well-placed in a 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.270
 large pool if they have many fish in 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:57.120
 a small fish tank may die 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.400
 and something that you should never never have to 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.550
 to change the water 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.090
 and many times I would recommend that you 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.290
 they will change the water every month but not all 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.889
 the water 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:13.460
 I would say 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:16.310
 a quarter of the fish tank will be changed 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.710
 because you can because that one of them 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:23.199
 they produce bacteria the bacteria do not 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.199
 they need to against diseases 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.420
 and for an agreement like this you have it 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:32.950
 what to prepare 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.950
 then I will tell you how 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:40.550
 and these are my fish 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:45.310
 there we see each other for the other video 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.310
 I hope you have served this video bye
