00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 hello people under one of the past videos 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.480
 honest comments 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.330
 please tell me how to 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.900
 do bulbulyator and the water still 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:33.040
 Misha asks into the phone 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.180
 answering Misha I do not know how to 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.940
 where is the rule here to read how 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.450
 right well i did as i did 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.500
 that is, I looked like u guys like 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.700
 this is done there is a video on youtube 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.410
 as others do, well, let's say 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.770
 let's i can credit one of these 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.170
 which video I watched myself located 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.950
 below the video you can watch 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.290
 Well, I'll show you how I did this 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:08.409
 water seal well in common 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:10.630
 Bulbulyu Ie there is a tube and here 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.360
 when we dive through our top 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.600
 some water flows and we constantly 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.250
 forced to purge for this 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.720
 underwater hunters came up with so 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.229
 called hydrolock or bulbulator 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.870
 what they do they do right here 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:37.420
 let's say so kernel air cap even 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:40.510
 the box turns out so here's the principle 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.430
 actions from above we dress the bottle when 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.460
 we dive the air stays in the top 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.869
 up is already at our neck 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:53.290
 tubes so when we dive 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.390
 and don't roll over underwater just 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.340
 so here we dive so that is ducked 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.290
 surfaced dive surfaced then we 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.850
 the tubule is constantly dry we don't need 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.310
 constantly blown 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.960
 well, and therefore we do not make a noise award 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.390
 no extra noise we will not 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.039
 publish when we blow syava grandfather 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.090
 constantly gurgling is not some noise 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.879
 shuffling product extra noise fish afraid 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.939
 and leaves therefore from the guys came up here 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.920
 such a thing well, I personally to this tube 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.109
 could not pick up some jar for a long time 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.600
 which is the diameter for me here 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.720
 here 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.230
 then I found a jar is a jar usually 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.090
 This Volsk vitamins is not advertising 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920
 it's just showing a jar which is me 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.360
 came up 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.640
 what is this jar good on top and 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.850
 here we have a cap and there is already ready 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.350
 hole diameter 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.780
 which fits the diameter clearly here 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:51.840
 she is well here on the straw 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.550
 in order not to block access 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.250
 air that is, if my tube is just 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.280
 die in banks but yah you know on 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.490
 close ourselves 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.040
 air is air access so i did 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.750
 I took the following procedure 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:16.500
 hole punch normal and here is the maximum 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:20.160
 diameter let's say then done dirt here 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.480
 so here in the edge of the tube at the very top 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.760
 tubes at the end 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 put on holes that is now if I even 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.810
 I'll close the phone completely 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:35.880
 omission of a finger look I basically 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.100
 I can breathe easy well even 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.580
 can breathe deeply yes that is in 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:47.220
 principle does not interfere with the fact that the top will 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:50.430
 something is there that way i can not 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.930
 just put the water like this 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:58.830
 end of the tube and I can and just rest on 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.320
 The bottom of the jar is what will give me this 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.550
 there will be a tubule or rather a jar will not 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.650
 hanging by itself 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.320
 guys just here somehow electrical tape i 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.280
 wrapped a bunch of electrical tape well, I personally 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.080
 such an idea is not very liking therefore 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.780
 so that the bank does not hang out, I decided here 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.380
 here are a bunch of holes here 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.950
 on top and just rest and this one 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.280
 jar 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.230
 just in front of this tube end 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.690
 but in the banks then it will be like 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.650
 hard to stand well see for yourself what 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.810
 a little bank 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.880
 easy part slides back and forth for 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.419
 this i took a piece of electrical tape will do 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.990
 who probably 57 tapes and here 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.949
 now something 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:48.430
 I have my jar very tight and clear 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:56.620
 here falls into place we do not have 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:05:00.789
 written 17 no idea so now 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.750
 I do not play here that is 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.850
 little bottle here on top here is a jar well 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.610
 do not move, that is, two points 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.949
 supports point of support here even nowhere 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.460
 there are a lot of them small and yes point 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.490
 supports 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.340
 2 that is, here are two points of support and 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.930
 a bottle of this here or a jar like 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.389
 want to call and that is she in 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.729
 principle now one thing together with here 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.289
 this story well I know very often 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:32.699
 the guys are just tying the jar 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.110
 electrical tape electrical tape water soaks 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.210
 unwound and here is this jar they 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.760
 just then somewhere on the current loses and 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.070
 already have to hunt without further 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.430
 banks that delivers certain 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.010
 inconvenience well as an example, here I am talking 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.210
 a link below you can see the second 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:54.039
 an example of how a person decided to do 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.630
 similar system but how would your 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:01.120
 improvised some other 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:04.360
 there he found a jar when I decided 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.550
 This problem is exactly the same. 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.620
 this dragon 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.449
 so that we came here 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.530
 water and so that we can breathe 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.389
 on the case in two rows here and so in two 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.310
 a number of holes made these holes in 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.240
 principle is quite enough 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.430
 and quite for the eyes and enough for the eyes 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.800
 so that I can breathe easy but even 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.870
 not calm even deep 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.520
 let's say so decide to and feast ventilation 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.260
 easy to do once blow well 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.360
 prodyshalsya before nakom to 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.020
 product well here these please 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.120
 fools 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.699
 and my eyes are enough and one more plus 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.620
 These are the stories that the first plus 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.680
 this is something that we are not noisy second plus this 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:51.300
 the fact that 1 dry tube always stays up 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.940
 we do not swallow the water well, and the third plus 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.190
 that when you are in the evening or something 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.669
 just pops up this first step you can 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:05.159
 inhale and tighten a bunch of mosquitoes yourself 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:07.569
 right in the lungs well there were cases like guys 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:09.340
 told that mosquitoes are downright and 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:12.190
 you take a breath and you there 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.199
 about five mosquitoes immediately flies so 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.919
 This story is very 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:20.289
 many problems how would i solve this 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:22.659
 a question for yourself is about to take place 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:26.889
 so here we see here even before 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:29.560
 polushka such there is a point of contact spot 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:33.389
 contact is very clear and everything is wonderful 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.520
 Well, in principle, in principle, somehow so I 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:39.780
 I hope someone this video was useful 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.780
 all bye bye
