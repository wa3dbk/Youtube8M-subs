00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
alright guys welcome back so how do we

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.140 
alright guys welcome back so how do we
export<00:00:02.879> there<00:00:03.149> are<00:00:03.270> so<00:00:03.600> many<00:00:04.200> settings<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.490> to

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
export there are so many settings and to

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.960 
export there are so many settings and to
me<00:00:06.560> it<00:00:07.560> all<00:00:07.710> depends<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.130> what<00:00:08.309> you're<00:00:08.460> doing

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
me it all depends on what you're doing

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.370 
me it all depends on what you're doing
I<00:00:09.000> do<00:00:09.120> screencast<00:00:09.960> tutorials<00:00:10.679> so<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.130> do

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
I do screencast tutorials so I just do

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.790 
I do screencast tutorials so I just do
720<00:00:13.610> HD<00:00:14.610> if<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.690> were<00:00:15.809> doing<00:00:15.900> action<00:00:16.350> stuff<00:00:16.590> like

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
720 HD if I were doing action stuff like

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.470 
720 HD if I were doing action stuff like
snowboarding<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.640> mountain<00:00:17.910> biking<00:00:18.330> or

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
snowboarding or mountain biking or

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.380 
snowboarding or mountain biking or
fishing<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.109> would<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.770> 1080<00:00:20.369> HD<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.180> would

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
fishing I would do 1080 HD or I would

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.509 
fishing I would do 1080 HD or I would
just<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> custom<00:00:22.199> preset<00:00:22.380> all<00:00:23.279> these

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
just have a custom preset all these

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
just have a custom preset all these
options<00:00:23.939> are<00:00:24.090> determined<00:00:24.600> by<00:00:24.810> bit<00:00:25.560> rate<00:00:25.769> which

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
options are determined by bit rate which

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.679 
options are determined by bit rate which
is<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> number<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.730> bits<00:00:26.939> per<00:00:27.060> second

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
is the number of bits per second

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.870 
is the number of bits per second
transmitting<00:00:28.320> data<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.609> does<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
transmitting data so like what does it

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.959 
transmitting data so like what does it
affect<00:00:30.179> higher<00:00:30.810> bitrate<00:00:31.109> well<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.430> file<00:00:32.669> size

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
affect higher bitrate well the file size

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.760 
affect higher bitrate well the file size
and<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> quality<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.870> your<00:00:33.960> videos<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.649> we

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and the quality of your videos so we

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.310 
and the quality of your videos so we
have<00:00:35.360> presets<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.630> could<00:00:36.780> look<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.020> YouTube

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
have presets we could look at YouTube

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.950 
have presets we could look at YouTube
right<00:00:37.469> here<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> file<00:00:37.980> size<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.750> twenty<00:00:39.750> point

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
right here the file size is twenty point

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.299 
right here the file size is twenty point
six<00:00:40.230> megabytes<00:00:40.559> well<00:00:41.160> let's<00:00:41.370> look<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.640> 1080<00:00:42.059> HD

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
six megabytes well let's look at 1080 HD

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
six megabytes well let's look at 1080 HD
twenty<00:00:44.309> point<00:00:44.520> six<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> same<00:00:45.570> thing

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
twenty point six so it's the same thing

twenty point six so it's the same thing
YouTube's<00:00:46.559> preset<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.309> sets<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.640> 1080p

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149

don't<00:00:58.859> recommend<00:00:59.670> doing<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
don't recommend doing that so we have a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
don't recommend doing that so we have a
custom<00:01:02.879> preset<00:01:03.059> which<00:01:03.660> I've<00:01:03.840> never<00:01:04.080> found<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
custom preset which I've never found to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340 
custom preset which I've never found to
be<00:01:04.799> better<00:01:05.010> than<00:01:05.270> 1080<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.869> takes<00:01:07.140> up

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
be better than 1080 it just takes up

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.700 
be better than 1080 it just takes up
more<00:01:07.500> space<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.159> computer<00:01:09.560> dragged<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
more space on my computer dragged to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.080 
more space on my computer dragged to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the GoPro Sunna forum this Jack's it up

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
the GoPro Sunna forum this Jack's it up
and<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:25.140> haven't<00:01:25.950> been<00:01:26.369> able<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> tell<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and I I haven't been able to tell a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
and I I haven't been able to tell a
difference<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> what<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
difference so what I do if it's a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.300 
difference so what I do if it's a
screencast<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.439> mean<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.650> all<00:01:31.770> depends<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.130> what

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
screencast I mean it all depends on what

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.830 
screencast I mean it all depends on what
you're<00:01:32.460> filming<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:33.030> videos<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.509> make<00:01:33.689> I

or<00:01:59.490> something<00:02:00.049> just<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.680> set<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.009> HD<00:02:02.969> 720

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
or something just have it set to HD 720

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.480 
or something just have it set to HD 720
set<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> your<00:02:04.200> desktop<00:02:05.420> 720

underscore HD to YouTube export it take

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.580 
underscore HD to YouTube export it take
a<00:02:15.200> second<00:02:15.709> boom<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:18.290> takes<00:02:18.500> a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
a second boom just like that it takes a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.770 
a second boom just like that it takes a
while<00:02:18.770> just<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.370> export<00:02:19.819> your<00:02:20.000> desktop<00:02:20.480> and

while just to export your desktop and

while just to export your desktop and
then<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.290> takes<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.590> long<00:02:21.770> time<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:22.040> export<00:02:22.670> to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
then it takes a long time to export to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.120 
then it takes a long time to export to
