00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.360
 the camera takes three frames 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.230
 we can and see

 the camera makes an insane amount 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.730
 frames as a result we have such a picture 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.730
 which we can certainly see 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.480
 full see in Kiev 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.840
 and the full screen camera will stay there with 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.550
 they have a position, however 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.110
 we can do it ourselves 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.110
 flipping through 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.470
 well 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.470
 left talking to 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.039
 image stabilization 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.119
 here is the percentage 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.119
 so i already talked lost 2 gdp by 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:15.349
 the forum 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.299
 image stabilization 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.389
 refined 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.219
 I'm not going to show him now 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:20.969
 So 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.719
 we see images on camera now 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.269
 cherish 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.569
 pretty much 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.569
 Now bring multiple hosumi it is understandable 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.109
 now we focus and yana 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.309
 stop going 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.599
 let's get a look 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.549
 and miraculously analogue expensive 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.229
 stopped 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.709
 we drop again going up 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.739
 stopped again 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.779
 function works 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.619
 well he is wonderful in all 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:52.069
 relationship in my opinion one points 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.589
 of the best stabilization 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:54.939
 Images 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.939
 which are on the market 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.969
 and what else in the statute will we talk 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.019
 of course let's talk mode 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.449
 tame 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.919
 wherein 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.339
 which can 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.339
 a lot of things to do 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:14.809
 In this case, change the value 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.809
 salt white balance focus 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.289
 and so on of course there is 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:23.589
 smile recognition mode 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.009
 which is present in many devices 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.009
 this company and indeed on the market 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.859
 let's see how to shoot 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.369
 in manual mode 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.629
 here so removes 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.299
 well and of course we set talk a little more 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:47.739
 positive
