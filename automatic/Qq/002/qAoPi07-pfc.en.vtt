00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
this video I'm going to talk about what

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.650 
this video I'm going to talk about what
I<00:00:04.680> think<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.009> best<00:00:05.220> weapons<00:00:05.640> are<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:06.000> Game<00:00:06.450> bra

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
I think the best weapons are in Game bra

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.140 
I think the best weapons are in Game bra
busters<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:08.010> redoing<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.519> video<00:00:08.790> because

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
busters I'm redoing the video because

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
busters I'm redoing the video because
last<00:00:09.660> time<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.960> did<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.110> video<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.710> did<00:00:11.190> it

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
last time I did this video I did it

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.150 
last time I did this video I did it
before<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.940> patch<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.509> now<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.740> damage

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
before the patch and now all the damage

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.210 
before the patch and now all the damage
has<00:00:14.549> changed<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.680> some<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.859> weapons<00:00:16.980> that

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
has changed so some of the weapons that

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.550 
has changed so some of the weapons that
previously<00:00:18.150> were<00:00:18.390> good<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.779> no<00:00:19.080> longer<00:00:19.320> as

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
previously were good are no longer as

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.769 
previously were good are no longer as
good<00:00:19.770> anymore<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.180> guess<00:00:21.359> I'll<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.539> jump

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
good anymore so I guess I'll just jump

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.080 
good anymore so I guess I'll just jump
into<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.160> we're<00:00:23.340> looking<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.850> slugger

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
into it so we're looking at the slugger

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
into it so we're looking at the slugger
right<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.869> let's<00:00:25.019> go<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> all<00:00:25.619> right

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
right here so let's go to all right

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.640 
right here so let's go to all right
let's<00:00:26.490> go<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> store<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> clip<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> go

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
let's go to the store of the clip and go

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.460 
let's go to the store of the clip and go
to<00:00:28.710> weapons<00:00:29.070> okay<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:30.029> previously<00:00:30.900> said<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to weapons okay so I previously said the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
to weapons okay so I previously said the
zebra<00:00:31.740> bat<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> best<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.820> that's<00:00:33.750> not

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
zebra bat was the best but that's not

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
zebra bat was the best but that's not
really<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> case<00:00:34.350> anymore<00:00:35.010> um<00:00:35.660> like<00:00:36.660> ice<00:00:36.750> will

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
really the case anymore um like ice will

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.389 
really the case anymore um like ice will
start<00:00:37.110> off<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.469> continuous<00:00:37.950> fire<00:00:38.129> which<00:00:38.309> is

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
start off with continuous fire which is

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.959 
start off with continuous fire which is
trainee<00:00:38.610> ball<00:00:38.820> uh<00:00:39.079> I<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.969> like

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
trainee ball uh I don't think like

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.690 
trainee ball uh I don't think like
continuous<00:00:42.450> fire<00:00:42.600> used<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> best<00:00:43.710> like

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
continuous fire used to be the best like

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
continuous fire used to be the best like
but<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.600> i'm<00:00:45.809> pretty<00:00:46.050> sure<00:00:46.260> trinity<00:00:46.800> ball<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
but now i'm pretty sure trinity ball is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400 
but now i'm pretty sure trinity ball is
a<00:00:47.340> lot<00:00:47.579> better<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.570> does<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.110> much

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
a lot better just because does so much

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.950 
a lot better just because does so much
damage<00:00:49.680> compared<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> continuous<00:00:51.180> fire<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.750> i

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
damage compared to continuous fire so i

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.619 
damage compared to continuous fire so i
recommend<00:00:52.829> using<00:00:53.190> trinity<00:00:53.579> ball<00:00:53.730> um<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
recommend using trinity ball um the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.410 
recommend using trinity ball um the
majority<00:00:54.899> people<00:00:55.399> aight<00:00:56.399> aight<00:00:56.640> still<00:00:56.879> 50-50

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
majority people aight aight still 50-50

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.000 
majority people aight aight still 50-50
like<00:00:57.629> people<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.379> still<00:00:58.469> trying<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> figure

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
like people are still trying to figure

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.279 
like people are still trying to figure
out<00:00:59.160> what's<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> best<00:00:59.399> but<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> still<00:01:01.079> think

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
out what's the best but I still think

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.750 
out what's the best but I still think
Trinity<00:01:01.469> well<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> best<00:01:01.920> even<00:01:02.399> though<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
Trinity well is the best even though I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
Trinity well is the best even though I
use<00:01:02.850> continuous<00:01:03.210> fire<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.680> time<00:01:04.949> bomb

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
use continuous fire and then time bomb

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.730 
use continuous fire and then time bomb
vs<00:01:05.460> big<00:01:05.640> ball<00:01:05.900> hi<00:01:06.900> mom<00:01:07.110> used<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> best

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
vs big ball hi mom used to be the best

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.460 
vs big ball hi mom used to be the best
but<00:01:08.100> now<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.240> starting<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.689> big<00:01:10.229> ball

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
but now I'm starting to think big ball

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.510 
but now I'm starting to think big ball
is<00:01:11.100> pretty<00:01:11.490> good<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.650> time<00:01:14.159> bomb<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
is pretty good so like time bomb you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
is pretty good so like time bomb you
sicced<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:14.880> multiple<00:01:15.299> people<00:01:15.420> stores<00:01:16.290> lots<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sicced on multiple people stores lots of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
sicced on multiple people stores lots of
people<00:01:16.740> big<00:01:16.890> ball<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.250> does<00:01:17.400> loads<00:01:18.240> amounts

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
people big ball just does loads amounts

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.950 
people big ball just does loads amounts
of<00:01:18.900> damage<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.210> still<00:01:21.390> 5050

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
of damage so I think it's still 5050

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.649 
of damage so I think it's still 5050
between<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.500> bat<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.790> you're<00:01:24.030> doing<00:01:24.360> pvp

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
between the bat like if you're doing pvp

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.590 
between the bat like if you're doing pvp
I'd<00:01:25.229> say<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.340> Trinity<00:01:26.790> ball<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:27.450> either

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I'd say use Trinity ball and then either

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380 
I'd say use Trinity ball and then either
time<00:01:27.930> Ballmer<00:01:28.140> big<00:01:28.350> ball<00:01:28.579> but<00:01:29.579> you're<00:01:30.090> doing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
time Ballmer big ball but you're doing

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.719 
time Ballmer big ball but you're doing
boss<00:01:31.350> battle<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:32.250> gonna<00:01:32.340> want<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> go

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
boss battle then you're gonna want to go

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.140 
boss battle then you're gonna want to go
continuous<00:01:33.210> fire<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.689> big<00:01:33.900> ball<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.310> yeah<00:01:35.460> it's

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
continuous fire in big ball so yeah it's

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.929 
continuous fire in big ball so yeah it's
basically<00:01:37.140> whatever<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:37.920> there's<00:01:38.759> not

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
basically whatever you think there's not

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.289 
basically whatever you think there's not
really<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> best<00:01:39.270> Locker<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.900> anyone

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
using six years till I see a few people

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.160 
using six years till I see a few people
using<00:01:55.439> 92<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.689> no<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.049> uses

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
using 92 and then no one really uses

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.850 
using 92 and then no one really uses
wall<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.860> basically<00:01:59.729> i<00:01:59.759> recommend<00:02:00.299> for

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
wall so basically i recommend for

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.620 
wall so basically i recommend for
firefighter<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.090> six<00:02:03.090> shooter<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
firefighter is six shooter because it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840 
firefighter is six shooter because it
does<00:02:03.719> more<00:02:03.930> damage<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> Riddler

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
does more damage and like the Riddler

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.069 
does more damage and like the Riddler
about<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> same<00:02:06.299> range<00:02:06.540> anyways<00:02:06.869> them

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
about the same range anyways them

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.020 
about the same range anyways them
there's<00:02:07.829> only<00:02:08.099> maybe<00:02:08.429> local<00:02:08.849> square<00:02:09.119> where

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
there's only maybe local square where

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.000 
there's only maybe local square where
you<00:02:10.390> will<00:02:11.110> have<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> hard<00:02:11.440> time<00:02:11.530> she<00:02:11.770> can<00:02:11.920> go

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
you will have a hard time she can go

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.910 
you will have a hard time she can go
across<00:02:12.069> summer<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.819> then<00:02:13.810> i'd<00:02:14.500> recommend

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
across summer and then i'd recommend

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.410 
across summer and then i'd recommend
six-shooter<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.490> mind<00:02:15.730> ball<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.240> would

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
six-shooter in mind ball so that would

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.100 
six-shooter in mind ball so that would
be<00:02:16.450> either<00:02:17.440> gold<00:02:17.800> lightning<00:02:18.220> or<00:02:18.690> steel<00:02:19.690> pig<00:02:20.280> so

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
be either gold lightning or steel pig so

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.110 
be either gold lightning or steel pig so
rocker<00:02:23.110> uh<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:26.340> plasma<00:02:27.340> ball<00:02:27.489> is<00:02:27.640> pretty<00:02:27.940> bad

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
rocker uh I plasma ball is pretty bad

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.479 
rocker uh I plasma ball is pretty bad
let's<00:02:28.330> look<00:02:28.420> at<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.720> 1i<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.830> use

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
let's look at the 1i have so I use

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.820 
let's look at the 1i have so I use
electric<00:02:30.880> mission<00:02:31.209> because<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:31.750> amazing<00:02:32.230> it

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the one person plasma balls is range but

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.180 
the one person plasma balls is range but
like<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:41.200> kind<00:02:41.350> of<00:02:41.380> unnecessary<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:42.070> like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
like it's kind of unnecessary it's like

just because like we've lost games

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.470 
just because like we've lost games
because<00:03:02.560> they're<00:03:02.739> shooting<00:03:03.130> people<00:03:03.480> away

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
because they're shooting people away

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.840

because it's knock people back all that

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.580 
because it's knock people back all that
your<00:03:07.060> carpet<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.510> really<00:03:07.870> good<00:03:07.989> stuns<00:03:08.260> people

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
your carpet is really good stuns people

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.320 
your carpet is really good stuns people
and<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.069> does<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.220> lot<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.459> damage<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:10.000> think<00:03:10.239> it's

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
and it does a lot of damage I think it's

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.150 
and it does a lot of damage I think it's
got<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> bigger<00:03:10.690> radius<00:03:10.900> than<00:03:11.350> sonic

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
got a bigger radius than sonic

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.699 
got a bigger radius than sonic
explosions<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.090> recommend<00:03:13.810> getting<00:03:14.350> purple

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
explosions so I recommend getting purple

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.039

see a lot of people now using the flame
blub<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.560> because<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:48.820> attack<00:03:49.180> faster<00:03:49.660> and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
blub just because you attack faster and

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.449 
blub just because you attack faster and
you<00:03:50.980> can<00:03:51.100> overwhelm<00:03:51.549> people<00:03:51.670> with<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:52.750> uh

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
you can overwhelm people with it so uh

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.920 
you can overwhelm people with it so uh
it<00:03:54.459> used<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.730> be<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.090> was<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.390> best<00:03:55.540> but

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
it used to be that this was the best but

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.370 
it used to be that this was the best but
now<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:56.739> think<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.549> see<00:03:58.239> 50<00:03:58.570> 50<00:03:58.900> now<00:03:59.049> between

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
now I think I see 50 50 now between

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.130 
now I think I see 50 50 now between
these<00:03:59.560> two<00:03:59.709> weapons<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.280> think<00:04:01.120> if<00:04:01.510> you're<00:04:01.930> just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
these two weapons I think if you're just

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.170 
these two weapons I think if you're just
starting<00:04:02.230> out<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.799> game<00:04:02.980> you'd<00:04:03.820> might<00:04:04.000> want

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
starting out the game you'd might want

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.520 
starting out the game you'd might want
to<00:04:04.269> start<00:04:04.420> off<00:04:04.540> with<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:04.870> weapon<00:04:05.019> here<00:04:05.290> like

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
to start off with this weapon here like

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.020 
to start off with this weapon here like
to<00:04:05.799> be<00:04:05.890> on<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.010> shockwave<00:04:06.280> an<00:04:06.519> uppercut<00:04:06.850> is

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
to be on a shockwave an uppercut is

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.910 
to be on a shockwave an uppercut is
personal<00:04:07.900> preference<00:04:08.079> i<00:04:08.320> think<00:04:08.500> uppercuts

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
personal preference i think uppercuts

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.759 
personal preference i think uppercuts
better<00:04:09.160> though<00:04:09.370> but<00:04:09.750> still<00:04:10.750> doesn't<00:04:11.410> they're

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
better though but still doesn't they're

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.170 
better though but still doesn't they're
not<00:04:11.890> like<00:04:12.070> that<00:04:12.250> big<00:04:12.459> they're<00:04:13.000> not<00:04:13.120> a

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
not like that big they're not a

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.490
