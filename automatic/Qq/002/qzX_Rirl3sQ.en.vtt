00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.560
 hello friends here I'm going to show cut puyo estic 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.530
 Arcadian 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.520
 for me it is terrifying ipc 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.490
 not all the instructions for the team stated that they exist but in this 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.099
 case 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.689
 division for 2015 was small 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.349
 very comfortable for the desk 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.109
 What I did was 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.320
 uncover the keyboard remove the back cover 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.550
 then pull out all we aspire to that is worth the metal mine that goes 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.110
 in 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.110
 with the axis so that they are all equal but very impulsive and 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.820
 in fact, they all have 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.820
 the printed circuit board that contains a chip 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.230
 this sense the candidate but the club gijonés and the intendenta s 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 the computer 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 of the fluid and you have to make that street the metal sheet 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.920
 sic and others 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.110
 the blanquita 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.300
 the wound in one eye has 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.780
 a lot of contact 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.730
 it's a final and the columns in front 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.620
 I tb keyboard we also have on your side futoshi toba and 100 where they arrive 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.620
 all the paths of the ball 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.060
 almost everything went well of this type 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.740
 they are the same way until they are hard composed 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.500
 the ceiba on the one hand 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.400
 the base and of a rubber base in this case in the round of 16 as acts but 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.140
 there 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.670
 in the same movie or 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.000
 another that walks an increase one as individual 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.090
 I'm much more comfortable when it's a rubber keyboard in different areas 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.960
 towel 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 Anderson in this case 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.950
 on the one hand more important 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.470
 his words achieves mapped keyboards 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.740
 you have a foot 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.710
 april the keyboard the two bands thank you because I watched a movie up 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.610
 where there is a great centenary base 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.979
 it seems that at his age 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.370
 behind only 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.830
 I was single reader and giuseppe thader this middle band does not have any 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.050
 type of contacts and only for what 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.050
 lets go when one grows one the key 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.180
 will make contact the top part by the bottom of its producing 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.680
 the reconduction 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.550
 now codeff said for juan kills the keyboard you have to follow each of the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.509
 roads 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.299
 in this case the good thing here I have doubts the arrows 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.489
 top down left to right 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.189
 this is evident that must be done 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.629
 that and all the roads 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.009
 for example there we want the i key or left down 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.889
 and right are exactly the same connection challenges she is exportable 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.599
 that later because the material they will have to join now 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.769
 he has also given alonso corresponding buttons 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.559
 this year the button above and it's worth what the locals shuffled 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.529
 and on the other side 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.529
 the other part the matrix 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.090
 we have the button 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.799
 d the corresponding to each rival 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.709
 and to the left according to him 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.559
 it will be another cable 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.949
 the button down another cable 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.929
 diego where the local right remember that yesterday gold key hit him 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.809
 therefore such a local investment now everything started way 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:08.840
 those contacts 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.819
 who thinks kilos up to x to the edge collector 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.529
 asq 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.529
 and the edge collector in turn that's why everything has to be creating a piece of paper 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:18.679
 to move 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.469
 and then he connected his double 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.449
 printed circuit 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.739
 you have to pay for the cables 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.469
 for later devils -actually connect 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.599
 what am I worth 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.899
 now I'm going to see 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.899
 quito 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.029
 if you can see here 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:42.239
 like me south of the channels from the back of the network removing to 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.459
 fly from there we are going 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.099
 so that the one who made it work 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.159
 and to his understanding a collector of 9 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.059
 and for those of santoro 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:54.059
 2 to 2 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.029
 to the touch we are well 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:57.049
 now I am 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.789
 the strict sense that the team 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:01.589
 the deadly kombat 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.589
 but how can I make a novel as I want, for example? 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.999
 here I have others 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.999
 I used to play aitana actress 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:16.329
 if you beat well who wanted to loma pytá guaymate checkups 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.729
 it refers to being a map of the connections all of you 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.430
 later I do not know why that evil was done on paper 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.729
 massol doctor or cable as befits the buttons 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.139
 of the bank and then with him 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.340
 the facts 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.590
 now to avoid the problem when a person goes from buttons at the same time 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.240
 Sometimes the Lombards do not linger 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.020
 the pain can not 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.300
 hello friends and how this factory to the keyboard can be watered baetica same 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.879
 weather 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.539
 this got confused in each button 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.419
 Seita this problem for example 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.500
 hello fatality of euros to predict the deadly tepuy kombat uribe pointed out that 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.720
 all buttons down 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.940
 also the balance down and then with 4 webster the opponent to 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.090
 Water 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.800
 in an Indian styx kid that can not be done at least in this one when I 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.310
 manufacture could not be done 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.139
 it does not work 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.180
 and everything gave 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.860
 and so bonuses 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.169
 with the demi moore exit 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.639
 in my house there is no street 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.509
 in this case the v8 only 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.559
 for all this amount of fabric and even don mario vázquez m 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.939
 this is called that you have to order a job the regulator that you like 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:26.400
 in this case the mother 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.559
 and load the game that you like 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.229
 and they are going to 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.059
 roberts eta 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.680
 impute 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.770
 and here you can choose 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.639
 the ship to earth whatever they want 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.229
 who manages like 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.449
 I have no fact and so no 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.819
 I could not do 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:48.800
 there is no more
