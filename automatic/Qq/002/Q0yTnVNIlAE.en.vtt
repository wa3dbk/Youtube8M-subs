now I'm using my pink tip here and this

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.240 
now I'm using my pink tip here and this
is<00:05:26.669> just<00:05:26.819> a<00:05:26.970> quick<00:05:27.300> quick<00:05:27.990> practice<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.979> do<00:05:29.129> the

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
is just a quick quick practice to do the

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:41.350 
is just a quick quick practice to do the
do<00:05:29.639> the<00:05:29.669> braided<00:05:30.240> hair

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.689 

in<00:05:41.960> order<00:05:42.319> for<00:05:42.349> the<00:05:42.620> icing<00:05:43.039> to<00:05:43.069> hold<00:05:43.400> its<00:05:43.610> shape

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
in order for the icing to hold its shape

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.899 
in order for the icing to hold its shape
it<00:05:44.090> has<00:05:44.270> to<00:05:44.479> be<00:05:44.659> stiffer<00:05:45.229> consistency<00:05:46.129> if<00:05:46.699> you

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
it has to be stiffer consistency if you

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.749 
it has to be stiffer consistency if you
were<00:05:47.030> to<00:05:47.240> use<00:05:47.449> a<00:05:47.960> flat<00:05:48.280> consistency<00:05:49.280> like<00:05:49.460> 10

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
were to use a flat consistency like 10

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.770 
were to use a flat consistency like 10
second<00:05:50.210> or<00:05:50.419> 15<00:05:50.870> second<00:05:51.229> realizing<00:05:52.569> you<00:05:53.569> won't

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
second or 15 second realizing you won't

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.580 
second or 15 second realizing you won't
be<00:05:53.900> able<00:05:53.990> to<00:05:54.259> do<00:05:54.409> that<00:05:54.849> braided<00:05:55.849> technique<00:05:56.780> the

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
be able to do that braided technique the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.070 
be able to do that braided technique the
icing<00:05:57.979> would<00:05:58.189> just<00:05:58.490> blend<00:05:59.180> together<00:05:59.449> and<00:05:59.930> you

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
icing would just blend together and you

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.920 
icing would just blend together and you
wouldn't<00:06:00.319> have<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:01.330> texture<00:06:02.330> there<00:06:02.569> so

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
wouldn't have the texture there so

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.779 
wouldn't have the texture there so
that's<00:06:03.319> how<00:06:03.469> you<00:06:03.590> can<00:06:03.919> make<00:06:04.129> the<00:06:04.340> braided<00:06:04.759> hair

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
that's how you can make the braided hair

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.600 
that's how you can make the braided hair
and<00:06:05.469> we're<00:06:06.469> going<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.680> finish<00:06:06.860> adding<00:06:07.370> some

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
and we're going to finish adding some

00:06:07.610 --> 00:07:00.690 
and we're going to finish adding some
details<00:06:08.030> with<00:06:08.270> green<00:06:09.080> and<00:06:09.409> pink<00:06:09.919> royal<00:06:10.250> icing

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.930 

and<00:07:00.850> that's<00:07:01.600> how<00:07:01.900> you<00:07:01.960> can<00:07:02.290> make<00:07:02.320> an<00:07:02.830> Adele<00:07:03.550> the

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940
