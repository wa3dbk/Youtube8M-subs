just<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.190> few<00:03:53.370> selections<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.209> some<00:03:54.780> brush

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
just a few selections and some brush

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.220 
just a few selections and some brush
strokes<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:56.090> quick<00:03:57.090> tip<00:03:57.299> on<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.600> reflections

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.050 
strokes a quick tip on the reflections
here<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.500> get<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.799> perfect<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.760> will<00:03:59.880> see

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
here to get this perfect you will see

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.420 
here to get this perfect you will see
you<00:04:00.209> have<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.480> reflection<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.920> created

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
you have the reflection is created

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.630 
you have the reflection is created
automatically<00:04:03.000> by<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.269> smart<00:04:03.600> object<00:04:05.390> if<00:04:06.390> you

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
automatically by the smart object if you

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.310 
automatically by the smart object if you
this<00:04:08.640> has<00:04:08.850> some<00:04:09.060> layers<00:04:09.209> or<00:04:09.570> stars<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.170> for

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
this has some layers or stars on it for

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.930 
this has some layers or stars on it for
example<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.769> blur<00:04:10.950> if<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.220> remove<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.730> blur

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
example the blur if you remove the blur

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.060 
example the blur if you remove the blur
you<00:04:12.390> get<00:04:12.570> you<00:04:13.110> get<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.730> more<00:04:15.650> more<00:04:16.650> reflective

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
you get you get a more more reflective

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.060 
you get you get a more more reflective
more<00:04:17.640> glossy<00:04:18.269> version<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.380> prefer<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.859> blood

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
more glossy version I prefer the blood

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.070 
more glossy version I prefer the blood
kind<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:20.669> looks<00:04:20.880> more<00:04:21.209> natural<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.720> me<00:04:21.810> but<00:04:21.989> if

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
kind of looks more natural to me but if

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.110 
kind of looks more natural to me but if
you<00:04:22.109> want<00:04:22.320> more<00:04:22.650> gloss<00:04:22.950> either<00:04:23.430> reduce<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
you want more gloss either reduce the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.480 
you want more gloss either reduce the
blur<00:04:24.330> here<00:04:24.599> of<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:24.930> layer<00:04:25.440> style<00:04:25.770> or<00:04:25.979> simply

blur here of this layer style or simply

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.870 
blur here of this layer style or simply
remove

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
remove

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.330 
remove
it<00:04:27.030> overall<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.840> also<00:04:28.320> if<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.830> want<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.100> get

it overall and also if you want to get

it overall and also if you want to get
this<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.120> obviously<00:04:30.450> an<00:04:30.570> automated<00:04:30.990> process

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320

if you want to get the perfect result

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.650 
if you want to get the perfect result
you<00:04:33.480> want<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.960> rasterize<00:04:34.800> this<00:04:35.630> rasterize<00:04:36.630> the

you want to rasterize this rasterize the
layer<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.320> then<00:04:38.130> press<00:04:38.880> T<00:04:39.270> ctrl<00:04:39.690> T<00:04:40.050> to

layer and then press T ctrl T to
transform<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.040> then<00:04:41.310> choose<00:04:41.670> wall<00:04:42.360> pair

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
transform it and then choose wall pair

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.680 
transform it and then choose wall pair
and<00:04:42.960> then<00:04:43.440> simply<00:04:43.980> drag<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.640> little<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.510> make

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
and then simply drag a little to make

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.860 
and then simply drag a little to make
the<00:04:46.350> curve<00:04:46.620> here<00:04:46.950> adjust<00:04:47.460> exactly<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:48.750> the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
the curve here adjust exactly to the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.090 
the curve here adjust exactly to the
curve<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:50.730> glass<00:04:50.970> itself<00:04:51.510> has<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.830> this

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
curve the glass itself has and this this

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.800 
curve the glass itself has and this this
way<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.460> neatly<00:04:53.700> tucks<00:04:54.090> in<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.480> you've<00:04:54.600> got

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
way it neatly tucks in and you've got

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.570 
way it neatly tucks in and you've got
the<00:04:54.960> perfect<00:04:55.170> reflection<00:04:55.500> there<00:04:56.040> so

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
the perfect reflection there so

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.880 
the perfect reflection there so
