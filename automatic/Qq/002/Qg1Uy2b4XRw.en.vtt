00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi, I am Tasya.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We are back again in Street Food Webisodes of...,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.420
Masak.TV!

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.640
Today I am going to show you how to make Mayonnaise Risoles.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
First of all, we have all-purpose flour.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.180
200gr.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.100
Which I will mix with milk.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880
And 2 eggs.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.160
Stir until they are thoroughly combined.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.500
Add salt and pepper as well.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.640
I put half a teaspoon of salt,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.940
And half a teaspoon of pepper.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.000
Mix them all up again.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.700
So we are stirring this, until...,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.860
We get rid of flour lumps.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.000
We are done with the mixture.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.120
We don't want to make it too thick.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.000
Make it a little runny.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.660
Spread some oil to the frying pan.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.880
Only a little bit, so that it is not sticky.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.720
Can we use margarine instead?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.320
Sure, why not?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.400
Wait for the temperature to rise.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.820
So now what I am going to do next is folding.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.960
And I am going to put a little flour,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.660
And then fry!

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.900
So this is ham.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.060
I am now going to cut the pre-boiled eggs into 4 pieces.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.120
I have got 4 here.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.500
I'm going to place it right here.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.680
Folding now.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.920
Done!

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.840
This is to create another layer.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960
I have added in some seasonings in it.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.680
Salt.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.220
Pepper.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.860
I am now going to prepare this.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.440
So we can directly fry later.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.900
We are frying now!

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.720
It is done!

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.880
We are going to drain these out.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.600
We can...,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.600
I have one here.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.520
it is finished!

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.720

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.420
Can fill these with vegetables.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.480
