just<00:00:31.380> kind<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.710> level<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.090> you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
just kind of level it out so that you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.260 
just kind of level it out so that you
know<00:00:33.329> what's<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:35.340> open<00:00:36.210> up

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
out a lot of seed in here we don't need

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.440 
out a lot of seed in here we don't need
nearly<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.829> much<00:00:47.000> but<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.149> good<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.329> have

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
nearly this much but it's good to have

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
nearly this much but it's good to have
it<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.440> start<00:00:49.680> your<00:00:49.860> seed<00:00:50.039> holes<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.700> good

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it so we start your seed holes it's good

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.750 
it so we start your seed holes it's good
to<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> pencil<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> little

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to use a pencil and just make a little

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.410 
to use a pencil and just make a little
hole<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.360> maybe<00:00:54.840> half<00:00:55.410> an<00:00:55.649> inch<00:00:55.829> deep<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.420> each

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
hole in maybe half an inch deep in each

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.599 
hole in maybe half an inch deep in each
of<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> sections<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.050> drop<00:01:01.050> one<00:01:01.710> seed

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
of the sections and drop one seed

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.429 
of the sections and drop one seed
they're<00:01:02.969> tiny<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:04.710> feed<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:06.049> each<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
they're tiny but one feed in each of the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.060 
they're tiny but one feed in each of the
holes<00:01:08.390> after<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.080> simply<00:01:10.470> cover<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.950> up

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
holes after that you simply cover it up

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
holes after that you simply cover it up
don't<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> cover<00:01:12.420> them<00:01:12.600> too<00:01:12.750> deep<00:01:12.960> that's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
don't want to cover them too deep that's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.870 
don't want to cover them too deep that's
why<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> only<00:01:13.500> make<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> hole<00:01:14.220> half<00:01:14.520> an<00:01:14.700> inch

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
why you only make the hole half an inch

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.899 
why you only make the hole half an inch
cover<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:15.930> up<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.110> bit

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
cover them up a bit

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.140 
cover them up a bit
save<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> rest<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.390> seed<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.840> later<00:01:20.150> now

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
save the rest of the seed for later now

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
save the rest of the seed for later now
we<00:01:21.210> got<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> water<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> water<00:01:23.040> gently

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
we got a water you have to water gently

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.789 
we got a water you have to water gently
because<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> wash<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.500> seeds

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
because you don't want to wash the seeds

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.719 
because you don't want to wash the seeds
away<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:27.000> give<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.360> gentle<00:01:28.100> bit<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.310> water

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
away so give it a gentle bit of water

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.920 
away so give it a gentle bit of water
now<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.079> take<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.659> sit<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
now all we do is take it sit it in a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.649 
now all we do is take it sit it in a
sunny<00:01:34.170> location<00:01:34.880> we<00:01:35.880> could<00:01:36.060> get<00:01:36.210> good<00:01:36.390> light

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
sunny location we could get good light

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.890 
sunny location we could get good light
and<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.259> has<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.740> warm<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.400> between<00:01:39.180> 70<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and it has to be warm to between 70 to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.080 
and it has to be warm to between 70 to
85<00:01:40.290> degrees<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.250> give<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.820> seeds

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
85 degrees is going to give the seeds

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.389 
85 degrees is going to give the seeds
the<00:01:42.240> best<00:01:42.509> chance<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> germinate<00:01:43.500> after

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the best chance to germinate after

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.910 
the best chance to germinate after
danger<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.909> Frost<00:01:45.210> has<00:01:45.420> passed<00:01:45.450> outdoors<00:01:46.170> we

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
danger of Frost has passed outdoors we

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.639 
danger of Frost has passed outdoors we
break<00:01:47.220> each<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.700> these<00:01:47.820> pots<00:01:48.210> apart<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.899> then

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
break each of these pots apart and then

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.859 
break each of these pots apart and then
we<00:01:49.740> plant<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> right<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> garden<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
we plant it right in the garden the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
we plant it right in the garden the
whole<00:01:52.079> thing<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.520> we've<00:01:53.640> got<00:01:53.759> our<00:01:53.880> letter

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
whole thing and we've got our letter

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270
