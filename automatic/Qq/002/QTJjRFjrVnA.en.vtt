tech lab after he pushes out maybe two
Marines<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.789> we<00:01:42.909> might<00:01:43.060> see<00:01:43.210> some<00:01:43.240> early

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690

right<00:02:17.370> we're<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.849> see<00:02:17.970> two<00:02:18.810> Marines

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110

here<00:02:20.269> no<00:02:21.269> gasps<00:02:21.540> actually<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.480> interested<00:02:24.480> to

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
here no gasps actually so interested to

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.320 
here no gasps actually so interested to
see<00:02:24.720> whether<00:02:24.870> throws<00:02:25.200> up<00:02:25.349> another<00:02:25.680> barracks

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
see whether throws up another barracks

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.789 
see whether throws up another barracks
looks<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.480> his<00:02:27.540> phone<00:02:27.780> for<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:27.989> fast<00:02:28.290> expand

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
looks like his phone for a fast expand

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.820 
looks like his phone for a fast expand
here<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.670> command<00:02:30.299> center<00:02:30.569> after<00:02:31.019> two<00:02:31.470> Marines

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
here so command center after two Marines

he's going to be submitting this work
you<00:03:30.080> did<00:03:30.230> get<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.560> too<00:03:30.920> early<00:03:30.950> yes<00:03:31.550> so<00:03:33.370> might

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
you did get this too early yes so might

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.810 
you did get this too early yes so might
be<00:03:34.490> going<00:03:34.640> for<00:03:34.820> some<00:03:35.000> sort<00:03:35.240> of<00:03:35.360> higher<00:03:35.570> tech

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.400 
be going for some sort of higher tech
see<00:03:37.820> what<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.150> right<00:03:38.360> now<00:03:38.420> looks<00:03:39.230> like<00:03:39.320> a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
see what it is right now looks like a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.620 
see what it is right now looks like a
third<00:03:39.800> gate<00:03:40.010> right<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:41.420> might<00:03:41.600> be

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
third gate right so you might be

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.330 
third gate right so you might be

is now being turned into an old go
command<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:46.640> be<00:03:47.390> pushing<00:03:47.720> out<00:03:47.840> three

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
command and be pushing out three

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.740 
command and be pushing out three
gateways<00:03:48.530> for<00:03:48.560> some<00:03:49.040> early<00:03:49.280> pressure<00:03:49.630> STC<00:03:50.630> is

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
gateways for some early pressure STC is

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.720 
gateways for some early pressure STC is
by<00:03:52.210> with<00:03:53.210> this<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.930> bunker<00:03:54.370> get<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:55.490> a<00:03:55.580> good

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
by with this this bunker get in a good

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
by with this this bunker get in a good
position<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.510> softer<00:03:57.050> swing<00:03:57.260> club<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:58.750> take

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
damage Warbeck a tech almost finished

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.670 
damage Warbeck a tech almost finished
looks<00:04:05.420> like<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.870> going<00:04:05.990> to<00:04:06.080> be<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.170> for<00:04:06.470> gate

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
looks like it's going to be a for gate

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.060 
looks like it's going to be a for gate
so<00:04:07.640> we'll<00:04:07.790> see<00:04:07.970> what<00:04:08.090> kind<00:04:08.300> of<00:04:08.420> force<00:04:09.070> that

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
so we'll see what kind of force that

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.400 
so we'll see what kind of force that
gets<00:04:10.340> up<00:04:10.490> here<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:10.910> whether<00:04:11.660> he's<00:04:11.870> going<00:04:12.290> to

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
gets up here and whether he's going to

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.740 
gets up here and whether he's going to
