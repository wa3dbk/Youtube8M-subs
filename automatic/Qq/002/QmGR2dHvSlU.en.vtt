although it can't support weight it's

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.820 
although it can't support weight it's
kind<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:13.909> a<00:01:14.000> nice<00:01:14.210> little<00:01:14.479> way<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.810> ensure<00:01:15.770> that

kind of a nice little way to ensure that
you<00:01:16.130> don't<00:01:16.280> get<00:01:16.369> too<00:01:16.580> much<00:01:16.759> weight<00:01:17.530> depending

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
you don't get too much weight depending

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.899 
you don't get too much weight depending
upon<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.860> types<00:01:19.040> of<00:01:19.159> tools<00:01:19.369> that<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.670> want<00:01:19.759> to

hang on the pegboard without separating

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.800 
hang on the pegboard without separating
it<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:23.990> this<00:01:24.409> case<00:01:24.470> on<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:26.270> far<00:01:26.509> side<00:01:26.780> over

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
it and in this case on the far side over

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.190 
it and in this case on the far side over
here<00:01:27.020> you'll<00:01:27.320> see<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.619> I've<00:01:27.770> got<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:29.200> didn't

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
paint the board in the background so you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.179 
paint the board in the background so you
can<00:01:31.759> see<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:34.189> 1<00:01:34.369> by<00:01:34.520> 2<00:01:34.579> on<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.000> far<00:01:35.210> side<00:01:35.509> and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
2x4 to go into if you're not sure where

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.830 
2x4 to go into if you're not sure where
the<00:02:35.570> studs<00:02:35.840> are<00:02:35.960> located<00:02:37.630> typically<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:38.780> a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
the studs are located typically in a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.670 
the studs are located typically in a
house<00:02:39.190> they<00:02:40.190> will<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.460> 16<00:02:40.880> inches<00:02:41.150> on<00:02:41.300> center

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
house they will be 16 inches on center

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.640 
house they will be 16 inches on center
separated<00:02:43.240> so<00:02:44.240> from<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> center<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.080> 2x4

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
separated so from the center of one 2x4

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.890 
separated so from the center of one 2x4
to<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.890> center<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.310> next<00:02:46.460> 2x4<00:02:47.090> will<00:02:47.780> be

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
to the center of the next 2x4 will be

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.430 
to the center of the next 2x4 will be
exactly<00:02:48.200> 16<00:02:48.770> inches<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.930> one<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.080> methods

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
exactly 16 inches so one of the methods

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.760 
exactly 16 inches so one of the methods
you<00:02:51.530> can<00:02:51.650> use<00:02:51.710> if<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.520> have<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:53.120> example

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
you can use if you have for example

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.650 
you can use if you have for example
something<00:02:54.770> like<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.070> light<00:02:55.340> switch<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:56.000> know

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
something like a light switch you know

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.480 
something like a light switch you know
that<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.440> light<00:02:57.650> switch<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:58.100> mounted

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
that that light switch is mounted

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.670 
that that light switch is mounted
there's<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.540> box<00:02:59.780> there<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.200> it's<00:03:00.290> mounted<00:03:00.650> to

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
there's a box there and it's mounted to

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.220 
there's a box there and it's mounted to
a<00:03:00.770> tublat<00:03:01.160> force<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.670> know<00:03:01.790> exactly<00:03:02.270> 16

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
a tublat force you know exactly 16

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.940 
a tublat force you know exactly 16
inches<00:03:04.450> sit<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.810> right<00:03:06.470> or<00:03:06.710> to<00:03:06.740> the<00:03:06.860> left

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
inches sit to the right or to the left

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.300 
inches sit to the right or to the left
of<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.420> position<00:03:08.420> will<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.750> another<00:03:09.160> 2x4<00:03:10.160> so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
of that position will be another 2x4 so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.210 
of that position will be another 2x4 so
you<00:03:10.370> don't<00:03:10.550> have<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.790> go<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:12.230> attach<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.100> whole

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
you don't have to go and attach a whole

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.920 
you don't have to go and attach a whole
bunch<00:03:13.460> of<00:03:13.550> holes<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:14.240> wall<00:03:14.330> trying<00:03:14.840> to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
bunch of holes to the wall trying to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.260 
bunch of holes to the wall trying to
find<00:03:15.170> where<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.440> next<00:03:15.650> stud<00:03:15.830> is<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.910> in

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
find where the next stud is that so in

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.190 
find where the next stud is that so in
this<00:03:17.600> case<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:18.080> have<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> six<00:03:19.190> foot<00:03:19.460> board<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.690> I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
this case I have a six foot board and I

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.670 
this case I have a six foot board and I
know<00:03:21.260> from<00:03:22.090> where<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.120> drilled<00:03:23.480> these<00:03:23.630> holes<00:03:23.690> to

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
know from where I drilled these holes to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.900 
know from where I drilled these holes to
mount<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.250> know<00:03:25.850> exactly<00:03:26.630> four<00:03:26.900> feet<00:03:27.200> or

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
mount it I know exactly four feet or

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.210 
mount it I know exactly four feet or
3/16<00:03:28.910> inch<00:03:29.090> sections<00:03:29.510> will<00:03:29.900> be<00:03:30.020> my<00:03:30.170> next<00:03:30.440> one

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
3/16 inch sections will be my next one

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.670 
3/16 inch sections will be my next one
so<00:03:31.550> even<00:03:31.820> really<00:03:32.030> without<00:03:32.440> drilling<00:03:33.440> any

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
so even really without drilling any

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.140 
so even really without drilling any
pilot<00:03:34.040> holes<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.340> try<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.550> find<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.910> stud<00:03:35.120> I

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
pilot holes to try to find the stud I

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.600 
pilot holes to try to find the stud I
knew<00:03:35.450> exactly<00:03:35.570> where<00:03:35.990> it<00:03:36.080> was<00:03:36.200> at<00:03:36.350> before<00:03:37.340> I

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
knew exactly where it was at before I

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.610 
knew exactly where it was at before I
got<00:03:37.790> started<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.390> let's<00:03:38.930> take<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.170> trip<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.500> Home

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
got started so let's take a trip to Home

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.950 
got started so let's take a trip to Home
Depot<00:03:39.650> let's<00:03:40.160> take<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.310> look<00:03:40.550> at<00:03:40.730> what<00:03:41.720> kind<00:03:41.840> of

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
Depot let's take a look at what kind of

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.040 
Depot let's take a look at what kind of
tools<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.290> equipment<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:42.710> might<00:03:42.860> need
