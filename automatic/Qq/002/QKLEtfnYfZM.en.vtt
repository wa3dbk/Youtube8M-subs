team fighting both diving and zoning are
common<00:00:20.820> tactics<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.960> knowing<00:00:22.080> when<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
common tactics but knowing when to do it

common tactics but knowing when to do it
how<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.519> why<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.789> really<00:00:24.330> important

how to do it and why is really important
let's<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.920> started<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.250> diving<00:00:26.670> since<00:00:26.880> i've

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
let's get started with diving since i've

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.400 
let's get started with diving since i've
touched<00:00:27.210> over<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> little<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.080> previous

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
touched over a little bit in previous

touched over a little bit in previous
videos<00:00:29.000> now<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.240> general<00:00:30.539> diving<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.470> not

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
videos now in general diving is not

videos now in general diving is not
always<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.520> good<00:00:32.700> idea<00:00:32.850> it's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
always going to be a good idea it's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.569 
always going to be a good idea it's
easily<00:00:34.079> countered<00:00:34.530> by<00:00:34.649> kiting<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
easily countered by kiting and you

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430 
easily countered by kiting and you
should<00:00:35.730> only<00:00:35.850> dive<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.540> there's<00:00:36.780> no<00:00:37.140> chance

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
should only dive in if there's no chance

should only dive in if there's no chance
of<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> being<00:00:37.860> guided<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:38.850> sure<00:00:38.879> you

of you being guided and you're sure you

can<00:00:39.570> secure<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> kill<00:00:40.230> most<00:00:41.190> dives<00:00:41.520> are

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
can secure the kill most dives are

however<00:00:53.820> diving<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:55.020> effective<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
however diving can be effective if you

zoning<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> lot<00:01:01.559> more<00:01:01.739> similar<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
zoning is actually a lot more similar to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
zoning is actually a lot more similar to
diving<00:01:02.460> than<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.820> might<00:01:02.969> expect<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:04.049> zoning

much better way to dive in as it creates
a<00:01:29.790> dive<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.390> way<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.750> actually<00:01:30.900> sets<00:01:31.560> up

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
a dive in a way that actually sets up

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.289 
a dive in a way that actually sets up
solid<00:01:32.189> positioning<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> your

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
solid positioning for you and your

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.240 
solid positioning for you and your
teammates<00:01:33.659> while<00:01:34.259> dragging<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.829> opponent's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
teammates while dragging the opponent's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.219 
teammates while dragging the opponent's
out<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.610> vulnerable<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.630> type<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> dive

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
out to be vulnerable this type of dive

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.440 
out to be vulnerable this type of dive
is<00:01:37.470> almost<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> reverse<00:01:38.369> peel<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.060> you're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
is almost like a reverse peel as you're

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.670 
is almost like a reverse peel as you're
peeling<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.900> opponent's<00:01:40.320> off<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> your

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
peeling the opponent's off of your

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.499 
peeling the opponent's off of your
carries<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.670> through<00:01:41.909> crowd<00:01:42.150> control<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
carries not through crowd control and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
carries not through crowd control and
kiting<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.320> by<00:01:43.409> jumping<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.130> then

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
kiting but by jumping in and then

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.679 
kiting but by jumping in and then
proceeding<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> zone<00:01:45.030> them<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.360> while<00:01:45.600> they

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
proceeding to zone them out while they

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.319 
proceeding to zone them out while they
focus<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.170> down<00:01:46.520> however<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.820> cons<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> this

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
focus you down however the cons of this

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.030 
focus you down however the cons of this
type<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.540> dive<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> opponent's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
type of dive are that if the opponent's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.319 
type of dive are that if the opponent's
can<00:01:50.159> kill<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> quickly<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.210> be

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
can kill you quickly it will be

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.550 
can kill you quickly it will be
difficult<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.869> zone<00:01:52.079> them<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
difficult to zone them out for a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.310 
difficult to zone them out for a
reasonable<00:01:53.070> amount<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.369> time<00:01:54.020> anyways<00:01:55.020> both

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
reasonable amount of time anyways both

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.080 
reasonable amount of time anyways both
strategies<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.070> pros<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.460> cons<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.969> in

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
strategies have pros and cons but in

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.429 
strategies have pros and cons but in
general<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.570> say<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.110> zoning

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
general I would say that the zoning

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.319 
general I would say that the zoning
tactic<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.979> much<00:01:59.159> more<00:01:59.369> useful<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> little

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
tactic is much more useful but a little

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
tactic is much more useful but a little
bit<00:02:00.450> less<00:02:00.659> well-known<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.500> try<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> take

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
bit less well-known so try to take

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
bit less well-known so try to take
advantage<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.549> especially<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:03.299> tanky

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
advantage of it especially on tanky

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450 
advantage of it especially on tanky
champions<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.200> hard<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> kill<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.219> lack

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
champions that are hard to kill but lack

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.270 
champions that are hard to kill but lack
