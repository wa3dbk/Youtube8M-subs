physics<00:04:38.080> at<00:04:39.080> least<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:39.320> get<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.500> see<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.710> game

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
physics at least you get to see the game

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.750 
physics at least you get to see the game
over<00:04:40.130> animation<00:04:41.950> now<00:04:42.950> all<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.220> them<00:04:43.310> have<00:04:43.520> one

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
over animation now all of them have one

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.060 
over animation now all of them have one
I<00:04:44.060> think<00:04:44.120> it's<00:04:44.390> just<00:04:44.480> this<00:04:44.690> one<00:04:44.990> maybe<00:04:45.800> one

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
I think it's just this one maybe one

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:56.339 
I think it's just this one maybe one
other<00:04:47.110> do<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.140> again<00:04:48.530> alright

the<00:06:28.780> train<00:06:29.110> was<00:06:29.260> actually<00:06:29.650> supposed<00:06:29.950> to<00:06:30.010> be

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
the train was actually supposed to be

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.330 
the train was actually supposed to be
another<00:06:30.310> minigame<00:06:30.610> there<00:06:31.830> but<00:06:32.830> it<00:06:32.950> was<00:06:33.070> cut

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
another minigame there but it was cut

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.550 
another minigame there but it was cut
out<00:06:33.520> of<00:06:33.700> the<00:06:33.820> the<00:06:34.240> western<00:06:35.050> version<00:06:35.290> of<00:06:35.500> the

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
out of the the western version of the

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.100 
out of the the western version of the
game<00:06:35.740> because<00:06:35.980> it<00:06:36.460> was<00:06:37.030> too<00:06:37.240> hard<00:06:37.480> to<00:06:37.600> localize

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
game because it was too hard to localize

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.890 
game because it was too hard to localize
I<00:06:38.460> can't<00:06:39.460> really<00:06:39.970> have<00:06:40.060> a<00:06:40.090> game<00:06:40.270> where<00:06:40.450> I<00:06:40.480> think

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
I can't really have a game where I think

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.870 
I can't really have a game where I think
he's<00:06:41.110> supposed<00:06:41.290> he's<00:06:41.890> on<00:06:42.040> the<00:06:42.130> subway<00:06:42.520> train

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
he's supposed he's on the subway train

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.580 
he's supposed he's on the subway train
and<00:06:43.240> you<00:06:43.570> go<00:06:43.750> buy<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.960> whole<00:06:44.140> bunch<00:06:44.230> of<00:06:44.380> people

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
and you go buy a whole bunch of people

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.550 
and you go buy a whole bunch of people
holding<00:06:44.890> up<00:06:44.980> signs<00:06:45.310> and<00:06:45.850> I<00:06:46.630> I<00:06:47.020> can't<00:06:47.440> remember

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
holding up signs and I I can't remember

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.770 
holding up signs and I I can't remember
you<00:06:47.920> have<00:06:48.040> to<00:06:48.160> identify<00:06:48.360> which<00:06:49.360> signs<00:06:49.600> are

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
you have to identify which signs are

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
you have to identify which signs are
correct<00:06:49.900> or<00:06:50.230> something<00:06:50.710> and<00:06:52.050> it<00:06:53.050> would<00:06:53.200> be<00:06:53.530> too

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
correct or something and it would be too

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.500 
correct or something and it would be too
hard<00:06:54.100> localized<00:06:54.610> because<00:06:55.030> it<00:06:55.120> was<00:06:55.240> like<00:06:55.360> one

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
hard localized because it was like one

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.480 
hard localized because it was like one
Japanese<00:06:55.960> character<00:06:56.530> but<00:06:57.100> something<00:06:57.460> that

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
Japanese character but something that

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.790 
Japanese character but something that
would<00:06:57.700> be<00:06:57.880> multiple<00:06:58.360> words<00:06:59.020> that<00:06:59.470> would<00:06:59.590> not

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
would be multiple words that would not

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.320 
would be multiple words that would not
fit<00:07:00.010> in<00:07:00.100> the<00:07:00.130> sign<00:07:00.370> or<00:07:00.580> be<00:07:00.700> easily<00:07:01.090> readable

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
fit in the sign or be easily readable

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.820 
fit in the sign or be easily readable
and<00:07:01.660> so<00:07:01.840> he<00:07:01.930> just<00:07:01.960> cut<00:07:02.350> out<00:07:02.500> the<00:07:02.680> whole

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
and so he just cut out the whole

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.070 
and so he just cut out the whole
minigame<00:07:03.280> from<00:07:03.520> the<00:07:03.580> Western<00:07:03.880> version<00:07:04.060> it<00:07:04.930> was

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
minigame from the Western version it was

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.920 
minigame from the Western version it was
actually<00:07:05.440> one<00:07:05.590> other<00:07:05.710> cut<00:07:06.010> minigame<00:07:06.400> later<00:07:06.610> on

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
actually one other cut minigame later on

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.510 
actually one other cut minigame later on
but<00:07:07.930> actually<00:07:08.380> I'm<00:07:08.470> glad<00:07:08.620> the<00:07:08.920> other<00:07:09.070> one<00:07:09.280> got

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
but actually I'm glad the other one got

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.200 
but actually I'm glad the other one got
cut<00:07:09.760> out<00:07:09.790> because<00:07:09.910> it<00:07:10.360> looked<00:07:10.570> kind<00:07:10.840> of<00:07:10.930> bad
