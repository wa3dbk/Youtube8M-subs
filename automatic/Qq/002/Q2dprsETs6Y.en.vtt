but I didn't think about it so that's
that's<00:03:42.919> that's<00:03:43.519> your<00:03:43.760> fault<00:03:44.709> all<00:03:45.709> right<00:03:45.950> now

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
that's that's your fault all right now

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.490 
that's that's your fault all right now
we<00:03:46.310> get<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.730> sides<00:03:47.060> right<00:03:47.419> here<00:03:47.500> finally

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
we get the sides right here finally

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.530 
we get the sides right here finally
getting<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.889> sides<00:03:49.750> this<00:03:50.750> one<00:03:50.989> right<00:03:51.169> here

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
getting the sides this one right here

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.930 
getting the sides this one right here
finally<00:03:53.540> getting<00:03:53.750> put<00:03:54.079> on<00:03:56.799> now<00:03:57.799> I<00:03:58.040> used<00:03:58.430> I<00:03:58.730> use

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
finally getting put on now I used I use

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.240 
finally getting put on now I used I use
the<00:03:59.060> same<00:03:59.359> technique<00:03:59.419> that<00:04:00.139> I<00:04:00.560> did<00:04:00.799> last<00:04:00.980> time

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
the same technique that I did last time

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.280 
the same technique that I did last time
just<00:04:01.579> gluing<00:04:01.880> just<00:04:02.419> gluing<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:02.750> onto<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.079> mask

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
just gluing just gluing it onto the mask

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.290 
just gluing just gluing it onto the mask
because<00:04:04.159> you<00:04:04.400> needed<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.730> stay<00:04:05.060> on

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
because you needed to stay on

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.390 
because you needed to stay on
all<00:04:06.900> I'm<00:04:07.050> doing<00:04:07.080> right<00:04:07.350> here<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.860> just<00:04:07.890> cutting

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
all I'm doing right here is just cutting

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.640 
all I'm doing right here is just cutting
off<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.700> threads<00:04:09.000> everything<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.620> I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
off the threads everything that I that I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.490 
off the threads everything that I that I
you<00:04:10.770> know<00:04:11.630> left<00:04:12.630> on<00:04:12.840> from<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.080> threads<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
you know left on from the threads and

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.820 
you know left on from the threads and
everything<00:04:14.360> that's<00:04:15.360> time<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.750> show<00:04:16.410> off<00:04:16.590> a

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
everything that's time to show off a

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.100 
everything that's time to show off a
little<00:04:17.040> bit<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.250> mask<00:04:17.430> but<00:04:17.670> wait<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.390> forgot

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
little bit of the mask but wait I forgot

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.920 
little bit of the mask but wait I forgot
one<00:04:19.680> little<00:04:20.010> theme<00:04:20.760> which<00:04:21.269> was<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.540> little

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
one little theme which was a little

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.480 
one little theme which was a little
things<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.380> little<00:04:22.710> silver<00:04:22.980> parts<00:04:23.340> that

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
things that little silver parts that

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.040 
things that little silver parts that
come<00:04:23.640> off<00:04:23.760> on<00:04:24.570> well<00:04:25.560> come<00:04:25.950> on<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.730> eye<00:04:27.030> holes<00:04:27.660> I

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
come off on well come on the eye holes I

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.480 
come off on well come on the eye holes I
hold<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.070> mask<00:04:30.710> now<00:04:31.710> this<00:04:32.340> was

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
hold of the mask now this was

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.310 
hold of the mask now this was
last-minute<00:04:32.850> addition<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.690> didn't<00:04:34.230> think

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
last-minute addition and I didn't think

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.220 
last-minute addition and I didn't think
about<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.620> too<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.430> lot<00:04:35.670> later<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.570> camera<00:04:37.020> ran

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
about it too a lot later the camera ran

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.850 
about it too a lot later the camera ran
out<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.380> battery<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:38.420> and<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:40.110> memory<00:04:40.440> cards

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
out of battery and and the memory cards

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.640 
out of battery and and the memory cards
or<00:04:41.130> memory<00:04:41.790> sticks<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:42.240> was<00:04:42.390> using<00:04:42.900> were

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
or memory sticks that I was using were

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.670 
or memory sticks that I was using were
full<00:04:43.980> on<00:04:44.010> memory<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.610> didn't<00:04:44.970> have<00:04:45.060> enough

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
full on memory so I didn't have enough

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.850 
full on memory so I didn't have enough
space<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:46.740> actually<00:04:47.540> record<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:49.050> coloring<00:04:49.710> of

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
space to actually record the coloring of

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.610 
space to actually record the coloring of
that<00:04:50.130> of<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.640> little<00:04:50.970> part<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:52.500> was

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
that of that little part but it was

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.910 
that of that little part but it was
basically<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.980> same<00:04:53.010> thing<00:04:53.340> just<00:04:53.550> with

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
basically the same thing just with

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.750 
basically the same thing just with
silver<00:04:55.920> did<00:04:56.880> stitch<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.300> on<00:04:57.390> and<00:04:57.810> there<00:04:57.990> we<00:04:58.110> go

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
silver did stitch it on and there we go

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.570 
silver did stitch it on and there we go
there<00:04:59.760> we<00:04:59.790> go<00:05:00.230> look<00:05:01.230> at<00:05:01.380> that<00:05:01.410> now<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.280> see<00:05:02.460> me

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
there we go look at that now you see me

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.150 
there we go look at that now you see me
wearing<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.120> few<00:05:03.390> of<00:05:03.450> my<00:05:03.510> vlogs<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.410> that's

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
wearing a few of my vlogs and that's

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.520 
wearing a few of my vlogs and that's
about<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.520> that's<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.360> end<00:05:06.390> of<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.720> series<00:05:06.960> so
