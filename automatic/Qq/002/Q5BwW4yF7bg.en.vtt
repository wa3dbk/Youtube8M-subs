00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.240
 because a packaging 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.719
 When going through an accepting stent the advantages are obvious 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.080
 the fluffy soil with large vases is a clean and crumbled report that 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.259
 immediately this compact 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.529
 so the unit stays on the ground 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.029
 if in light and medium soils always to one but towed after this 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.199
 combined work cycle the field is ready forever 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.140
 if the packers used as but front produces a uniform bed of 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 planting for the next rough 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.040
 in this function the packer writes to the additional module to make 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
 simultaneously these works 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.320
 lempen offers with fix year restrictive pact two models that packager 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.260
 widely chiqui peace 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.600
 for example due to construction in circles incubated the working width 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.530
 can be increased simply and quickly by giving up the central axis 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.190
 there is a lot of space between the open rings thus obtaining a job 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.190
 unions change 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.600
 yes in a single row or as a double packer fixedly attached by tugboats 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.799
 with different profiles of haro 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.670
 for different times of euros the packers delinquen 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.580
 are oriented in soil conditions and ways of utilization 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.520
 during the summer the roller 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.289
 Compactor change may pac c described theft matica min mind before the trip 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.270
 and after the turn, the robust turn is captured again safely 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.640
 of capture despite 0 of very elastic and does not deform if accidentally 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.780
 Extractor passes over 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.260
 equipped with a push device in the list can also be used in 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.560
 the unique frontal appointment when compacting the jal accounts in front of the tractor 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 traces at the same time the packager 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.890
 the front weight for the cultivation combinations behind the deal 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.930
 as several factors tel packager is docked directly behind the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.289
 tractor or combined with implements in fines 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.779
 in this version of working width can reach up to six meters 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:32.799
 For road transport the elements are even folded 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.459
 only 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.999
 The packaged integrated ric six pack is set praised by an arm of 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.279
 diesel traction designed together with the plow 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:47.089
 for road transport the six pack are securely fixed between 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:48.469
 carried bodies 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.419
 in this way has stopped and packers arrive at their place of 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.619
 work in one trip
