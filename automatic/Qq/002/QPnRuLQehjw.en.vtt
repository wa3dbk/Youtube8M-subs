00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.710
 yes the manufacturer had no 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.989

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:38.790

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:07.299

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.220
 laptop to exactly and on the laptop served 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.110
 In addition, the camera crane the photo straight 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:20.259

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.090
 following post it again very politically 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.060
 breathtakingly deep senses 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.369

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.590
 football stadium 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.630
 I mean what's the name of the woman marilyn ob 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.840

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.670
 she really did not care about that joke 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.240
 we know it was summer and what is it 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.620
 it's always warm in summer in summer 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.330
 the claim could come from the victim 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.640
 In any case, it is so that people 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.210
 to put pressure on the right one 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.860
 figure to reach summer yet 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.170
 a little something for the character and 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.900
 is the summer quite there is still is 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.090
 little time longest manufacturer fierce 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.550
 on hashtag yet another diet 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.480
 little bit hashtag for the characters 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.400
 diet set 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.080
 only missing hashtag filter is the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.420
 joke completely well I'm of opinion 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.130
 although less figure there is none 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.630
 figure to recognize more or some 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.470
 I will understand now 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.000
 maybe yes, too 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.010

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.600
 So they want to work here 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.489

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.500
 span during the work and the videos 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.780
 not to the typical application interview 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500
 even love does not end much 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.540

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.970
 Of course you know that, too 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.410

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.220
 Shade everything clear 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.780
 One is naked and coincidentally 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.660
 one then naked on the toilet and 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.630

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.209
 telling life is a beautiful one 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.940
