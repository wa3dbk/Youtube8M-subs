00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
stutter free time lapses it's super

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.000 
stutter free time lapses it's super
simple<00:00:19.980> straightforward<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.010> so

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
simple straightforward so here it is so

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.439 
simple straightforward so here it is so
the<00:00:23.340> main<00:00:23.490> issue<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.029> when<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.240> shoot

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the main issue you get when you shoot

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.300 
the main issue you get when you shoot
time<00:00:24.689> lapses<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.039> like

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
time lapses is you get this like

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220 
time lapses is you get this like
flickering<00:00:26.820> effect<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:28.050> because

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
flickering effect and that's because

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.310 
flickering effect and that's because
most<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.820> shutter<00:00:30.060> is

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
most of it's because the shutter is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.220 
most of it's because the shutter is
closing<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.470> opening<00:00:31.590> closing<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.669> opening

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
closing and opening closing and opening

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.690 
closing and opening closing and opening
and<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.440> not<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.800> same<00:00:34.980> every<00:00:35.280> time<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and it's not the same every time it

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.459 
and it's not the same every time it
might<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> little<00:00:36.210> bit<00:00:36.360> off<00:00:36.540> each<00:00:37.050> each

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
might be a little bit off each each

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.840 
might be a little bit off each each
frame<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.010> get<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.250> weird<00:00:38.520> stutter

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
frame so you get this weird stutter

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090 
frame so you get this weird stutter
effect<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.510> doesn't<00:00:39.780> look<00:00:39.840> nice<00:00:40.100> easiest

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
effect it just doesn't look nice easiest

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.790 
effect it just doesn't look nice easiest
way<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> take<00:00:41.520> care<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:43.170> set<00:00:43.710> your

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
way to take care that is to set your

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.100 
way to take care that is to set your
f-stop<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.370> where<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:45.110> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
f-stop to where you want it to be and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.660 
f-stop to where you want it to be and
then<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.800> press<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.550> little

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
then you want to press this little

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.790 
then you want to press this little
button<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> side<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.140> engages<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
button on the side here this engages the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.760 
button on the side here this engages the
shutter<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.149> hear<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> close<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.140> then

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
shutter you can hear it close and then

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.020 
shutter you can hear it close and then
