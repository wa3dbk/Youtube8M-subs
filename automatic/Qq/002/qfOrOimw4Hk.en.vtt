how<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.080> make<00:00:10.370> modular<00:00:11.370> terrain<00:00:11.820> tiles<00:00:12.150> we've

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
how to make modular terrain tiles we've

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.020 
how to make modular terrain tiles we've
made<00:00:13.019> some<00:00:13.200> nice-looking<00:00:13.410> hills<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.490> now

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
made some nice-looking hills and now

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.820 
made some nice-looking hills and now
we're<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.509> move<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.139> making<00:00:16.440> some

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
we're going to move on to making some

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
we're going to move on to making some
interesting<00:00:17.369> terrain<00:00:17.640> features<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.779> really

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
interesting terrain features and really

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.500 
interesting terrain features and really
the<00:00:19.350> sky's<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> limit<00:00:20.060> playing<00:00:21.060> around<00:00:21.330> with

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the sky's the limit playing around with

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.400 
the sky's the limit playing around with
making<00:00:21.869> some<00:00:22.140> chasms<00:00:22.769> now<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:24.109> probably<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.320> I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
making some chasms now and probably if I

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
making some chasms now and probably if I
would<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.619> done<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.340> again<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.849> think<00:00:27.090> I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
would have done this again I think I

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.700 
would have done this again I think I
would<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.510> cut<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.930> out<00:00:28.109> before<00:00:28.380> I've

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
would have cut this out before I've

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.679 
would have cut this out before I've
mounted<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> board<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
mounted it on the board because that

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.030 
mounted it on the board because that
makes<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> bit<00:00:31.170> more<00:00:31.289> difficult<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:31.920> all

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
makes it a bit more difficult to get all

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.620 
makes it a bit more difficult to get all
the<00:00:32.130> stuff<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.210> could<00:00:33.540> have

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the stuff out of here and I could have

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.330 
the stuff out of here and I could have
just<00:00:33.870> cut<00:00:34.079> through<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:34.739> mounted<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
just cut through and then mounted on the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.729 
just cut through and then mounted on the
board<00:00:35.520> next<00:00:36.270> thing<00:00:36.420> I'm<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.020> get

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
board next thing I'm going to do is get

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.119 
board next thing I'm going to do is get
some<00:00:37.890> slivers<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.660> foam<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
some slivers of foam and I'm going to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.799 
some slivers of foam and I'm going to
stick<00:00:42.090> these<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> edge<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.660> they're

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
stick these on the edge so they're

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
stick these on the edge so they're
sticking<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.440> bit<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
sticking up a bit like that just use a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.569 
sticking up a bit like that just use a
little<00:00:47.850> bit<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.969> white<00:00:48.149> glue<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.340> course

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
little bit of white glue and of course

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.209 
little bit of white glue and of course
I've<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:50.969> big<00:00:51.660> box<00:00:51.930> full<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.199> bits<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I've got my big box full of bits so I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.880 
I've got my big box full of bits so I
can<00:00:53.430> easily<00:00:53.899> go<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.350> find<00:00:55.620> little

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
can easily go in here and find little

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.110 
can easily go in here and find little
bits<00:00:57.109> and<00:00:58.109> stick<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:59.340> tear<00:01:00.000> them

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
bits and stick them here just tear them

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.049 
bits and stick them here just tear them
to<00:01:00.270> size<00:01:00.649> there<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:02.910> these

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
to size there we go I put all these

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.340 
to size there we go I put all these
little<00:01:03.210> bits<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.570> foam<00:01:03.780> around<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.229> edge<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
little bits of foam around the edge and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.219 
little bits of foam around the edge and
roughly<00:01:04.920> stuck<00:01:05.129> them<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.640> white<00:01:05.820> glue

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
roughly stuck them down with white glue

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.980 
roughly stuck them down with white glue
I'll<00:01:07.229> let<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.439> dry<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.540> time<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
I'll let that dry and then it's time to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
I'll let that dry and then it's time to
go<00:01:10.140> crazy<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> gap<00:01:11.010> filler<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.729> go

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
go crazy with the gap filler here we go

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.399 
go crazy with the gap filler here we go
you<00:01:12.360> may<00:01:12.479> need<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.720> couple<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> containers

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
you may need a couple of containers

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.249 
you may need a couple of containers
worth<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.299> you're

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
worth because as you can see you're

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.560 
worth because as you can see you're
going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.650> use<00:01:16.890> quite<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.360> let's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
going to use quite a lot of it now let's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.880 
going to use quite a lot of it now let's
fast-forward<00:01:18.840> through<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> process<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
fast-forward through the process of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.859 
fast-forward through the process of
making<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.280> sunken<00:01:20.640> Road<00:01:20.939> feature<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
making a sunken Road feature on one of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.840 
making a sunken Road feature on one of
the<00:01:21.960> tiles<00:01:22.140> I've<00:01:23.040> dug<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> tile

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the tiles I've dug into the tile

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120 
the tiles I've dug into the tile
somewhat<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.810> using<00:01:24.900> foam<00:01:25.530> pieces

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
somewhat and then I'm using foam pieces

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.370 
somewhat and then I'm using foam pieces
to<00:01:26.759> build<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.119> rocks<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.750> rocky<00:01:27.960> model

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to build up rocks and rocky model

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.039 
to build up rocks and rocky model
Earth's<00:01:28.560> framing<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.579> I'm<00:01:30.299> using<00:01:30.479> some<00:01:30.780> pins

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
Earth's framing it I'm using some pins

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
Earth's framing it I'm using some pins
to<00:01:31.259> keep<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> foam<00:01:31.770> pieces<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.340> place<00:01:32.549> while

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to keep the foam pieces in place while

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.280 
to keep the foam pieces in place while
that<00:01:33.689> PVA<00:01:34.439> glue<00:01:34.579> dries<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> matter

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
that PVA glue dries it's just a matter

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
that PVA glue dries it's just a matter
of<00:01:37.380> being<00:01:37.500> creative<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> playing<00:01:38.549> around

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
of being creative and playing around

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.830 
of being creative and playing around
with<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.030> until<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.450> an<00:01:39.570> interesting

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
with it until you get an interesting

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.469 
with it until you get an interesting
effect<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.340> particular<00:01:41.640> tile<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.329> was

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
effect for this particular tile I was

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
effect for this particular tile I was
inspired<00:01:42.840> by<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:43.110> terrain<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.920> saw

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
inspired by some terrain that I saw

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.389 
inspired by some terrain that I saw
online<00:01:44.750> once<00:01:45.750> I've<00:01:45.930> arranged<00:01:46.259> my<00:01:46.350> phone<00:01:46.979> it's

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
have to cover brush it on and then

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.870 
have to cover brush it on and then
scatter<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.860> fine<00:03:22.100> grade<00:03:22.400> texturing

material all over the top I started

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.100 
material all over the top I started
doing<00:03:25.880> this<00:03:25.970> lightly<00:03:26.240> with<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.630> trowel<00:03:26.870> but

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
doing this lightly with the trowel but

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.600 
doing this lightly with the trowel but
eventually<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.620> just<00:03:27.890> poured<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.310> straight

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
eventually I just poured it straight

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.110 
eventually I just poured it straight

from the tub all over the tile in one go

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.699 
from the tub all over the tile in one go
pat<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.240> down<00:03:32.450> lightly<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:33.020> little<00:03:33.260> bit<00:03:33.440> and

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
pat it down lightly a little bit and

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.160 
pat it down lightly a little bit and
then<00:03:33.860> pick<00:03:34.160> up<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.340> tile<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:34.820> shake<00:03:35.690> off<00:03:35.870> the

harder wearing and flock even if you do
