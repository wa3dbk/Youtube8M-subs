00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.769
 hey the maxime of session 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.060
 I have the box with me today 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.550
 you have something nice for us today 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:18.919
 brought namely the lsr series of 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:21.980
 javier here once the 308 and 3 0 518 5 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.419
 counter studio monitors what special 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.919
 tell them that a bit 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.359
 special is that they are brand new st 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.159
 they are straight from the very first 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.479
 delivery tapped and directly to you 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.619
 down here because I thought 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.379
 we have to show you that we have to 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.260
 Show you at home and accordingly 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.420
 here briefly demonstrate 30 5 308 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.359
 just mentioned that it is the new 3 Series 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.100
 wales series are two models 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.719
 maybe the series will grow along 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.269
 at the moment there are still the 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.250
 two speaker types consist of what 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.460
 They are classic two-way systems 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.309
 bm powered with glass stages 1 and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.530
 40 watts for the woofer 41 play 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.809
 tweeter in the smaller version and 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.079
 56 watts each for civil engineering and 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.880
 in the 308 classic two 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.650
 way what is so striking on the 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.980
 first look is very big 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.780
 wavelight image control wave is the 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.840
 marketing expression you smile about it 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.270
 Yes, marketing is one of them but it is stuck 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.580
 really great aspects behind it the man 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.210
 actually should briefly explain yes 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.830
 is very conspicuous 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.630
 influenced the radiation behavior completely 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.340
 exactly is affect distance behavior 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.050
 that in the studio, of course, very much 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.800
 very important because we have here 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.810
 Of course , a very important sweet 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.240
 spot that is called from the triangle where 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.320
 one hears optimally and ideally should 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.940
 to be as big as possible 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.800
 just to work with me 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.570
 can move accordingly when mixing 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.650
 if I have devices on the side 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.090
 I turn to page 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.290
 or I have 19 inch devices the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.090
 maybe mounted further down the rack 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.890
 I'm moving so I'm determined 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.850
 not always quieter i move when 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.890
 I want to move, of course 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.110
 if possible no sound loss 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.110
 that's why it's important that this sweet 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.000
 spot is as big as possible that will be here 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.200
 guaranteed why does it work 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.450
 here so good for one, we have one 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.520
 tweeter behind with neodymium magnets 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.619
 It works very efficiently up to 24 kg 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.590
 heart and the other are the haaner 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.450
 designed that relatively large 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.849
 as the turn of the trend down to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.700
 woofers I can settle very deep 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.400
 that has the decisive advantage that 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.140
 frequencies until about 1700 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.099
 heart shape tweeter can play 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.760
 and I have a better one there 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.010
 control 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 other systems separate at 3000 heart 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.190
 or even higher up then 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.470
 of course, the woofers these high 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.269
 still work with frequencies and here 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.230
 So I can get in earlier and have 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.519
 thus a much better 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.450
 radiates control 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.400
 I have a wider stereo picture 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.720
 But I still have a lot of it 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 good phantom transmitter that is if i am 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.349
 close your eyes and consider ok where 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.120
 is the middle when i move me 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.380
 I have a very precise phantom middle 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.670
 simple but also what the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.989
 I have dealt with depth graduation 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.250
 simply enormous advantages 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.739
 i can do a lot in the mix 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.750
 to work more accurately I can get signals better 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.610
 in the constellation I can distribute halt 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.079
 Setting rooms can be much more precise 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.060
 just work that's the big one 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.640
 advantage of this image control wave 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.769
 By the way, do not guide for the first time 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.560
 This series was developed but for 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.500
 the gl m 2 reference monitor that is one 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.079
 absolute high end reference monitor 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.560
 in many studios stands in big 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.579
 studios is there was the first time for 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.840
 developed and then you have yourself 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.780
 thoughtful let's try it 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.099
 this yes this technology round too 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.930
 break and also in smaller series 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.819
 to let in and that is very 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.920
 as well as everybody likes 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.310
 can convince yourself of 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.709
 Connection possibilities can be seen here 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.040
 on the back also everything 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.630
 symmetrically designed xlr i left i 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.290
 have room adjustments in heights and 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.180
 in the deep, I can each 2 db 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.549
 raise or lower 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.440
 That's just what you need for customization 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.639
 in room setting or too 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.079
 individual taste that we the 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.669
 bring in three aspects again 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.579
 we can be the initial sensitivity 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:04:00.250
 adjust from minus 10 to +4 dbp 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.220
 Ordering connections age knows you 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.880
 Actually we have the 30 55 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.690
 inch in it 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.489
 in the 30 880 katrin yes exactly 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.669
 the tweeter is the same for both 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.889
 What is there to say about it ? 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.030
 we have the image control wakeskate 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.829
 already spoken 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.269
 especially worth mentioning is still 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.060
 the low frequency range because we have here 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.800
 long stroke woofer in it 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.660
 in combination with the special 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.520
 bass reflex opening and the big one 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.720
 housing just work very well 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.970
 a very dynamic and powerful 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.250
 bass playback have the reflex opening 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.139
 are so-called slipstream openings that 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.610
 are flow-optimized openings the 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.100
 just do not create turbulence and 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.210
 thus much more efficient and accurate 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.260
 continue to work the woofer at 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.900
 Great here at 308, it's going down 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.620
 37 heart at minus 10 db and at the 305 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.150
 it runs down to 43 yards - cw 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.500
 we have in different first 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.030
 I already heard that he joined 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.290
 very many applications actually 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.260
 no separate shadow from me 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.960
 Of course there are signals here 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.190
 extremely what are intensively recommend there 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.050
 We also recommend a tip 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.280
 students again separately but here 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.870
 actually works a lot 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.110
 Wide range of the system outstanding 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.510
 even without subwoofer, yes, then nice 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.260
 thanks, as I said, comes over hears you 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.500
 the things 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.300
 that's definitely worth it 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.880
 thanks for the show thank you very much for 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.630
 your time and come over and become you 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.470
 very much in days 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.470
 until next time
