00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.830
 what people catch when I go back 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.330
 and today's new gameplay he comes 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.919
 also main channel after three weeks again 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.380
 Back in business Some will be there now 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.440
 probably you think right now 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.969
 abortion yes in any case today 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.990
 again new gameplay could now 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.910
 I'll come to the gameplay for a moment 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.350
 since the background can be seen and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.039
 what is a real older gameplay 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.689
 I've had that before too 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.859
 uploaded but I had none 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.779
 Gameplays have been there for three weeks 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.000
 gambled again so you never can 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.289
 I gambled and yes that is why I 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.730
 the old money used but are 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.570
 really sick is no playback on 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 every case in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.700
 It 's 100 plus in a reign 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.140
 half-time of the right grass in any case 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.059
 and it was even more blatant 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.440
 we simply have another trend with 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.790
 me in the lobby was also the dogs and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.020
 I've thought it was a good idea to swim out 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.789
 or twice but I think it was still 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.020
 once and through that I could mine 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.370
 do not activate swarm of a dog 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.489
 but maybe it would be merkels 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.110
 become and the gameplay in any case 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.670
 I can only win properly 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.969
 recommend 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.949
 and yes , why so much is three again 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.449
 weeks no video came at the time really 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.579
 not very active very often 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.090
 toy now a particular youtube 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.040
 say about height and who came to me why 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.060
 no video I have as I said three 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.840
 weeks no longer gambled 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.880
 and actually has little brocken 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.810
 to make video and we have real 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.939
 really many people on facebook 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.920
 why i dont have any videos anymore 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.960
 do and you why nothing comes 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.640
 and we had that right again 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.490
 eyes guided that is really there people 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.680
 stop just want to see my videos 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.939
 and me who need to write that to me 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.890
 I do not do anything and is probably right 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.270
 blatant is again so obvious 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.740
 to get guided in any case where 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.659
 you always see a youtube making videos 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.799
 just keep the numbers that way 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.119
 many clicks and so many 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.600
 subscribers you never really see the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.040
 before out eyes and people and now 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 I have motivation for a video again 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 and I try it on everyone 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.920
 fall even in a week so at least 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 actually halt in the week to get out 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.200
 bring and how you motivate me to do so 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.700
 Of course we can do that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.810
 are simply the video that motivates 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.290
 with most a youtube the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.290
 reviews 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.500
 says it's just say it's 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.920
 also just so that the reviews with 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.940
 motivate most of the youtuber 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.170
 continue to make videos 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.700
 So if you see more videos, check it out 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.220
 or see more videos in the week 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.390
 in any case 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.099
 klaus maier here a few likes on that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.480
 video then I think right again 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.069
 crass motivation I have it too 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.170
 get some new video ideas again 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.150
 and then I will definitely be back 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.720
 back in town back in business how to do it 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.640
 nice says 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.590
 and something else that I have 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.690
 if you wanted to speak to me 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.220
 want to write a message or stop 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.510
 have any question or how that 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.040
 want to write a message to his family 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.209
 then doing is definitely on facebook 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.890
 is our video description linked 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.629
 because youtube has been around since I have 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.120
 believe over a month already the 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.620
 news the update updated and 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.299
 until now really confusing and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.640
 were ugly and yes youtube 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.609
 just confusing and - 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.260
 inferior says so nicely and yes so 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.790
 as I said write me diversity 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.140
 facebook if anything you want to know 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.880
 or just ask if the message 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.250
 wanted to write and then to 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.019
 Last conversations for this comment 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.120
 and I have a few 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.680
 Problems with the pc but that is not 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.269
 too bad I put my pc is 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.099
 completely new on max has an external 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.630
 Hard drive bought around my whole 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.340
 to save things so my videos and 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.790
 other things, music and so on 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.959
 one has on the pc and should also 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.959
 not too long maybe two 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.519
 up to three days or at most two to 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.829
 three days no idea how long he was 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:38.019
 Need to know in any case 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:40.069
 Lage clarifies which business and 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.989
 as I said if you motivate me 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.579
 You want to do that by holding that 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.349
 video rated the motivated as I said 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.459
 with most at youtube the 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.739
 reviews and of course the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.060
 comments and he actually was 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.760
 such a big whole currency 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.780
 commentary I do not have everything 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.829
 mentioned what she wanted to become 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.750
 Gameplay is almost over 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.889
 were really crass the gameplay and 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.419
 then as I said forget that 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.340
 I rate comments and there I am 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:04.060
 already out and say we'll see 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.060
 Until next time
