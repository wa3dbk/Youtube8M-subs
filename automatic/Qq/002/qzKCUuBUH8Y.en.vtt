00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
attention to this PAX East stuff and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.549 
attention to this PAX East stuff and
this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> first<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:33.899> you're<00:00:34.050> tuning<00:00:34.410> in

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
this is the first time you're tuning in

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.979 
this is the first time you're tuning in
so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:34.980> convince<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.540> very

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so I can convince you that this is very

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.690 
so I can convince you that this is very
probable<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.800> may<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.040> an<00:00:38.250> announcement

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
probable that we may see an announcement

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.670 
probable that we may see an announcement
for<00:00:38.790> fall<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.780> basically<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.530> reason

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
for fall for so basically the reason

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.229 
for fall for so basically the reason
we're<00:00:40.920> all<00:00:41.160> assuming<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.730> there<00:00:41.879> might<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
we're all assuming that there might be a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
we're all assuming that there might be a
fall<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.809> announcement<00:00:43.260> at<00:00:43.350> PAX<00:00:43.559> East<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
fall for announcement at PAX East is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.369 
fall for announcement at PAX East is
because<00:00:44.100> PAX<00:00:44.340> East<00:00:44.550> does<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.120> fact<00:00:45.180> take<00:00:46.079> place

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
because PAX East does in fact take place

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.400 
because PAX East does in fact take place
in<00:00:46.649> boston<00:00:47.640> where<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.570> think<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:48.840> us<00:00:49.289> going

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
in boston where do we think for us going

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.990 
in boston where do we think for us going
to<00:00:49.500> take<00:00:49.620> place<00:00:49.770> boston<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to take place boston so it kind of it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.450 
to take place boston so it kind of it
would<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.390> ideal<00:00:51.739> announcement<00:00:52.739> area<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
would be an ideal announcement area and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
would be an ideal announcement area and
i<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:53.820> they<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.149> something<00:00:54.329> very<00:00:54.690> cool

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
i think they can do something very cool

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.680 
i think they can do something very cool
with<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.410> personally<00:00:55.890> also<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.969> top<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.629> off

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
with it personally also to top that off

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.310 
with it personally also to top that off
with<00:00:58.190> ESL<00:00:59.190> will<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.760> by<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.329> any<00:01:00.930> hype

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
with ESL will be out by then so any hype

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.779 
with ESL will be out by then so any hype
that<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.680> had<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> build<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.280> before<00:01:02.640> then

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that they had to build up before then

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.390 
that they had to build up before then
we'll<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> common<00:01:05.040> assumption

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
we'll be there now the common assumption

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.710 
we'll be there now the common assumption
is<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> new<00:01:06.180> order

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
is that we're going to see a new order

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.859

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
that so that's what I'm thinking that

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.270 
that so that's what I'm thinking that
they<00:02:55.000> had<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.600> obviously<00:02:56.020> seen<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:56.500> but

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.070 
they had to have obviously seen this but
they<00:02:57.670> haven't<00:02:57.880> commented<00:02:58.270> on<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.690> because<00:02:58.960> I

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
they haven't commented on it because I

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.510 
they haven't commented on it because I
thinking<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.440> lot<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.740> messages<00:03:00.100> saying<00:03:00.310> Oh

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
all that's been talked about when it

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.060 
all that's been talked about when it

which<00:03:39.490> I<00:03:39.610> was<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.030> excited<00:03:40.210> for<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.530> evil

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
which I was so excited for the evil

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.190 
which I was so excited for the evil
within<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.460> the<00:03:42.490> new<00:03:43.000> order<00:03:43.360> were<00:03:43.810> slated<00:03:44.050> to

so<00:03:48.550> yes<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.210> very<00:03:49.510> bad<00:03:49.750> for<00:03:49.780> business<00:03:50.140> and

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
so yes that is very bad for business and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.370 
so yes that is very bad for business and
that's<00:03:51.160> probably<00:03:51.640> explains<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.720> little<00:03:52.930> bit<00:03:53.200> as

that's probably explains a little bit as

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.490

called a disastrous company for

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.019 
called a disastrous company for
all<00:06:40.969> their<00:06:41.449> choices<00:06:41.689> in<00:06:42.099> 2013<00:06:43.099> it's<00:06:43.819> really

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:44.029 
all their choices in 2013 it's really

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.299 
all their choices in 2013 it's really
hurting<00:06:44.330> their<00:06:44.539> image<00:06:44.869> especially<00:06:45.169> with<00:06:45.709> the

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:46.309 
hurting their image especially with the

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:48.339 
hurting their image especially with the
survivor<00:06:46.639> 2299<00:06:47.089> so<00:06:47.899> they're<00:06:48.050> in<00:06:48.139> a<00:06:48.169> bad

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
survivor 2299 so they're in a bad

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.049 
survivor 2299 so they're in a bad
position<00:06:48.559> and<00:06:49.129> I<00:06:49.249> think<00:06:49.519> they<00:06:49.639> need<00:06:49.849> to<00:06:49.879> make

00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:50.059 
position and I think they need to make

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:51.759 
position and I think they need to make
sure<00:06:50.119> they<00:06:50.389> have<00:06:50.419> fans<00:06:50.839> on<00:06:51.080> their<00:06:51.379> side<00:06:51.619> at

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:51.769 
sure they have fans on their side at

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:54.519 
sure they have fans on their side at
this<00:06:51.889> point<00:06:51.979> so<00:06:52.819> that's<00:06:52.969> more<00:06:53.360> evidence<00:06:54.199> as<00:06:54.469> to

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:54.529 
this point so that's more evidence as to

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:57.159 
this point so that's more evidence as to
why<00:06:54.769> an<00:06:55.099> announcement<00:06:55.639> is<00:06:55.729> key<00:06:56.029> but<00:06:56.809> what<00:06:57.110> do

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
why an announcement is key but what do

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:59.019 
why an announcement is key but what do
you<00:06:57.259> think<00:06:57.619> is<00:06:57.800> this<00:06:58.009> proof<00:06:58.309> enough<00:06:58.580> for<00:06:58.639> you

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029 
you think is this proof enough for you

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.919 
you think is this proof enough for you
are<00:06:59.179> you<00:06:59.269> going<00:06:59.419> to<00:06:59.479> wait<00:06:59.599> until<00:06:59.749> the<00:06:59.899> next
