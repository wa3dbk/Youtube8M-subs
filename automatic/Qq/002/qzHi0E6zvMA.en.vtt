00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.289
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.730
 play star wars battlefront 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:25.820
 one over the net there are many methods 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:28.430
 for example hamachi or plan but 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.039
 we will not consider this either 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.280
 You can buy a license Well, we do not 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:38.380
 interesting we will be through tunngle 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:42.890
 as it is called the program is not muddy 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:46.220
 understandable language register too 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.899
 easy link I leave under the video well 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.899
 actually go to tunngle 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.019
 we wait 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.040
 there are such characteristic sounds for 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.310
 programs for me here for example throughout 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.520
 our country as a provider Rostelecom 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.909
 Well here about spam so here we give well 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.990
 principle does not matter but does not particularly hinder here 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.220
 won here dim be your password here it is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.090
 automatically entered the failure 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.090
 sign up 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.930
 there is no special function here by the way 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.050
 messages the registrar click here and 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.560
 you in the browser of the new page 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.560
 opens 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.609
 now here is the connection all now 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.240
 we choose genres here 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.799
 subdivided the game well, for example 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.100
 sar wars battlefront one from he 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.299
 refers to the action select and search by 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:11.410
 name and put the places but I'm already an example 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.410
 know here 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.920
 not 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.830
 here's a star wars battlefront 1 right here 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.980
 eleven people out of 255 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.200
 also from star wars battlefront 2 not 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.200
 genre game connect 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.460
 this is all local network 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.800
 that is, if you are star wars 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.930
 go then there is local network here here 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.150
 other players are displayed they can 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.730
 friends add but i have in english 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.230
 someone will be in Russian here 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.920
 write something I do not know there oh well 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.670
 principle here from many countries here Russian 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.200
 little but it doesn't matter if you want to play 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.330
 with friends it doesnâ€™t interfere 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.190
 own do not close the program 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.770
 if you click this cross she doesn't 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.870
 curtailed in the tray you need to click this 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.060
 small little point she here 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.040
 it collapses now we go right in 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.040
 star wars loading 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.590
 Now it is over here are the logos 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.360
 get down 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.960
 click choose login click yes here 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.220
 important point in network options options 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.590
 choose hosting 256 kilobytes 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.480
 but this is more or less normal 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.840
 speeds and most internet 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.820
 supports the same speed if 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.670
 choose your server probably not 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.940
 see dollars in extreme cases can 128 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.110
 use but i am happy with the footage 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.920
 per second 30 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.090
 this is the most optimal looking 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.910
 show performance and better 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.000
 turn off this extra load she doesn't 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.530
 need to click take graphic here 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.959
 prices to your taste and to the maximum 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.780
 actually go to the network game 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:22.040
 your ip and then written version and then 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.950
 do you choose to create or enter 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.590
 Well, for example, create choose any card 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.860
 on my favorite tatoo 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.770
 so I'll choose her name here play here 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.040
 write a password here choose the order of the game 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.080
 okay or random order 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.080
 there is a server option it is important that this 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.000
 the line was always off otherwise your 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.260
 the server simply does not see the new play 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.180
 you can not and the team better to be 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.500
 the player's choice is so interesting to play 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.820
 heroes off 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.090
 you can play them without swamps 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.090
 at all 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.139
 Well, everything is accepted, we press and launch, but also 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.550
 I will not run 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.419
 my goal is only to show go to the network 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.910
 to come in 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.990
 and here we already see the server on it 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.400
 for some reason there are no people 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.080
 sometimes it happens here for 5 to 6 servers but 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.650
 if for example you created a server then 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.000
 your friend will flash here like your 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.139
 server actually think of it all 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 thanks by the way love 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.000
 likes subscribe all bye
