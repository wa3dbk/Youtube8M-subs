00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.410
 alright today i'm going to make you a 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.779
 little video to explain the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.309
 Season 3 preparations 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.380
 the occurrence you have been many to me 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.610
 ask for advice to book 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.230
 airline tickets for accommodations 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.730
 so I will explain to you how I 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.809
 I proceeded this season 3 will take more 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.430
 close to about ten planes 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.930
 so if there is a safe place she 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.100
 will have to save it's this one I 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.840
 will start by telling you about the site 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.460
 free internet liligo which is a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 comparator comparators 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.359
 so we'll do together a little 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.769
 simulation from paris in 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 direction of tokyo on the dates of 1st 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 February 2015 back on February 8, 2015 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 are going to have a little week at 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.960
 Japan for two adults 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.700
 it's gone and you break now 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.930
 the results by out of price it is necessary 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.460
 know that the me I like with 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.480
 stopovers if you want to save it's 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 one of the concessions that can be made 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 it's a stop somewhere we have 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.440
 30 for example air china like that by 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 example 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 Here I take the flight to 1200 euros it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.230
 take me back to the comparator go voyages 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.309
 it's an offer 2 go trips could 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.870
 so now proceed to your 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.239
 booking on your travels 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.470
 but before doing that what I can 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.600
 advise you to do is go 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.850
 see directly on the website 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.590
 air china to see if the prices are 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.430
 identical or even lower times 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 so here we will do a little 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 quickly simulate a total of 1200 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.150
 19 euros and wanted to see live 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.650
 with me the increase that practice 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.540
 all these companies websites 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.340
 air ticket comparator 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.619
 when you go back to see many times 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.750
 in a row the same plane ticket 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.829
 automatically it saves your 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.079
 ip address they know you are 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.450
 interested in these schedules by this 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.490
 airline ticket it increases the price there one 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.210
 has an increase of 20 euros for nothing 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.210
 before 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.770
 attention there are comparators that have 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 little traps you'll see for 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.750
 the same trip paris-tokyo go back 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.400
 we want to use edreams so see the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.660
 price which shows you 1150 euros 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.100
 once you have filled everything 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.680
 form that you have register and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.150
 you have registered your spouse or there 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.010
 and you are ready to pay 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.740
 you will see this is where 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.370
 the blog so we have a total of 1150 3 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.760
 euros you select your card from 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.830
 payment 1197 50 euros more expensive 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.690
 why because of office and dream come true 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.490
 actually count a reduction that 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.320
 you would have if you use a map 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.130
 visa between them pay that I even know 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.180
 not what it is I do not want to 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.940
 to know if alain who know me 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.950
 do not speak that and so and you count 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.240
 already a reduction before even knowing 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.800
 if you have the map then they will you 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.370
 propose a price that is not true in 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.870
 made at the start 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.640
 now we will move to housing 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.780
 me when I travel I need to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.460
 work every night to make a 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.840
 video so my blog so I have good 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.580
 internal connections to stable I need 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.050
 to be calm so that's going to be 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.910
 I am rather looking for comfort 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.500
 so to seek comfort I will 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.460
 go through a website that's going to be 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.530
 website 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.570
 airbnb maybe you know that 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.890
 allows you to rent apartments 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.959
 that private individuals put you to 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.489
 provision on the whole planet 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.050
 you will see the website is 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.489
 very simple it looks like his 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.300
 indicated the city you want to go 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.010
 so we will put 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.989
 we are going to Seoul and you want to go there 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.209
 go for example in the month of June so 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.160
 you 1 June and you stay there a long time 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.810
 you stay until the 15th of June 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.239
 you select the number of travelers 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.739
 we will say you want to go alone 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.800
 and you're looking for is actually it takes 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.170
 offer housing throughout the 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.360
 city ​​you can of course set if 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.830
 you want a room to share a 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.930
 private room or entire dwelling 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.100
 to have an apartment for you 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.570
 also have your interactive map that 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.810
 is left if you too 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.030
 you or but on an area 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.320
 he'll show you right only 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.730
 an apartment that is going to be in 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.680
 this area really allows you to 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.730
 very simply target places so 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.230
 I really like this site to make 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.600
 reservations or apartments through 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.260
 the world by cons attention this site 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.410
 Internet 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.700
 like for airline tickets if ever 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.790
 you will see an apartment this 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.260
 apartment there you 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.549
 you will see once you put 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.200
 side you'll see other stuff that 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.609
 you go back to see him they want to 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.109
 your ip address and when you go the 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.909
 see several times bout the price 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.620
 so this increases the practice that 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.799
 I hate and I really do not find 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.719
 there honest at all there is a way very 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.640
 simple on the part and that's when you 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.859
 have decided to choose your tickets 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.769
 plane or your accommodation you do not have 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.000
 on another andy and you'll be able to 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.140
 first blow that's why that where 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.970

 to travel beyond money if it's 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.239
 the more that can at the cost that stops you 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.919
 it's really easy to travel 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.930
 you just have to take the plane ticket 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.340

 wealth of joy and discovery games 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.349
