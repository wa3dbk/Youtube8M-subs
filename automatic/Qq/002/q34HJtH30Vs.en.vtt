okay<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:26.090> water<00:00:26.420> heater<00:00:26.720> has<00:00:27.050> been<00:00:27.490> turned

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
okay the water heater has been turned

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.140 
okay the water heater has been turned
off<00:00:28.730> at<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.000> breaker<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:30.550> we<00:00:31.550> have<00:00:31.670> taken<00:00:31.850> the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
off at the breaker and we have taken the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.590 
off at the breaker and we have taken the
covers<00:00:33.220> off<00:00:34.220> the<00:00:34.280> water<00:00:34.730> heater<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.180> top<00:00:35.390> and

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
covers off the water heater the top and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.790 
covers off the water heater the top and
the<00:00:35.660> bottom<00:00:36.400> to<00:00:37.400> get<00:00:37.580> to<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.760> elements<00:00:38.800> okay

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
the bottom to get to the elements okay

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.720 
the bottom to get to the elements okay
so<00:00:39.860> I'm<00:00:40.010> going<00:00:40.130> to<00:00:40.220> show<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:40.430> where<00:00:40.640> the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
so I'm going to show you where the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.840 
so I'm going to show you where the
elements<00:00:41.210> are<00:00:41.330> located<00:00:41.480> on<00:00:42.260> a<00:00:42.320> water<00:00:42.650> heater

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
elements are located on a water heater

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.240 
elements are located on a water heater
let's<00:00:43.850> go<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.180> top<00:00:44.360> one<00:00:44.570> first<00:00:45.040> you'll<00:00:46.040> see

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
let's go to the top one first you'll see

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.799 
let's go to the top one first you'll see
right<00:00:46.460> here<00:00:47.170> this<00:00:48.170> round<00:00:48.530> part<00:00:49.129> here<00:00:49.809> that's

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
right here this round part here that's

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.350 
right here this round part here that's
the<00:00:51.410> top<00:00:51.620> element<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:52.700> have<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.910> blue<00:00:53.120> wire

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
the top element you have the blue wire

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.740 
the top element you have the blue wire
and<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:55.070> yellow<00:00:55.280> wire<00:00:55.580> coming<00:00:56.120> down<00:00:56.330> feeding

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
and the yellow wire coming down feeding

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.560 
and the yellow wire coming down feeding
that<00:00:57.230> element<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:59.150> bottom<00:00:59.449> one<00:00:59.659> is<00:01:01.570> basically

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
that element the bottom one is basically

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.180 
that element the bottom one is basically
the<00:01:02.690> same<00:01:02.809> look<00:01:03.650> it's<00:01:03.949> a<00:01:04.840> round<00:01:05.920> part<00:01:06.920> right

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
the same look it's a round part right

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.570 
the same look it's a round part right
there<00:01:07.490> that's<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.479> end<00:01:08.690> of<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.050> element<00:01:09.710> and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
there that's the end of the element and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.750 
there that's the end of the element and
that's<00:01:10.790> where<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.150> see<00:01:11.360> a<00:01:11.630> black<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.760> red

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
that's where you see a black and red

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.740 
that's where you see a black and red
wire<00:01:14.030> feeding<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:16.330> you're<00:01:17.330> gonna<00:01:17.479> need<00:01:17.690> a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
wire feeding it you're gonna need a

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.240 
wire feeding it you're gonna need a
multimeter<00:01:18.409> like<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:20.350> it<00:01:21.350> has<00:01:21.530> two<00:01:21.920> probes

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
multimeter like this it has two probes

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.740 
multimeter like this it has two probes
and<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:24.020> test<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.470> element<00:01:24.890> you're<00:01:25.159> going<00:01:25.430> to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
and to test the element you're going to

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.580 
and to test the element you're going to
turn<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.900> dial<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.670> two<00:01:28.670> hundred<00:01:29.560> two<00:01:30.560> hundred

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
turn the dial to two hundred two hundred

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.110 
turn the dial to two hundred two hundred
ohms<00:01:31.370> right<00:01:32.150> there<00:01:32.890> two<00:01:33.890> hundred<00:01:34.130> ohms<00:01:35.620> and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
ohms right there two hundred ohms and

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:46.800 
ohms right there two hundred ohms and
now<00:01:38.120> I<00:01:38.420> will<00:01:38.630> show<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:38.840> how<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.050> test

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.110 

now<00:01:47.810> take<00:01:48.140> your<00:01:48.380> two<00:01:48.680> probes<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:49.400> you're

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
now take your two probes and you're

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.310 
now take your two probes and you're
going<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.710> touch<00:01:51.710> one<00:01:52.520> on<00:01:52.850> one<00:01:53.300> screw<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:53.990> one

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
going to touch one on one screw and one

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.460 
going to touch one on one screw and one
on<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.560> other<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:55.460> doesn't<00:01:55.820> really<00:01:55.970> matter<00:01:56.470> if

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
on the other it doesn't really matter if

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.250 
on the other it doesn't really matter if
it's<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.890> red<00:01:58.100> or<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.310> black<00:01:58.640> probe<00:01:59.260> we're

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
it's the red or the black probe we're

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.420 
it's the red or the black probe we're
trying<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.530> see<00:02:00.680> if<00:02:00.710> it's<00:02:00.920> completing<00:02:01.370> a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
trying to see if it's completing a

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.210 
trying to see if it's completing a
circuit<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:03.050> ohm<00:02:03.230> meter<00:02:03.590> should<00:02:03.950> read

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
circuit and the ohm meter should read

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.020 
circuit and the ohm meter should read
anywhere<00:02:04.820> between<00:02:05.030> 10<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:05.840> 16<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:07.040> right

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
anywhere between 10 and 16 and right

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.620 
anywhere between 10 and 16 and right
here<00:02:08.270> we<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.660> thirteen<00:02:09.320> point<00:02:09.770> two<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:11.060> we

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
here we have thirteen point two so we

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.559 
here we have thirteen point two so we
know<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:13.310> element<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.030> good

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.940 

now<00:02:19.569> we're<00:02:19.810> going<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.140> test<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.620> bottom

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
now we're going to test the bottom

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.800 
now we're going to test the bottom
element<00:02:22.799> down<00:02:23.799> here<00:02:24.450> we're<00:02:25.450> gonna<00:02:25.599> do<00:02:25.689> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
element down here we're gonna do the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.319 
element down here we're gonna do the
same<00:02:26.019> thing<00:02:26.319> this<00:02:27.099> one<00:02:27.310> has<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.730> red<00:02:28.030> and

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
same thing this one has the red and

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.539 
same thing this one has the red and
black<00:02:28.569> wire<00:02:28.870> feeding<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.590> we're<00:02:30.340> going<00:02:30.459> to

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
black wire feeding it we're going to

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.030 
black wire feeding it we're going to
touch<00:02:30.730> both<00:02:30.970> screws<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.810> see<00:02:32.769> what<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
touch both screws and see what the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.509 
touch both screws and see what the
reading<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.579> on<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.720> multimeter<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:42.340> we

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
reading is on the multimeter and as we

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.319 
reading is on the multimeter and as we
can<00:02:42.670> see<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.890> reading<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.519> 1<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.180> not

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
can see the reading is 1 so that is not

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.440 
can see the reading is 1 so that is not
between<00:02:49.720> 10<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.049> 16<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:51.549> we<00:02:51.579> know<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.000> this

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
between 10 and 16 so we know that this

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.170 
between 10 and 16 so we know that this
element<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.140> bad<00:02:53.549> we<00:02:54.549> are<00:02:54.609> going<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.909> have<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
element is bad we are going to have to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.840 
element is bad we are going to have to
replace<00:02:55.569> it
