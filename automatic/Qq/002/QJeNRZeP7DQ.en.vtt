00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.180
 you look in the mailbox or the yes 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.160
 post potential found then are 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.079
 surprise package will take place this time 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.510
 It's about a brush which I like very much 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.850
 I find interesting that I have some brushes 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 from Essens and I think for the price 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.930
 you can say absolutely nothing and me 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 find the are yourself design and design 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 yes, I have already tested it, of course 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 first washed and then completely yesterday 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.449
 tried and now defend yourself yes 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 to say something to every single brush 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.180
 and yes my opinion there for the future 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.549
 give 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.850
 on the one hand there is this brush here 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.119
 is a kita brush the as youngster 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.490
 quickly declared but I think 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.540
 not that you brush it well as a boxer 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.020
 can use 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.119
 because that's just a lot to resist 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.100
 So I have the guests foundation quickly 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.720
 So use it when you look at it 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.270
 he does not press here now 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.799
 somehow totally one and yes that has 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.259
 works great but I think 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.700
 now as a boxer brush with me him 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.320
 personally do not use but like 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.299
 said today for foundation is really 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.310
 I was very good with the next brush 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.930
 At first, you are a little skeptical 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.110
 the shape is a very flat one 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.970
 but quite big off the island 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.950
 It says that this is a brother and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.290
 fallopian tube brush rhine should 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.570
 and there thought something like a powder brush 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.509
 class works but that has 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.079
 wonderfully worked I use at the moment 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.000
 the transparent brother of food and yes 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.780
 then I always have it under here 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.240
 the eyes are given 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.710
 that was super super good yes and then 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.990
 just like that with the flat side or 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.630
 times spread over the whole face 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.980
 says brother added 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.920
 and also good switch on the skin 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.840
 that was really no ding as 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.070
 highlighter brush could you too 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.930
 very good use 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.360
 Maybe I do not feel quite like that 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.080
 precise on the nose or something but here 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.060
 It worked very well with me and 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.590
 I have a third option 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.270
 to use from this brush 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.070
 and I have the still to 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.780
 used contour and / or 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.640
 there now bronze to apply 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.640
 because I think with this narrow 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.710
 could the cheek completely fit here 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.360
 Good and yes then you can do that too 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.090
 nice associations because yes quite fluid 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.530
 is and I think that has quite good 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.720
 is working 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.940
 I also like the color here 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.340
 chosen because it brash brighter 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.980
 because you are the product then 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.960
 actually quite well on it recognizes the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.180
 next summit has a very nice 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.790
 color is pink and that is that 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.200
 blanche branche here I have to find 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.230
 I do not like the color though 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.460
 Well chosen because that's all in pink 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.290
 pink is but i find a bit 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.370
 difficult because you just do not like how much 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.170
 product on it has 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.180
 So I really just want this one 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.570
 Use if you know the book stuck 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.600
 or that's really great there 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.220
 documented what and yes that is so 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.110
 a stripped-down variant, I thought 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.030
 Also it could be the human of dacian 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.800
 use rapidly but it is not so 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.490
 because resistance here was not that bad 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.070
 I've just tried it out 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.600
 has worked wonderfully 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.430
 I would now, however, here in the paths 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.650
 does not say so completely pigmented seuss 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.350
 take too because I'm such a fluid 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.880
 brush is not hard so stop like 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.000
 said not meant to mine 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.370
 opinion but also not so 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.380
 super fluffy that you totally because the eu 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.380
 split again nice can blind 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.780
 and yes I think so right now 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.810
 film cream products quite well suited 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.660
 Then there are several eye brushes 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.070
 let's start with where I'm with 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.770
 The name is not quite so satisfied 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.310
 because blender brasch on it 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.450
 and you see that is such a pill 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.819
 so very short ago 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.349
 I think you can use it well and 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.269
 down eyelashes eyeshadow 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.150
 I did that yesterday as I did 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.700
 I quickly opened the door 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.450
 Blend is that now find nothing 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.370
 I would not be an island maybe 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.830
 otherwise very nice assortment 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.080
 but he just does his job 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.740
 not too vomit then a brush 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.169
 that also very much like that is the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.450
 priest dobratsch and yes I have 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.190
 applied in the eyelid has been wonderful 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.290
 It works so well 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.300
 So I think they are often so fluffy 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.070
 the windows for the elite and the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.870
 not at all that will be very precise 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.700
 but you can also down here on 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.669
 apply eyelashes eyeshadow or 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.780
 also a similar angle 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.700
 brush is here in this part and 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.040
 Although that is actually quite good for 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.050
 traveling for traveling because you are here completely 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.750
 many different things have so once 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.070
 this brush as grades actually 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.229
 not there is no difference of 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.419
 black and will stop chris 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.740
 bosh here called then you have the whole 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.780
 normal applicator and last but not least 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.650
 einkel branche because you could go to 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.090
 For example, follow the eyebrows 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.669
 I think that's nice for now 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.020
 me no but it must be quite 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.729
 Practical if you are traveling and not 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.530
 Would like to take 1000 brushes and now 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.139
 not the glaring eye make-up in front of you 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.400
 Last but not least there are these 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.340
 lips brush here 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.289
 I have to say that I think so 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.630
 bit color or swallowed 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.669
 not quite as good as the experience 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.080
 I had to do yesterday I think 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.570
 A pity, but I am too 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.060
 no lip specialist at all 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.419
 brush is almost never called which 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.210
 user-last but not least were after two 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.370
 things are not a pendulum 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.650
 in itself, however, is related to the topic 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.490
 has and once this 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.860
 storage box which I think is right 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.830
 cool fits super color scheme and is 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.289
 made of imitation leather and yes you can stop for 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.370
 travel clean the brush or what 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.160
 I definitely agree with this 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.080
 make brush 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.080
 Just set here and on the 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.240
 make a dressing table and too good 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.670
 Last was in my picture of the week 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.490
 with pretty that's what I have now 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.690
 ever said ok from the title seen 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.340
 I think I have not said it yet 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:34.140
 that's the brush cleaner and that's why 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.030
 also handy for traveling because 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.150
 one on vacation we in this time and 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.770
 Lust has the brush to wash though 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.020
 remember something like that is no substitute than you 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.840
 really need the brush so synonymous of 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.030
 Reason to clean from scratch 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.280
 soap or somehow baby shampoo or 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.680
 But that's just for in between 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.330
 very good if you change your color 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.000
 or want to use something or why 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.590
 she has to go fast, that's it 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.900
 now with my video already to the 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.240
 so I have to say that to me 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.050
 I like these eleven very much 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.910
 and sometimes the names are not quite correct 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.520
 or her lips is just not mine 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.740
 but otherwise i find that senses 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.660
 cool I know the prices straight 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.670
 not said upside but you know 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.410
 Eat her very cheap now 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.970
 Of course , as I said the avenue too 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.700
 down even more before not link box 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.700
 and yes I like the open the 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.770
 idea good the colors totally with the zick 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.910
 zack pattern and the dot and yes it 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.580
 is not enough is something else 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.740
 and if you 're in the brush of 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:38.460
 then i should be interested 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.660
 say hawks because so brushes are yes 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.500
 always forget it so fast 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.690
 sold out 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.400
 I wanted so often found and 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.740
 never got any just like that 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.960
 are gone quickly and if theirs 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.360
 partly in small circles then for
