00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.350 

eight<00:00:24.950> seconds<00:00:25.370> left<00:00:25.550> in<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.790> game<00:00:25.820> I'm<00:00:26.210> just

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
eight seconds left in the game I'm just

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.720 
eight seconds left in the game I'm just
going<00:00:26.570> to<00:00:26.660> play<00:00:26.840> both<00:00:27.140> of<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:27.580> systems<00:00:28.580> here

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
going to play both of the systems here

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.580 
going to play both of the systems here
at<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:28.940> same<00:00:29.150> time<00:00:29.330> you<00:00:29.690> can<00:00:29.900> see<00:00:30.350> the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
at the same time you can see the

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.409 
at the same time you can see the
experiences<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.520> started<00:00:31.910> on<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.180> netbook

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
experiences so I started on the netbook

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.110 
experiences so I started on the netbook
and<00:00:33.110> started<00:00:33.770> over<00:00:33.860> time<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.280> notebook<00:00:34.610> you

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
and started over time the notebook you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.680 
and started over time the notebook you
can<00:00:35.360> see<00:00:35.570> just<00:00:35.780> be<00:00:36.850> over<00:00:37.850> here<00:00:38.030> do<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:38.330> see<00:00:38.390> ray

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
can see just be over here do you see ray

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.479 
can see just be over here do you see ray
on<00:00:38.840> take<00:00:39.200> that<00:00:39.230> three-point<00:00:39.800> shot<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.280> you

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
on take that three-point shot and you

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.000 
on take that three-point shot and you
just<00:00:40.730> totally<00:00:40.940> missed<00:00:41.330> it<00:00:41.480> over<00:00:41.780> here<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.350> yeah

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
just totally missed it over here so yeah

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.220 
just totally missed it over here so yeah
but<00:00:43.220> much<00:00:43.370> better<00:00:43.550> training<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.239> go<00:00:44.420> go<00:00:45.020> full

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
but much better training to go go full

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.810 
but much better training to go go full
string<00:00:45.590> on<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.160> kind<00:00:46.370> of<00:00:46.400> hard<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.640> see

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
string on this it's kind of hard to see

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.010 
string on this it's kind of hard to see
and<00:00:46.910> not<00:00:47.030> only<00:00:47.120> that<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.360> can<00:00:47.570> see<00:00:47.750> that<00:00:47.780> this

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
and not only that you can see that this

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.770 
and not only that you can see that this
is<00:00:48.200> just<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.530> full<00:00:49.129> rich<00:00:49.460> experience<00:00:50.360> in<00:00:50.570> you

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
is just a full rich experience in you

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.299 
is just a full rich experience in you
this<00:00:51.170> is<00:00:51.320> something<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.770> people<00:00:51.830> are<00:00:52.160> going

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
this is something that people are going

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.250 
this is something that people are going
to<00:00:52.720> think<00:00:54.190> well<00:00:55.190> hey<00:00:55.310> we<00:00:55.489> can<00:00:55.610> fix<00:00:55.820> that<00:00:56.260> you

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
to think well hey we can fix that you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.780 
to think well hey we can fix that you
know<00:00:57.380> video<00:00:57.560> thing<00:00:57.890> if<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.100> slap<00:00:58.370> slap<00:00:58.760> a

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
know video thing if you slap slap a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.990 
know video thing if you slap slap a
graphics<00:00:59.210> chip<00:00:59.420> in<00:00:59.540> it<00:00:59.690> no<00:01:00.579> yes<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:01.730> can<00:01:01.790> put<00:01:01.970> a

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
graphics chip in it no yes you can put a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.490 
graphics chip in it no yes you can put a
graphics<00:01:02.420> chip<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:02.750> if<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:02.899> increase<00:01:03.410> the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
graphics chip in if you increase the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.530 
graphics chip in if you increase the
power<00:01:03.680> consumption<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.399> thumb<00:01:04.640> on<00:01:04.820> board<00:01:05.149> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
power consumption of thumb on board and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.389 
power consumption of thumb on board and
you<00:01:05.630> want<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.869> anything<00:01:06.080> at<00:01:06.259> all<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.700> okay<00:01:07.700> so

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
you want to anything at all that okay so

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.030 
you want to anything at all that okay so
so<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.119> believe<00:01:11.630> what<00:01:12.050> you'll<00:01:12.259> find<00:01:12.440> is<00:01:12.800> what

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
so so I believe what you'll find is what

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.770 
so so I believe what you'll find is what
he<00:01:13.160> wanted<00:01:13.399> to<00:01:13.520> represent<00:01:13.729> on<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.210> left<00:01:14.450> was

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
he wanted to represent on the left was

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.780 
he wanted to represent on the left was
was<00:01:15.410> something<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:15.979> didn't<00:01:16.250> burn<00:01:16.399> a<00:01:16.430> lot<00:01:16.640> of

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
was something that didn't burn a lot of

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.950 
was something that didn't burn a lot of
power<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.300> what<00:01:17.450> he<00:01:17.540> wanted<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.840> represent

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
power and what he wanted to represent

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.300 
power and what he wanted to represent
the<00:01:18.290> right<00:01:18.440> with<00:01:18.619> something<00:01:18.890> that<00:01:18.920> burned<00:01:19.190> a

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
the right with something that burned a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.340 
the right with something that burned a
lot<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.490> power<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.390> let's<00:01:20.570> go<00:01:20.720> off<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.170> see

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
lot of power so let's go off and see

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.469 
lot of power so let's go off and see
what<00:01:21.500> we<00:01:21.619> can<00:01:21.770> do<00:01:21.950> now<00:01:22.310> with<00:01:22.910> tegra<00:01:23.300> based

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
what we can do now with tegra based

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.930 
what we can do now with tegra based
platform<00:01:24.050> which<00:01:24.229> has<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:24.470> GPU<00:01:24.979> integrated<00:01:25.790> and

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
platform which has a GPU integrated and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:54.110 
platform which has a GPU integrated and
obviously<00:01:26.360> on<00:01:26.929> HD<00:01:27.319> video

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.110 

I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.140 

what<00:02:02.120> is<00:02:02.510> your<00:02:02.900> name<00:02:03.580> my<00:02:04.580> name<00:02:04.730> is<00:02:04.880> James

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
what is your name my name is James

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.800 
what is your name my name is James
Tiberius<00:02:05.450> Kirk<00:02:08.440> ok<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.770> piers<00:02:10.130> we<00:02:10.340> get

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
Tiberius Kirk ok so the piers we get

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.050 
Tiberius Kirk ok so the piers we get
that<00:02:11.810> looks<00:02:11.960> pretty<00:02:12.110> good<00:02:12.380> doesn't<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:13.060> so

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
that looks pretty good doesn't it so

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.990 
that looks pretty good doesn't it so
here's<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.720> GPU<00:02:15.320> does<00:02:15.770> an<00:02:15.890> awful<00:02:16.250> lot<00:02:16.370> for<00:02:16.430> HD

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
here's a GPU does an awful lot for HD

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.940 
here's a GPU does an awful lot for HD
video<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.690> appears<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.440> best<00:02:18.620> video

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
video that appears to be the best video

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.180 
video that appears to be the best video
you<00:02:19.190> saw<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.460> truth<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:20.000> sheriffs<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:21.190> and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
you saw the truth of sheriffs so and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.560 
you saw the truth of sheriffs so and
again<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.760> was<00:02:22.940> done<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.150> one<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.420> our

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
again that was done in one of our

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.870 
again that was done in one of our
partners<00:02:23.840> systems<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:25.250> was<00:02:25.370> done<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.670> well

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
partners systems and it was done in well

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.050 
partners systems and it was done in well
under<00:02:25.910> or<00:02:26.240> walk<00:02:26.590> right<00:02:27.590> probably<00:02:28.280> 12<00:02:28.730> or<00:02:28.850> 14

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060

is this is uh this is the user interface
that<00:02:34.880> people<00:02:35.150> will<00:02:35.270> see<00:02:35.420> when<00:02:35.570> they<00:02:35.660> killing

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
that people will see when they killing

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.780 
that people will see when they killing
these<00:02:36.020> devices<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:37.070> will<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.250> delivered<00:02:37.550> by
