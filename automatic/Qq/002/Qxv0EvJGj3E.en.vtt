00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.400
 you gil gil charlie and this is an ipod touch 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.790
 of fifth generation 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.380
 and ipod boiler but it's a very ipod 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.510
 special since this little ipod can 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 make calls with the simple my phone 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.130
 as if it were an iphone 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 we'll see 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.770
 in a gray finish 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.560
 as I did you can see it here in a box 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.180
 all of us who have been owners 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.630
 ever from an ipod touch we have had 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.370
 the dream of being able to get him to call 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.630
 that can serve as a phone arrives 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.380
 potassium much cheaper than 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.770
 iphone 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.200
 so I 've always had the idea of 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.920
 look for some mechanism for there the ipod 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.950
 touch 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.000
 let me be called 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.039
 and most of us probably got to 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.570
 use skiing for example that allows us 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.500
 make calls whenever there is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.850
 internet since the computer has wifi not 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.130
 has 3g connection but has wifi 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.079
 then where could we meet 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.880
 we can also call people 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.619
 that we have our team contacts 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.600
 and if you have money in ski you can call 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.600
 but the truth is quite limited 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.929
 if you have no credit card 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.929
 you can load 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.040
 If you do not have internet, then it is not 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.810
 pretty useless then all at the end 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.610
 all solutions depended on that 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.370
 We had wifi and sure as you usually 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.880
 occur some device 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.220
 and where will they connect well and that device 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.020
 will connect to the network gsm up arduino 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.930
 has a device to connect gsm 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.510
 science put together a question as well as a 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.660
 arduino that connects to the gsm network and 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.450
 then by bluetooth it connects to the ipod 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.230
 touch like we would have something like 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.690
 a kind of leds 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.750
 looking for your skin with the blue 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.610
 tooth that are some cases that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.170
 they performed exactly what I am 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.930
 saying the problem is that I had to 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.000
 sing them is 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.799
 at home and it was quite thick and 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.230
 finished turning the importance into 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.200
 a pretty heavy option and a little 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.810
 unpleasant perhaps you will be used 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.130
 and keep looking and that's how I found 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.910
 what we have here 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.290
 what is this little girl that looks like a 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.290
 multimedia player an mp4 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.670
 but in reality it is a device to 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:03:00.800
 which one inserts the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.490
 Grandma inserts your sim 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.870
 it's like that 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.870
 in this little slot 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.530
 Y 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.069
 the stop then is install on the client 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.290
 it's on the ipod touch and the 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.650
 conversion the potax into a story and 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.620
 as if this little child device 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.379
 not only allows you to enter a simple 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.090
 but two without or is not even 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.439
 turning your ipod touch into a 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.030
 phone only if you do not have a 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.740
 phone with doubles and fantastic 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.430
 so let's see a bit how 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.430
 this thing works 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.150
 and enough 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.830
 portals 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.830
 d 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.360
 a husband who comes with a manual in 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.010
 include chile has a cable that is 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.250
 equal to the fourth ipod touch 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.250
 generation 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.769
 has the same 30 day connector 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.229
 your blues is loaded with the same connector 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.639
 of 30 then for users of a 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.050
 fourth-generation iphone touch or 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.669
 all of the above is spectacular 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.390
 because you can use the same tablet to 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:36.410
 charge your ipod and your blues 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.690
 and good and then the only thing that had to 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.310
 make quite simple I did not download the 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.310
 application are blue 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.490
 I have a message 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.660
 - bloomberg there the messages arrive 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.210
 it will show recent flames 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.089
 and you can synchronize your contacts with 

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:04.660
 those of the ipod touch and with those of your 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:09.690
 SIM card 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.690
 and also has a cake party trailer 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.920
 you can not choose the simple 51 in this 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.400
 case I have only yells the 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.400
 singular 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.860
 and that's it 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.380
 also ultra several options like you 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.190
 you can change the tone of the phone 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.900
 when they call you and the text message 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.430
 you can also configure to add 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.190
 I do not have a plan on the internet 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:38.930
 moment to navigate minutes the problem 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.470
 so the only limitation is that this does not 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.470
 has a connection 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.660
 but good 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.400
 I will not have them all either 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.389
 and that pretty much installs itself from 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.150
 synchronize and I could make calls 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:05.150
 as they saw in the beginning 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.150
 and we will take to the service of the own one 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.200
 of the hypothesis 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.810
 and this according to what can be the backpack and 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.220
 the best thing is that it maintains the aesthetics of 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.200
 the ipod touch &amp; like from the 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.090
 ipod touch not like the covers that I 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.880
 I'm finding you take away all the 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.800
 aesthetics for example if you put it a 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.540
 clan muffler the ipod touch does not vibrate 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.810
 but the types of his influenced thought of 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.200
 that 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.490
 and this book has a vibrator 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.980
 then also against sending messages 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.980
 or a call this one made here 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.650
 so in that sense of the flames by 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.000
 that the only drawback is that the 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.970
 important as it was in flavor to do 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.980
 an iphone and does not have a headset only 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.510
 has the horn and then it sounds 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.250
 quite strong it could be in volume 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.980
 the calls so you hear more 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.530
 Slowly but it's nothing so terrible 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:12.740
 that can be solved and it's nothing 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:15.240
 can not solve a good headset 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.890
 with microphones that have to be 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.670
 wired so because the light connection 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.870
 is something else like negative and the connection 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.970
 bluetooth that is fully output 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.650
 can not can not if it seizes 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.870
 completely the application of the 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.360
 connecting him 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.040
 but for the benefits it brings I do not 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:39.730
 I have no problem 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:43.300
 and that's what I expect from him show club 

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.920
 made by fisher a Chinese company and that 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.030
 allows you to convert your ipod touch be in 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.590
 An iphone 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.360
 and soon this video gadget 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.220
 you probably find it on the page 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.100
 to take a lapse of the official store 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:58.320
 that is coming soon and that we see in 

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.320
 a next chapter of a box lapse 

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.350
 Of course he made me go and in the best of 

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:14.480
 world and thank you very much for your very 

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.480
 funny and cheerful acting
