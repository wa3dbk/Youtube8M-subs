things here shortly so I did make a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.760 
things here shortly so I did make a
change<00:02:37.800> there<00:02:39.080> everything<00:02:40.080> else<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.530> pretty

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
change there everything else is pretty

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.040 
change there everything else is pretty
much<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.040> same<00:02:41.490> as<00:02:42.420> far<00:02:42.630> as<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.990> goes

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
much the same as far as that goes

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.250

I think it's 11 dear man he's building

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.170 
I think it's 11 dear man he's building
some<00:02:59.250> dairy<00:02:59.940> barns<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:01.700> he's<00:03:02.700> got<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> really

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180

some dairy barns and he's got a really
nice<00:03:03.450> setup<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.410> give<00:03:04.710> him<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.890> little<00:03:05.040> shout

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
nice setup so I give him a little shout

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.480 
nice setup so I give him a little shout
out<00:03:06.030> there<00:03:06.390> who<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.250> quality<00:03:08.250> craftsmanship

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
out there who is a quality craftsmanship

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.100 
out there who is a quality craftsmanship
so<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.520> went<00:03:11.730> ahead<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:11.910> put<00:03:12.090> an<00:03:12.180> Iowa<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:12.810> and

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
so I went ahead and put an Iowa in and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.340 
so I went ahead and put an Iowa in and
he<00:03:13.800> has<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:14.040> center<00:03:14.460> gate<00:03:14.990> but<00:03:15.990> I'm<00:03:16.110> going<00:03:16.290> to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
he has a center gate but I'm going to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.780 
he has a center gate but I'm going to
run<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.500> different<00:03:16.890> operation<00:03:17.459> i'm<00:03:17.580> going<00:03:17.730> to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
run a different operation i'm going to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.199 
run a different operation i'm going to
go<00:03:17.880> free<00:03:18.150> stall<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:20.150> an<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.390> milk<00:03:21.660> house<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
go free stall and an a milk house and

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.800 
go free stall and an a milk house and
I'm<00:03:24.209> doing<00:03:24.480> my<00:03:24.690> gates<00:03:24.959> at<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> end<00:03:25.459> so

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
I'm doing my gates at the end so

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.000 
I'm doing my gates at the end so
basically<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.230> cows<00:03:28.440> will<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.740> out<00:03:28.860> to

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
basically the cows will be out to

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.530 
basically the cows will be out to
pasture<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.490> think<00:03:29.880> I'm<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.090> have<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.300> add

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
pasture I think I'm going to have to add

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.190 
pasture I think I'm going to have to add
another<00:03:31.430> small<00:03:32.430> section<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.209> my<00:03:33.360> display<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
another small section to my display so I

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.090 
another small section to my display so I
have<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.800> realistic<00:03:35.790> view<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.690> maybe<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.680> field

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
have a realistic view and maybe a field

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.449 
have a realistic view and maybe a field
I<00:03:38.370> wanted<00:03:39.270> to<00:03:39.330> put<00:03:39.510> kind<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.900> field<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.430> I

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
I wanted to put kind of a field in so I

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.120 
I wanted to put kind of a field in so I
can<00:03:41.730> do<00:03:42.090> some<00:03:42.320> videos<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.620> know<00:03:43.739> maybe<00:03:43.920> not

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
can do some videos you know maybe not

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.340
