00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hello everyone, today I am here to do 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.170
 starting the first lesson of the course in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.750
 restoration so let's move to the plane from 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:19.529
 work and we aim for things that are needed more 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.449
 our two short our brushes 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.699
 stucco 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.320
 in this table i very holes 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.720
 long then under committed a piece of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.380
 cardboard attached with scotch tape for 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.620
 do not obviously get off the grout 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.050
 on the ground then go and lose it 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.640
 so I'm going to put the stop with 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.710
 this brush that makes it very easy 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:53.219
 drafting because it is also very flexible 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.190
 then this curtain put on remains 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.109
 dry then it takes a lot if not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.570
 mind if you don't put alcohol 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.270
 however if you put the alcohol it takes us to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 less then this putty comes a little 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 maluccio from the sanding but second 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 I'm fine, I'm the same 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.130
 using it because I didn't have it at home 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.049
 normal grout so as you see I do 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.780
 see well now how good I am 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.000
 putting on and then removing the excesses 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.500
 obviously everything therefore has to be filled 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.880
 well you can wait for it to dry and 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.740
 avoid doing all this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.399
 smear that I did 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.930
 but start playing cards to remove excess 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.930
 so let's move on from there 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.259
 I hope you enjoyed this video and 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.960
 so bye and see you soon but 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.110
 remember to put cops verbs 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.189
 pleasure I like to share e 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.810
