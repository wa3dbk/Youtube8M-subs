00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
thinking here and try covering a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.450 
thinking here and try covering a
significant<00:01:44.240> portion<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.720> map<00:01:45.560> down<00:01:45.800> here<00:01:46.120> so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
significant portion of map down here so

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.800 
significant portion of map down here so
that<00:01:49.460> looks<00:01:49.700> good<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.060> me<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.480> you<00:01:50.570> might<00:01:50.780> say

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
that looks good to me and you might say

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.020

Dave<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.770> doesn't<00:01:52.070> cover<00:01:52.250> all<00:01:52.400> sorts<00:01:52.970> of

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
Dave it doesn't cover all sorts of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.110 
Dave it doesn't cover all sorts of
important<00:01:53.480> areas

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.210 

doesn't<00:01:57.960> it

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.530 

yeah<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.550> think<00:02:04.850> we're<00:02:04.970> going<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.150> have<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.390> go

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
yeah I think we're going to have to go

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.180 
yeah I think we're going to have to go
with<00:02:05.690> an<00:02:05.780> elementary<00:02:06.290> school<00:02:06.410> over<00:02:06.800> here<00:02:07.040> to

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
with an elementary school over here to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.760 
with an elementary school over here to
just<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:08.229> pretty<00:02:09.229> much<00:02:09.380> on<00:02:09.560> principle<00:02:10.130> actually

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
just a pretty much on principle actually

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.660 
just a pretty much on principle actually
hopefully<00:02:12.770> they<00:02:12.890> don't<00:02:13.010> get<00:02:13.160> bullied<00:02:13.460> by<00:02:13.640> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
hopefully they don't get bullied by the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.160 
hopefully they don't get bullied by the
University<00:02:14.570> types<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:16.450> oh<00:02:17.450> yeah<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.960> last

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
University types and oh yeah that last

University types and oh yeah that last
thing<00:02:18.530> health<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:24.320> probably<00:02:24.560> time<00:02:24.980> for

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
thing health it's probably time for

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.850 
thing health it's probably time for
another<00:02:25.280> mini<00:02:25.670> center<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.270> city<00:02:26.450> anyway

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.200

just<00:06:02.850> going<00:06:02.970> to<00:06:03.000> let<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.180> run<00:06:03.450> for<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.720> little

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
just going to let it run for a little

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.420 
just going to let it run for a little
bit<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:04.260> on<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:05.160> note<00:06:05.400> actually<00:06:07.250> yeah<00:06:08.250> we're

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
bit and on that note actually yeah we're

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.470 
bit and on that note actually yeah we're
probably<00:06:08.610> not<00:06:08.790> going<00:06:08.940> to<00:06:09.000> get<00:06:09.150> much<00:06:09.270> more

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.260 
probably not going to get much more
growth<00:06:09.750> over<00:06:10.050> there<00:06:10.230> I<00:06:11.030> should<00:06:12.030> probably

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
growth over there I should probably

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.060 
growth over there I should probably
