like<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.489> know<00:03:32.670> now<00:03:33.060> there's<00:03:33.450> no<00:03:33.600> denying<00:03:33.959> that

the<00:03:34.260> interior<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.830> trucks<00:03:35.190> has<00:03:35.430> come<00:03:36.090> on

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
the interior of trucks has come on

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.259 
the interior of trucks has come on
hugely<00:03:36.630> from<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:36.989> utilitarian<00:03:37.980> roots<00:03:38.489> but

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
hugely from the utilitarian roots but

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.360 
hugely from the utilitarian roots but
for<00:03:39.450> me<00:03:39.570> it's<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.840> RAM<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:40.860> shades<00:03:41.130> it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
for me it's the RAM that just shades it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.090 
for me it's the RAM that just shades it
J<00:03:42.060> these<00:03:42.329> vehicles<00:03:42.600> are<00:03:42.959> working<00:03:43.590> tools<00:03:43.829> and

J these vehicles are working tools and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.340 
J these vehicles are working tools and
value<00:03:44.430> really<00:03:44.940> matters<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.989> Silverado

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
value really matters so is the Silverado

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.870 
value really matters so is the Silverado

well<00:03:48.329> Silverado<00:03:48.720> offers<00:03:49.170> legitimate<00:03:49.980> value

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220

over<00:03:53.220> here<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.459> might<00:03:53.579> be<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.000> category

but anyway the RAM really does have a

awesome but the RAM is enjoyable to

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.180 
awesome but the RAM is enjoyable to
drive<00:05:24.840> thanks<00:05:25.260> to<00:05:25.350> its<00:05:25.440> suspension<00:05:25.830> and

what<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.020> RAM<00:05:31.140> also<00:05:31.410> has<00:05:31.530> going<00:05:31.740> for<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:32.040> is<00:05:32.250> a

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
what the RAM also has going for it is a

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.210 
what the RAM also has going for it is a
big<00:05:33.540> rig<00:05:33.720> styling<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.380> mean<00:05:34.620> it<00:05:34.740> really<00:05:35.010> looks

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
big rig styling I mean it really looks

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.490 
big rig styling I mean it really looks
like<00:05:35.310> an<00:05:35.580> 18-wheeler<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.300> guys<00:05:36.870> like<00:05:37.290> their

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
like an 18-wheeler and guys like their

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.490 
like an 18-wheeler and guys like their
trucks<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:38.070> look<00:05:38.550> tough<00:05:38.760> but<00:05:39.060> guys<00:05:39.960> also<00:05:40.320> want

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
trucks to look tough but guys also want

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.990 
trucks to look tough but guys also want
their<00:05:40.620> trucks<00:05:40.860> to<00:05:41.010> be<00:05:41.040> capable<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.700> you're

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
their trucks to be capable and you're

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.640 
their trucks to be capable and you're
right<00:05:42.150> trucks<00:05:42.480> aren't<00:05:42.690> about<00:05:42.930> fun<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.410> drive

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
right trucks aren't about fun to drive

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.800 
right trucks aren't about fun to drive
this<00:05:43.890> it<00:05:44.430> all<00:05:44.520> comes<00:05:44.730> down<00:05:44.790> to<00:05:44.910> capability<00:05:45.660> and

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
this it all comes down to capability and

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.500 
this it all comes down to capability and
comfort<00:05:46.170> in<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.350> Silverado<00:05:46.860> has<00:05:47.400> very<00:05:48.240> nearly

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
comfort in the Silverado has very nearly

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.750 
comfort in the Silverado has very nearly
the<00:05:48.690> same<00:05:48.870> comfort<00:05:49.320> as<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.620> RAM<00:05:49.830> but<00:05:50.250> offers

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
the same comfort as the RAM but offers

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.640 
the same comfort as the RAM but offers
more<00:05:51.000> trucky<00:05:51.360> capability<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:52.260> makes<00:05:52.500> it

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
more trucky capability that makes it

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.680 
more trucky capability that makes it
better<00:05:52.770> well<00:05:53.430> I'll<00:05:53.640> give<00:05:53.910> you<00:05:53.940> that<00:05:54.180> except

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
better well I'll give you that except

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.350 
better well I'll give you that except
for<00:05:54.930> my<00:05:55.230> own<00:05:55.280> research<00:05:56.280> which<00:05:56.580> I<00:05:56.730> have<00:05:56.880> no<00:05:57.060> data

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
for my own research which I have no data

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.900 
for my own research which I have no data
to<00:05:57.660> show<00:05:57.990> says<00:05:58.770> that<00:05:59.040> most<00:05:59.220> people<00:05:59.550> drive<00:05:59.730> the

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
to show says that most people drive the

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.910 
to show says that most people drive the
trucks<00:06:00.180> on<00:06:00.360> a<00:06:00.390> daily<00:06:00.720> basis<00:06:01.140> more<00:06:01.440> like<00:06:01.620> cars

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
trucks on a daily basis more like cars

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.620 
trucks on a daily basis more like cars
and<00:06:02.190> so<00:06:02.610> for<00:06:02.820> that<00:06:02.910> reason<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.330> RAM<00:06:03.480> is

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
and so for that reason the RAM is

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.750 
and so for that reason the RAM is
actually<00:06:04.020> better<00:06:04.230> because<00:06:04.470> it's<00:06:05.070> because<00:06:05.730> a

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
actually better because it's because a

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.150 
actually better because it's because a
drive<00:06:06.000> nicer<00:06:06.330> I<00:06:06.540> got<00:06:07.440> nothing<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.740> say<00:06:07.800> that

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
drive nicer I got nothing to say that

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.800 
drive nicer I got nothing to say that
because<00:06:08.280> you're<00:06:08.460> actually<00:06:08.760> right<00:06:08.940> I'm<00:06:09.540> going

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
because you're actually right I'm going

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.750 
because you're actually right I'm going
to<00:06:09.870> cut<00:06:10.050> in<00:06:10.230> and<00:06:10.350> end<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:10.650> madness<00:06:11.190> now<00:06:11.220> that

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
to cut in and end this madness now that

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.480 
to cut in and end this madness now that
the<00:06:12.210> RAM<00:06:12.450> might<00:06:12.750> not<00:06:12.960> be<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.170> raptor<00:06:13.710> but<00:06:14.370> in

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
the RAM might not be a raptor but in

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.450 
the RAM might not be a raptor but in
this<00:06:14.610> contest<00:06:15.150> it<00:06:15.330> is<00:06:15.480> marginally<00:06:16.380> more<00:06:17.160> fun

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
this contest it is marginally more fun

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.820 
this contest it is marginally more fun
the<00:06:18.000> RAM<00:06:18.270> has<00:06:18.300> three<00:06:18.840> points<00:06:19.050> and<00:06:19.410> the
