00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
game understanding game sense to bring

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.699 
game understanding game sense to bring
other<00:02:22.010> people<00:02:22.220> into<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.640> game<00:02:22.940> and

other people into the game and

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.800 
other people into the game and
athleticism<00:02:24.709> clearly<00:02:25.489> is<00:02:25.880> really<00:02:26.540> really

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
athleticism clearly is really really

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.070 
athleticism clearly is really really
important<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:28.100> great<00:02:28.130> attitude<00:02:29.080> that's

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
important and a great attitude that's

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.100 
important and a great attitude that's
what<00:02:30.200> we<00:02:30.470> look<00:02:30.680> for<00:02:30.739> trying<00:02:31.489> judge<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.750> pace

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
what we look for trying judge the pace

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.660 
what we look for trying judge the pace
and<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.530> number<00:02:33.769> of<00:02:33.860> bounces<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.340> want<00:02:34.580> to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
and the number of bounces you want to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.850 
and the number of bounces you want to
put<00:02:34.819> in<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.000> ball<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:35.660> if<00:02:36.140> I'm<00:02:36.350> going<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.620> say<00:02:36.799> 2

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
put in the ball so if I'm going to say 2

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.820 
put in the ball so if I'm going to say 2
G<00:02:37.160> by<00:02:37.190> 2<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.810> can<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.290> bounce<00:02:39.440> twice

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
G by 2 and I can get it to bounce twice

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.370 
G by 2 and I can get it to bounce twice
before<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.489> kicks<00:02:40.760> up<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.150> G<00:02:41.330> by<00:02:41.510> that's<00:02:42.230> a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
before it kicks up to G by that's a

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.250 
before it kicks up to G by that's a
point<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.860> me<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.280> I'm<00:02:43.790> going<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.330> say<00:02:44.540> 2<00:02:44.600> all

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
point to me so I'm going to say 2 all

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.430 
point to me so I'm going to say 2 all

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
things that we should hopefully be able

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.270 
things that we should hopefully be able
to<00:02:53.870> help<00:02:54.170> them<00:02:54.380> with<00:02:54.620> if<00:02:54.769> they've<00:02:54.950> got<00:02:55.160> the
