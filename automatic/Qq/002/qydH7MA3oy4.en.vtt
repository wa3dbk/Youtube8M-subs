I work hard at home but it's another

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:45.910 
I work hard at home but it's another
level<00:01:44.899> when<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.080> get

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
level when you get

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.440 
level when you get
actually<00:01:46.920> big<00:01:47.580> difference<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.120> high<00:01:48.210> school

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
actually big difference in high school

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.120 
actually big difference in high school
we<00:01:48.510> didn't<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.810> Moscow<00:01:49.530> didn't<00:01:49.770> looked<00:01:50.010> at

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
we didn't in Moscow didn't looked at

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.580 
we didn't in Moscow didn't looked at
many<00:01:50.280> ways<00:01:50.430> though<00:01:50.870> if<00:01:51.870> anything<00:01:52.380> probably

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
many ways though if anything probably

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.580 
many ways though if anything probably
bench<00:01:52.890> press<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.270> totally<00:01:54.270> different<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.870> think

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
bench press is totally different I think

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.110 
bench press is totally different I think
it's<00:01:55.710> important<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.220> teach<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.670> kids<00:01:56.910> why

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
it's important to teach the kids why

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.109 
it's important to teach the kids why
