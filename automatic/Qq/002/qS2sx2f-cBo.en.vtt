00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.850
 art 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.239
 for seniors 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.210
 the slogans of the campaign 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.210
 to separate from you 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.999
 a day before to save his life the movement was critical 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.640
 Ethical bodies teach me something reel and this time to save you the next 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.580
 time 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.570
 try 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.650
 who knows 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.760
 very well we will start with something 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.020
 Luis 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.010
 but I'm afraid we're going to have to be 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 for now a new muse 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.070
 but this has been the first choice 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.220
 one wind and the second 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.920
 I felt marginalized since we arrived a flight of sawdust mud pipes 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.060
 I think having control of the termite plague this place has everything that 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.960
 you can imagine inserts in conversations that can extend through 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.400
 pest treatment 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.940
 I find this place repellent 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.920
 palache surprised faces 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.400
 you should have told me I do not think I should leave those waves 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.540
 so we can have a private discussion like you call it then 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.120
 we will publish throughout the world 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.390
 roddick what are you doing here 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.160
 three of the united nations onu reported this yes he promised him director of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.060
 informative that will never get report from the center 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.350
 everybody something more important than the threat I do if it represents 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.869
 for all the planet nobody those things commented all that information 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.390
 confidential but all these parties my words for personal benefit 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.690
 what is about to conclude 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.120
 to achieve it in offside 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.310
 the producer filmmaker and everybody has to know how to separate the personal and the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.560
 professional 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 If you can not do that, we have nothing else to talk about 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.200
 I think we are dealing with a termite colony 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 this is what they have done in the jungle in less than two weeks 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.090
 this kind of massive destruction 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.680
 they start hundreds of species of animals and plants santana I do not always 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.659
 pointed out that the program could disappear psychologically and asks 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.939
 bills 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.549
 I do not know a normal queen can lay thousands of eggs in a week 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.049
 some become soldiers equipped with two powerful brushes 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.690
 for her I have seen them before their movements generate ultrasound waves 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.640
 yes that can be heard throughout the colony the soldiers allow him to defend his 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.529
 territory 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.369
 the workers are the ones who go out for the food because we did not make the colony 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.569
 hope and we have just once 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.049
 duke this Monday president 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.329
 we can not people would cause an environmental disaster vega 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.930
 well we talk what we do has to be soon 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.930
 I have tickets for the opera on Friday 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.749
 you have no idea what this experience is 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.029
 and I would love for you to torture me in the Vikings screaming loudly 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.759
 open it's a shame that thermals can not hear it according to local media 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.999
 first there are no distinctions in china and second officer 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.259
 and in the case Messi always and Vikings 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:27.989
 hundreds of indigenous people said that among them they communicate through 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:28.849
 ultrasound 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.439
 and if we look for something to interfere facto and its signals 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.079
 so we could manipulate them, of course we have to generate our 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.299
 own sound waves at a frequency of 50 thousand ar 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.379
 that humans can not hear the petitioner in this case that could 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.819
 go crazy do not worry about getting a couple of plugs 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.239
 very well in both the soldiers and the meat workers of the arts 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.239
 from star more to the queens of their flights 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:16.030
 telvent called AIDS 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.739
 before ensuring that it's a good idea 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.739
 I do not think we have many more options at all 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:27.090
 now 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.090
 I thought the cockroaches were worse 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.669
 last stop 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.309
 in the complaint of the people 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.849
 pretend women 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.849
 it occurred to him and who is going to do 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.279
 the peace of this year 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.819
 in what remains of the week 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.819
 throughout 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.319
 we can not with all of them pp are taking over 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.389
 the meeting that will take place in the loopholes
