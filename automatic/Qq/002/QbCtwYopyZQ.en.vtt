00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
about this is the fact that a first and

about this is the fact that a first and
foremost<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.610> only<00:00:38.760> use<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:38.969> lock<00:00:39.420> or

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
foremost you can only use one lock or

foremost you can only use one lock or

you can use only one lock to keep it
locked

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
locked

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.830 
locked
instead<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.440> using<00:00:44.100> both<00:00:44.489> holes<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.510> some<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
instead of using both holes like some of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
instead of using both holes like some of
them<00:00:45.989> require<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.489> even<00:00:47.700> though

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
them require as you can see even though

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.029 
them require as you can see even though
I<00:00:48.000> am<00:00:48.210> using<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.660> lock<00:00:48.930> no<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.680> would<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.950> able

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I am using one lock no one would be able

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.910 
I am using one lock no one would be able
to<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.579> gun<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.739> reason

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to get that gun out of there the reason

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.209 
to get that gun out of there the reason
I<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.649> ever<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
I do this is because if there is ever is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.150 
I do this is because if there is ever is
a<00:00:56.250> chance<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.090> reason<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.840> I'm

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
a chance or a reason that I'm

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.970 
a chance or a reason that I'm
transferring<00:00:59.160> my<00:00:59.399> handgun<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:01.260> situation

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
transferring my handgun and a situation

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.100 
transferring my handgun and a situation
arises<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.120> need<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.690> use<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
arises that I actually need to use it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.250 
arises that I actually need to use it
I'd<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:05.129> rather<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.790> need<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
I'd much rather just need to do this and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.910 
I'd much rather just need to do this and
get<00:01:07.770> started<00:01:08.180> then<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.780> know<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> unlock

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
get started then you know have to unlock

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
get started then you know have to unlock
both<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.369> them<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> few<00:01:12.570> extra

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
both of them and have a few extra

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.330 
both of them and have a few extra
seconds<00:01:13.200> where<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> may<00:01:13.650> actually<00:01:13.830> matter

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
seconds where it may actually matter

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060 
seconds where it may actually matter
so<00:01:15.299> Pelican<00:01:15.990> cases<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.560> I'm<00:01:16.680> sure<00:01:16.890> you've

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so Pelican cases as I'm sure you've

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
so Pelican cases as I'm sure you've
already<00:01:17.220> actually<00:01:17.490> heard<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.150> are

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
already actually heard of them are

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170 
already actually heard of them are
really<00:01:19.439> considered<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> top<00:01:20.250> tier<00:01:20.549> cases<00:01:21.000> for

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
really considered the top tier cases for

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
really considered the top tier cases for
a<00:01:21.210> couple<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> reasons<00:01:21.860> first<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.159> they're

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a couple of reasons first of all they're

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.649 
a couple of reasons first of all they're
pretty<00:01:23.970> damn<00:01:24.659> near<00:01:24.960> indestructible<00:01:26.659> they're

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
pretty damn near indestructible they're

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
pretty damn near indestructible they're
made<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.049> plastic<00:01:28.080> instead<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.890> metal<00:01:28.979> so

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
made of plastic instead of metal so

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580 
made of plastic instead of metal so
they're<00:01:29.520> actually<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.060> lighter<00:01:30.299> too<00:01:30.600> but

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
they're actually a bit lighter too but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
they're actually a bit lighter too but
the<00:01:32.430> way<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> plastic<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the way they make the plastic and the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.210 
the way they make the plastic and the
formula<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> plastic<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:34.920> use<00:01:35.070> is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
formula of the plastic they use is

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.950 
formula of the plastic they use is
actually<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.790> high<00:01:36.000> impact<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.689> one

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
actually very high impact which is one

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.840 
actually very high impact which is one
of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> reasons<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.530> pillow<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.520> actually

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
of the reasons that pillow can actually

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.310 
of the reasons that pillow can actually
have<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> lifetime<00:01:39.479> warranty<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> their

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
have a lifetime warranty in all of their

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.740 
have a lifetime warranty in all of their
cases<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.400> if<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.759> case<00:01:42.000> ever<00:01:42.180> breaks<00:01:42.570> or

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
cases so if this case ever breaks or

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.630 
cases so if this case ever breaks or
gets<00:01:42.869> damaged<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.189> use<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
gets damaged in a way that I can use it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.789 
gets damaged in a way that I can use it
I<00:01:44.759> literally<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:46.020> call<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> Pelican<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
I literally just call it Pelican and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.380 
I literally just call it Pelican and
they'll<00:01:47.009> send<00:01:47.280> me<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> new<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:48.060> that's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
they'll send me a new one because that's

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.880 
they'll send me a new one because that's
the<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.740> think

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the what you know they really think

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.340

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
have this pressure release valve

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.470 
have this pressure release valve
so<00:02:31.920> if<00:02:32.040> there's<00:02:32.190> ever<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.520> gas<00:02:32.820> buildup<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.360> any

so if there's ever a gas buildup of any

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.020 
so if there's ever a gas buildup of any
sort<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.930> there<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.520> obvious<00:02:35.520> reasons<00:02:35.880> or

sort in there for obvious reasons or

less<00:02:36.150> obvious<00:02:36.540> reasons<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:38.370> will<00:02:38.550> make<00:02:38.700> sure

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
less obvious reasons this will make sure

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.970 
less obvious reasons this will make sure
that<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:40.200> know<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.380> doesn't<00:02:40.530> violently

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
that you know it doesn't violently

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.120 
that you know it doesn't violently
explode<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.820> cause<00:02:42.420> harm<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.810> anybody<00:02:43.110> at<00:02:43.980> the

explode and cause harm to anybody at the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.680 
explode and cause harm to anybody at the
same<00:02:44.340> time<00:02:44.520> if<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.700> ever<00:02:44.880> falls<00:02:45.180> under<00:02:45.450> water

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
same time if this ever falls under water

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.420 
same time if this ever falls under water
or<00:02:45.870> something<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.830> deep<00:02:47.070> that's

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
or something really really deep that's

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.070 
or something really really deep that's
also<00:02:47.910> another<00:02:48.090> reason<00:02:48.420> they<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.720> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
also another reason they have that to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.960 
also another reason they have that to
just<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.410> know<00:02:49.440> equalize<00:02:50.190> gasses<00:02:50.670> between

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
just you know equalize gasses between

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.420 
just you know equalize gasses between
the<00:02:51.090> two<00:02:51.239> sides<00:02:52.670> at<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.730> same<00:02:53.850> time<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.600> case

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
the two sides at the same time this case

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.890 
the two sides at the same time this case
actually<00:02:56.430> comes<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.180> something<00:02:57.390> called<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
actually comes with something called the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.500 
actually comes with something called the
pluck<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.650> pick<00:02:59.459> foam<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.120> see<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.390> one

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
pluck and pick foam you can see the one

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.540 
pluck and pick foam you can see the one
I'm<00:03:00.600> spreading<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:03.290> it's<00:03:04.290> actually<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:05.130> bunch

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
I'm spreading this it's actually a bunch

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.090 
I'm spreading this it's actually a bunch
of<00:03:05.730> little<00:03:05.910> squares<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:07.080> foam<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.830> what<00:03:07.980> you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100

put your phone in this if you want and
you<00:03:12.590> outline<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.640> literally

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you outline it and then you literally

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.820 
you outline it and then you literally
just<00:03:15.300> go<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.690> there<00:03:15.900> with<00:03:16.080> your<00:03:16.230> fingers<00:03:16.290> and

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
just go in there with your fingers and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.009 
just go in there with your fingers and
you<00:03:16.890> pull<00:03:17.190> out<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.640> foam<00:03:17.850> what<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.630> did<00:03:18.870> though

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
you pull out the foam what I did though

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.100 
you pull out the foam what I did though
is<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.290> actually<00:03:19.760> cut<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:21.090> rough<00:03:21.690> shape<00:03:21.959> of

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
is I actually cut it a rough shape of

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.080 
is I actually cut it a rough shape of
where<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.350> should<00:03:22.380> be<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.860> pulled<00:03:23.820> out<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
where it should be I pulled out the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.350 
where it should be I pulled out the
whole<00:03:24.269> piece<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.690> foam<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:26.430> then<00:03:26.760> afterwards

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
whole piece of foam and then afterwards

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.060 
whole piece of foam and then afterwards
I<00:03:27.540> cut<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.959> back<00:03:28.110> end<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.560> just<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.920> make<00:03:29.040> it

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
I cut the back end of it just to make it

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.259 
I cut the back end of it just to make it
a<00:03:29.160> little<00:03:29.250> bit<00:03:29.400> small<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.820> put<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.120> back<00:03:30.150> in

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
a little bit small and I put it back in

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.690 
a little bit small and I put it back in
and<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:31.440> gives<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.829> nice<00:03:32.040> backdrop<00:03:32.400> to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
and that gives this a nice backdrop to

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.370 
and that gives this a nice backdrop to
actually<00:03:33.239> rest<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.900> which<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.230> way<00:03:34.320> you

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
actually rest on which is the way you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.740 
actually rest on which is the way you
should<00:03:34.470> be<00:03:34.709> doing<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.100> as<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:36.209> can<00:03:36.360> see<00:03:36.540> this

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
should be doing it as you can see this

as well I think that for all intents and

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.810 
as well I think that for all intents and
purposes<00:04:07.140> I'd<00:04:07.680> rather<00:04:07.860> have<00:04:08.160> two<00:04:08.489> fully

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
purposes I'd rather have two fully

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.420 
purposes I'd rather have two fully
loaded<00:04:09.090> magazines<00:04:09.630> ready<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.049> go<00:04:10.200> then<00:04:11.040> one
