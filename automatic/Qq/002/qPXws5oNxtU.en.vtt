 so very careful not to take the sun 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.720

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.090

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.830
 duckling and was transferred to itabom 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.010

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.420

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.080

 stainless steel and antique cap and stainless steel 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.520
 too much salt in the nascar at first can run away 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.620
 without metal if you saw that other 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.840
 fully rusted grill on the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.140
 sun case is a kind of coarse salt 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.880

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.400

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.110
 rodriguinho is burned in the climate 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:56.220
 because it does not stop in direct contact with the 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:58.920
 people in the house put the blame for everything here 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.340
 on top of the normal archer 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.250
 guilt was controlled 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.530
 no contact 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:15.480
 that's why you put it on again 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:19.310
 look at the good clean off the pond who 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.310

 I'll get it, at least it provides for the closing 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.599
 to cook because the faster the 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.729
 the temperature of the meat is there 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:51.910

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:08.569
 more about an exclusive optics in 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:12.169
