devices they differentiate themselves by
HTC<00:00:42.059> Sense<00:00:42.540> right<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.770> obviously<00:00:44.300> Microsoft

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
HTC Sense right so obviously Microsoft

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.119 
HTC Sense right so obviously Microsoft
or<00:00:45.510> prevents<00:00:45.930> people<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.530> manufacturers

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
or prevents people the manufacturers

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.490 
or prevents people the manufacturers
from<00:00:47.280> customizing<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> software<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
from customizing the software in the the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.160 
from customizing the software in the the
operating<00:00:49.860> system<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.730> HTC<00:00:51.660> has<00:00:51.750> gone<00:00:51.930> around

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
operating system so HTC has gone around

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
operating system so HTC has gone around
