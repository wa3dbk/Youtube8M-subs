00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
its curliness but right now it's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.990 
its curliness but right now it's
straight<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.630> course<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:23.039> will<00:00:23.430> pull<00:00:23.699> some

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.819 

you

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.329 

so<00:00:37.399> you<00:00:37.489> can<00:00:37.640> see<00:00:37.820> how<00:00:38.409> curly<00:00:39.409> actually<00:00:40.070> it<00:00:40.190> is

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
so you can see how curly actually it is

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.469 
so you can see how curly actually it is
I<00:00:40.670> really<00:00:41.629> like<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.530> way<00:00:42.559> because<00:00:43.550> i<00:00:44.210> don't

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
I really like the way because i don't

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.869 
I really like the way because i don't
know<00:00:44.539> i<00:00:44.600> never<00:00:44.749> had<00:00:45.140> curly<00:00:45.500> hair<00:00:45.530> before<00:00:45.879> but

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
know i never had curly hair before but

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.479 
know i never had curly hair before but
this<00:00:47.359> time<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:48.079> was<00:00:48.229> different<00:00:48.260> because<00:00:48.829> i

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
this time it was different because i

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.299 
this time it was different because i
might<00:00:50.089> want<00:00:50.449> to<00:00:50.539> try<00:00:50.659> something<00:00:50.899> new<00:00:51.049> and<00:00:51.799> I

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
might want to try something new and I

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.279 
might want to try something new and I
was<00:00:52.549> like<00:00:52.760> searching<00:00:53.089> and<00:00:53.719> looking<00:00:53.750> for

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
was like searching and looking for

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.049 
was like searching and looking for
reviews<00:00:54.649> on<00:00:54.859> this<00:00:54.979> week<00:00:55.219> which<00:00:55.430> is<00:00:55.579> not<00:00:55.850> that

straight<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.119> none<00:01:00.109> of<00:01:00.140> them<00:01:00.699> had<00:01:01.699> any<00:01:02.180> of<00:01:02.989> it

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.770 
straight and none of them had any of it
looking<00:01:03.500> straight<00:01:03.859> so<00:01:04.369> um<00:01:04.789> I<00:01:05.179> had<00:01:05.509> to<00:01:05.630> split

for about a month and I have died it
many<00:01:09.200> times<00:01:09.560> as<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.009> can<00:01:10.159> see<00:01:10.429> later<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.789> in

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
many times as you can see later on in

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.020 
many times as you can see later on in
this<00:01:11.270> video<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:12.549> dyed<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:13.780> blue<00:01:14.780> purple<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:16.030> I

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
this video I dyed it blue purple and I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.169 
this video I dyed it blue purple and I
bleached<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.110> I<00:01:18.920> did<00:01:19.250> recently<00:01:19.549> bleached

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
bleached it and I did recently bleached

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.639 
bleached it and I did recently bleached
my<00:01:20.479> ends<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.580> still<00:01:23.179> and<00:01:23.690> i<00:01:23.899> also<00:01:24.110> got<00:01:24.470> it

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
my ends so it's still and i also got it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.520 
my ends so it's still and i also got it
back<00:01:24.799> black<00:01:25.250> from<00:01:25.789> when<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.149> was<00:01:26.179> blue<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:26.959> it

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
back black from when it was blue so it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.949 
back black from when it was blue so it
actually<00:01:28.190> has<00:01:28.610> been<00:01:28.819> holding<00:01:29.330> up<00:01:29.450> really<00:01:29.659> good

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
actually has been holding up really good

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.870 
actually has been holding up really good
and<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.319> had<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.740> for<00:01:30.950> about<00:01:31.069> a<00:01:31.190> month<00:01:31.549> now<00:01:31.729> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.429 
and I had it for about a month now and
it's<00:01:32.330> like<00:01:32.420> really<00:01:32.840> good<00:01:33.170> um<00:01:34.209> when<00:01:35.209> I<00:01:35.240> went<00:01:36.200> it

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
it's like really good um when I went it

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.460 
it's like really good um when I went it
again<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.429> just<00:01:37.789> condition<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:39.200> goes

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
again and just condition it it goes

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.680 
again and just condition it it goes
straight<00:01:40.009> back<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.670> curly<00:01:41.239> way<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.479> was

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
straight back to the curly way it was

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.619 
straight back to the curly way it was
before<00:01:41.929> which<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.099> really<00:01:43.489> like<00:01:43.789> that<00:01:44.149> that<00:01:44.360> may

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:44.629 
before which I really like that that may

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:47.499 
before which I really like that that may
be<00:01:44.690> doing<00:01:45.319> all<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.590> bleaching<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.239> the<00:01:47.239> dying

be doing all the bleaching and the dying

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.259 
be doing all the bleaching and the dying
which<00:01:47.899> aims<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.379> curl<00:01:48.800> pattern<00:01:49.160> which<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:50.060> has

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:50.269 
which aims to curl pattern which it has

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:53.410 
which aims to curl pattern which it has
it<00:01:50.509> which<00:01:50.720> is<00:01:50.899> really<00:01:51.170> good<00:01:51.379> um<00:01:52.000> which<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.149> was

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
it which is really good um which I was

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.109

expecting front lace actually and I

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.790 
expecting front lace actually and I
wanted<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.300> get<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.660> whole<00:02:00.110> lights<00:02:00.349> but<00:02:00.590> that

wanted to get a whole lights but that

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.699 
wanted to get a whole lights but that
was<00:02:00.979> just<00:02:01.009> like<00:02:01.459> us<00:02:01.759> too<00:02:02.239> much<00:02:02.390> money<00:02:02.629> so<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.560> was

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
was just like us too much money so I was

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.440 
was just like us too much money so I was
kinda<00:02:03.979> nervous<00:02:04.129> about<00:02:04.429> having<00:02:04.729> this<00:02:05.030> leg<00:02:05.300> as

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
kinda nervous about having this leg as

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.190 
kinda nervous about having this leg as
front<00:02:05.840> lace<00:02:06.019> because<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:07.369> didn't<00:02:08.209> know<00:02:08.509> how

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
front lace because I didn't know how

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.229 
front lace because I didn't know how
good<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.560> would<00:02:09.830> be<00:02:10.099> like<00:02:10.369> how<00:02:10.610> much<00:02:10.759> less<00:02:11.030> will

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
good it would be like how much less will

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.390 
good it would be like how much less will
be<00:02:11.360> up<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.780> farm<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.650> if<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.190> actually

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
be up to the farm but if you actually

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.190 
be up to the farm but if you actually
look<00:02:13.819> there<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:16.400> maybe<00:02:16.790> two<00:02:17.239> inches<00:02:17.540> of

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
look there is about maybe two inches of

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.500 
look there is about maybe two inches of
lace<00:02:18.440> which<00:02:19.099> is<00:02:19.370> pretty<00:02:19.670> enough<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.330> that's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
lace which is pretty enough and that's

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.050 
lace which is pretty enough and that's
good<00:02:20.750> enough<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:21.050> me<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.739> it's<00:02:22.580> actually

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
good enough for me and it's actually

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.949 
good enough for me and it's actually
really<00:02:23.739> really<00:02:24.739> good<00:02:24.920> um<00:02:25.489> but<00:02:26.330> four<00:02:26.840> different

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.309 
really really good um but four different
laces<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:28.090> last<00:02:29.090> aren't<00:02:29.450> bleach<00:02:29.659> I<00:02:29.930> bleach<00:02:30.290> my

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
laces the last aren't bleach I bleach my

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.610 
laces the last aren't bleach I bleach my
own<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:31.180> which<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.209> really<00:02:32.569> easy<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:33.049> do<00:02:33.230> but

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
own that which is really easy to do but

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.339 
own that which is really easy to do but
yeah<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.670> this<00:02:35.150> plague<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.420> actually<00:02:35.959> really

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
yeah so this plague is actually really

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.830 
yeah so this plague is actually really
good<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.430> like<00:02:37.640> what<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> bunch<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.450> reviews

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
good and I like what a bunch of reviews

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.770 
good and I like what a bunch of reviews
on<00:02:39.110> while<00:02:39.470> African<00:02:39.980> saying<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.519> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
on while African saying that the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.470 
on while African saying that the
was<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.140> really<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.380> good<00:02:41.740> or<00:02:42.270> stuff<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:43.450> I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
was it really that good or stuff so I

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480 
was it really that good or stuff so I
was<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:44.110> nervous<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.709> buying<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.250> way

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
was really nervous on buying this way

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.920 
was really nervous on buying this way
but<00:02:46.270> actually<00:02:46.990> it's<00:02:47.319> pretty<00:02:48.250> good<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:48.930> so

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
but actually it's pretty good it was so

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.800 
but actually it's pretty good it was so
far<00:02:50.230> after<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.370> diamond<00:02:51.940> five<00:02:52.240> or<00:02:52.540> six<00:02:52.720> times

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
far after like diamond five or six times

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.490 
far after like diamond five or six times
is<00:02:53.610> actually<00:02:54.610> lasted<00:02:55.290> longer<00:02:56.290> than<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.470> thought

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
is actually lasted longer than I thought

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.309 
is actually lasted longer than I thought
it<00:02:56.800> would<00:02:56.980> be<00:02:57.280> because<00:02:58.000> usually<00:02:58.540> when<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.020> buy

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
it would be because usually when I buy

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.860 
it would be because usually when I buy
wigs<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.130> dyed<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.819> hair<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.390> many<00:03:01.630> times

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
wigs and I dyed the hair so many times

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.559 
wigs and I dyed the hair so many times
it<00:03:02.140> just<00:03:02.310> gets<00:03:03.310> um<00:03:04.620> ratty<00:03:05.620> which<00:03:06.550> this<00:03:06.910> has<00:03:07.330> not

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
it just gets um ratty which this has not

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.979 
it just gets um ratty which this has not
the<00:03:07.600> hair<00:03:08.050> still<00:03:08.319> saw<00:03:08.680> i<00:03:09.130> can<00:03:09.880> put<00:03:10.209> conditioner
