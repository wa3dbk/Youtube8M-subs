00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
flight review video of my spin training

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.650 
flight review video of my spin training
lesson<00:00:05.130> which<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.400> did<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.609> earlier<00:00:05.670> today<00:00:05.970> now

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660

lesson which I did it earlier today now
to<00:00:06.720> do<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.080> spin<00:00:07.290> training<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.740> couldn't

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
to do the spin training I couldn't

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.070 
to do the spin training I couldn't
actually<00:00:08.160> do<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.639> my<00:00:08.760> beloved<00:00:09.150> Cessna<00:00:09.510> 172

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
actually do it in my beloved Cessna 172

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.049 
actually do it in my beloved Cessna 172
so<00:00:10.559> instead<00:00:11.010> I'm<00:00:11.460> asked<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> go<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.940> these

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
so instead I'm asked to go in these

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.839 
so instead I'm asked to go in these
slightly<00:00:12.330> older<00:00:12.719> cessna152<00:00:13.559> now<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.429> liken<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
slightly older cessna152 now I liken the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.430 
slightly older cessna152 now I liken the
1<00:00:14.969> v<00:00:15.210> 2<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.540> an<00:00:15.660> old<00:00:15.780> letter

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
every time I slip into her I feel very

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.150 
every time I slip into her I feel very
much<00:00:18.539> at<00:00:18.750> home<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.199> I've<00:00:19.560> quite<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> few<00:00:20.039> hours

on 1 v 2 from a couple of years ago that
said<00:00:22.769> compared<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> 172<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.840> got<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
slightly higher nose attitude which

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.099 
slightly higher nose attitude which
meant<00:00:26.849> today<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.570> flying<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
meant today I was flying it with a

meant today I was flying it with a
slightly<00:00:28.320> lower<00:00:28.560> knows<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.949> she's<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
slightly lower knows that she's and I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
slightly lower knows that she's and I
should<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.640> been<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.570> kept<00:00:30.750> descending

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
should have been and I kept descending

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.440 
should have been and I kept descending
before<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> flight<00:00:32.160> -<00:00:32.399> dr.<00:00:32.730> Johnson<00:00:33.149> gave<00:00:33.329> me

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
before the flight - dr. Johnson gave me

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.970 
before the flight - dr. Johnson gave me
a<00:00:33.480> ground<00:00:33.719> briefing<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.320> taught<00:00:34.500> me<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> very

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a ground briefing and taught me a very

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.900 
a ground briefing and taught me a very
clever<00:00:35.250> mnemonic<00:00:36.030> which<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.510> par<00:00:37.079> or<00:00:37.500> pair<00:00:38.160> but

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
clever mnemonic which is par or pair but

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.369 
clever mnemonic which is par or pair but
we<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.180> say<00:00:39.329> pair<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.110> not

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
we don't say pair because it's not

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.160 
we don't say pair because it's not

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.350 
some points at about Johnson
demonstrated<00:01:38.550> a<00:01:38.610> spinning<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.030> me<00:01:39.120> and<00:01:39.300> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
demonstrated a spinning to me and it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.150 
demonstrated a spinning to me and it
isn't<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> I've<00:01:39.720> never<00:01:39.990> ever<00:01:40.170> done<00:01:40.380> before<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
isn't a I've never ever done before so I

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.620 
isn't a I've never ever done before so I
was<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.430> bit<00:01:41.520> worried<00:01:41.820> at<00:01:41.940> first<00:01:41.970> facet

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
was a little bit worried at first facet

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.450 
was a little bit worried at first facet
Johnson<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.230> fantastic<00:01:43.740> demonstrating<00:01:44.310> how

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
Johnson was fantastic demonstrating how

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
Johnson was fantastic demonstrating how
the<00:01:44.520> spin<00:01:44.850> works<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.870> made<00:01:46.050> sure

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the spin works and really made sure

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.050 
the spin works and really made sure
before<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.740> did<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.010> spin<00:01:47.310> myself<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
before I did a spin myself that I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
before I did a spin myself that I
understood<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.050> look<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> how

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
understood what to look for and how

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.680 
understood what to look for and how
exactly<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.430> recover<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.940> aircraft<00:01:51.030> using

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
exactly to recover the aircraft using

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:05.969 
exactly to recover the aircraft using
the<00:01:51.780> power<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.380> pair<00:01:52.830> mnemonic

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.150 

so<00:02:06.579> here<00:02:06.729> goes<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.030> spin<00:02:07.500> first<00:02:08.500> there<00:02:09.069> are

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
so here goes the spin first there are

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.670 
so here goes the spin first there are
three<00:02:09.340> parts<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.819> spin<00:02:10.149> number<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
three parts to a spin number one the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.320 
three parts to a spin number one the
incipient<00:02:12.160> spin<00:02:12.550> this<00:02:12.879> is<00:02:13.030> where<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
incipient spin this is where the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.449 
incipient spin this is where the
aircraft<00:02:13.480> does<00:02:13.870> an<00:02:14.050> alter<00:02:14.319> rotation<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.040> then

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
aircraft does an alter rotation and then

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.190 
aircraft does an alter rotation and then
enters<00:02:15.940> into<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.300> fully<00:02:16.510> developed<00:02:16.599> spin

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
enters into the fully developed spin

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.440 
enters into the fully developed spin
which<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.590> number<00:02:17.739> two<00:02:18.040> part<00:02:18.910> three<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
which is number two part three of the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.270 
which is number two part three of the
spin<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> spin<00:02:20.170> recovery<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:21.040> that's<00:02:21.160> what

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
spin is a spin recovery and that's what

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.670 
spin is a spin recovery and that's what
we<00:02:21.340> use<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.610> part<00:02:21.940> or<00:02:22.180> pair<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.870> mnemonic<00:02:23.230> to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
we use the part or pair and mnemonic to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.740 
we use the part or pair and mnemonic to
make<00:02:23.830> sure<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.160> we<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.430> aircraft

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
make sure that we get the aircraft

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.850 
make sure that we get the aircraft
stabilized<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.019> we're<00:02:26.170> not<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.560> spin

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860

quickly<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.800> Johnson<00:02:30.250> demonstrated<00:02:30.910> his<00:02:31.060> it

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
quickly so Johnson demonstrated his it

thanks<00:03:21.970> Jonathan<00:03:22.480> that's<00:03:22.840> my<00:03:22.989> third<00:03:23.290> spin<00:03:23.680> we

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
thanks Jonathan that's my third spin we

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.680 
thanks Jonathan that's my third spin we
had<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.190> back<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.400> Blackpool<00:03:24.609> Airport<00:03:25.150> now<00:03:25.630> the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
had it back to Blackpool Airport now the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.240 
had it back to Blackpool Airport now the
women<00:03:25.870> was<00:03:26.049> pretty<00:03:26.200> much<00:03:26.350> chiefs<00:03:26.650> ounce<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.220> I

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
women was pretty much chiefs ounce and I

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.440 
women was pretty much chiefs ounce and I
think<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.489> was<00:03:27.579> putting<00:03:27.790> twenty<00:03:28.090> or<00:03:28.209> thirty

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
think it was putting twenty or thirty

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.879 
think it was putting twenty or thirty
knots<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:28.959> seemed<00:03:29.139> to<00:03:29.230> take<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:29.560> forever

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
knots so it seemed to take like forever

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.020 
knots so it seemed to take like forever
to<00:03:30.160> get<00:03:30.280> back<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.549> airfield

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
to get back to the airfield

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.120 
to get back to the airfield
I<00:03:31.090> joined<00:03:31.359> on<00:03:31.510> quite<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.750> wide<00:03:32.109> right<00:03:32.470> base<00:03:32.799> and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
I joined on quite a wide right base and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.490 
I joined on quite a wide right base and
then<00:03:33.609> also<00:03:34.000> quite<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.480> dodgy<00:03:34.900> final<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
then also quite a dodgy final the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.020 
then also quite a dodgy final the
headwind<00:03:35.859> felt<00:03:36.160> really<00:03:36.340> really<00:03:36.549> strong<00:03:36.819> it

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
headwind felt really really strong it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.309 
headwind felt really really strong it
this<00:03:37.120> must<00:03:37.359> have<00:03:37.480> been<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.600> strongest<00:03:38.049> cross

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
this must have been the strongest cross

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.030 
this must have been the strongest cross
when<00:03:38.500> they've<00:03:38.590> actually<00:03:38.620> ever<00:03:38.920> landed<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:41.040> I'm

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
when they've actually ever landed it I'm

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.199 
when they've actually ever landed it I'm
getting<00:03:42.459> down<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.700> about<00:03:42.790> four<00:03:43.060> or<00:03:43.180> three

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
getting down to about four or three

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.000 
getting down to about four or three
hundred<00:03:43.510> feet<00:03:43.930> thinking<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.650> my<00:03:44.709> head<00:03:44.739> -

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
hundred feet thinking in my head -

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.590 
hundred feet thinking in my head -
Jonathan<00:03:45.459> Jonathan<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.329> don't<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.569> a

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
little go at this my little cell sort of

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.580 
little go at this my little cell sort of
demonstrate<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.209> however<00:03:50.019> you<00:03:50.319> just<00:03:50.380> said

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590

no carry on

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.350 
no carry on
and<00:03:51.519> I'm<00:03:52.060> actually<00:03:52.180> get<00:03:52.480> us<00:03:52.569> down<00:03:52.750> no

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360

and I'm actually get us down no
at<00:03:53.510> all<00:03:53.660> really<00:03:54.350> felt<00:03:54.530> like<00:03:54.560> had<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.830> kick<00:03:55.010> a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
at all really felt like had to kick a

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.800 
at all really felt like had to kick a
lot<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.310> right<00:03:55.640> rudder<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.210> I<00:03:56.480> didn't<00:03:56.690> man

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
lot of right rudder and I didn't man

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.060 
lot of right rudder and I didn't man
should<00:03:56.960> drift<00:03:57.110> over<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.470> center<00:03:57.770> line<00:03:57.800> either

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
should drift over the center line either

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.700 
should drift over the center line either
which<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.640> was<00:03:59.150> quite<00:03:59.360> pleased<00:03:59.630> with<00:03:59.750> I<00:04:00.110> learnt

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
which I was quite pleased with I learnt

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.470 
which I was quite pleased with I learnt
an<00:04:00.830> awful<00:04:00.950> lot<00:04:01.370> from<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.610> flight<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.210> I<00:04:02.270> feel

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
an awful lot from this flight and I feel

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.150 
an awful lot from this flight and I feel
a<00:04:02.630> lot<00:04:02.780> more<00:04:02.810> confident<00:04:03.410> now<00:04:03.590> controlling<00:04:04.070> the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
a lot more confident now controlling the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.860 
a lot more confident now controlling the
aircraft<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.850> was<00:04:04.880> also<00:04:05.150> nice<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.570> find<00:04:05.780> the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
aircraft it was also nice to find the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.480 
aircraft it was also nice to find the
1/5<00:04:06.260> -<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:06.770> almost<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:07.040> bit<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.250> challenge

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
1/5 - it's almost a bit of a challenge

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.980 
1/5 - it's almost a bit of a challenge
really<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.210> know<00:04:08.360> trying<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.690> remember<00:04:08.810> the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
really you know trying to remember the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.060 
really you know trying to remember the
slight<00:04:09.230> differences

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
slight differences

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.470 
slight differences
little<00:04:10.340> things<00:04:10.490> like<00:04:10.520> seating<00:04:11.000> position<00:04:11.300> felt

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
little things like seating position felt

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.580 
little things like seating position felt
really<00:04:11.630> different<00:04:12.020> and<00:04:12.140> then<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.290> attitude

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
really different and then the attitude

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.230 
really different and then the attitude
as<00:04:12.920> well<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.310> had<00:04:13.460> done<00:04:13.880> that

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
as well so had done that

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.880 
as well so had done that
still<00:04:14.630> my<00:04:14.780> next<00:04:15.050> flight<00:04:15.140> is<00:04:15.350> my<00:04:15.470> qualifying
