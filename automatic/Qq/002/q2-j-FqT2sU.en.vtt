a<00:05:48.560> minor<00:05:49.510> which<00:05:50.510> is<00:05:50.690> a<00:05:50.720> really<00:05:51.200> nice<00:05:51.410> touch

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060

chords for a very very long time
and<00:06:38.750> it<00:06:39.500> wasn't<00:06:39.770> worth<00:06:40.010> it<00:06:40.190> so<00:06:40.669> you<00:06:40.729> just<00:06:40.880> get

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.370 
and it wasn't worth it so you just get
them<00:06:41.180> over<00:06:41.300> with<00:06:41.419> because<00:06:41.630> once<00:06:41.900> you<00:06:42.020> got<00:06:42.199> them
