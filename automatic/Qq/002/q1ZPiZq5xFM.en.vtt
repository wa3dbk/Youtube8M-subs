hey<00:00:05.790> guys<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.210> made<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.600> intern<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.050> welcome

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
hey guys I made the intern and welcome

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.990 
hey guys I made the intern and welcome
back<00:00:07.320> to<00:00:07.590> built<00:00:07.770> by<00:00:07.860> design<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:08.759> one<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:08.910> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
back to built by design so one of the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.910 
back to built by design so one of the
questions<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.480> get<00:00:09.599> all<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.050> time<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.320> how<00:00:10.740> do<00:00:10.800> i

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
questions I get all the time is how do i

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.820 
questions I get all the time is how do i
model<00:00:11.160> Shane<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.150> Inventor<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:13.230> chain<00:00:13.650> and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
model Shane in Inventor now chain and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.350 
model Shane in Inventor now chain and
sprocket<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.400> something<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.940> would

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
sprocket is something that you would

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.419 
sprocket is something that you would
always<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.019> have<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.619> your<00:00:16.650> model<00:00:17.070> but

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:17.429 
always like to have in your model but

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:18.769 
always like to have in your model but
it's<00:00:17.550> often<00:00:17.670> very<00:00:17.820> hard<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.600> want<00:00:18.750> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
it's often very hard because you want to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
it's often very hard because you want to
spend<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.080> time<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.380> model<00:00:19.860> each<00:00:20.039> individual

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
spend the time to model each individual

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.490 
spend the time to model each individual

model<00:00:25.260> chain<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:26.039> either<00:00:26.189> existing<00:00:26.880> or

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
model chain to either existing or

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.640 
model chain to either existing or
modeled<00:00:27.840> sprockets<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.859> let's<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.130> started

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
modeled sprockets so let's get started

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.819 
modeled sprockets so let's get started
alright<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.609> order<00:00:32.879> to<00:00:33.090> apply<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.960> chain

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
alright so in order to apply this chain

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.229 
alright so in order to apply this chain
I<00:00:34.859> need<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.639> I'm<00:00:35.699> gonna<00:00:35.819> open<00:00:35.999> up

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
I need to go in and I'm gonna open up

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.069 
I need to go in and I'm gonna open up
this<00:00:36.510> wheel<00:00:36.780> assembly<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:38.749> after<00:00:39.749> that<00:00:39.870> I'm

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
this wheel assembly and after that I'm

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.419 
this wheel assembly and after that I'm
gonna<00:00:40.139> open<00:00:40.409> up<00:00:40.499> this<00:00:40.679> sprocket

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
gonna open up this sprocket

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.209 
gonna open up this sprocket
now<00:00:41.639> chains<00:00:42.389> are<00:00:42.600> applied<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.199> a<00:00:43.319> plane<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.159> I'm

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
now chains are applied on a plane so I'm

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.709 
now chains are applied on a plane so I'm
going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.429> go<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.699> into<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> plane<00:00:45.359> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
going to go up and into the plane and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
going to go up and into the plane and
click<00:00:46.350> mid<00:00:46.589> plane<00:00:46.889> between<00:00:47.339> two<00:00:47.549> parallel

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
click mid plane between two parallel

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.289 
click mid plane between two parallel
planes<00:00:49.039> now<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.190> selecting<00:00:50.249> each<00:00:50.819> side<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.179> the

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
planes now by selecting each side of the

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.410 
planes now by selecting each side of the
sprocket<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.219> can<00:00:53.219> ensure<00:00:53.339> that<00:00:53.639> the<00:00:53.940> plane<00:00:54.209> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
sprocket I can ensure that the plane is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.109 
sprocket I can ensure that the plane is
inserted<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.829> exact<00:00:56.249> center<00:00:56.729> of<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:57.119 
inserted in the exact center of that

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.569 
inserted in the exact center of that
sprocket<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.589> I<00:00:58.619> have<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.010> plane<00:00:59.399> in

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
sprocket now that I have that plane in

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.889 
sprocket now that I have that plane in
place<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.179> can<00:01:01.019> save<00:01:01.319> and<00:01:02.279> I<00:01:02.999> can<00:01:03.269> go<00:01:03.449> back<00:01:03.479> out

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
place I can save and I can go back out

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.920 
place I can save and I can go back out
and<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.329> it's<00:01:06.600> there

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and you can see that it's all it's there

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.580 
and you can see that it's all it's there
and<00:01:07.170> now<00:01:07.710> I'll<00:01:07.950> return<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.810> frame<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.469> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and now I'll return to my frame now as I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.139 
and now I'll return to my frame now as I
can<00:01:10.649> see<00:01:10.770> those<00:01:11.009> planes<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
can see those planes all up to the

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.060 
can see those planes all up to the
design<00:01:12.570> tab<00:01:13.490> insert<00:01:14.490> roller<00:01:15.479> chain<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.229> then

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
design tab insert roller chain and then

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.649 
design tab insert roller chain and then
I<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.609> and<00:01:17.880> I'll<00:01:17.969> need<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> select<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
I will go and I'll need to select a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.179 
I will go and I'll need to select a
different<00:01:18.810> chain<00:01:19.289> type<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.770> I'm<00:01:19.859> going<00:01:20.039> to<00:01:20.100> go

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
different chain type so I'm going to go

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.599 
different chain type so I'm going to go
in<00:01:21.020> go<00:01:22.020> down<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.670> ISO<00:01:23.670> 10<00:01:24.450> 190<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.490> make<00:01:26.490> sure

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
in go down to ISO 10 190 and make sure

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.149 
in go down to ISO 10 190 and make sure
that<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:26.909> quarter<00:01:27.780> inch<00:01:27.960> chain<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.649> number

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that it's quarter inch chain or number

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.090 
that it's quarter inch chain or number
25<00:01:29.579> chain<00:01:29.969> this<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> pretty<00:01:30.929> close<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.499> what<00:01:32.070> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
25 chain this is pretty close to what we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.789 
25 chain this is pretty close to what we
use<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:33.179> do<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.409> modeling

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
use and will do for the modeling

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.459 
use and will do for the modeling
purposes<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.939> FRC<00:01:36.539> now<00:01:37.259> we'll

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
purposes that we have in FRC now we'll

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.160 
purposes that we have in FRC now we'll
go<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.679> select<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.159> plane<00:01:38.600> I'll<00:01:39.600> click<00:01:39.899> on<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
go and select a plane I'll click on that

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
go and select a plane I'll click on that
plane<00:01:40.499> and<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.950> inserts<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.909> whole<00:01:42.390> chain

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
plane and it inserts now the whole chain

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.060 
plane and it inserts now the whole chain
will<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.899> constrained<00:01:43.289> that<00:01:43.560> plane<00:01:43.829> I'll

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
will be constrained that plane I'll

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.819 
will be constrained that plane I'll
choose<00:01:44.369> an<00:01:44.490> existing<00:01:44.689> sprocket<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.869> my

now it'll still tell me that how big my

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.470 
now it'll still tell me that how big my
sprocket<00:01:59.800> is<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.640> wouldn't<00:02:01.030> can<00:02:01.180> then<00:02:01.330> go

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
sprocket is and I wouldn't can then go

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.330 
sprocket is and I wouldn't can then go
and<00:02:01.930> again<00:02:02.140> choose<00:02:02.530> existing<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.160> need

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
and again choose existing and now I need

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.130 
and again choose existing and now I need
to<00:02:06.400> go<00:02:06.580> find<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:06.970> sprocket<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.690> still<00:02:07.930> zoom

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
to go find that sprocket to still zoom

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.340 
to go find that sprocket to still zoom
out<00:02:09.390> orient<00:02:10.390> my<00:02:10.450> model<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> little<00:02:10.960> bit<00:02:11.080> and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
out orient my model a little bit and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.570 
out orient my model a little bit and
zoom<00:02:11.710> back<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.660> find<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.900> tooth<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:17.580> just

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
zoom back in find that tooth and just

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.090 
zoom back in find that tooth and just
find<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:19.840> need<00:02:19.959> from<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.290> top<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.650> tooth<00:02:20.800> click

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
find I need from the top of tooth click

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.400 
find I need from the top of tooth click
on<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.670> there<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:22.180> go<00:02:22.740> all<00:02:23.740> right<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:25.350> go<00:02:26.350> to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
on it and there we go all right so go to

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.160 
on it and there we go all right so go to
the<00:02:26.530> home<00:02:26.709> view<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.780> last<00:02:28.780> one<00:02:28.870> these<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.110> need

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
the home view and last one these I need

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.680 
the home view and last one these I need
a<00:02:29.290> close<00:02:29.620> adaptability<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.480> won't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
a close adaptability so it won't

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.080 
a close adaptability so it won't
calculate<00:02:32.110> any<00:02:32.709> further<00:02:33.070> once<00:02:33.640> I've<00:02:33.820> done<00:02:33.940> it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
calculate any further once I've done it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.630 
calculate any further once I've done it
once<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:35.590> will<00:02:35.770> just<00:02:36.040> help<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.400> from

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
once this will just help it from

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.910 
once this will just help it from
breaking<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.600> I'm<00:02:37.959> just<00:02:38.110> gonna<00:02:38.320> go<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.770> do

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
breaking and I'm just gonna go in and do

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.100 
breaking and I'm just gonna go in and do

be able to delineate them from the other
models<00:02:51.250> once<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.640> apply<00:02:52.030> all<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.630> chains<00:02:53.520> so

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
models once I apply all the chains so

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.250 
models once I apply all the chains so
once<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.760> just<00:02:54.940> sit<00:02:55.090> finish<00:02:55.390> copy<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.900> pasting

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
once I just sit finish copy and pasting

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.100 
once I just sit finish copy and pasting
this<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.560> here<00:02:57.720> I'm<00:02:58.720> gonna<00:02:58.930> hit<00:02:59.140> OK<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.900> just

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
this in here I'm gonna hit OK and I just

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.449 
this in here I'm gonna hit OK and I just
need<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.350> accept<00:03:02.739> these<00:03:02.980> calculations

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
need to accept these calculations

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.220 
need to accept these calculations
because<00:03:03.850> there<00:03:03.940> isn't<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.269> sliding<00:03:04.750> sprocket

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
because there isn't a sliding sprocket

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.479 
because there isn't a sliding sprocket
which<00:03:05.380> means<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.890> calculations

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
which means that the calculations

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.340 
which means that the calculations
working<00:03:06.880> perfect<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.540> just<00:03:07.810> need<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.170> say

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
working perfect I just need to say

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.130 
working perfect I just need to say
that's<00:03:08.560> ok<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.190> for<00:03:10.090> now<00:03:10.239> we're<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:10.780> not

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
that's ok and for now we're just not

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.250 
that's ok and for now we're just not
gonna<00:03:11.290> worry<00:03:11.560> about<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.769> if<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.400> was<00:03:12.580> a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
gonna worry about that if this was a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.750 
gonna worry about that if this was a
complete<00:03:14.260> FRC<00:03:14.769> robot<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.190> might<00:03:15.430> design<00:03:15.730> a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
complete FRC robot I might design a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.550 
complete FRC robot I might design a
chain<00:03:16.120> tensioner<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.989> have<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.350> use<00:03:17.530> a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
chain tensioner and you have to use a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.410 
chain tensioner and you have to use a
sliding<00:03:18.130> sprocket<00:03:20.489> all<00:03:21.489> right<00:03:21.700> now<00:03:22.269> that

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
sliding sprocket all right now that

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.800 
sliding sprocket all right now that
that's<00:03:22.570> done<00:03:22.750> I'm<00:03:23.290> going<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.799> go<00:03:23.890> in<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:25.630> can

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
that's done I'm going to go in and I can

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.479 
that's done I'm going to go in and I can
look<00:03:25.930> at<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:26.290> but<00:03:26.560> as<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.709> can<00:03:26.980> see<00:03:27.040> as<00:03:27.370> I

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
look at this but as you can see as I

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.520 
look at this but as you can see as I
orient<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:27.880> model<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.450> chain<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:29.019> perfect

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
orient this model the chain is perfect

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.020 
orient this model the chain is perfect
but<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.760> can<00:03:31.269> still<00:03:31.540> see<00:03:32.040> planes<00:03:33.040> on<00:03:33.549> these

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
but I can still see planes on these

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.020 
but I can still see planes on these
gears<00:03:34.480> right<00:03:34.690> here<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.739> that's<00:03:36.610> just<00:03:36.790> an

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
gears right here so that's just an

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.180 
gears right here so that's just an
unattractive<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.049> bad<00:03:38.260> modeling<00:03:38.709> practice

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
unattractive and bad modeling practice

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.170 
unattractive and bad modeling practice
so<00:03:39.430> I'm<00:03:39.519> gonna<00:03:39.640> go

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
so I'm gonna go

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.660 
so I'm gonna go
is<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.630> out<00:03:40.780> go<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.560> my<00:03:41.620> work<00:03:41.830> plane<00:03:42.130> turn<00:03:42.549> the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
is it out go to my work plane turn the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.740 
is it out go to my work plane turn the
visibility<00:03:42.970> off<00:03:43.510> over<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.989> work<00:03:44.110> plane<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:45.750> I

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
visibility off over the work plane and I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.759 
visibility off over the work plane and I
am<00:03:47.320> then<00:03:47.620> going<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:48.040> save<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.310> part<00:03:49.650> exit<00:03:50.650> out

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
am then going to save that part exit out

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.910 
am then going to save that part exit out
of<00:03:50.920> it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
of it

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.700 
of it
and<00:03:53.819> now<00:03:54.569> as<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.810> can<00:03:54.960> see<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> have<00:03:55.500> finished

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
and now as you can see I have finished

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.040 
and now as you can see I have finished
my<00:03:55.950> model<00:03:56.460> there's<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.209> chain<00:03:57.840> on<00:03:57.870> that

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
my model there's a chain on that

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.260 
my model there's a chain on that
sprocket<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:58.920> I'm<00:03:59.550> good<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.790> go

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
sprocket and I'm good to go

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.170 
sprocket and I'm good to go
all<00:04:01.170> right<00:04:01.319> so<00:04:01.830> now<00:04:01.920> we've<00:04:02.069> got<00:04:02.250> Shane<00:04:02.910> our

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
all right so now we've got Shane our

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.750 
all right so now we've got Shane our
sprockets<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.110> we're<00:04:04.590> ready<00:04:04.770> to<00:04:04.980> move<00:04:05.310> on<00:04:05.520> but

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
sprockets and we're ready to move on but

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.520 
sprockets and we're ready to move on but
what<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.569> want<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.840> think<00:04:07.020> about<00:04:07.080> is<00:04:07.380> that

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
what I want you to think about is that

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.560 
what I want you to think about is that
every<00:04:08.069> time<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.490> use<00:04:08.520> design<00:04:09.030> accelerator

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
every time we use design accelerator

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.949 
every time we use design accelerator
we're<00:04:09.780> saving<00:04:10.170> time<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.220> energy<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.690> more

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
we're saving time and energy so the more

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.440 
we're saving time and energy so the more
you<00:04:13.260> guys<00:04:13.380> can<00:04:13.620> use<00:04:13.830> pre<00:04:14.550> model<00:04:14.850> components

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
you guys can use pre model components

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.330 
you guys can use pre model components
and<00:04:15.630> things<00:04:16.230> that<00:04:16.380> are<00:04:16.560> gonna<00:04:16.650> speed<00:04:17.040> up<00:04:17.070> your

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
and things that are gonna speed up your

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.670 
and things that are gonna speed up your
workflow<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.180> faster<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.750> can<00:04:18.780> go<00:04:19.019> from<00:04:19.230> 3d

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
workflow the faster you can go from 3d

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.280 
workflow the faster you can go from 3d
model<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.459> final<00:04:20.850> product<00:04:21.269> until<00:04:21.840> next<00:04:21.989> time

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
model the final product until next time

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.840 
model the final product until next time
I<00:04:22.410> meant<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.830> intern<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.520> built<00:04:23.730> by

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
I meant the intern this is built by

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.080 
I meant the intern this is built by
design<00:04:24.180> good<00:04:24.750> luck<00:04:24.900> out<00:04:25.020> there
