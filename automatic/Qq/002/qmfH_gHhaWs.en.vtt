00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi on video I'm about to do today is 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.710
 a little different than all of them 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.189
 that you saw mine previously 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.320
 channel 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.150
 today we're going to talk about those who 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.910
 have been while favorite games 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.560
 during 2013 this is my dragon 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.560
 gold and I am frank 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 I waited a moment waiting for one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.140
 before starting even if the video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.160
 should be serious should be 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.050
 fun somehow decided to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.910
 do it my way not caring about all the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.560
 possible unimaginable comments 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 since it was still something to be 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.120
 serious I decided to wear a suit 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.340
 a little more elegant we do not draw our own 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.290
 video editing skills in front of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.670
 great jury that will be this event 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.309
 as surely the best does not have 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.989
 immediately discarded a priori but still 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.650
 let's try then maybe the dress does the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.200
 monaco no I finally have a dress 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.970
 much more elegant and much more I would say 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.070
 faith and therefore what is that game that you 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.559
 wins my third position in the three 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.330
 favorite games released in 2013 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.670
 already from the soundtrack you should understand 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.990
 which game I'm talking about released in 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.110
 November 2013 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.360
 in stores everywhere the legend of comes out 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 zelda a link between wars game that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.040
 I think it was perhaps one of the most 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.979
 beautiful released in 2016 released 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.020
 exclusively for 3ds even for two 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.240
 several been perhaps one of the most games 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.860
 nicer colorful ones that have come out 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.990
 during 2013 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.580
 a game that in my opinion exploits 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.459
 wisely all the features 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.530
 of the 3ds new dogs that show the 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.850
 true potential for 3ds is that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 they must be wisely defeated 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.880
 link returns more colorful more sympathetic 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.190
 and perhaps with a touch of innovation in the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.200
 3d certainly manages to indulge in 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.280
 more but also the passage to 2d is not 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.280
 was not bad at all 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.450
 then let's move on to the game that we are 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.370
 put in the second position of this 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.020
 ranking is a game that many of you 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.180
 they will know a game that they knew 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.050
 enthuse many gamers 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.970
 which created a really absurd hype 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.830
 since 2008 and since when the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.650
 first trailer in the youtube channel of the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.230
 rockstar games has created a hype 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.760
 absolute for this game and maybe it's one 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.700
 punk is well deserved 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.800
 I'm talking about grand theft auto 5 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.750
 last chapter of the rockstar saga 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.820
 games that has been a success 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.820
 incredible and from the first days 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.550
 earning millions of dollars 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.150
 are the billions but still did i 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.920
 money 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 one of the peculiarities that I think is 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.330
 was really the strong point of 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.510
 this game was the combination of 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.170
 not one, not two, but three protagonists 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.360
 main 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.220
 please frankie in the skinny are three 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.200
 characters that are characterized to 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 maximum during the story weaving of 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.430
 these three people inside 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.950
 a single great story makes it all 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.480
 rock is much more interesting 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.120
 will also this time managed to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.190
 hit the gamers well but now 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.750
 we move to the first position only 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.360
 from the soundtrack should 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.820
 recognize this title maybe it was 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.989
 the best title of 2013 not just for 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.370
 me but also for many others 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.739
 gamers 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.810
 I'm talking about the last advancing title 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.700
 released by the naughty dog that by now 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.310
 we know how to create masterpieces 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.950
 as an uncharted game he managed to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.220
 really passionate about the plot is 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.910
 really deep you get to levels 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.489
 cinematic and interesting how 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.850
 manages to create a video game 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.770
 emotions of watching a movie or reading 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.160
 being able to convey the emotions of 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.050
 joint that tries to approach to 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.120
 rally as if it were his second 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.400
 daughter is commendable 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.170
 everyone has spoken well and very few 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.820
 they dared to speak ill but what 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.890
 surely it is the strong point of 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.750
 the base star is the plot even more 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.670
 the characterization of the characters that 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.070
 finish in the first position of mine 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.530
 golden dragon what for me was the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.020
 best game of 2013 maybe because 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.720
 sooner or later all video games must 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.550
 being able to convey emotions and 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.950
 this is the demonstration that a game a 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.500
 sometimes he manages to go beyond the terms 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.930
 canons of the classic video game 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.460
 this was my golden dragon if the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.190
 video that liked let me a nice me 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.350
 like and support me by sharing the 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.660
 videos and commenting we meet again 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.590
 then to an upcoming video as always 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.590
 straight ahead
