00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.500
 speak up 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.360
 Now I will teach you cuts 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.360
 pack to impress your friends 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.020
 first cut with one hand 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.609
 You will hold the deck. 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:29.330
 in this position then divide half 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:35.070
 drop push pointer close 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.520
 once again divide pushes and closes with 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.520
 both hands 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.809
 Now I'm going to teach you two methods. 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.420
 to cut the cards without changing the order 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.440
 of the deck use then I do not play anymore 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.260
 of swords that the cut is so 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.050
 cut to the table this can do 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.070
 as many times as you want 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.320
 You have to always at the top to explain 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.280
 for you I will use a letter 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.770
 blue we took it using a load 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:20.430
 different split-hit another one 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.710
 The detail is the beating is essential. 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.860
 to make people believe that you 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.920
 changed the place heaps once more 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:35.009
 video beats the next cut method 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.030
 it's a little more confusing but that's helps 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.420
 because it will confuse the viewer 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.979
 They are also more or less so above 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.170
 will divide one two three times 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.590
 she always remains in the same place more 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.590
 once 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.330
 the closer to explain works well 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:06.350
 a different charge up held 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:08.930
 deck cut half low-turn by hand 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.140
 catch part of the top returns that part 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.270
 underneath that part above you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.460
 strip and put in the same place 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.040
 He took down take on rock top 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.830
 underneath back up and as soon as 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.520
 makes cuts in the deck to impress 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.520
 your friends
