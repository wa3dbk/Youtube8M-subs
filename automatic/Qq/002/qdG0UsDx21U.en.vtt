00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.069
 At night we returned to the second part of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.020
 our week 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.380
 I just put the onion in the freezer or 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.320
 let die a freezer and looks he's 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.580
 hot 180 degrees then look okay 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.440
 hot 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.320
 I'll put it here to keep it in front of 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.510
 People are going to make a nuisance cookie. 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.830
 too hot it will be enough this is the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 This is a real practice so we 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:38.460
 are forgetting within this the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.170
 mayonnaise 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.140
 then the ideal even to give that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.930
 wonderful taste in mayonnaise and the clasp 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.440
 good quality and will put 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.140
 depending on the quantity you like 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.710
 that it is more or less red not 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.449
 If you will touch your face, will you travel? 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.830
 if you what is so if you want more 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.680
 Of course these pure beauty. 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.650
 I like a little darker than 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.900
 that this was not a bit of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.360
 ketchup 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.070
 is always good and ideal because depending 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.410
 of the brand and I await 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.810
 so it will not end this 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:28.350
 legal consistency is that flavor that only 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.520
 When we have time we will use the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:38.790
 spicy paprika everyone who likes 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:43.979
 pepper is wonderful and regret 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:52.770
 fell a little bit it smells good 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:58.800
 strong is very tasty mixed with a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:04.070
 Gold was little a little just 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.300
 take a corzinha lightweight saborzinho 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.060
 I think they like 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.619
 this recipe also leads to strong root you 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.080
 find some markets that have 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.500
 oriental cuisine products 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.430
 Me and Bruno are not too much fans. 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.299
 strong 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.940
 so we will not use this 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:28.950
 recipe is ready 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.540
 the mill and despite not being so 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.329
 beautiful 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.110
 the proof also our onion subtracts 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.090
 Wonder if she got so tasty so 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.480
 Look at this, the idea is we've voted for new ones. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.480
