00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.390
 Hi there, Snack with you in this video. 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.430
 tell you about the raid which is called 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.289
 dragon soul 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.509
 Well, and the required level of equipment is 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.460
 365 Ie this is optimal and I 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.430
 still want to remind 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.320
 I play on the server of the Pandavas dot ru where 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.379
 80 work 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.570
 and maybe 90 percent of all 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.450
 instov who only have in the world 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.780
 warcraft and well let's go 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.140
 dragon soul created by the death dragon in 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.570
 the war of the ancients and afterwards 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.629
 destroyed possessed the power of all dragons 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.000
 fought and the remaining dragons set off 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.579
 time caves and saved this 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.670
 powerful artifact in a matter of 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.580
 seconds before its destruction and now they 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.460
 gathered in the temple of the dragon dormancy 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.090
 to realize a desperate plan 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.850
 use the dragon's soul against itself 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.700
 deathwing now i think is worth 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.420
 tell about the main and most powerful 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.360
 bosses that live in this inst 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.420
 and can pull your nerves and so the first 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.880
 of them this is the morpho strongest of 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.930
 remaining under the control of deathwing 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.299
 Markha's elementals were once the former 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.450
 silent quiet guard but not 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.130
 convinced that only the destruction of Azeroth 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.220
 gives him peace 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.979
 more hot trying to destroy the foundation 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.490
 the temple of the dragon dormancy of the latter 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:56.020
 bastion of azerot the next boss by 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.500
 order this is khagara the mistress of storms they 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.829
 don't really say anything but 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.329
 In short, Hagar is one of 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:08.530
 the first female students who renounced 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.160
 learning the secret magic 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.010
 but then comes the ridge of the death-worm 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.860
 when deathwing first took advantage 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.960
 the power of the dragon's soul in the battle against 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.230
 the rest 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.260
 dragons monster released them 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.110
 streams of energy nearly tore it apart 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.710
 in tatters however he is not willing to give up 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.790
 from his weapon ordered to weld to 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.520
 your scales adamantine plates that you 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.180
 thereby strengthen your body these 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.680
 the plates are later reinforced by the element 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.890
 became his only vulnerable spot 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.900
 then comes the boss called commander 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.770
 zones about thousands of years ago 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.620
 the commander he was 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.570
 his soldiers waged an endless war 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.160
 against tuna troops 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:09.150
 and from the past century and he still 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.810
 serves the mighty ancient god n 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.410
 dota 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.330
 now deathwing to the basis and his task 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.780
 this legendary commander crush 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.750
 defenders in the temple of the dragon dormancy and 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.050
 rsh not sleeping after the fall of the sun 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.760
 bastion ether sange 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.640
 sleepless in every way possible 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.450
 deathwing u releasing more and 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.570
 more faceless of their dungeon cameras 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.780
 no number of his troops and unimaginable him 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.140
 the power of air sange is counting on generous 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.960
 reward in exchange for his faithful service but 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.920
 now briefly about the last three 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.990
 finalists 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.360

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.620
 third place in our top 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.750
 he is the only twilight dragon 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.530
 lauded by death and his 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.740
 arrogance 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.480
 second only raging in his energy 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.430
 body ultra xeon dedicated to his gas 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.359
 vowed to destroy the temple of the dragon 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.320
 rest, the penultimate boss is the voivode 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.810
 the black horn of twilight dragons once 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.729
 only a few left 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.009
 dozen 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:31.380
 hardened in many battles they carry on 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.110
 their backs are the best of the best 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.110
 lifeguard dragonriders 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.100
 deathwing they obey the governor 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.280
