00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
swim and move on to the next point

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.680 
swim and move on to the next point
now<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> haven't<00:02:19.520> included<00:02:19.820> these<00:02:20.330> ship

segments the sailing segments because if

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.550 
segments the sailing segments because if
you<00:02:23.270> are<00:02:23.330> detected<00:02:23.750> during<00:02:23.930> those<00:02:24.050> segments

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
you are detected during those segments

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.199 
you are detected during those segments
you<00:02:24.740> automatically<00:02:25.220> fail<00:02:25.550> which<00:02:25.820> means<00:02:26.030> it

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
you automatically fail which means it

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.560 
you automatically fail which means it
