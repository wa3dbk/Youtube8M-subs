00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.860
 So much glamor is there in the statement 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.209
 For a long time hamburg did not consider it 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.130
 seen like last night 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.469
 Hollywood superstar Sylvester stallone 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.420
 came to the Hanseatic city around his 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.130
 Boxing of alter ego hockey on the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.410
 Musical stage in the ring rise 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.029
 see a longtime dream of 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.980
 stallone years ago 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.050
 his food on the new yorker 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.380
 Broadway wanted now it is the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.150
 become hamburger reeperbahn 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.379
 The world premiere takes place here the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.190
 shows how much the world 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.750
 has changed 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.309
 he was just arguing about everything 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.870
 broadway we are one now 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.879
 international community 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.260
 I'm so happy and it's great the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.510
 Klitschkos are here and we bring 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.220
 something new to the world together 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.580
 I'm so proud of you I'm proud of 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.580
 Hamburg 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.700
 as co-producers with the party 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.570
 the equally powerful ones 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.640
 enterprising boxing champion 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.690
 brothers klitschko the next colder and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.970
 every quantity pr 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.710
 also box coaching for rocky performers 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.710
 contributed damage 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.140
 rocchi does not have the water rocky 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.820
 shown and made me grow to chunks 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.610
 brought 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.930
 a human was fighting nuclear school to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.410
 rather fight for it takes place around fight 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.460
 So a 76 came out there I am 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.380
 just been born 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.600
 So we really want to have it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.790
 we very neatly a living legend 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.790
 and with living legendary music 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.780
 Of course, the musical stage is the right one 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.730
 Hook by call engraved rock that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.770
 musical is a lavishly staged 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.630
 Spectacular including one in the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.200
 stage room driving boxing ring for the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.200
 big showdown 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.799
 history gags almost everything 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.990
 gets straight from the movie to the stage 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.990
 this will work 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.670
 the musical actor you can salvage 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.800
 there already plays the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.720
 Of course, the boxer wrecked with the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.310
 approval from nesta stallone of it 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.350
 not to be taken with the selection 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.330
 to have a say in the performance of the actor 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.460
 who lives in vienna German americans 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.140
 savage was allowed after a long casting 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.980
 process finally in the boxing gloves 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:34.340
 hatch to fill it now applies 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.880
 was a personal concern of mine 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.360
 that I do not just imitate 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.100
 I also said that to the storm 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.650
 if I do that, then I offend 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.360
 us both and he was totally open and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:57.410
 says you have to find yourself then 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:59.150
 the cinema is and I try it 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.450
 to occupy as little as possible 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.570
 So there is a huge template and 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.470
 if you accept that and then 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.269
 Again, you can sleep at night 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.130
 it will be a good night's sleep for investors team 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.780
 not until the 15 million euro 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.620
 production costs for rock he 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.720
 are recorded 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.580
 nothing is left to chance 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.830
 risks are kept as low as possible 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.390
 an internationally known fabric of the 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.280
 from the first rain of the broadways 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.959
 is being edited and the marketing 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.910
 machine is running at full speed 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.440
 as did the movie so shall roque 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.440
 the musical conquer the world 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.690
 strive for a biggest decision 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.930
 I have 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.830
 food 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.490
 then I hear 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.490
 I say 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.150
 the FR 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.280
 for the creative duo steven slater and 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.290
 Linz is the broadway a winning road 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.400
 Tony Awards and Oscar nominations 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.600
 you have in your pocket 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.600
 hamburg was new territory 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:21.130
 I'm from New York coming out 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.130
 not a bad thing 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.000
 We have over this years small 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.500
 Scratcher called Broadway worked and 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.540
 At some point you start to think that 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.979
 the world on 9 x 10 roadblocks 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.870
 but it does not really do that 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.020
 as to hamburg thinks the reeperbahn 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.210
 harbor and musical so think the goal of 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.919
 Production company around the reputation as 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.350
 continue to cement the musical metropolis 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.240
 builds them up by 60 million euros 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.760
 fourth big house in the Hanseatic city 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.590
 directly opposite the scandalous 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.580
 financed by the public sector 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.580
 elbphilharmonie 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.169
 hockey does not win against the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.210
 but world champion has become dear 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.310
 his noble ones and the respect of one 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.590
 nation fights for the musical version 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.389
 Rocky does not turn into a horror show 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.680
 now depends on whether you are the audience 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.680
 indeed 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.720
 to 7 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.850
 si 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.590
 dream of me
