 if you accept gudiel 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:12.459
 more than a month 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.189
 murcia have contacted something macrismo their consultations 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.310
 It was not found 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.130
 meanwhile companion 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.689
 in this one in this fight 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.140
 in this claim because it is not a fight is a claim was the claim for something 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 that we needed and that we knew that the moon 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.400
 Thank you 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.830
 mainly 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.320
 now all what the Argentine federation of gay lesbian bisexuals and 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.870
 trans 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 organization 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.720
 federation 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.720
 who created this law that drove this law 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.110
 and by which carillo codes can we be married how are they going to 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.880
 to be 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.200
 hundreds and hundreds of couples across the country 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.440
 although perhaps very proud 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.190
 of having reached backwards to this achievement 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.450
 what 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020
 experts in that situation of abuse 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.460
 because we believe that from the sanction of the law of marriage 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.060
 egalitarian we believe that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.230
 percent 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.830
 there has been an e-book an evolution of an improvement in society 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.250
 society is a little better from the recognition of our rights 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.030
 this does not end here with the marriage we do not believe 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.119
 a false image has not ended is a very important achievement the cinema was 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.520
 talking to Maria 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.520
 also at political level 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.300
 d a jury but still a lot 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.799
 What I did was journalistic work 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.170
 it seemed good to me I do not believe in him as the ones of him that is objective journalism 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.390
 efe is something that does not exist 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.930
 When this debate started, I realized that there is a lot of information that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.440
 buy eta could give and what that information could be happier to 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.440
 many people and more than anything could bring us all to the truth the only thing 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.960
 what I did was II I always did this side to fulfill my function 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.480
 journalist appeared that will see what I knew I think they can 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.539
 share 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.839
 It's wonderful to know what's talked about that we could share code 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.839
 crystallize into something so wonderful 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:21.659
