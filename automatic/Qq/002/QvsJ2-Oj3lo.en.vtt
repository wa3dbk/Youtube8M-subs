tests<00:00:37.980> before<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.460> actually<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:39.000> testing<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
tests before you actually get testing to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.079 
tests before you actually get testing to
ensure<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.650> pen<00:00:40.860> tester<00:00:41.339> is<00:00:41.580> actually

callouses IPA application which we're

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.680 
callouses IPA application which we're
actually<00:01:28.290> going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.800> started<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.690> it's

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
actually going to get started and it's

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.450 
actually going to get started and it's
going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.930> automatically<00:01:31.440> connect<00:01:31.860> once<00:01:32.130> the

going to automatically connect once the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.720 
going to automatically connect once the
fifth<00:01:33.150> tester<00:01:33.510> gets<00:01:33.690> going<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:34.680> now<00:01:35.520> we're

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
fifth tester gets going and now we're

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.000 
fifth tester gets going and now we're
connected<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.330> you<00:01:36.510> can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.960> from<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.620> ipad

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
connected as you can see from the ipad

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.120 
connected as you can see from the ipad
software<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:40.320> first<00:01:40.560> test<00:01:40.830> that<00:01:40.980> we're

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
software and the first test that we're

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.280 
software and the first test that we're
actually<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.700> started<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.420> using<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.110> lo

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
actually can get started is using the lo

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.340 
actually can get started is using the lo
pin<00:01:43.620> load<00:01:43.920> verification<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.510> in<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.930> kit

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
pin load verification so in this kit

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.770 
pin load verification so in this kit
it's<00:01:46.650> going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.920> include<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> lo<00:01:48.150> pin<00:01:48.479> load

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's going to include the lo pin load

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.590 
it's going to include the lo pin load
and<00:01:49.140> also<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.190> torque<00:01:50.490> wrench<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.940> needed<00:01:51.420> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and also the torque wrench is needed to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.030 
and also the torque wrench is needed to
secure<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.729> interconnect<00:01:54.450> cable

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
secure that and the interconnect cable

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.170 
secure that and the interconnect cable
so<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> take<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.580> out<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
so I'm going to take this out of the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.480 
so I'm going to take this out of the
package<00:01:59.150> we're<00:02:00.150> going<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.390> get<00:02:00.479> started<00:02:00.780> by

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
package we're going to get started by

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.960 
package we're going to get started by
connecting<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.700> end<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.360> lo<00:02:03.570> pin<00:02:03.930> cable

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
connecting one end of the lo pin cable

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:19.390 
connecting one end of the lo pin cable
onto<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.150> RF<00:02:06.450> output<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> pimp<00:02:07.560> tester

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.580 

and<00:02:20.400> we're<00:02:21.060> actually<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.690> use<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and we're actually have to use the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.410 
and we're actually have to use the
torque<00:02:22.860> wrench<00:02:23.100> for<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.550> since<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.090> want<00:02:24.300> to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
torque wrench for this since you want to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.980 
torque wrench for this since you want to
make<00:02:25.260> sure<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.560> torqued<00:02:25.980> down<00:02:26.070> real<00:02:26.910> good

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.540 

torque<00:02:33.990> wrench<00:02:34.350> would<00:02:34.620> actually<00:02:35.040> click<00:02:35.370> as

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
torque wrench would actually click as

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.460 
torque wrench would actually click as
soon<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.090> has<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.420> right<00:02:36.660> torque<00:02:37.140> level

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
soon as it has the right torque level

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.680 
soon as it has the right torque level
that<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.740> guys<00:02:37.890> are<00:02:38.010> about<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.220> see<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:39.240> just

we're going to connect the loaf pan load

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.000 
we're going to connect the loaf pan load
onto<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.260> end<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.650> test<00:02:46.920> cable<00:02:49.010> now

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
onto the end of this test cable now

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.730 
onto the end of this test cable now
we're<00:02:50.220> all<00:02:50.340> set<00:02:50.580> up<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.960> can<00:02:52.140> hear<00:02:52.230> use<00:02:52.500> this

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
we're all set up so we can hear use this

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.570 
we're all set up so we can hear use this
iPad<00:02:53.340> Mini<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:55.010> we<00:02:56.010> could<00:02:56.160> go<00:02:56.280> through<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
iPad Mini or we could go through the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.480 
iPad Mini or we could go through the
actual<00:02:57.030> front<00:02:57.660> panel<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:59.190> we're<00:02:59.340> actually

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
actual front panel so we're actually

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.640 
actual front panel so we're actually
going<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> see<00:03:00.300> both<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.020> now<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:01.470> have

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
going to see both so now that we have

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.010 
going to see both so now that we have
the<00:03:01.830> lo<00:03:02.010> pin<00:03:02.340> load<00:03:02.670> connected<00:03:03.090> we're<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:03.960> to

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
the lo pin load connected we're going to

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.950 
the lo pin load connected we're going to
press<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.830> RF<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.310> button<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.880> now<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.390> plan

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
press the RF on button and now the plan

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.430 
press the RF on button and now the plan
is<00:03:06.990> we<00:03:07.410> should<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.830> reading<00:03:08.100> below<00:03:08.610> 100<00:03:09.240> 7<00:03:09.660> DB<00:03:10.050> M

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.520 

so<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.560> RF<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.480> pin<00:03:15.930> tester<00:03:16.410> is

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
so the RF is on and the pin tester is

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.150 
so the RF is on and the pin tester is
reading<00:03:16.860> yeah<00:03:17.700> definitely<00:03:18.180> below<00:03:18.420> 170<00:03:19.290> BM<00:03:19.590> so

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
reading yeah definitely below 170 BM so

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.190 
reading yeah definitely below 170 BM so
that<00:03:20.340> means<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.910> up<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.660> end<00:03:21.960> of<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
that means that up to this end of the

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.460 
that means that up to this end of the
cable<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.400> not<00:03:23.550> have<00:03:23.730> any<00:03:23.910> problems<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.440> now

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
cable we do not have any problems so now

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.740 
cable we do not have any problems so now
we're<00:03:25.770> going<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:25.950> turn<00:03:26.100> off<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.640> RF<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.300> we're

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
we're going to turn off the RF and we're

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.780 
we're going to turn off the RF and we're
going<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.960> move<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.110> doing<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:29.550> known

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
going to move to doing the the known

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.450 
going to move to doing the the known
pimp<00:03:30.180> source<00:03:30.540> test<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.920> we're<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.220> take

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
pimp source test so we're going to take

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:53.000 
pimp source test so we're going to take
off<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.900> test<00:03:34.170> bar<00:03:34.410> cable<00:03:34.740> for<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.100> test

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.809 

let's<00:03:54.010> grab<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.719> source<00:03:55.859> now<00:03:56.859> this<00:03:57.159> source

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
let's grab this source now this source

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.720 
let's grab this source now this source
should<00:03:58.239> be<00:03:58.299> reading<00:03:59.019> at<00:03:59.939> minus<00:04:00.939> 80<00:04:01.890> DBM<00:04:02.890> plus

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
should be reading at minus 80 DBM plus

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.979 
should be reading at minus 80 DBM plus
or<00:04:03.909> minus<00:04:04.239> five<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:06.459> we<00:04:06.549> get<00:04:06.730> nice<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.060> snug<00:04:07.750> on

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
or minus five so we get nice and snug on

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.530 
or minus five so we get nice and snug on
here

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
here

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.819 
here
then<00:04:10.540> use<00:04:10.840> our<00:04:11.079> hand

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
then use our hand

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:44.650 
then use our hand
torque<00:04:12.069> wrench<00:04:16.739> make<00:04:17.739> sure<00:04:17.979> it<00:04:18.130> clicks

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:54.080 

all<00:04:45.660> right<00:04:46.940> on<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.450> iPad<00:04:48.930> Mini<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:53.090> we're

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
all right on to the iPad Mini and we're

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:01.010 
all right on to the iPad Mini and we're
going<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.330> turn<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.810> are<00:04:54.960> on<00:04:55.260> back<00:04:55.920> on<00:04:59.300> as<00:05:00.300> you

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
going to turn the are on back on as you

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.530 
going to turn the are on back on as you
can<00:05:01.170> see<00:05:01.380> here<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.950> pimp<00:05:02.700> tester<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.210> raining

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
can see here the pimp tester is raining

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.300 
can see here the pimp tester is raining
-<00:05:03.750> 80<00:05:04.290> DBM

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
- 80 DBM

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.550 
- 80 DBM
so<00:05:05.550> that's<00:05:05.730> within<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.330> minus<00:05:06.750> 80<00:05:07.020> plus<00:05:07.380> or

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
so that's within the minus 80 plus or

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.980 
so that's within the minus 80 plus or
minus<00:05:07.860> five<00:05:08.070> media<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:09.240> we<00:05:09.360> know<00:05:09.510> it's<00:05:09.660> reading

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
minus five media so we know it's reading

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.230 
minus five media so we know it's reading
it<00:05:10.110> incorrectly<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.160> we're<00:05:11.850> going<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.030> turn

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
it incorrectly so we're going to turn

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.790 
it incorrectly so we're going to turn
our<00:05:12.770> off<00:05:13.770> now<00:05:14.510> so<00:05:15.510> now<00:05:15.690> we<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:16.050> an<00:05:16.320> actual

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
our off now so now we have an actual

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.280 
our off now so now we have an actual
setup<00:05:17.160> for<00:05:17.460> an<00:05:17.550> actual<00:05:17.850> pen<00:05:18.030> test<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:19.020> over

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
setup for an actual pen test so over

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.070 
setup for an actual pen test so over
here<00:05:19.500> we<00:05:19.650> have<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.890> damaged<00:05:20.670> load<00:05:21.540> which<00:05:22.050> is

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
here we have a damaged load which is

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.250 
here we have a damaged load which is
going<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:22.530> simulate<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:23.430> tower<00:05:23.910> source<00:05:24.330> with

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
going to simulate a tower source with

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.890 
going to simulate a tower source with
high<00:05:25.500> pin<00:05:25.920> values<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:26.910> all<00:05:27.090> we<00:05:27.240> have<00:05:27.360> to<00:05:27.510> do<00:05:27.690> is

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
high pin values so all we have to do is

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:36.760 
high pin values so all we have to do is
press<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.770> RF<00:05:29.010> on<00:05:29.220> button<00:05:29.610> on<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:30.690> pin<00:05:30.900> tester

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.470 

so<00:05:37.770> we're<00:05:37.890> going<00:05:37.980> to<00:05:38.070> turn<00:05:38.250> on<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.910> RF<00:05:39.450> power

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
so we're going to turn on the RF power

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:47.540 
so we're going to turn on the RF power
using<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.200> iPad<00:05:40.590> Mini<00:05:44.480> and<00:05:45.950> as<00:05:46.950> you<00:05:47.130> can<00:05:47.280> see

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
using the iPad Mini and as you can see

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.910 
using the iPad Mini and as you can see
that<00:05:47.850> it's<00:05:48.150> reading<00:05:48.540> so<00:05:48.840> much<00:05:49.020> pin<00:05:49.380> that's<00:05:49.650> off

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
that it's reading so much pin that's off

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.400 
that it's reading so much pin that's off
this<00:05:50.220> chart<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.880> if<00:05:51.330> you<00:05:51.480> go<00:05:51.690> down<00:05:51.720> here<00:05:52.260> you

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
this chart and if you go down here you

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.550 
this chart and if you go down here you
can<00:05:52.740> actually<00:05:52.920> see<00:05:53.160> using<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.240> timer's<00:05:54.750> pin

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
can actually see using the timer's pin

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.750 
can actually see using the timer's pin
feature<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:57.060> this<00:05:57.540> load<00:05:58.050> is<00:05:58.380> a<00:05:58.410> way<00:05:59.400> beyond

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
feature that this load is a way beyond

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.970 
feature that this load is a way beyond
the<00:05:59.910> specifications<00:06:00.810> of<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:01.020> normal<00:06:01.380> pin<00:06:01.650> test

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
the specifications of a normal pin test

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.390 
the specifications of a normal pin test
and<00:06:02.820> now<00:06:03.720> we<00:06:03.780> we<00:06:04.410> know<00:06:04.530> that's<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.980> high<00:06:05.130> pin

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
and now we we know that's a high pin

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:13.510 
and now we we know that's a high pin
source

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
