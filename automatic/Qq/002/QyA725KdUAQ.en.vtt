at vendors as well on the auction house

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.410 
at vendors as well on the auction house
they<00:02:26.280> tend<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.550> be<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.910> bit<00:02:27.150> pricey

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
they tend to be a little bit pricey

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.640 
they tend to be a little bit pricey
because<00:02:27.750> they're<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.380> hard<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
because they're really not that hard to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.350 
because they're really not that hard to
come<00:02:28.890> by<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.100> it's<00:02:29.580> not<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:29.940> they're<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> hot

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
come by and it's not like they're a hot

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.870 
come by and it's not like they're a hot
commodity<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.860> sometimes<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.370> do<00:02:32.520> need<00:02:32.670> them

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
commodity but sometimes you do need them

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.220 
commodity but sometimes you do need them
and<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.180> certainly<00:02:33.480> worth<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.050> investment

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and it's certainly worth the investment

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.660 
and it's certainly worth the investment
so<00:02:34.910> go<00:02:35.910> grab<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.180> bunch<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.510> MF<00:02:36.780> gear<00:02:37.400> loaded<00:02:38.400> up

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
as humanly possible that way when he

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.210 
as humanly possible that way when he
starts<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.930> run<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.260> just<00:02:58.440> makes<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.800> lot

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
starts to run it just makes it a lot

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.510

enough<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.000> point<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.020> head<00:03:04.380> back<00:03:04.700> and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
enough at this point so I head back and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.490 
enough at this point so I head back and
it's<00:03:06.450> time<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.630> take<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.080> treasure<00:03:07.290> goblin

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
it's time to take on the treasure goblin

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.880 
it's time to take on the treasure goblin
now<00:03:07.740> these<00:03:07.890> guys<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.310> tough<00:03:08.580> solo<00:03:09.090> and

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
now these guys can be tough solo and

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.810 
now these guys can be tough solo and
anytime<00:03:10.890> you're<00:03:11.160> doing<00:03:11.310> something<00:03:11.520> like<00:03:11.730> this

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
anytime you're doing something like this

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.610 
anytime you're doing something like this
I<00:03:12.060> know<00:03:12.120> I've<00:03:12.300> mentioned<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:13.020> my

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
I know I've mentioned this in my

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.650 
I know I've mentioned this in my
previous<00:03:13.920> videos<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:14.670> any<00:03:15.360> time<00:03:15.540> you're

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
previous videos but any time you're

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.880 
previous videos but any time you're
doing<00:03:15.840> something<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.320> it's<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.590> great

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
doing something like this it's a great

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.650 
doing something like this it's a great
idea<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.190> have<00:03:17.280> four<00:03:17.640> friends<00:03:18.090> doing<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.570> at

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
idea to have four friends doing it at

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.140 
idea to have four friends doing it at
the<00:03:18.750> same<00:03:18.959> time<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.040> increase<00:03:20.670> your

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the same time so you just increase your

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.729 
the same time so you just increase your
efficiency<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.810> increase<00:03:21.959> your<00:03:22.140> chances<00:03:22.620> to

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
efficiency and increase your chances to

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.550 
efficiency and increase your chances to
find<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.190> treasure<00:03:23.340> goblin<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.500> then<00:03:25.500> you

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
find the treasure goblin and then you

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.320 
find the treasure goblin and then you
