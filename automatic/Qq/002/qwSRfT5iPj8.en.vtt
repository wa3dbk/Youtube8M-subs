00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
in fact most recipes don't call for it I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.570 
in fact most recipes don't call for it I
just<00:03:54.690> like<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.320> way<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.500> tastes<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.040> added

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
just like the way it tastes so I added

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.699 
just like the way it tastes so I added
it<00:03:56.730> all<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.570> if<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.810> don't<00:03:57.990> have<00:03:58.170> all<00:03:58.470> red

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
it all so if you don't have all red

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.620 
it all so if you don't have all red
peppers<00:03:59.130> that's<00:03:59.310> okay<00:03:59.760> I've<00:03:59.970> done<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.390> once

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
peppers that's okay I've done this once

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.510 
peppers that's okay I've done this once
or<00:04:00.810> twice<00:04:00.840> throwing<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:01.860> an<00:04:01.950> orange<00:04:02.220> pepper

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
or twice throwing in an orange pepper

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.360 
or twice throwing in an orange pepper
and<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:03.000> works<00:04:03.270> out<00:04:03.540> fine<00:04:03.900> too<00:04:04.320> if<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:05.130> don't

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
and that works out fine too if you don't

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.830 
and that works out fine too if you don't
have<00:04:05.550> apple<00:04:05.910> cider<00:04:06.030> vinegar<00:04:06.240> you<00:04:06.750> can

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
substitute regular vinegar and if you

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.120
