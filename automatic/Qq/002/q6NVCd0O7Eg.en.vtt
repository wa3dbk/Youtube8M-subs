00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.999 

in<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:02.399> tutorial<00:00:02.810> we<00:00:03.810> will<00:00:03.840> create<00:00:04.230> only<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
in this tutorial we will create only the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.340 
in this tutorial we will create only the
solid<00:00:05.430> model<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.180> machine<00:00:06.509> part<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.020> you

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
solid model of the machine part that you

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.400 
solid model of the machine part that you
are<00:00:07.500> now<00:00:07.620> looking<00:00:08.010> at<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:09.000> course<00:00:09.660> there<00:00:10.230> are

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
are now looking at of course there are

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.160 
are now looking at of course there are
many<00:00:10.440> ways<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.830> draw<00:00:11.340> anything<00:00:11.910> but<00:00:12.780> what<00:00:12.990> you

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
many ways to draw anything but what you

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.099 
many ways to draw anything but what you
will<00:00:13.320> see<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.219> my<00:00:14.610> way<00:00:14.820> based<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.780> 20

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
will see here is my way based on 20

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.890 
will see here is my way based on 20
years<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.560> design<00:00:17.160> experience

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.529 

here<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.500> completed<00:00:23.010> project<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:24.180> 2d

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
here is the completed project the 2d

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.929 
here is the completed project the 2d
drawing<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.380> solid<00:00:25.740> model<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.340> shown<00:00:26.670> in

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
drawing and the solid model are shown in

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.409 
drawing and the solid model are shown in
paper<00:00:27.180> space<00:00:27.410> using<00:00:28.410> two<00:00:28.950> viewpoints<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
paper space using two viewpoints the

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.390 
paper space using two viewpoints the
first<00:00:30.689> thing<00:00:30.930> to<00:00:31.110> do<00:00:31.259> is<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> erase<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
first thing to do is to erase the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.780 
first thing to do is to erase the
viewport<00:00:32.820> containing<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> solid<00:00:34.290> model<00:00:34.790> it

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
viewport containing the solid model it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.210 
viewport containing the solid model it
will<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.239> recreated<00:00:36.720> later<00:00:37.379> on

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.580 

since<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.489> solid<00:00:41.880> model<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.870> created<00:00:43.410> in

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
since the solid model will be created in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.610 
since the solid model will be created in
model<00:00:43.980> space<00:00:44.010> I'll<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.329> click<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.260> model

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
model space I'll now click the model

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.509 
model space I'll now click the model
space<00:00:46.950> button

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.819 

notice<00:00:50.519> that<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.879> 2d<00:00:51.390> drawing<00:00:51.719> still<00:00:52.199> exists

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
notice that the 2d drawing still exists

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459 
notice that the 2d drawing still exists
in<00:00:53.010> model<00:00:53.489> space<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> split<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> screen

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in model space that I split the screen

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.520 
in model space that I split the screen
into<00:00:56.010> two<00:00:56.219> vertical<00:00:56.969> viewpoints<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.350> new

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
into two vertical viewpoints the new

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
into two vertical viewpoints the new
drawing<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.159> solid<00:00:59.610> model<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.300> be

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
drawing of the solid model will be

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.139 
drawing of the solid model will be
created<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> blank<00:01:01.890> screen<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.969> right

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.899 
created on the blank screen on the right
i<00:01:06.080> created<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.560> two<00:01:07.770> vertical<00:01:08.340> viewports

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
i created the two vertical viewports

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
i created the two vertical viewports
leaving<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.509> 2d<00:01:09.869> drawing<00:01:10.259> intact<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
leaving the 2d drawing intact on the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.020 
leaving the 2d drawing intact on the
left<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.570> used<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> reference<00:01:13.430> now<00:01:14.430> let's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
left to be used as a reference now let's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.289 
left to be used as a reference now let's
proceed<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.600> make<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.960> solid<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.970> first

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
proceed to make the solid the first

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.840 
proceed to make the solid the first
thing<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.110> move<00:01:19.530> into<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.070> Southeast

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
thing to do is move into a Southeast

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.719 
thing to do is move into a Southeast
isometric<00:01:21.720> view<00:01:21.929> and<00:01:22.140> start<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.979> Box<00:01:23.220> command

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
isometric view and start the Box command

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.219 
isometric view and start the Box command
using<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.690> 3d<00:01:25.170> wireframe<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.429> length<00:01:26.729> will<00:01:27.000> be

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
using a 3d wireframe the length will be

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:35.590 
using a 3d wireframe the length will be
6.80<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:29.250> width<00:01:29.840> 3.75<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.710> height<00:01:32.240> 2.83

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.810 

we<00:01:36.600> want<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:37.109> remove<00:01:37.439> material<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:38.159> inside

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
we want to remove material from inside

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.510 
we want to remove material from inside
the<00:01:39.030> box<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.899> it<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.229> desirable<00:01:40.859> to<00:01:41.130> use

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the box and so it is desirable to use

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.849 
the box and so it is desirable to use
the<00:01:41.850> shell<00:01:42.119> command<00:01:42.689> therefore<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> will

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
the shell command therefore I will

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.740 
the shell command therefore I will
switch<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.179> top<00:01:45.479> view<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.350> box<00:01:47.689> now<00:01:48.689> we

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
switch to the top view of the box now we

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.510 
switch to the top view of the box now we
click<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.409> shell<00:01:49.679> button<00:01:50.100> which<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.340> located

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
click the shell button which is located

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
click the shell button which is located
on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> solid<00:01:51.869> editing<00:01:52.350> toolbar<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:53.069> select

the<00:01:53.729> box<00:01:55.280> however<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.850> not<00:01:57.090> hit<00:01:57.390> enter

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the box however we do not hit enter

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.380 
the box however we do not hit enter
because<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.770> are<00:01:58.920> now<00:01:59.130> asked<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.789> we<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.209> to

by<00:02:34.500> using<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:35.189> constrained<00:02:35.760> orbit<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
by using the constrained orbit on the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.839 
by using the constrained orbit on the
view<00:02:36.900> toolbar<00:02:37.409> we<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.799> see<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> object

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
view toolbar we can see that the object

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.410 
view toolbar we can see that the object
is<00:02:39.060> empty<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.659> has<00:02:40.170> no<00:02:40.439> typeface<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:42.239> we

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
is empty and has no typeface and if we

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.020 
is empty and has no typeface and if we
add<00:02:42.599> shading<00:02:43.019> we<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.950> see<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.459> work<00:02:44.790> we

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
add shading we can see that the work we

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.399 
add shading we can see that the work we
have<00:02:45.060> done<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.659> correct<00:02:48.079> everything<00:02:49.079> seems

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
have done is correct everything seems

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.129 
have done is correct everything seems
okay<00:02:49.889> so<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.459> go<00:02:50.639> back<00:02:50.670> into<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.420> wireframe

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
okay so we go back into the wireframe

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.180 
okay so we go back into the wireframe
mode

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.660 

now<00:03:04.420> we<00:03:04.480> will<00:03:04.900> draw<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.350> horizontal<00:03:05.590> line<00:03:06.160> from

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
now we will draw a horizontal line from

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.900 
now we will draw a horizontal line from
the<00:03:06.819> lower<00:03:07.030> left<00:03:07.330> corner<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.080> right

extending beyond the box and we will

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.870 
extending beyond the box and we will
offset<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.110> line<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:14.800> drawn<00:03:15.160> upward<00:03:15.730> a

at<00:03:20.209> this<00:03:20.569> time<00:03:20.900> we<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.290> also<00:03:21.709> erase<00:03:22.400> all

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
at this time we can also erase all

at this time we can also erase all
unnecessary<00:03:23.420> lines

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.470 

the<00:03:27.240> next<00:03:27.630> step<00:03:27.840> will<00:03:28.110> be<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.880> extrude<00:03:29.880> the

we<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.300> subtract<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.170> whole<00:03:37.440> from<00:03:38.100> the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
we have to subtract this whole from the

we have to subtract this whole from the
box

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.600 

now<00:03:46.390> we<00:03:46.450> want<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.110> create<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.830> rectangular

hole in the bottom of the box to
accomplish<00:03:51.640> this<00:03:51.880> we<00:03:52.210> will<00:03:52.360> first<00:03:52.630> draw<00:03:53.380> a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
accomplish this we will first draw a

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.550 
accomplish this we will first draw a
straight<00:03:53.860> line<00:03:53.890> on<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.970> top<00:03:55.270> from<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.170> upper

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
the box next to the box we will draw a

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.880 
the box next to the box we will draw a
rectangle<00:04:03.670> with<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.000> length<00:04:04.240> of<00:04:04.420> 4.30<00:04:05.320> and

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
the width of 1.25 and again draw a

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.680 
the width of 1.25 and again draw a
straight<00:04:09.250> line<00:04:09.280> from<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.180> upper<00:04:10.510> right

corner to the lower left corner

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.430 
corner to the lower left corner
now<00:04:14.580> we'll<00:04:14.879> move<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.269> new<00:04:15.450> rectangle<00:04:16.169> from

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
now we'll move the new rectangle from

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.620 
now we'll move the new rectangle from
its<00:04:16.680> midpoint<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.729> midpoint<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.359> the

diagonal line to the midpoint of the
diagonal<00:04:21.239> line<00:04:21.449> on<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.959> box

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
diagonal line on the box

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.580 
diagonal line on the box
and<00:04:24.080> also<00:04:25.220> erase<00:04:26.220> any<00:04:26.580> unnecessary<00:04:27.120> lines

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
and also erase any unnecessary lines

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.740 
and also erase any unnecessary lines
finally<00:04:30.590> we<00:04:31.040> want<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.460> extrude<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.120> rectangle

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
finally we want to extrude the rectangle

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.920 
finally we want to extrude the rectangle
a<00:04:32.870> distance<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.500> minus<00:04:34.130> 4<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:35.150> be<00:04:35.300> sure<00:04:35.540> that<00:04:35.570> it

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
a distance of minus 4 to be sure that it

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.439 
a distance of minus 4 to be sure that it
will<00:04:36.020> pass<00:04:36.320> through<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.860> bottom<00:04:37.220> surface<00:04:37.790> so

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
will pass through the bottom surface so

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.840 
will pass through the bottom surface so
that<00:04:38.479> when<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.229> is<00:04:39.410> subtracted<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.580> will

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
that when it is subtracted it will

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.210 
that when it is subtracted it will
create<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.419> rectangular<00:04:42.110> hole<00:04:42.320> on<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:43.040> bottom

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
create a rectangular hole on the bottom

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.710 
create a rectangular hole on the bottom
of<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.790> box

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
of the box

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.310 
of the box
the<00:04:46.350> drawing<00:04:46.740> now<00:04:47.250> shows<00:04:47.670> what<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.690> box<00:04:48.930> looks

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
the drawing now shows what the box looks

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.010 
the drawing now shows what the box looks
like<00:04:49.590> before<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.580> rectangular<00:04:51.210> solid<00:04:51.630> is

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
like before the rectangular solid is

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.830 
like before the rectangular solid is
subtracted<00:04:52.800> from<00:04:52.830> it

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
subtracted from it

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.180 
subtracted from it
the<00:04:55.410> drawing<00:04:55.770> looks<00:04:56.100> okay<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:56.940> me<00:04:57.210> now<00:04:57.919> so<00:04:58.919> we

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
the drawing looks okay to me now so we

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.180 
the drawing looks okay to me now so we
will<00:04:59.220> switch<00:04:59.730> to<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.660> top<00:05:00.930> view<00:05:01.199> and<00:05:01.410> go<00:05:01.980> back

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
will switch to the top view and go back

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:10.360 
will switch to the top view and go back
to<00:05:02.430> using<00:05:02.610> only<00:05:03.030> one<00:05:03.600> viewport
