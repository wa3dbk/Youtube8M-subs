00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.760 

ok<00:00:03.419> today<00:00:03.750> we're<00:00:03.929> going<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.140> make<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.319> folded

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
ok today we're going to make a folded

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.880 
ok today we're going to make a folded
sort<00:00:04.980> pup<00:00:05.160> pad<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.759> it's<00:00:06.480> based<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:07.020> triangles

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
sort pup pad and it's based on triangles

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.310 
sort pup pad and it's based on triangles
that<00:00:08.160> are<00:00:08.790> placed<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.599> top<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.900> each<00:00:10.170> other

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
that are placed on top of each other

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.459 
that are placed on top of each other
it's<00:00:10.769> an<00:00:10.920> 8<00:00:11.160> co-star<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.660> build<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.410> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
it's an 8 co-star and we build it on a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.460 
it's an 8 co-star and we build it on a
interfacing<00:00:14.429> template<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.470> custom-made

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
interfacing template that is custom-made

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.769 
interfacing template that is custom-made
for<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> hot<00:00:17.160> pad<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.940> basically<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
for the hot pad and it's basically a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.400 
for the hot pad and it's basically a
ruler<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.250> ruler<00:00:20.520> has<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.060> grid<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.750> has

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
ruler and the ruler has a grid that has

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.890 
ruler and the ruler has a grid that has
increments<00:00:23.279> already<00:00:23.760> set<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.750> you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
increments already set up so that you

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050 
increments already set up so that you
can<00:00:25.109> build<00:00:25.230> your<00:00:25.470> star<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.039> they're<00:00:26.849> layered

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
can build your star and they're layered

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.169 
can build your star and they're layered
and<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.840> started<00:00:28.849> we're<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.029> going

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and so to get started we're just going

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.609 
and so to get started we're just going
to<00:00:30.210> start<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> very<00:00:30.900> beginning<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to start with the very beginning and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.870 
to start with the very beginning and
we're<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.890> put<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> little<00:00:32.340> bit<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> glue

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
we're going to put a little bit of glue

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.080 
we're going to put a little bit of glue
right<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> first<00:00:34.260> piece<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.059> put<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
right on the first piece and put it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.299 
right on the first piece and put it
right<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.510> place<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.530> start<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:37.890> 4

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
right in place and we start with 4

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
right in place and we start with 4
little<00:00:39.090> triangles<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.140> hit<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> blue

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
little triangles and we just hit a blue

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.389 
little triangles and we just hit a blue
stick<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.790> lay<00:00:41.969> them<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.270> layer<00:00:42.570> 1<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> we

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
stick and we lay them on layer 1 and we

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.600 
stick and we lay them on layer 1 and we
press<00:00:44.760> them<00:00:44.940> gently<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.989> glue<00:00:46.430> toward<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
press them gently with a glue toward the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.369 
press them gently with a glue toward the
middle<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.989> first<00:00:49.289> four<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.100> do

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
middle and the first four that you do

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.750 
middle and the first four that you do
establish<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.680> eight<00:00:52.860> point<00:00:53.160> star<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
establish the eight point star that

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.650 
establish the eight point star that
you're<00:00:53.969> doing

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.860 

there<00:01:02.470> you<00:01:02.620> go<00:01:02.770> your<00:01:03.100> first<00:01:03.310> four<00:01:03.700> are<00:01:04.059> done

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
there you go your first four are done

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.990 
there you go your first four are done
and<00:01:05.290> then<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.650> move<00:01:05.890> backwards<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.729> we<00:01:06.850> go

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
and then we move backwards and we go

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.930 
and then we move backwards and we go
back<00:01:07.210> to<00:01:07.420> later<00:01:07.660> two<00:01:07.990> we<00:01:08.680> take<00:01:08.890> our<00:01:09.070> next<00:01:09.310> piece

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
back to later two we take our next piece

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.670 
back to later two we take our next piece
and<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.420> put<00:01:10.660> glue<00:01:10.810> on<00:01:11.110> it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
and we put glue on it

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.219 
and we put glue on it
just<00:01:12.280> on<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.550> tip<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.210> we<00:01:13.510> move<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.840> back<00:01:14.020> and

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
just on the tip and we move it back and

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.260 
just on the tip and we move it back and
we're<00:01:14.350> going<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.530> do<00:01:14.650> eight<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:15.100> these<00:01:15.280> now<00:01:16.210> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
we're going to do eight of these now the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.469 
we're going to do eight of these now the
first<00:01:16.570> one<00:01:16.750> was<00:01:16.930> four<00:01:17.350> but<00:01:18.100> by<00:01:18.280> moving<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.240> back

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
first one was four but by moving it back

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.210 
first one was four but by moving it back
we're<00:01:19.960> going<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.140> establish<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.800> little

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
we're going to establish that little

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.490 
we're going to establish that little
star<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.790> middle<00:01:21.970> but<00:01:22.690> an<00:01:22.990> eight<00:01:23.260> point

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
star in the middle but an eight point

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.130 
star in the middle but an eight point
star<00:01:23.710> needs<00:01:24.100> eight<00:01:24.310> triangles<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.420> at<00:01:25.810> each

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
star needs eight triangles so at each

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.400 
star needs eight triangles so at each
intersection<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.729> 45<00:01:28.300> degrees<00:01:28.780> we're

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
intersection of the 45 degrees we're

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.130 
intersection of the 45 degrees we're
going<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.619> put<00:01:29.830> a<00:01:30.040> triangle<00:01:30.610> but<00:01:31.420> exactly<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
going to put a triangle but exactly the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.100 
going to put a triangle but exactly the
same<00:01:32.380> point<00:01:32.650> on<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.009> ruler<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:34.479> we're<00:01:34.990> going

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
same point on the ruler so we're going

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.810 
same point on the ruler so we're going
to<00:01:35.170> keep<00:01:35.380> going<00:01:35.440> around<00:01:36.190> this<00:01:36.700> with<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.960> brown

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
to keep going around this with the brown

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.070 
to keep going around this with the brown
fabric<00:01:39.820> with<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.030> green<00:01:40.360> fabric<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:40.990> then

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
fabric with the green fabric and then

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:50.160 
fabric with the green fabric and then
with<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.320> top<00:01:41.590> fabric

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.680 

yeah<00:01:50.800> it's<00:01:51.159> fairly<00:01:51.520> quick<00:01:51.820> if<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.240> just<00:01:52.450> use<00:01:52.659> a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
yeah it's fairly quick if you just use a

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.990 
yeah it's fairly quick if you just use a
little<00:01:53.020> bit<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.260> glue<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.700> press<00:01:54.970> it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
little bit of glue and you press it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.290 
little bit of glue and you press it
right<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.750> spot<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.890> goes<00:01:57.670> together<00:01:57.909> and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
right and spot just goes together and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.390 
right and spot just goes together and
stays<00:01:58.540> together<00:01:58.890> unless<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.070> want<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.340> change

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
stays together unless you want to change

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.760 
stays together unless you want to change
it<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:00.970> they<00:02:01.119> because<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:01.900> glue<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.740> can

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
it and they because it's glue you can

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:12.870 
it and they because it's glue you can
undo<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.880> do<00:02:04.630> something<00:02:04.869> else

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.360 

another<00:02:13.630> thing<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.020> think<00:02:14.050> about<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.620> contrast

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
another thing to think about is contrast

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.360 
another thing to think about is contrast
you<00:02:15.610> want<00:02:15.850> your<00:02:16.030> star<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.370> dimension

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
you want your star to have a dimension

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.430 
you want your star to have a dimension
to<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:18.910> have<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.420> think<00:02:19.660> when<00:02:20.380> you're

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
to it so you have to think when you're

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.280 
to it so you have to think when you're
doing<00:02:20.980> your<00:02:21.010> star<00:02:21.490> will<00:02:22.000> these<00:02:22.180> players<00:02:22.690> show

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
doing your star will these players show

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.190 
doing your star will these players show
together<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:25.120> when<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.330> get<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.600> your<00:02:25.720> last

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
together and when you get to your last

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.070 
together and when you get to your last
piece<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.430> want<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.700> tuck<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.000> under<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.870> now

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
piece you want to tuck it under so now

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.950 
piece you want to tuck it under so now
we<00:02:29.140> have<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> pinwheel<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:31.510> next<00:02:31.810> layer

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
we have a pinwheel and the next layer

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.210 
we have a pinwheel and the next layer
that<00:02:31.990> we<00:02:32.440> do<00:02:32.590> we're<00:02:32.770> going<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> move<00:02:33.070> it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
that we do we're going to move it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.510 
that we do we're going to move it
backwards<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.030> layer<00:02:34.480> three<00:02:35.220> we're<00:02:36.220> already

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
backwards to layer three we're already

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.870 
backwards to layer three we're already
on<00:02:36.700> there<00:02:36.940> three<00:02:37.240> we're<00:02:37.510> going<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.780> do<00:02:38.880> we're

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
on there three we're going to do we're

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.400 
on there three we're going to do we're
going<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.150> put<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.320> place<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:43.290> get<00:02:44.290> our

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
going to put it in place just get our

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.530 
going to put it in place just get our
glue<00:02:44.680> stick<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:46.440> again<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.540> very

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
glue stick and again this is a very

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.230 
glue stick and again this is a very
quick<00:02:49.840> thing

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.560 

it<00:02:52.780> helps<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.320> your<00:02:53.970> triangles<00:02:54.970> are<00:02:55.120> starched

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
it helps if your triangles are starched

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.790 
it helps if your triangles are starched
and<00:02:55.780> sprayed<00:02:56.230> nice<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.010> flat<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.880> they<00:02:58.180> don't

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
and sprayed nice and flat and they don't

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.340 
and sprayed nice and flat and they don't
start<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.950> relax<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.790> your<00:03:01.180> your<00:03:02.050> layers

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
start to relax so that your your layers

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:23.950 
start to relax so that your your layers
of<00:03:02.710> your<00:03:02.800> fabric<00:03:03.250> versus<00:03:03.550> flat<00:03:03.760> as<00:03:03.940> possible

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.880 

okay<00:03:24.560> we're<00:03:24.770> almost<00:03:24.950> done<00:03:25.160> with<00:03:25.400> layer<00:03:25.640> three

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
okay we're almost done with layer three

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.320 
okay we're almost done with layer three
all<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:27.920> way<00:03:28.040> around<00:03:28.430> here

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
all the way around here

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.530 
all the way around here
and<00:03:30.320> we're<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.890> take<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.970> under<00:03:32.330> you

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
and we're going to take that under you

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.910 
and we're going to take that under you
know<00:03:33.370> that's<00:03:34.370> layer<00:03:34.640> three<00:03:35.350> we<00:03:36.350> do<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.710> top

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
know that's layer three we do the top

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.010 
know that's layer three we do the top
layer<00:03:37.190> layer<00:03:37.490> four<00:03:37.910> it's<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.210> same<00:03:38.450> thing<00:03:38.750> we

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
layer layer four it's the same thing we

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.770 
layer layer four it's the same thing we
just<00:03:39.050> go<00:03:40.000> right<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.420> end<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:43.780> template

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
just go right to the end of the template

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:53.960 
just go right to the end of the template
area<00:03:46.300> use<00:03:47.300> a<00:03:47.330> glue<00:03:47.600> stick<00:03:47.630> compress<00:03:48.290> it

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.030 

as<00:03:54.630> soon<00:03:54.840> as<00:03:54.990> we're<00:03:55.140> done<00:03:55.170> with<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.530> we're

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
as soon as we're done with this we're

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.230 
as soon as we're done with this we're
going<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.220> take<00:03:56.460> it<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.820> ironing<00:03:56.850> board

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
going to take it to the ironing board

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.460 
going to take it to the ironing board
and<00:03:57.570> iron<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.900> then<00:04:00.900> we're<00:04:01.110> going<00:04:01.320> to

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
and iron it and then we're going to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.250 
and iron it and then we're going to
stitch<00:04:01.860> in<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.130> ditch<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:03.060> now<00:04:03.270> this<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.870> very

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
stitch in a ditch and now this is a very

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.860 
stitch in a ditch and now this is a very
exciting<00:04:04.860> way<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.760> finish<00:04:06.270> it<00:04:06.300> up<00:04:06.570> because

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
exciting way to finish it up because

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.780 
exciting way to finish it up because
there's<00:04:07.230> no<00:04:07.410> handwork<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.100> it's<00:04:08.490> very

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
there's no handwork and it's very

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.770 
there's no handwork and it's very
friendly<00:04:09.720> if<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.590> are<00:04:11.510> going<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.630> do

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
friendly if you are going to do

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.009 
friendly if you are going to do
something<00:04:12.990> real<00:04:13.290> quick<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.690> make<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.840> very

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
something real quick and make it very

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.229 
something real quick and make it very
well<00:04:16.290> because<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:17.000> stitching<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.209> ditch

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
well because the stitching in the ditch

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.180 
well because the stitching in the ditch
holds<00:04:19.049> all<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.320> layers<00:04:19.530> together<00:04:19.799> without

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
holds all the layers together without

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.090 
holds all the layers together without
showing<00:04:20.760> your<00:04:20.790> threads<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:22.260> also<00:04:22.470> keeps

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
showing your threads and it also keeps

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.980 
showing your threads and it also keeps
it<00:04:23.250> strong<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.150> after<00:04:24.450> washing<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
it strong so that after washing and

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.240 
it strong so that after washing and
wearing<00:04:25.170> those<00:04:25.530> threads<00:04:25.830> aren't<00:04:26.010> going<00:04:26.190> to

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
wearing those threads aren't going to

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.900 
wearing those threads aren't going to
break<00:04:26.420> but<00:04:27.420> there<00:04:27.660> there's<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.320> hot<00:04:28.590> pad<00:04:28.910> put

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
break but there there's a hot pad put

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.690 
break but there there's a hot pad put
together<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.800> now<00:04:31.800> we<00:04:31.860> would<00:04:32.190> stitch<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:32.610> a

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
together and now we would stitch in a

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.080 
together and now we would stitch in a
ditch<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.450> do<00:04:34.320> that<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.950> have<00:04:35.880> one

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
ditch and to do that and have one

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.910 
ditch and to do that and have one
already<00:04:36.270> done<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:37.040> take<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.460> hot<00:04:38.670> pad<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.920> we

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
already done I take the hot pad and we

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.070 
already done I take the hot pad and we
open<00:04:41.340> up<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:42.210> layers<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.820> we<00:04:44.820> start<00:04:45.210> at<00:04:45.870> one

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
open up the layers and we start at one

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.870 
open up the layers and we start at one
point<00:04:46.320> go<00:04:46.950> down<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.870> if<00:04:48.870> we<00:04:49.140> need<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.590> we<00:04:50.460> open

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
point go down and if we need to we open

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.260 
point go down and if we need to we open
up<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:52.680> triangles<00:04:53.310> just<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.730> little<00:04:53.970> bit<00:04:54.120> to

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
up the triangles just a little bit to

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.670 
up the triangles just a little bit to
stitch<00:04:54.480> it'll<00:04:54.780> get<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.080> come<00:04:55.260> all<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.560> way

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
stitch it'll get to come all the way

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.980 
stitch it'll get to come all the way
through<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.330> stitch<00:04:57.330> all<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.570> way<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
through and stitch all the way to the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.250 
through and stitch all the way to the
other<00:04:58.080> side<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.590> we<00:04:58.680> do<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.010> four<00:04:59.370> times<00:04:59.730> and

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
other side and we do that four times and

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.690 
other side and we do that four times and
each<00:05:01.260> time<00:05:01.320> we<00:05:01.830> do<00:05:01.980> that<00:05:02.220> we're<00:05:02.430> going<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.640> get

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
each time we do that we're going to get

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.580 
each time we do that we're going to get
better<00:05:02.910> at<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.840> really<00:05:04.050> helps<00:05:04.470> when

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
better at it and it really helps when

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.140 
better at it and it really helps when
you<00:05:04.740> iron<00:05:04.919> your<00:05:05.130> triangles<00:05:05.760> if<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:05.970> leave<00:05:06.120> a

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
you iron your triangles if you leave a

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.390 
you iron your triangles if you leave a
little<00:05:06.240> space<00:05:06.690> right<00:05:07.680> at<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.890> tip<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:08.370> that

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
little space right at the tip so that

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.240 
little space right at the tip so that
that<00:05:09.060> thread<00:05:09.360> will<00:05:09.390> go<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:09.840> there<00:05:10.080> but<00:05:10.890> at<00:05:11.070> the

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
that thread will go in there but at the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.460 
that thread will go in there but at the
other<00:05:12.060> side<00:05:12.390> of<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.600> which<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.840> can<00:05:13.110> see<00:05:13.320> is

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
other side of it which you can see is

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.920 
other side of it which you can see is
that<00:05:13.500> there's<00:05:13.919> only<00:05:14.070> four<00:05:14.430> seams<00:05:14.729> and<00:05:15.030> then

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
that there's only four seams and then

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.360 
that there's only four seams and then
we're<00:05:16.080> going<00:05:16.200> to<00:05:16.229> baste<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.740> all<00:05:16.890> around<00:05:17.250> the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
we're going to baste it all around the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.190 
we're going to baste it all around the
edge<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.850> then<00:05:18.600> we're<00:05:18.720> going<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.900> trim<00:05:19.140> off

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
edge and then we're going to trim off

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.350 
edge and then we're going to trim off
all<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.770> extra<00:05:20.130> and<00:05:21.860> when<00:05:22.860> we<00:05:22.950> do<00:05:23.130> that<00:05:23.370> we

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.750 
all this extra and when we do that we
want<00:05:24.510> to<00:05:24.600> get<00:05:24.720> rid<00:05:24.840> of<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.229> extra<00:05:25.979> areas<00:05:26.580> of

want to get rid of the extra areas of

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.120 
want to get rid of the extra areas of

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
the template in a little dog ears when

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.950 
the template in a little dog ears when
we<00:05:32.250> trim<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.640> then<00:05:33.360> we're<00:05:33.510> getting<00:05:33.600> ready<00:05:33.840> to

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
we trim it then we're getting ready to

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.530 
we trim it then we're getting ready to
pull<00:05:34.320> them<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.830> quilting<00:05:35.250> is<00:05:35.520> as<00:05:36.120> simple

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
pull them and the quilting is as simple

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.110 
pull them and the quilting is as simple
or<00:05:36.690> ornate<00:05:37.200> as<00:05:37.380> you<00:05:37.530> wish<00:05:37.770> what<00:05:38.460> I<00:05:38.490> usually<00:05:38.790> do

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
or ornate as you wish what I usually do

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.260 
or ornate as you wish what I usually do
is<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.600> get<00:05:39.990> batting<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.830> get<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.310> backing<00:05:42.090> that

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
is I get batting I get a backing that

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.440 
is I get batting I get a backing that
matches<00:05:42.720> and<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.770> top<00:05:44.130> stitch<00:05:44.490> around<00:05:45.000> the

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
matches and I I top stitch around the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.900 
matches and I I top stitch around the
edge<00:05:45.570> so<00:05:46.320> that<00:05:46.350> it<00:05:46.650> layers<00:05:47.160> all<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.700> pieces

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
edge so that it layers all the pieces

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.530 
edge so that it layers all the pieces
together<00:05:48.210> but<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:49.140> also<00:05:49.640> shows<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:50.940> star<00:05:51.210> on

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
together but it also shows the star on

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.110 
together but it also shows the star on
the<00:05:51.660> back

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
the back

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.150 
the back
so<00:05:52.510> it's<00:05:52.720> nice<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:52.960> you<00:05:53.290> can<00:05:53.500> do<00:05:53.710> two<00:05:53.889> layers

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
so it's nice and you can do two layers

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.550 
so it's nice and you can do two layers
you<00:05:54.850> can<00:05:55.000> stop<00:05:55.240> top<00:05:55.510> stitch<00:05:55.810> more<00:05:56.169> than<00:05:56.320> one

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
you can stop top stitch more than one

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.400 
you can stop top stitch more than one
and<00:05:56.860> that<00:05:57.610> looks<00:05:57.820> well<00:05:58.120> really<00:05:58.690> nice<00:05:58.930> too<00:05:59.199> then

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
and that looks well really nice too then

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.680 
and that looks well really nice too then
you're<00:05:59.590> going<00:05:59.800> to<00:06:00.000> baste<00:06:01.000> around<00:06:01.389> the<00:06:01.510> edge

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
you're going to baste around the edge

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.870 
you're going to baste around the edge
and<00:06:01.990> get<00:06:02.680> rid<00:06:02.830> of<00:06:02.860> the<00:06:03.070> batting<00:06:03.430> and<00:06:03.610> you're

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880

and get rid of the batting and you're
almost<00:06:04.120> done<00:06:04.479> you're<00:06:04.750> ready<00:06:04.900> to<00:06:05.260> bind<00:06:06.100> it<00:06:06.370> so

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
almost done you're ready to bind it so

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.760 
almost done you're ready to bind it so
we've<00:06:07.030> quilted<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.660> we've<00:06:08.290> cleaned<00:06:08.560> up<00:06:08.710> the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
we've quilted it we've cleaned up the

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.939 
we've quilted it we've cleaned up the
edge<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:09.600> we're<00:06:10.600> ready<00:06:10.810> to<00:06:11.020> add<00:06:11.290> our<00:06:11.350> binding

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.629 
edge and we're ready to add our binding
and<00:06:12.220> the<00:06:13.350> circle<00:06:14.350> binding<00:06:14.770> doesn't<00:06:15.340> need<00:06:15.490> to

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
and the circle binding doesn't need to

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.700 
and the circle binding doesn't need to
be<00:06:15.790> biased<00:06:16.330> but<00:06:16.510> it's<00:06:16.660> very<00:06:16.960> nice<00:06:17.199> if<00:06:17.440> you<00:06:17.530> do
