00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.580
 new two guys that we are in a 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.400
 new good video we are in the network of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.110
 10 to 15 for the dwarf channel that good 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.759
 has asked for some help to do the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.380
 review and good this case I bring you the 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.880
 review of what the demo would have 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.009
 taken a couple of days ago for the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 most platforms of what I did and 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.300
 I'm going to do the reviews about 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.130
 gaming websites or cruise 360 ​​the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.320
 what's new and a little bit too 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 the differences with the previous fifa 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.250
 follow files let's go god said 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.980
 First of all you should talk about what 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.989
 would be the effect of the shot is a bit 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 more retouched compared to the previous 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.870
 fifa you know that in the previous fifa the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.879
 effect was a little more going a little more 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.070
 direct did not have had him what is the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.870
 effect but did not take that much good thread 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.140
 so fifa 15 as you can see here goes 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.270
 rather faster it picks up more speed and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 it goes like with more curve so that's 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.140
 pretty good in second place we'll have 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.609
 what would the guy be the shot right now 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.440
 it can be said that it is more manual and 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.330
 we would have to direct the ball more with 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.160
 the joystick because as you can see in the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.979
 The first few times he provided, I was leaving very 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.869
 up and I was not being here then at 8 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.470
 You could say a great goal 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.990
 terrible 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.730
 you have to move with the joystick you have 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.170
 that to direct new already to the ball and sometimes 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.330
 you can create effects and voices like 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.980
 as extras another of the novelties is 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 say the 15 for me the best is the 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.950
 improving the goalie area with this me 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.480
 I mean the goalie has 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.400
 different reflections 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.520
 movements and stops as you can see 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 here to a shot of nothing of 2 meters 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.820
 the goalie can fill in a couple of 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
 seconds sticking a leg like here and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.480
 paying the ball that could enter something 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.100
 perfectly as in this for example 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.810
 in a corner kick to the head for a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.869
 shot from the goalkeeper's head shoots 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.790
 down with one hand and are things that the 14 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.040
 you could see but here they are pretty 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.930
 improved and good all this is going to see 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.940
 rather better in the new consoles 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.220
 generation and I started to know everything 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.720
 perfectly these news I will 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.280
 comment now you can appreciate more in 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.680
 new generation consoles in the tier one 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.750
 in play 4 that would be the wear of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.270
 the game as the game progresses 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.960
 match this in our 60 and a play 3 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.790
 you can not enter practically anything 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.320
 because they do not have the engine they need 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.420
 of the graphics but good as we 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.850
 the game goes by as the field is going 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.920
 wearing more looks like the grass is 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.110
 is raising a little in celebrations 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.570
 for example they are stretching of knees 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.370
 mark the lines of the feet 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.470
 slip good that's also a 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.390
 barbarity also something else would be 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.690
 the hobbies are quite improved and 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.610
 the stadiums with this I mean that 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.810
 for example now less here you have 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.640
 purchased the rights of the prize 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.650
 then they have all is from the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.840
 prize officially created that accuracy 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.700
 and also those hobbies for example in 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.860
 a game if you are losing you touch 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.870
 come back as they are like all 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.640
 they start animal they start to jump or if 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.560
 for example they earn 20 in a certain 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.570
 moment of the game, they all 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.950
 the like of backs that is to do 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.750
 much in england they stand on their backs 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.610
 and I started jumping good is pretty 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.470
 improved what would be the hobby and the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.750
 the stadiums are very good as in 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.100
 All of the new minigames are taught 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.710
 I mean the shooting skill game 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.840
 of center pass all of this one of 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.780
 they are watching here would be the game 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.000
 to go through walls and make walls 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.290
 with those plates that we have there and this 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.900
 it tells us that the game 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.390
 teammates more will 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.640
 everything faster there will be better passes in 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.219
 three rivals and others so that the game 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.540
 everything is faster more agile and that has 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.060
 It looks very good for the new 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.829
 generation and finally I would fit 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.420
 highlight what control would be 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.939
 new direction that good as a team is 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.379
 63 I do not think you'll get to notice much 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.000
 who does not so much play the 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.290
 true but good in control 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.849
 addressed I mean that by 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.040
 example, you get a pass from above 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.170
 high and instead of directly controlling 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.579
 what is you, you can control and 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.909
 move forward 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.269
 enzo 14 this was already there were some 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.799
 failures sometimes with some controls 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.569
 I think that for 15 they will have improved it for 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.549
 for what would be the new generation 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.069
 so let's wait and see how it is and 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.609
 no guys that's all for me 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.079
 I hope it has helped you 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.030
 searched what I could have recorded what 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.459
 I could think that this is more or 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.930
 minus a summary of what it would be almost 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.629
 all the news and I'm sure something 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.570
 it stays but they do not dry perfect so 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.680
 nothing and also it will hurt thanks to nano for 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.590
 let me do the promotion to her and 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.870
 good since they do not know much about football me 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.180
 It's not like I'm a professional but 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.650
 I think I can help you and I hope that 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.410
 guys, it's like that you already know that you can give 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.410
 like and it does not feel good kids chao
