00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:12.389
 and then we will start another week 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 The logical thing is that we have to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.730
 think about our kitchen chat that 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.590
 that moment that we talk about 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 we reflect and today only I go 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.140
 talk to you, I'll talk about my 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 personal experience of how it was in this 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.720
 project in my process of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.109
 weight loss to have a mother say 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.109
 like this 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.230
 greedy 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.809
 She's a pretty slate and we always leave. 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.360
 together with people and my mother that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 who was fortunate enough to be able to eat 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.920
 all things and do not get fat 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.910
 and I do not deprive you saw she did not 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.129
 deprives you of your diet because you 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.129
 She wants to see your side, look there. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.030
 and then how could anyone not give security 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.030
 these green people 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.750
 I did not say it's pulled, it 's pulled. 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.240
 now that's what you have in the family 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.040
 people who want to eat they want 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.880
 eating things that you do not currently 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.119
 How can this process be for us? 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.410
 Because we're going to live together all the time. 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.979
 during our dietary reeducation 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.890
 whether it 's a television or the street 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.710
 People will not stop at work. 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.530
 what you're dieting because you 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.119
 You need to lose weight because you have 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.490
 problems with food 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.320
 the problem we have with food 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.840
 It's ours and it's only for people like 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.060
 to resist this type of situation and there 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.160
 people who do food re-education if they 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.180
 day in the day to day. 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 day right 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.729
 suddenly comes across a tray 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.729
 these 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.760
 full of brigadeiro full of thing 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.700
 Hot and doing re-education 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.840
 food you choose 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.250
 our choice counts for me and there and there 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.320
 what you do when you sit in a 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.230
 brigaderia and the smell of chocolate 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.900
 invades your nostrils 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.430
 What do you do? What do you do? What? 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.430
 You did good, you know what I do and what I do. 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.730
 I made my motivation 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.670
 she had to keep on high and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.730
 she kept herself like that in 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.750
 I was able to enjoy these 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.959
 things 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.430
 with the response I had to the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.459
 my attitudes 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.230
 so I made the right choices look 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.930
 We only went out this weekend. 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.080
 They ate that cake you'll see. 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.080
 now 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:20.800
 It's my choice which was my choice 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:23.110
 is my option is to escape the sense and then the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.590
 fun staff and weightless in 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.440
 awareness and by interacting with 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.030
 world eating my frozen mango without 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.650
 sugar 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.569
 want to say today we have this option the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.880
 market he makes available to us 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.310
 many other things 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.220
 so we have to look around the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.400
 People have to realize what it is for us. 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.920
 What can I do now and why? 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.410
 that I want it for me because I 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:00.160
 I will resist this because I want to 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:02.530
 to eliminate weight because I want to improve 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.090
 my health because I want to get into the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.379
 clothes that are lost inside the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.019
 wardrobe 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.450
 I look at them they look at me and 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.970
 is the first pack of crackers that goes 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.030
 makes me stay more and more distant 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.350
 this clothing of this desire to return said 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.380
 the sec and I was then that kept me and 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.110
 I did not feel strengthened because the 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.550
 my body responds ahead of my 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.800
 choices 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.060
 I got one right the next day. 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:38.229
 I was more but luxa knows but so speaks 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.419
 it was not worth it and it's worth the people 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.180
 when I was going to reduce my gut 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:47.020
 is not paying off en holds his 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.610
 The wave continues because it 's paying off. 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.380
 You know you see you get more 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.960
 but in the sense of entering 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.090
 in your clothes in the lingerie your arm 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.940
 1 passing over the middle of the thigh not 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.760
 passing is not worth the effort 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.099
 people are still worth your 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.410
 continue product 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.910
 then it strengthened me that me 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.300
 kept strong 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.169
 my choice is right my choice 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.930
 possible, then my mother 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.060
 I could come with a plate of brigadeiro de 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.530
 tall kuca cake 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.810
 of what was and I knew inside of me 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.090
 spoke pt 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.550
 They have the right to eat now. 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.880
 acts because your choice is doing 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.720
 super sure you 're on the way is 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:45.010
 That's where it stays strong and we have to 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.560
 have our inner strength because the 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.480
 people they will continue to eat love 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.639
 they will not stop eating because you 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.040
 food re-education because you 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.040
 You need to diet, you 're going to continue. 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.070
 coexisting with wedding parties with 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.220
 Celebrations on me but you have to 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.200
 keep your strength because you know there 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.340
 deep down you're doing better 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.650
 for you 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.440
 when we make sure it is 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.690
 doing best for us can spend a 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.419
 truck from prague that are 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.100
 punish let's do it this week let's go 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.200
 to make sure that we are 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.210
 choosing the best so we do not care 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.820
 alone with bad luck not because I want 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.180
 that is so because I need it 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.450
 Yes, I deserve it so be it 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:35.440
 and we will learn this and if 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:40.080
 strengthening as one day at a time 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:45.520
 logical tamo together and always mixed 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:49.270
 resist things for you out of conviction 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:53.190
 I by conviction do not make me dislike 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:07:00.000
 not by characters and hence does not work 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:00.000
 The kiss, people and a week but we all
