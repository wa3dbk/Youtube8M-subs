and I tend to think of this not as a

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.630 
and I tend to think of this not as a
return<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> past<00:00:49.199> but<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.859> a<00:00:49.890> proper<00:00:50.339> step

return to the past but as a proper step

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.250 
return to the past but as a proper step

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
it's in a way completely important that

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.230 
it's in a way completely important that
this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.170> new<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.339> people<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> work

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
this is is new for people and the work

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.719 
this is is new for people and the work
is<00:01:06.540> judged<00:01:06.870> on<00:01:07.110> its<00:01:07.200> own<00:01:07.620> credit<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.400> this

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
is judged on its own credit all this

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.330 
is judged on its own credit all this
proposal<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.110> vision<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
proposal it's not just on vision it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.490 
proposal it's not just on vision it
sounds<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.940> obvious<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.500> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
sounds a little obvious but the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.590 
sounds a little obvious but the
combination<00:01:13.800> of<00:01:14.310> people<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.300> jury<00:01:15.480> I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
combination of people in the jury I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.200 
combination of people in the jury I
think<00:01:15.900> actually<00:01:16.050> gave<00:01:16.320> very<00:01:16.500> good<00:01:16.680> result

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
think actually gave very good result

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.560 
think actually gave very good result
because<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:19.530> inevitably<00:01:20.460> agreed<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.360> some

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
because we inevitably agreed on some

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
because we inevitably agreed on some
things<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.870> we<00:01:22.080> also<00:01:22.200> had<00:01:22.380> quite<00:01:22.680> discrepant

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
things but we also had quite discrepant

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.440 
things but we also had quite discrepant
points<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.880> view<00:01:24.290> for<00:01:25.290> others<00:01:25.620> and<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:27.180> just

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
points of view for others and it just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.710 
points of view for others and it just
seemed<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> work<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:28.020> fine<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.560> end<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
seemed to work out fine in the end I

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
seemed to work out fine in the end I
think<00:01:30.720> yeah<00:01:31.050> this<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> ICS<00:01:31.890> for

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
think yeah this is what the ICS for

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.090 
think yeah this is what the ICS for
ultimately<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.390> see<00:01:33.690> a<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.710> should<00:01:34.950> be

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
ultimately I see a you know should be

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.370 
ultimately I see a you know should be
just<00:01:35.250> full<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.550> artists<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.510> any<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> every

sort of like be open with ideas it's a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
sort of like be open with ideas it's a
fantastic<00:01:41.640> opportunities<00:01:42.150> where<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> think

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
fantastic opportunities where I think

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.010 
fantastic opportunities where I think
for<00:01:43.050> you<00:01:43.800> know<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> young<00:01:44.220> artist<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.360> basically

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
of make a statement and to say you know

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.230 
of make a statement and to say you know
this<00:01:51.510> is<00:01:51.540> me<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.080> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:56.240> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
this is me and this is what I do it

sounds<00:01:57.630> incredibly<00:01:58.140> old<00:01:58.320> school<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.710> me<00:01:58.800> but<00:01:58.980> I

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
sounds incredibly old school of me but I

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.620 
sounds incredibly old school of me but I
think<00:01:59.220> it's<00:01:59.340> very<00:01:59.430> important<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> new

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
think it's very important that new

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
think it's very important that new
contemporary<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.410> first<00:02:01.650> break<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
the tutors the structure that you set up

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.509 
the tutors the structure that you set up
