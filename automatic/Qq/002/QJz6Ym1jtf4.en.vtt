birth your walks ourselves the scrambles

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.349 
birth your walks ourselves the scrambles
will<00:00:04.980> be<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.400> description<00:00:05.520> okay<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:06.180> this

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
will be in the description okay so this

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.140 
will be in the description okay so this
is<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.540> first<00:00:06.690> scramble<00:00:07.610> and<00:00:08.610> looking<00:00:09.000> at<00:00:09.120> it

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
is the first scramble and looking at it

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.730 
is the first scramble and looking at it
I<00:00:09.420> see<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:09.990> I've<00:00:10.050> got<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.320> piece<00:00:10.500> solved

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
I see that I've got this piece solved

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.839 
I see that I've got this piece solved
already<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.130> I've<00:00:11.190> also<00:00:11.309> got<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.639> piece

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
already and I've also got this piece

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.610 
already and I've also got this piece
that<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.330> pretty<00:00:12.960> much<00:00:13.049> solved<00:00:13.469> already

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
that is like pretty much solved already

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.700 
that is like pretty much solved already
and<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.580> see<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.120> piece<00:00:16.080> relative<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and I see that this piece relative to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.710 
and I see that this piece relative to
this<00:00:16.800> piece<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.369> its<00:00:17.760> we're<00:00:18.240> opposite<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
this piece is in its we're opposite to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.779 
this piece is in its we're opposite to
where<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.869> supposed<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.080> be<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.279> like

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
where it supposed to be and this is like

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.130 
where it supposed to be and this is like
adjacent<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.539> where<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.750> supposed<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.020> be

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
adjacent to where it's supposed to be

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.310 
adjacent to where it's supposed to be
and<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.320> also<00:00:22.500> see<00:00:22.850> by<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.910> way<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.570> also<00:00:25.019> see

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and I also see by the way I'm I also see

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.230 
and I also see by the way I'm I also see
that<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.619> piece<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.820> bring<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> down

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
that this piece is if I bring it down

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
that this piece is if I bring it down
like<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.510> using<00:00:27.779> an<00:00:27.960> L<00:00:28.109> move<00:00:28.320> it'll<00:00:28.830> be

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
like this using an L move it'll be

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.230 
like this using an L move it'll be
basically<00:00:29.369> where<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.670> supposed<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
basically where it's supposed to be and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.990 
basically where it's supposed to be and
then<00:00:31.050> what<00:00:31.230> i<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.679> i<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.309> do

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
then what i can do is i can go do

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.430 
then what i can do is i can go do
instead<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.510> doing<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.750> d<00:00:33.870> prime<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.320> then

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
instead of just doing a d prime and then

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.049 
instead of just doing a d prime and then
our<00:00:34.860> there's<00:00:35.160> two<00:00:35.280> ways<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.550> could<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.880> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
our there's two ways I could do this I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.049 
our there's two ways I could do this I
could<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> d<00:00:36.690> prime<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.219> lines<00:00:38.879> up

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
could do a d prime so that this lines up

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.000 
could do a d prime so that this lines up
so<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> solved<00:00:40.290> these<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.590> pieces<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so that like I solved these two pieces I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.310 
so that like I solved these two pieces I
just<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.460> prone<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:43.050> then

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
just do an are prone like that and then

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.889 
just do an are prone like that and then
I<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.770> F<00:00:44.040> prime<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:45.000> line<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.539> bring

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I can do F prime to line this up bring

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.869 
I can do F prime to line this up bring
it<00:00:45.960> down<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.590> front<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.850> i

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it down and then a front do that or i

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.170 
it down and then a front do that or i
could<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.870> u<00:00:49.289> prime<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.670> line<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
could do u prime and then to line that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.880 
could do u prime and then to line that
up<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.840> relative<00:00:52.350> where<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.590> supposed<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.800> be

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
up to relative where it's supposed to be

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.410 
up to relative where it's supposed to be
here<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:53.520> our<00:00:53.640> party<00:00:53.910> fri<00:00:54.030> mar<00:00:54.210> prime

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
here and then our party fri mar prime

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.490 
here and then our party fri mar prime
i'm<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.379> one

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
i'm just going to go with that one

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.770 
i'm just going to go with that one
because<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.280> edius<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.149> i<00:00:57.480> don't<00:00:57.690> really

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
because it's the edius so i don't really

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
because it's the edius so i don't really
see<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.230> much<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.980> first<00:00:59.520> thing<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
see that much here the first thing that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
see that much here the first thing that
kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.969> catches<00:01:00.300> my<00:01:00.420> eye<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:01.020> edge

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
kind of catches my eye is this edge

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
kind of catches my eye is this edge
piece<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.590> piece<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.340> i<00:01:02.730> also<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
piece and this piece and i also see that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.950 
piece and this piece and i also see that
I've<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.600> red<00:01:03.960> red<00:01:04.970> got<00:01:05.970> red<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.390> red<00:01:06.720> pieces

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
I've got red red got red to red pieces

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.830 
I've got red red got red to red pieces
here<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.909> see<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> red<00:01:09.360> edge<00:01:09.540> here

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
here and so and I see a red edge here

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
here and so and I see a red edge here
and<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.439> basically<00:01:10.680> assume<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and so I can basically assume that and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160 
and so I can basically assume that and
so<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.689> neither<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> these

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so because I see that neither of these

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.719 
so because I see that neither of these
match<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.920> corner<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
match up with this corner I know that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.219 
match up with this corner I know that
this<00:01:14.880> edge<00:01:15.119> matches<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.720> his<00:01:15.869> corner<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
this edge matches up with his corner and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.050 
this edge matches up with his corner and
because<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> orientation<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.939> this

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
because of the orientation of this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.370 
because of the orientation of this
corner<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.610> Lu<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:22.170> L

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
corner I can just go Lu and then like L

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
corner I can just go Lu and then like L
and<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:22.890> cancel<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> three<00:01:24.210> move

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and then cancel with just the three move

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.929 
and then cancel with just the three move
insert<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.979> now<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.580> all

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
insert there and so now because of all

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
insert there and so now because of all
those<00:01:27.119> moves<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.450> tracked<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.110> edge<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.710> see

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
those moves I tracked this edge to see

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.230 
those moves I tracked this edge to see
that<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.070> goes<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.850> its<00:01:29.939> flipped

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that it goes back here and its flipped

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.039 
that it goes back here and its flipped
from<00:01:30.329> where<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.600> supposed<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.020> I'm

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
from where it's supposed to be so I'm

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.990 
from where it's supposed to be so I'm
going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> try<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> use<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> slot<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.880> my

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
going to try to use that slot with my

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.030 
going to try to use that slot with my
next<00:01:33.180> pair<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.720> bring<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
next pair so that I can bring it out so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.859 
next pair so that I can bring it out so
that<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.490> opposite<00:01:36.450> tort<00:01:36.630> suppose<00:01:36.780> d

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that it's not opposite tort suppose d

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.120 
that it's not opposite tort suppose d
which<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.350> crappy<00:01:37.560> position<00:01:37.740> for

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
which is a kind of crappy position for

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.679 
which is a kind of crappy position for
an<00:01:38.189> edge<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> other<00:01:39.180> hand<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.509> see

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
an edge to be on the other hand I see

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230 
an edge to be on the other hand I see
that<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.049> don't<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.890> solving<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.700> requires

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that I don't that solving this requires

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.730 
that I don't that solving this requires
a<00:01:42.299> rotation<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.320> course<00:01:43.350> because

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
a rotation and this of course because

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.690 
a rotation and this of course because
its<00:01:43.860> flipped<00:01:44.040> into<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> slot<00:01:44.399> requires

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
its flipped into the slot requires

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
its flipped into the slot requires
rotation<00:01:45.119> how<00:01:45.479> we're<00:01:45.659> solving<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.990> pair

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
rotation how we're solving this pair

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.630 
rotation how we're solving this pair
does<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.500> require<00:01:46.710> rotation<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.549> I'd

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
does not require rotation so I'd

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.399 
does not require rotation so I'd
probably<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.149> are<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.810> prime<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
probably just go are you are prime to

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.499 
probably just go are you are prime to
pair<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.000> insert

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
pair it up and then you and then insert

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.600 
pair it up and then you and then insert
it<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> back<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.320> what<00:01:52.439> she<00:01:52.590> said<00:01:52.770> so

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
it in the back that's what she said so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.010 
it in the back that's what she said so
what<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.450> because

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
what I'm going to do now is that because

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.929 
what I'm going to do now is that because
dr<00:01:55.409> both<00:01:55.530> flipped<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.890> their<00:01:55.979> space<00:01:56.159> places

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
dr both flipped in their space places

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.480 
dr both flipped in their space places
and<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.479> obviously<00:01:57.810> I've<00:01:58.710> got<00:01:58.950> two<00:01:59.159> edges<00:01:59.399> that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and so obviously I've got two edges that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.530 
and so obviously I've got two edges that
are<00:01:59.549> oriented<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.360> probably

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
are oriented and so what I'm probably

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.800 
are oriented and so what I'm probably
going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.290> force<00:02:01.649> an<00:02:01.890> orientation

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
going to do is just force an orientation

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.780 
going to do is just force an orientation
oll<00:02:03.810> skip<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:05.040> an<00:02:05.250> all<00:02:05.460> like

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
oll skip so that I get like an all like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.219 
oll skip so that I get like an all like
an<00:02:05.909> edges<00:02:06.149> oriented<00:02:06.509> case<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.899> i<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.079> do

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
an edges oriented case so that i can do

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.990 
an edges oriented case so that i can do
co<00:02:07.439> l<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.039> what<00:02:08.129> i'm<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.489> because

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
co l so what i'm going to do is because

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.820 
co l so what i'm going to do is because
like<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.599> pair<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.410> basically<00:02:10.739> my

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
like this pair like this is basically my

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.230 
like this pair like this is basically my
favorite<00:02:11.370> f2l<00:02:12.180> case<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.720> not

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
favorite f2l case that is not

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.480 
favorite f2l case that is not
um<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:14.380> three<00:02:14.680> move<00:02:14.800> insert<00:02:15.100> I'm<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.370> going

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
um like three move insert I'm just going

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.670 
um like three move insert I'm just going
to<00:02:15.520> keep<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.180> way<00:02:16.300> insert<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.560> that

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
to keep it that way insert that so that

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.530 
to keep it that way insert that so that
it's<00:02:17.800> correctly<00:02:18.520> oriented<00:02:18.760> relative<00:02:19.390> to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it's correctly oriented relative to

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.120 
it's correctly oriented relative to
these<00:02:19.690> two<00:02:19.870> here<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.200> then<00:02:20.770> I'm<00:02:20.860> just<00:02:20.890> going

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
these two here and then I'm just going

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.020 
these two here and then I'm just going
to<00:02:21.190> do<00:02:21.370> solve<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.270> fair<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:23.190> then<00:02:24.190> what<00:02:24.940> I'm

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
to do solve that fair and then what I'm

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.220 
to do solve that fair and then what I'm
going<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.240> do<00:02:25.330> here<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.050> kind<00:02:26.200> of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
going to do here is that this is kind of

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.050 
going to do here is that this is kind of
nice<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.770> can<00:02:27.070> not<00:02:27.370> only<00:02:27.490> swap<00:02:27.880> this

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
nice in that I can not only swap this

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.700 
nice in that I can not only swap this
with<00:02:28.240> this<00:02:28.450> meaning<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.170> I'll<00:02:29.290> get<00:02:29.440> an<00:02:29.530> all

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
with this meaning that I'll get an all

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.500 
with this meaning that I'll get an all
edges<00:02:30.010> case<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.430> can<00:02:30.610> also<00:02:30.820> set<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.390> up<00:02:31.480> for

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
edges case but I can also set it up for

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.570 
edges case but I can also set it up for
a<00:02:31.690> through<00:02:32.020> insert<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.460> this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
a through insert like that and then this

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.580 
a through insert like that and then this
is<00:02:33.700> even<00:02:33.970> nicer<00:02:34.120> because<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.900> see<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> really

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
is even nicer because I see a really

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.500 
is even nicer because I see a really
easy<00:02:35.770> winter<00:02:36.040> air<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.430> create<00:02:36.580> very<00:02:36.880> sorry<00:02:37.450> a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
easy winter air and create very sorry a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.450 
easy winter air and create very sorry a
winter<00:02:37.840> variation<00:02:38.320> case<00:02:38.470> which<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.800> where<00:02:39.010> you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
winter variation case which is where you

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.800 
winter variation case which is where you
orient<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.970> corners<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.420> last<00:02:40.600> layer

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
orient the corners of the last layer

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.950 
orient the corners of the last layer
while<00:02:42.060> inserting<00:02:43.060> your<00:02:43.270> last<00:02:43.480> pair<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:43.810> this

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
while inserting your last pair so this

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.480 
while inserting your last pair so this
one<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.470> case<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:44.830> just<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.190> sexy

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
one in this case it's just the sexy

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.820 
one in this case it's just the sexy
moves<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.820> then<00:02:45.940> insert<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.410> then<00:02:47.470> here's<00:02:47.740> an

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
moves and then insert and then here's an

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.780 
moves and then insert and then here's an
art<00:02:47.980> /<00:02:48.130> my<00:02:48.280> see<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.500> P<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:51.190> UFO<00:02:51.580> den<00:02:51.700> is

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
art / my see that the P a UFO den is

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.950 
art / my see that the P a UFO den is
going<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:51.970> be<00:02:52.030> YouTube<00:02:52.420> because<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.780> way<00:02:52.870> that

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
going to be YouTube because the way that

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.690 
going to be YouTube because the way that
you<00:02:53.050> tell<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.440> by<00:02:53.470> this<00:02:53.800> corner<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.550> this

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
you tell is by this corner so this

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.640 
you tell is by this corner so this
corner<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.300> opposite<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.020> work<00:02:56.200> specially<00:02:56.500> so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
corner is opposite to work specially so

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.050 
corner is opposite to work specially so
I<00:02:56.680> can<00:02:56.860> see<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.370> choose<00:02:57.550> in<00:02:57.670> at<00:02:57.760> all<00:02:57.850> if

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
I can see that a you choose in at all if

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.670 
I can see that a you choose in at all if
it<00:02:58.120> were<00:02:58.240> here<00:02:58.480> for<00:02:58.630> example<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:59.110> know<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.620> it

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
it were here for example I know that it

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.500 
it were here for example I know that it
were<00:02:59.800> it<00:03:00.070> would<00:03:00.130> be<00:03:00.400> no<00:03:00.760> way<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.910> f<00:03:01.120> because<00:03:01.390> it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
were it would be no way you f because it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.280 
were it would be no way you f because it
matches<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.320> it's<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.830> do<00:03:03.190> my<00:03:03.370> arm<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:04.290> as

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
matches so it's here I do my arm and as

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.040 
matches so it's here I do my arm and as
I<00:03:05.530> told<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.160> PLL<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.730> YouTube<00:03:07.180> so

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
I told you that the PLL is a YouTube so

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.070 
I told you that the PLL is a YouTube so
looking<00:03:08.320> at<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.470> scramble<00:03:08.830> I'm<00:03:09.040> really<00:03:10.080> not

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
looking at the scramble I'm really not

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.440 
looking at the scramble I'm really not
quite<00:03:11.230> sure<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.620> think<00:03:11.800> so<00:03:12.370> basically<00:03:12.850> because

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
quite sure to think so basically because

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.640 
quite sure to think so basically because
there's<00:03:13.600> nothing<00:03:13.870> really<00:03:13.990> solved<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.470> white

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
there's nothing really solved in white

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.930 
there's nothing really solved in white
and<00:03:14.830> there<00:03:14.950> are<00:03:15.040> some<00:03:15.160> pieces<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.670> example

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
and there are some pieces for example

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.850 
and there are some pieces for example
this<00:03:16.030> piece<00:03:16.210> this<00:03:16.360> piece<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.720> piece<00:03:16.900> these

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
this piece this piece this piece these

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.950 
this piece this piece this piece these
three<00:03:18.040> pieces<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.730> are<00:03:18.850> nearly<00:03:19.420> solved<00:03:19.840> in

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
three pieces that are nearly solved in

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.870 
three pieces that are nearly solved in
yellow<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:20.650> I'm<00:03:20.740> going<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:20.950> do<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.730> I'm

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
yellow what I'm going to do is that I'm

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.520 
yellow what I'm going to do is that I'm
see<00:03:22.240> this<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.600> opposite<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.260> where<00:03:23.440> it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
see this is opposite to where it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.380 
see this is opposite to where it
supposed<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.770> be<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.390> solved

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
supposed to be and this is solved

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.610 
supposed to be and this is solved
correctly<00:03:25.570> relative<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.260> word<00:03:26.350> supposed<00:03:26.470> to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
correctly relative to word supposed to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.320 
correctly relative to word supposed to
be<00:03:26.710> and<00:03:26.860> so<00:03:27.370> what<00:03:27.490> i<00:03:27.520> can<00:03:27.670> do<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.820> i<00:03:27.970> can<00:03:28.000> put

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
be and so what i can do is i can put

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.710 
be and so what i can do is i can put
this<00:03:28.420> down<00:03:29.610> like<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.030> then<00:03:31.360> do<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> d

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
this down like that and then do a d

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.880 
this down like that and then do a d
prime<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.200> its<00:03:32.320> opposite<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.740> where<00:03:32.800> it

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
prime so that its opposite to where it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.020 
prime so that its opposite to where it
supposed<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.100> be<00:03:33.160> which<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.490> in<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.730> exact

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
supposed to be which is in the exact

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.550 
supposed to be which is in the exact
same<00:03:34.210> relative<00:03:34.540> position<00:03:34.750> as<00:03:35.110> this<00:03:35.230> one<00:03:35.410> and

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
same relative position as this one and

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.470 
same relative position as this one and
then<00:03:35.980> instead<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.250> just<00:03:36.370> doing<00:03:36.460> our<00:03:36.700> two<00:03:36.910> to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
then instead of just doing our two to

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.240 
then instead of just doing our two to
solve<00:03:37.720> tip<00:03:37.960> of<00:03:38.080> this<00:03:38.170> one<00:03:38.350> correct<00:03:38.920> relative

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
solve tip of this one correct relative

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.010 
solve tip of this one correct relative
that<00:03:39.370> one<00:03:39.460> what<00:03:39.610> i<00:03:39.640> can<00:03:39.820> do<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:39.940> r<00:03:40.240> u<00:03:40.540> prime<00:03:40.750> R

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
that one what i can do is r u prime R

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.010 
that one what i can do is r u prime R
and<00:03:41.460> so<00:03:42.460> this<00:03:42.670> one<00:03:42.850> now<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.270> also<00:03:43.480> opposite

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
and so this one now is also opposite

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.560 
and so this one now is also opposite
correct<00:03:44.490> opposite<00:03:45.490> relative<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.390> where<00:03:46.480> it's

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
correct opposite relative to where it's

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.390 
correct opposite relative to where it's
posed<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.780> be<00:03:46.870> which<00:03:46.990> is<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.200> same<00:03:47.400> relative

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
posed to be which is the same relative

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.950 
posed to be which is the same relative
position<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.120> one<00:03:49.300> so<00:03:49.390> i<00:03:49.510> can<00:03:49.690> just<00:03:49.780> solve

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
position is this one so i can just solve

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.990 
position is this one so i can just solve
that<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.260> then<00:03:50.440> do<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.590> d2<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.040> our<00:03:51.550> prime<00:03:51.760> to

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
that and then do a d2 and our prime to

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.390 
that and then do a d2 and our prime to
solve<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.270> so<00:03:52.870> while<00:03:53.200> i<00:03:53.260> was<00:03:53.350> doing<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.710> two

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
solve that so while i was doing that two

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.520 
solve that so while i was doing that two
pairs<00:03:54.700> call<00:03:54.940> my<00:03:55.030> eye<00:03:55.060> this<00:03:55.210> one<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.470> one

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
pairs call my eye this one and this one

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.350 
pairs call my eye this one and this one
and<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.830> course<00:03:57.040> this<00:03:57.280> matches<00:03:57.910> up<00:03:58.060> with<00:03:58.210> this

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
and of course this matches up with this

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.150 
and of course this matches up with this
or<00:03:58.540> about<00:03:58.660> three<00:03:59.050> pairs<00:03:59.350> already<00:03:59.680> there<00:03:59.860> I'm

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
or about three pairs already there I'm

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.260 
or about three pairs already there I'm
probably<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:00.430> gonna<00:04:00.580> do<00:04:00.760> this<00:04:01.000> one<00:04:01.150> right

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
probably just gonna do this one right

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.460 
probably just gonna do this one right
here<00:04:01.330> because<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:01.810> really<00:04:01.900> really<00:04:02.140> obvious

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
here because it's really really obvious

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.750 
here because it's really really obvious
so<00:04:02.590> it's<00:04:02.710> just<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:02.950> prime<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.310> then<00:04:03.400> sexy

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
so it's just you prime and then sexy

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.450 
so it's just you prime and then sexy
move<00:04:03.910> three<00:04:04.120> times<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:05.500> then<00:04:05.710> next<00:04:05.980> I've<00:04:06.310> got

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
move three times and then next I've got

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.610 
move three times and then next I've got
these<00:04:06.640> two<00:04:06.910> which<00:04:07.390> is<00:04:07.600> also<00:04:07.870> really<00:04:08.140> easy<00:04:08.260> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
these two which is also really easy and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.040 
these two which is also really easy and
does<00:04:08.800> not<00:04:08.950> require<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.310> rotation<00:04:09.820> so<00:04:10.480> it's<00:04:10.900> just

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
does not require a rotation so it's just

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.430 
does not require a rotation so it's just
paired<00:04:11.590> like<00:04:11.770> that<00:04:11.950> youtube<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.550> then<00:04:12.640> insert

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
paired like that youtube and then insert

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.900 
paired like that youtube and then insert
and<00:04:14.440> then<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:14.950> fact<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:15.520> one<00:04:15.730> requires

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
and then in fact this one requires

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.160 
and then in fact this one requires
rotation<00:04:16.480> so<00:04:16.570> I'm<00:04:16.630> going<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.780> save<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:16.989> till

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
rotation so I'm going to save it till

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.900 
rotation so I'm going to save it till
the<00:04:17.260> end<00:04:17.440> because<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.859> try<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.130> avoid<00:04:18.310> rotation

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
the end because I try to avoid rotation

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.150 
the end because I try to avoid rotation
from<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.090> can<00:04:19.270> so<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:19.810> this<00:04:20.140> one<00:04:20.320> pair<00:04:20.650> sorry

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
from I can so that this one pair sorry

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.330 
from I can so that this one pair sorry
I'm<00:04:21.340> solving<00:04:21.729> this<00:04:21.940> pair<00:04:22.150> right<00:04:22.180> here<00:04:22.330> and

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
I'm solving this pair right here and

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.950 
I'm solving this pair right here and
just<00:04:24.340> lu<00:04:24.640> two<00:04:24.760> L<00:04:24.880> prime<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.450> too<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:25.840> then

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
just lu two L prime you too and then

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.939 
just lu two L prime you too and then
insert

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
insert

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.709 
insert
and<00:04:27.949> now<00:04:28.189> this<00:04:28.490> one<00:04:28.699> pretty<00:04:28.999> easy<00:04:29.270> it's<00:04:29.539> just

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:29.719 
and now this one pretty easy it's just

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.909 
and now this one pretty easy it's just
are<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:29.870> two<00:04:30.050> are<00:04:30.169> five<00:04:30.349> and<00:04:30.499> then<00:04:30.650> justify

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
are you two are five and then justify

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.249 
are you two are five and then justify
juice<00:04:31.219> sledgehammer<00:04:31.610> in<00:04:32.030> order<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.330> get<00:04:32.449> edges

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
juice sledgehammer in order to get edges

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.989 
juice sledgehammer in order to get edges
only<00:04:33.469> case<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.830> now<00:04:33.889> I<00:04:33.919> do<00:04:34.129> see<00:04:34.490> oll<00:04:34.789> here

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:34.999 
only case and now I do see oll here

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:36.850 
only case and now I do see oll here
because<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.330> know<00:04:35.539> it<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.110> pretty<00:04:36.620> fast

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
because I know it and it's pretty fast

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.860 
because I know it and it's pretty fast
and<00:04:38.289> then<00:04:39.289> I'm<00:04:39.439> just<00:04:39.529> going<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.740> be<00:04:39.830> from<00:04:40.870> okay

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
and then I'm just going to be from okay

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.730 
and then I'm just going to be from okay
let's<00:04:42.199> do<00:04:42.439> one<00:04:42.770> more<00:04:42.800> oh<00:04:44.110> geez<00:04:45.110> pop<00:04:45.349> okay

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
let's do one more oh geez pop okay

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.110 
let's do one more oh geez pop okay
that's<00:04:45.919> not<00:04:46.009> good<00:04:46.189> okay<00:04:46.729> i<00:04:46.759> think<00:04:46.849> that<00:04:47.090> i

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
that's not good okay i think that i

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.760 
that's not good okay i think that i
scramble<00:04:47.449> that<00:04:47.539> one<00:04:47.659> wrong<00:04:47.779> but<00:04:48.080> here<00:04:48.590> we<00:04:48.650> go

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
scramble that one wrong but here we go

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.899 
scramble that one wrong but here we go
this<00:04:48.949> piece<00:04:49.129> has<00:04:49.219> already<00:04:49.340> solved<00:04:49.669> which<00:04:49.759> is

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
this piece has already solved which is

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.820 
this piece has already solved which is
nice<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.569> boo<00:04:50.900> interesting<00:04:51.379> could

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
nice and this boo interesting could

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.230 
nice and this boo interesting could
probably<00:04:52.009> pull<00:04:52.249> off<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.370> nice<00:04:52.550> x<00:04:52.789> cross<00:04:53.029> here

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
probably pull off a nice x cross here

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.369 
probably pull off a nice x cross here
and<00:04:53.389> then<00:04:53.479> this<00:04:53.509> is<00:04:53.719> in<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.020> bottom<00:04:54.139> layer

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
and then this is in the bottom layer

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.080 
and then this is in the bottom layer
which<00:04:54.560> means<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.800> i<00:04:54.889> can<00:04:54.949> line<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.520> up<00:04:55.699> right

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
which means that i can line it up right

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.909 
which means that i can line it up right
there<00:04:56.270> with<00:04:56.479> just<00:04:56.659> d<00:04:56.870> moves<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.229> this<00:04:57.590> corner

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
there with just d moves and this corner

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.010 
there with just d moves and this corner
is<00:04:57.949> solved<00:04:58.789> is<00:04:58.939> attached<00:04:59.449> I've<00:04:59.659> got<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.779> corner

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
is solved is attached I've got a corner

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.619 
is solved is attached I've got a corner
HP<00:05:00.199> here<00:05:00.379> so<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:00.889> can<00:05:01.039> probably<00:05:01.189> do<00:05:01.400> is<00:05:01.580> do<00:05:02.000> dr

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
HP here so I can probably do is do dr

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.279 
HP here so I can probably do is do dr
prime<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.500> make<00:05:03.710> this<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:04.159> 1<00:05:04.639> x<00:05:04.789> 2<00:05:04.819> x<00:05:05.120> 1<00:05:05.240> block<00:05:05.719> D<00:05:06.110> 2

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
prime to make this a 1 x 2 x 1 block D 2

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.050 
prime to make this a 1 x 2 x 1 block D 2
and<00:05:06.469> then<00:05:06.949> do<00:05:07.039> an<00:05:07.159> F<00:05:07.340> move<00:05:07.610> which<00:05:07.849> not<00:05:08.029> only

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
and then do an F move which not only

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.779 
and then do an F move which not only
lines<00:05:08.449> that<00:05:08.659> up<00:05:08.810> but<00:05:09.139> also<00:05:09.319> puts<00:05:09.979> this<00:05:10.189> edge<00:05:10.460> in

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
lines that up but also puts this edge in

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.939 
lines that up but also puts this edge in
so<00:05:10.939> i<00:05:10.969> can<00:05:11.150> do<00:05:11.240> dr<00:05:11.599> prime<00:05:11.840> and<00:05:12.050> i've<00:05:12.139> got<00:05:12.349> a<00:05:12.560> two

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
so i can do dr prime and i've got a two

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.950 
so i can do dr prime and i've got a two
by<00:05:13.129> two<00:05:13.430> by<00:05:13.550> two<00:05:13.669> block<00:05:14.000> plus<00:05:14.240> this<00:05:14.479> edge<00:05:14.719> and

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
by two by two block plus this edge and

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.719 
by two by two block plus this edge and
then<00:05:15.469> solving<00:05:16.039> this<00:05:16.129> edge<00:05:16.279> is<00:05:16.310> pretty<00:05:16.550> easy

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
then solving this edge is pretty easy

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.550 
then solving this edge is pretty easy
and<00:05:17.000> as<00:05:17.240> i'm<00:05:17.419> inserting<00:05:17.659> that<00:05:17.870> this<00:05:18.199> catches

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
and as i'm inserting that this catches

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.019 
and as i'm inserting that this catches
my<00:05:18.710> eye<00:05:18.740> which<00:05:19.009> is<00:05:19.129> just<00:05:19.250> an<00:05:19.370> easy<00:05:19.520> pair<00:05:19.819> like

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:20.029 
my eye which is just an easy pair like

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.829 
my eye which is just an easy pair like
that<00:05:20.979> so<00:05:21.979> i<00:05:22.009> can<00:05:22.250> just<00:05:22.490> insert<00:05:23.479> it<00:05:23.569> like<00:05:23.719> that

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:23.839 
that so i can just insert it like that

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.899 
that so i can just insert it like that
so<00:05:24.139> that<00:05:24.259> it<00:05:24.289> doesn't<00:05:24.499> affect<00:05:25.039> this<00:05:25.249> and<00:05:25.580> as

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
so that it doesn't affect this and as

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.459 
so that it doesn't affect this and as
i'm<00:05:26.029> doing<00:05:26.120> this<00:05:26.330> this<00:05:26.629> corner<00:05:27.080> catches<00:05:27.229> my

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
i'm doing this this corner catches my

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:28.510 
i'm doing this this corner catches my
eye<00:05:27.499> because<00:05:27.650> it<00:05:27.800> max<00:05:27.979> you<00:05:28.039> put<00:05:28.189> this<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.490> i

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
eye because it max you put this and i

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.879 
eye because it max you put this and i
notice<00:05:28.789> that<00:05:28.939> this<00:05:29.060> is<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.569> flip<00:05:30.319> in<00:05:30.529> its<00:05:30.650> spot

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
notice that this is a flip in its spot

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.679 
notice that this is a flip in its spot
so<00:05:31.250> i<00:05:31.279> can<00:05:31.610> just<00:05:31.729> solve<00:05:31.939> this<00:05:32.150> pair<00:05:32.360> sewickley

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689 
so i can just solve this pair sewickley

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.950 
so i can just solve this pair sewickley
and<00:05:33.520> then<00:05:34.520> this<00:05:34.909> is<00:05:35.000> pretty<00:05:35.210> easy<00:05:35.449> right<00:05:35.689> here

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
and then this is pretty easy right here

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.219 
and then this is pretty easy right here
just<00:05:36.229> like<00:05:36.379> that<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:37.089> now<00:05:38.089> in<00:05:38.419> order<00:05:38.569> to<00:05:38.689> just

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
just like that and now in order to just

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.990 
just like that and now in order to just
get<00:05:39.439> an<00:05:39.560> edge<00:05:39.680> like<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:40.129> could<00:05:40.279> do<00:05:40.699> something

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
get an edge like you could do something

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.499 
get an edge like you could do something
that<00:05:41.240> would<00:05:41.389> uh<00:05:42.669> what<00:05:43.669> was<00:05:43.819> I<00:05:43.909> you<00:05:44.270> could<00:05:44.419> do

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
that would uh what was I you could do

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.480 
that would uh what was I you could do
something<00:05:44.750> weird<00:05:45.199> that<00:05:45.439> would<00:05:45.589> probably<00:05:46.310> not

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
something weird that would probably not

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.240 
something weird that would probably not
that<00:05:47.000> would<00:05:47.120> not<00:05:47.240> guarantee<00:05:47.719> you<00:05:48.259> I<00:05:48.469> guess<00:05:48.949> and

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
that would not guarantee you I guess and

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.939 
that would not guarantee you I guess and
all<00:05:50.060> edges<00:05:50.419> like<00:05:50.810> a<00:05:50.839> corners<00:05:51.199> only<00:05:51.409> case<00:05:51.560> oll

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
all edges like a corners only case oll

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.980 
all edges like a corners only case oll
so<00:05:52.069> I<00:05:52.099> just<00:05:52.399> do<00:05:52.909> that<00:05:53.060> even<00:05:53.539> though<00:05:53.629> it<00:05:53.659> would

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
so I just do that even though it would

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.389 
so I just do that even though it would
require<00:05:54.199> more<00:05:54.589> moves<00:05:54.800> just<00:05:54.979> because<00:05:55.219> it<00:05:55.310> will

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:55.399 
require more moves just because it will

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:57.459 
require more moves just because it will
give<00:05:55.430> me<00:05:55.669> an<00:05:56.270> edge<00:05:56.629> is<00:05:56.779> only<00:05:56.960> case<00:05:57.169> and<00:05:57.349> now<00:05:57.439> I

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469 
give me an edge is only case and now I

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:58.779 
give me an edge is only case and now I
see<00:05:57.800> here<00:05:58.009> that<00:05:58.039> I've<00:05:58.250> got<00:05:58.339> to<00:05:58.430> see<00:05:58.550> you<00:05:58.610> ll

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
see here that I've got to see you ll

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.129 
see here that I've got to see you ll
case<00:05:58.969> this<00:05:59.210> one's<00:05:59.389> pretty<00:05:59.509> nice<00:05:59.750> because<00:06:00.020> it

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
case this one's pretty nice because it

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.659 
case this one's pretty nice because it
preserves<00:06:00.289> all<00:06:00.710> this<00:06:00.889> block<00:06:01.069> of<00:06:01.099> pieces<00:06:01.520> and

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
preserves all this block of pieces and

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.459 
preserves all this block of pieces and
so<00:06:02.120> just<00:06:02.360> looking<00:06:02.719> at<00:06:02.839> this<00:06:02.930> oh<00:06:03.080> I<00:06:03.409> know

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469 
so just looking at this oh I know

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.969 
so just looking at this oh I know
exactly<00:06:03.740> what<00:06:04.370> um<00:06:05.000> II<00:06:05.750> PLL<00:06:06.620> I'm<00:06:06.710> gonna<00:06:06.860> get

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
exactly what um II PLL I'm gonna get

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.469 
exactly what um II PLL I'm gonna get
what<00:06:07.099> PLL<00:06:07.460> magana<00:06:07.759> and<00:06:07.969> that's<00:06:08.210> gonna<00:06:08.300> be<00:06:08.449> a

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
what PLL magana and that's gonna be a

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.969 
what PLL magana and that's gonna be a
counterclockwise<00:06:08.930> you<00:06:09.379> perm<00:06:09.589> with<00:06:09.830> the

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
counterclockwise you perm with the

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.480 
counterclockwise you perm with the
yellow<00:06:10.279> bar<00:06:10.490> solved<00:06:10.969> so<00:06:11.330> I<00:06:11.360> do<00:06:11.449> my<00:06:12.399> it's<00:06:13.399> all

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
yellow bar solved so I do my it's all

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.139 
yellow bar solved so I do my it's all
right<00:06:13.639> there<00:06:13.789> and<00:06:14.000> I<00:06:14.270> see<00:06:14.569> this<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:14.990> so<00:06:16.120> what<00:06:17.120> I

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:17.149 
right there and I see this and so what I

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:20.230 
right there and I see this and so what I
probably<00:06:17.419> do<00:06:17.599> since<00:06:18.020> this<00:06:18.580> co<00:06:19.580> algorithm

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
probably do since this co algorithm

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.089 
probably do since this co algorithm
actually<00:06:20.360> ends<00:06:20.810> in<00:06:20.870> an<00:06:20.960> r2<00:06:21.289> and<00:06:21.500> the<00:06:21.740> you<00:06:21.860> perm

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
actually ends in an r2 and the you perm

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:23.709 
actually ends in an r2 and the you perm
actually<00:06:22.580> starts<00:06:22.849> in<00:06:22.939> an<00:06:23.029> r2<00:06:23.270> I<00:06:23.300> could<00:06:23.509> cancel

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
actually starts in an r2 I could cancel

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:27.610 
actually starts in an r2 I could cancel
so<00:06:24.289> I<00:06:24.319> do<00:06:24.409> this<00:06:24.649> and<00:06:24.909> then<00:06:25.909> I<00:06:26.439> canceled<00:06:27.439> it<00:06:27.500> all

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
so I do this and then I canceled it all

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.159 
so I do this and then I canceled it all
into<00:06:27.919> one<00:06:28.129> algorithm<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:29.629> that<00:06:29.659> was<00:06:29.899> some

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
into one algorithm so that was some

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.269 
into one algorithm so that was some
walkthrough<00:06:30.680> souls<00:06:30.889> by<00:06:31.330> me<00:06:32.330> I<00:06:32.539> average<00:06:33.229> mid<00:06:33.770> 11

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
walkthrough souls by me I average mid 11

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.909 
walkthrough souls by me I average mid 11
so<00:06:34.610> just<00:06:35.000> barely<00:06:35.330> sub<00:06:35.690> 12<00:06:35.959> although<00:06:36.409> I<00:06:36.440> failed

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
so just barely sub 12 although I failed

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.879 
so just barely sub 12 although I failed
in<00:06:37.159> competition<00:06:37.699> in<00:06:38.269> three<00:06:38.539> by<00:06:38.659> three

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:39.889 
in competition in three by three

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.050 
in competition in three by three
