so don't see where it shows all about
space<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.840> we're<00:01:58.020> trying<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
space so what we're trying to do is

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.360 
space so what we're trying to do is
recreate<00:01:59.510> starts<00:02:00.510> case<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:01.220> one<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
recreate starts case and one of the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
just use the bubbles and more backlight

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250 
just use the bubbles and more backlight
it<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.490> UV<00:02:11.850> light<00:02:12.120> hopefully<00:02:12.780> create<00:02:13.080> little

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
it with UV light hopefully create little

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:29.450 
it with UV light hopefully create little
mini<00:02:13.740> starscapes<00:02:27.650> think<00:02:28.650> around<00:02:28.830> space<00:02:29.190> it's

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
mini starscapes think around space it's

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.740 
mini starscapes think around space it's
quite<00:02:29.640> hard<00:02:29.790> because<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.090> want<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.330> travel<00:02:30.540> to

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
quite hard because you want to travel to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.050 
quite hard because you want to travel to
space<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.260> want<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.590> record<00:02:31.890> all<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.280> with

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
space you want to record all this with

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.350 
space you want to record all this with
this<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:34.170> know<00:02:34.290> universe<00:02:34.710> ism<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
this you know universe ism and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.300 
this you know universe ism and
starscapes<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.600> different<00:02:36.900> things<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.350> it's

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
starscapes and different things and it's

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.940 
starscapes and different things and it's
quite<00:02:38.700> hard<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.780> grasp<00:02:40.050> how<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.530> might

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
quite hard to grasp how you might

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.800 
quite hard to grasp how you might
capture<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.150> things<00:02:42.360> that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
capture that so one of the things that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.870 
capture that so one of the things that
is<00:02:42.990> quite<00:02:43.470> often<00:02:43.620> good<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.920> do<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
is quite often good to do is do the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.420 
is quite often good to do is do the
reverse<00:02:45.180> instead<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.690> doing<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.260> big<00:02:46.470> universal

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
reverse instead of doing a big universal

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.250 
reverse instead of doing a big universal
thing<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.120> sort<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.660> take<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.930> down<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
thing you sort of take it down to the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.000 
thing you sort of take it down to the
macro<00:02:49.680> micro<00:02:50.010> level<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.260> Thomas<00:02:52.260> who's<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
macro micro level and Thomas who's I

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.150 
macro micro level and Thomas who's I
collaborate<00:02:53.970> with<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> lot<00:02:54.590> he<00:02:55.590> was<00:02:55.950> playing

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
collaborate with a lot he was playing

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.949 
collaborate with a lot he was playing
around<00:02:56.340> with<00:02:56.459> these<00:02:56.640> UV<00:02:57.030> lights<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.600> bubbles

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
around with these UV lights and bubbles

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.070 
around with these UV lights and bubbles
and<00:02:58.170> different<00:02:58.470> things<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.810> they<00:03:00.810> came<00:03:01.020> up

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
and different things and they came up

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.949 
and different things and they came up
with<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.410> amazing<00:03:01.709> idea<00:03:02.280> around<00:03:02.959> shooting

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
with this amazing idea around shooting

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.350 
with this amazing idea around shooting
UV<00:03:04.290> lights<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.640> started<00:03:05.700> playing<00:03:06.180> with

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
UV lights and so we started playing with

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.870 
UV lights and so we started playing with
that<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:07.110> was<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.440> some<00:03:07.700> guess<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:08.850> just

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
that and it was just some guess we just

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:27.480 
that and it was just some guess we just
experiment<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.020> know<00:03:10.140> it's<00:03:10.500> playful

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.250 

it's<00:03:28.490> really<00:03:28.670> exciting<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.270> have<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.480> love<00:03:30.230> of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
it's really exciting I have a love of

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.710 
it's really exciting I have a love of
space<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.040> do<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:31.880> lot<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.060> time<00:03:32.300> lapse<00:03:32.510> with

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
space and do a lot of time lapse with

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.440 
space and do a lot of time lapse with
stars<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:33.760> love<00:03:34.760> anything<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.209> do<00:03:35.300> with<00:03:35.390> the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
stars and love anything to do with the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.130 
stars and love anything to do with the
universe<00:03:35.810> really<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:38.180> there's<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.989> really

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
universe really and so there's a really

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.800 
universe really and so there's a really
great<00:03:39.560> opportunity<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:41.000> try<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.660> enhance

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
great opportunity to to try to enhance

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.990 
great opportunity to to try to enhance
or<00:03:42.319> work<00:03:42.890> with<00:03:43.100> what<00:03:43.280> she's<00:03:43.489> doing<00:03:43.730> on<00:03:43.850> this
