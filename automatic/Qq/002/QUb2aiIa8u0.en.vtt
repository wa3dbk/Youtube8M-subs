00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.510
 that inside I already warned you that I did not 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.390
 I wanted to work a lot inside 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.000
 They are very very very bland but good 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.000
 Memora taught that as you can see 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.100
 bent but good 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.150
 this is the first the east effect of 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.150
 I liked water very much 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.320
 the second one is pretty 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.830

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.450
 It was a lot of TV in every house here 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.030
 the balcony 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 and the second one does not come in has a way 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.880
 to enter different 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.189
 neither the security of the two there that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.689
 you have the first one as you can see 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.729
 has the entrance a little high to the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.140
 second is flat and is therefore iker and other 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.240
 for him from the side 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.180
 it's generic the pool down like 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.160
