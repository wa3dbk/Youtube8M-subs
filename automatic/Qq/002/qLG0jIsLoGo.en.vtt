00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.969
 one hour yet to clarify that among the half a million young people who 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.509
 two weeks ago he presented the tests know of the icfes those of questions 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.890
 identical to those of pressing and official in the simulations that took place 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.100
 fifteen days before in these days and the prosecutor's office investigated the Julian case 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.170
 martínez following many complainants is Professor Walter Abondano 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.770
 which is strange because he himself presented the exam and when he went 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.369
 half the room he was doing all the students answered more 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.829
 quick that teachers 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.149
 kuester abondano vice chancellor of a private school north of bogota 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.900
 who presented the celestial exams on September 4 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.240
 to update his knowledge he said that during the presentation of 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.870
 questionnaire a strangely the room was left alone in a short time but with 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.679
 the tension that 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.150
 some students albil 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.120
 never really fast 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.190
 i the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.510
 being that one listens to comment when we leave the exam will go 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.309
 that how much you wish you already know those questions fifteen days before you 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.030
 more than 550 thousand students will present the state tests 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.950
 some colleges knew the questions that he and that if the formula 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 of this semester 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.690
 the filtering of the questionnaire was confirmed by the director of the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.170
 institute we receive some complaints 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.119
 of citizens anonymous complaints unfortunately 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.220
 It is very difficult 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310
 follow and ratify 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.159
 where we are not shown 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.340
 that some exam questions 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.890
 could have been driven by students who showed up the room 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.000
 September however he added that he can not confirm the responsibility 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.259
 of the icfes 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.299
 nor that some of the officials of the institute have leaked to the questions 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.119
 that some schools in Cali, Barranquilla and Bucaramanga, obtained 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 but it ensures that as determined by a statistical analysis 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.529
 - Results with a view to identifying pending 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.810
 in the known in advance the questions 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.040
 and reduce the effect that this can have on the final grade the teacher 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.580
 Álvaro suggests that the same schools with a view to rangers among the best 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.820
 could have stimulated fraud its adjoining with order 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.070
 the exams 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.390
 it does not make any sense and nevertheless the quality of the school 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.219
 they live by the results of interest the investigation is in charge of the 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.170
 cti prosecutor's office and the das
