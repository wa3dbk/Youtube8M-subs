00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
of course somebody shoots him down but

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.799 
of course somebody shoots him down but
that<00:00:55.280> rarely<00:00:55.460> happens<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:59.210> here<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.629> the

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
that rarely happens and here is the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.689 
that rarely happens and here is the
police<00:01:00.019> helicopter<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.069> it<00:01:01.309> looks<00:01:01.460> pretty

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
police helicopter and it looks pretty

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.340 
police helicopter and it looks pretty
good<00:01:01.969> you<00:01:02.600> know<00:01:02.629> think<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:02.839> don't<00:01:02.899> like<00:01:03.109> all<00:01:03.260> the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
good you know think I don't like all the

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.750 
good you know think I don't like all the
rotors<00:01:03.679> because<00:01:04.010> I'm<00:01:04.129> not<00:01:04.250> really<00:01:04.370> fond<00:01:04.670> of

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
rotors because I'm not really fond of

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.850 
rotors because I'm not really fond of
this<00:01:04.909> particular<00:01:05.509> design<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.649> there<00:01:06.770> are

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
this particular design but there are

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.200 
this particular design but there are
some<00:01:07.009> benefits<00:01:07.189> to<00:01:07.549> it<00:01:07.640> because<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.119> can

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
some benefits to it because you can

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.999 
some benefits to it because you can
always<00:01:08.299> bend<00:01:08.810> these<00:01:08.960> downward<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.560> and

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
always bend these downward like this and

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.920 
always bend these downward like this and
it<00:01:10.310> makes<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.579> easier<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.939> travel<00:01:11.210> behind<00:01:11.810> the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
it makes it easier to travel behind the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.810 
it makes it easier to travel behind the
trailer<00:01:12.380> going<00:01:12.770> through<00:01:12.979> tunnels<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.579> other

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
trailer going through tunnels and other

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.929 
trailer going through tunnels and other
narrow<00:01:14.119> passageways<00:01:14.979> but<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.700> other<00:01:16.820> problem

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
narrow passageways but the other problem

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.209 
narrow passageways but the other problem
if<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:17.659> when<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.930> spin<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:18.380> you

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
if this is that when you spin this you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.649 
if this is that when you spin this you
have<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> chance<00:01:19.549> of<00:01:19.759> hitting<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.180> tail<00:01:20.420> there

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
have a chance of hitting the tail there

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.600 
have a chance of hitting the tail there
which<00:01:21.469> in<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:21.920> long<00:01:22.130> run<00:01:22.340> you'll<00:01:22.490> probably

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
which in the long run you'll probably

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.069 
which in the long run you'll probably
put<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.850> dent<00:01:23.090> there<00:01:23.240> which<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:23.600> not<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:23.899> great

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
put a dent there which is not that great

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.719 
put a dent there which is not that great
so<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.860> might<00:01:25.009> want<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.189> keep<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.369> in<00:01:25.430> mind

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
so you might want to keep that in mind

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.940 
so you might want to keep that in mind
before<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:26.030> spin<00:01:26.299> this<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:26.930> much<00:01:27.110> anyway

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
before you spin this so much anyway

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.249 
before you spin this so much anyway
here's<00:01:28.219> the<00:01:28.340> view<00:01:28.520> from<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.820> side<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.570> before

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
here's the view from the side and before

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.630 
here's the view from the side and before
I<00:01:30.439> continue<00:01:30.590> there's<00:01:31.009> actually<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> lot<00:01:31.610> of

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
I continue there's actually a lot of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.090 
I continue there's actually a lot of
stickers<00:01:32.060> on<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:32.509> thing<00:01:32.719> and<00:01:33.039> instead<00:01:34.039> of

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
stickers on this thing and instead of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.590 
stickers on this thing and instead of
telling<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.430> where<00:01:34.520> they<00:01:34.670> go<00:01:34.909> I'm<00:01:35.329> better<00:01:35.539> off

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
telling you where they go I'm better off

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.660 
telling you where they go I'm better off
showing<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:35.899> guys<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.049> picture<00:01:36.469> we<00:01:37.340> get<00:01:37.460> them

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
really recommend putting inside and the

really recommend putting inside and the
weird<00:02:20.110> thing<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.710> are<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.040> supposed

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
weird thing is is that are you supposed

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.950 
weird thing is is that are you supposed
to<00:02:21.400> land<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.850> helicopter<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.510> then<00:02:22.660> take<00:02:22.870> the

to land a helicopter and then take the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.780 
to land a helicopter and then take the
handcuffs<00:02:23.170> out<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.560> catch<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.920> robber<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.400> mean

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
handcuffs out to catch the robber I mean

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.180 
handcuffs out to catch the robber I mean
doesn't<00:02:25.240> seem<00:02:25.450> very<00:02:25.480> practical<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.500> over<00:02:27.100> on

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
doesn't seem very practical and over on

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.430 
doesn't seem very practical and over on
this<00:02:27.280> side<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:27.640> binoculars<00:02:28.210> which<00:02:29.050> I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
this side we have binoculars which I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.600 
this side we have binoculars which I
don't<00:02:29.710> think<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:29.950> really<00:02:30.040> need<00:02:30.250> because<00:02:30.370> you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
don't think you really need because you

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.890 
don't think you really need because you
have<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.820> camera<00:02:31.090> right<00:02:31.240> there<00:02:31.270> I'm<00:02:31.690> pretty

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
have the camera right there I'm pretty

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.550 
have the camera right there I'm pretty
sure<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.200> has<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.350> zoom<00:02:32.620> feature<00:02:33.210> anyway<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:35.530> a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
sure it has a zoom feature anyway it's a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.680 
sure it has a zoom feature anyway it's a
little<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:35.830> pilot<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.220> there<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:37.660> should

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
little the pilot in there you should

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.320 
little the pilot in there you should
take<00:02:38.080> off<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.800> roof<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.910> windshield

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
take off the roof and the windshield

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.660 
take off the roof and the windshield
this<00:02:40.630> Way's<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> little<00:02:41.050> easier<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:42.520> just

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
this Way's a little easier and you just

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.310 
this Way's a little easier and you just
pop<00:02:42.850> them<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.120> there<00:02:43.270> those<00:02:43.690> other<00:02:43.930> controls

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
pop them in there those other controls

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.980 
pop them in there those other controls
there's<00:02:44.620> no<00:02:44.740> joystick<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:46.480> there<00:02:47.440> we<00:02:47.530> go

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
there's no joystick and there we go

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
there's no joystick and there we go
there's<00:02:49.990> quite<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> bit<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.440> work<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.560> put<00:02:50.920> them

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
there's quite a bit of work to put them

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.440 
there's quite a bit of work to put them
in<00:02:51.100> there<00:02:51.250> but<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.580> really<00:02:51.700> not<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.030> bad

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
in there but it's really not that bad

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.680 
in there but it's really not that bad
and<00:02:52.660> there<00:02:53.350> we<00:02:53.440> go<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.980> now<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:55.209> can<00:02:55.390> move<00:02:55.480> on

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
and there we go and now we can move on

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.430 
and there we go and now we can move on
to<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.110> recommendations<00:02:58.230> overall<00:02:59.230> I'd<00:02:59.410> say

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
to the recommendations overall I'd say

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.170 
to the recommendations overall I'd say
it's<00:02:59.709> an<00:02:59.770> old<00:02:59.920> case<00:03:00.130> set<00:03:00.400> when<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.820> comes<00:03:01.030> to

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
it's an old case set when it comes to

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.910 
it's an old case set when it comes to
the<00:03:01.270> valley<00:03:01.480> we<00:03:01.720> do<00:03:01.840> get<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.110> price<00:03:02.590> per<00:03:02.740> piece

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
the valley we do get a price per piece

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.190 
the valley we do get a price per piece
ratio<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.490> 10<00:03:03.670> cents<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:04.000> piece<00:03:04.180> but<00:03:04.900> when<00:03:05.110> you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
ratio of 10 cents a piece but when you

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.540 
ratio of 10 cents a piece but when you
look<00:03:05.320> at<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.500> value<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.920> parts<00:03:06.280> it

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
look at the value of the parts it

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.890 
look at the value of the parts it
actually<00:03:06.820> comes<00:03:07.000> out<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.180> around<00:03:07.360> seven<00:03:07.810> to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
actually comes out to around seven to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.630 
actually comes out to around seven to
nine<00:03:08.050> dollars<00:03:08.230> in<00:03:08.500> total<00:03:08.620> not<00:03:09.130> including<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.490> me

nine dollars in total not including a me

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.250 
nine dollars in total not including a me
figure<00:03:09.940> which<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.300> actually<00:03:10.600> pretty<00:03:10.810> bad<00:03:11.020> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
figure which is actually pretty bad and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.900 
figure which is actually pretty bad and
the<00:03:11.770> reason<00:03:12.070> why<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.220> because<00:03:12.280> we<00:03:12.610> do<00:03:12.700> get<00:03:12.880> a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
the reason why is because we do get a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.520 
the reason why is because we do get a
fair<00:03:13.150> amount<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.450> small<00:03:13.690> pieces<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:14.320> set

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
fair amount of small pieces in this set

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.590 
fair amount of small pieces in this set
but<00:03:15.310> given<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.610> this<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.150> ten<00:03:16.420> dollar

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
but given that this is in the ten dollar

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.060 
but given that this is in the ten dollar
range<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.290> would<00:03:17.410> actually<00:03:17.530> make<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.830> pretty

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
range it would actually make a pretty

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.070 
range it would actually make a pretty
decent<00:03:18.370> gift<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.030> when<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.600> comes<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.900> play

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
decent gift and when it comes to a play

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.630 
decent gift and when it comes to a play
value<00:03:20.290> I'd<00:03:20.739> say<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.070> pretty<00:03:21.190> good<00:03:21.430> I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
value I'd say it's pretty good I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.370 
value I'd say it's pretty good I
personally<00:03:22.420> find<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.810> all<00:03:23.019> police

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
personally find that all police

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.900 
personally find that all police
helicopters<00:03:23.950> are<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.130> lot<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.400> fun<00:03:24.610> especially

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
helicopters are a lot of fun especially

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.340 
helicopters are a lot of fun especially
this<00:03:25.420> one<00:03:25.600> because<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:25.959> have<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.170> really

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
this one because we have that really

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.470 
this one because we have that really
cool<00:03:26.590> camera<00:03:26.950> on<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.250> side<00:03:27.430> there<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.760> you

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
cool camera on the side there and you

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.030 
cool camera on the side there and you
can<00:03:28.600> use<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.200> record<00:03:29.530> all<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.680> your<00:03:29.739> high

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
can use that to record all of your high

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.470 
can use that to record all of your high
speed<00:03:30.100> car<00:03:30.610> chases<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.209> then<00:03:31.330> you<00:03:31.390> can

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
speed car chases and then you can

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.420 
speed car chases and then you can
broadcast<00:03:31.690> out<00:03:32.080> on<00:03:32.230> cops<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.190> can<00:03:33.310> see

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
broadcast out on cops and you can see

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.070 
broadcast out on cops and you can see
where<00:03:33.580> that's<00:03:33.730> going<00:03:33.880> we<00:03:34.690> also<00:03:34.840> get<00:03:35.050> some

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
where that's going we also get some

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.600 
where that's going we also get some
minor<00:03:35.350> accessories<00:03:35.830> they<00:03:35.920> go<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.160> me<00:03:36.280> figure

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
minor accessories they go to me figure

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.160 
minor accessories they go to me figure
so<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.060> don't<00:03:37.390> play<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.540> as<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.810> standalone

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
so you don't play that as a standalone

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.740 
so you don't play that as a standalone
that's<00:03:38.620> fine<00:03:38.800> too<00:03:39.040> but<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:40.090> main<00:03:40.269> reason<00:03:40.300> why

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
that's fine too but the main reason why

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.540 
that's fine too but the main reason why
I<00:03:40.780> got<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.290> helicopter<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.489> will

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
I got this helicopter is so that it will

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.280 
I got this helicopter is so that it will
sit<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:42.790> top<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:43.150> my<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.330> it<00:03:43.600> I<00:03:43.660> was<00:03:43.750> 11<00:03:44.080> police

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
sit on top of my to it I was 11 police

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.560 
sit on top of my to it I was 11 police
station<00:03:44.680> which<00:03:45.400> as<00:03:45.670> many<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.209> might<00:03:46.390> know

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
station which as many of you might know

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.240 
station which as many of you might know
this<00:03:47.049> set<00:03:47.320> didn't<00:03:47.620> actually<00:03:47.799> cover<00:03:48.130> the

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
this set didn't actually cover the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.560 
this set didn't actually cover the
helicopter<00:03:48.730> but<00:03:48.910> yet<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.239> came<00:03:49.390> with<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
helicopter but yet it came with the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.539 
helicopter but yet it came with the
helipad<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.260> as<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.010> can<00:03:51.100> see<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.400> two<00:03:51.519> of

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
helipad and as you can see the two of

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.500 
helipad and as you can see the two of
them<00:03:51.700> look<00:03:51.820> pretty<00:03:51.940> good<00:03:52.120> together

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
them look pretty good together

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.970 
them look pretty good together
even<00:03:52.810> though<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.019> helicopter<00:03:53.470> came<00:03:53.680> out<00:03:53.830> in

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
even though that helicopter came out in

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.759 
even though that helicopter came out in
2008<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:55.600> in<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.959> end<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.320> think<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:56.739> a

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
2008 so in the end I think it's a

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.740 
2008 so in the end I think it's a
worthwhile<00:03:56.950> set<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.430> get<00:03:57.640> but<00:03:58.390> it<00:03:58.510> can<00:03:58.630> get<00:03:58.720> a

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
worthwhile set to get but it can get a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.240 
worthwhile set to get but it can get a
discount<00:03:59.140> on<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.380> then<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.769> would<00:03:59.890> be<00:04:00.010> pretty

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
discount on it then that would be pretty

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.250 
discount on it then that would be pretty
ideal<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.820> that's<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.840> sums<00:04:02.019> up<00:04:02.140> my

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
ideal and that's it that sums up my

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.080 
ideal and that's it that sums up my
review<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.769> hope<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.370> guys<00:04:03.489> enjoyed<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.910> show
