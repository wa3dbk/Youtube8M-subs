00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.800
 hi guys in a video about cyclops i 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.050
 expressed a very bunch of exploding theory 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.420
 special hulk fans that cyclops when 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.930
 certain circumstances can it 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.660
 to kill 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.650
 duck that's how I understood some people are bad 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.840
 know comics 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.840
 but loves to drive on people who 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.760
 at least a little versed in them now 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.239
 we'll try to figure out who is right 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.340
 and why and both of you slych him 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:50.110
 in comments 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.570
 could goosebump let's start let's start with 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.930
 Cyclops or rather with his laser pointer 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.940
 which punishes the enemies of the X people this beam 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.010
 appears as a result of the fact that the self 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.260
 absorbs special energy from 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.170
 alternate universe soldered 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.479
 particles resembling photons and keeps 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.119
 her in her body eyes scott this 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.940
 a kind of portal between our and 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.070
 other worlds so when summers 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.479
 opens their releases accumulated 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.520
 photon energy outward as a result of these 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.039
 particles cause huge rays 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.440
 destructive forces as i mentioned in 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.080
 cyclop roller under charging from the sun 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.149
 increases this power many times he 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.729
 can its way through the mountain 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.130
 or surgical incinerate shot and 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.130
 before the mantle leaving wolverine without a brush 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.709
 hands and now remember that before the mantle 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.840
 easily punches the body hulka here's an example 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.209
 how logan kills hulk from within 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.660
 and then one-on-one kills 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.759
 another challenging his tummy tom comic 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.429
 100 reno logan whole hulk's string bag 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.509
 put it means that the cyclop is quite 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.459
 can hurt the hulk and seriously enough 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.149
 in world war hulk when hawk attacked 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.420
 on mutants 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.899
 cyclops a shot at it that is urine from 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.599
 hulk began to bring pieces of skin but I want 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.880
 note at that moment was night and 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.490
 solar charging in the cyclops was not and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.830
 besides, the hulk had fought with him 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.390
 wand of enemies and was in a fierce 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.550
 condition 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.459
 not what peak power means and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.310
 significant strength of the skin compared 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.830
 with a calm state we go further 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.370
 when did his phoenix last hit 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.470
 on the ground and and owned cyclo after 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.100
 how phoenix and cyclops shared each other 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.170
 wet Cyclops increased now he is not 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.450
 can control the shape of his teaching 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.080
 but he became much more powerful than 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.540
 earlier in the first issue of the x-man antenna 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.930
 he is alone the custody of the guards who 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.459
 consisted of adamanty and now remember 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.730
 my theory from the roller 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.769
 what if and cyclops special armor 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.620
 which accumulates solar energy then 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.450
 the power of cha will increase several times and how 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.269
 do you understand the hulk cyclops 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.260
 imagine for comparison 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.120
 laser cuts an apple and before cyclops 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.360
 hulk beats before he 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.180
 angry and worth more because he 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.880
 strategist and experienced fighter and knows 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.709
 strengths and weaknesses hulk yes and in 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.750
 principle any character could kill 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.570
 hulk as did deadpool 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.600
 everyone is driving that this is not a canon and this is not 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.579
 It is considered but it is complete nonsense themselves 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.220
 blame what to do restart only 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.470
 right now even in their gaddler even comics 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.440
 50s officially considered canon 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.720
 but that's all if you liked it 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.780
 this video and you want to see 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.329
 sequel namely the battle of silver 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.930
 surfers from marvel vs goblin here and 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.480
 then put the likes under the video will be 50 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.670
 likes there will be a new release for now bye 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.319
 guys and do not belong to this force 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.319
