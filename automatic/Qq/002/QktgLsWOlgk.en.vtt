00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.310
 Friends say now emphasizes not from today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.990
 we show you a mobile phone or one 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.320
 smartphone but let us show you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.660
 a preview of the samsung galaxy camera 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.839
 the new samsung digital camera 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 with android operating system 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 we immediately open the box which like 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.180
 we see is very similar to that of one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.220
 high-end smartphones 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 not for nothing the galaxy camera will be 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.279
 distributed by the mobile division of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.619
 samsung 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.769
 he said we immediately got the box e 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.950
 First let's see what we find 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.930
 camera galaxy camera 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.149
 in this case white on the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.500
 market will be available in two colors 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:49.800
 white and in the very classic nor see it 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.260
 what else we reserve the package the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.020
 a small and quick guide of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.500
 reference to start moving i 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.559
 first steps with the camera one 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.170
 battery 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:18.030
 of course the charger with the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:20.130
 usb cable and then a wrist strap 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.790
 for for the camera 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.290
 now let's put aside the accessories e 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.240
 let us focus instead on the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.009
 camera first we detach 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.520
 immediately the film of which already is 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.030
 sees the quad core processor camera race 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.340
 and a four core GPU then 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.170
 fast, of course, this is the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.729
 front part 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 here it is here we see the objective the the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.579
 button the cursor with which you can 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.329
 zoom in and out and the key 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.840
 turning on the camera on the part 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.180
 on the coast we say in flash that yes 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.390
 active mechanically 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.620
 the little button crushes you the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.289
 flash comes out of the body of the machine 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.729
 therefore the lower part 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.170
 let's put the battery here now you see 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.170
 the battery compartment 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.120
 here you see that this is the catch that 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.640
 holds the battery 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.680
 we mark two slots in this there is the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.830
 possibility to insert a memory 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.290
 extended a micro sd here in this 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.850
 moment is not inserted instead we have the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.800
 void to regulate 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.510
 because for the sim because this is one 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.239
 camera 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.860
 of course wifi but it is also a 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.980
 device that connects to the 3g network 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.590
 so we could use it to send 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.110
 immediately our shots just taken 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.660
 made with either wifi or even 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.920
 share with contagions naturally on 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.100
 internet share them on facebook 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.620
 send them to our friends now 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:10.970
 we turn on the galaxy room and see 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.090
 that of course the device 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.090
 it takes a few seconds to start 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.989
 the software that in this case 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.989
 android 4.1 famous see also the 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.269
 very generous display a 4.8 display 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.030
 inch this one by the way one 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.650
 video camera that shoots videos in full hd 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.489
 here the software is started as I have 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.190
 shown before 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.790
 this is the zoom button look a little 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.350
 the zoom 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.030
 now of course we have out of focus 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.959
 because we are too close but to make you 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.459
 see that the zoom reaches up to 21 per 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:51.170
 here we report in the car zoom it yes 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.540
 opens the camera in this state 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.540
 naturally to the right of the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.770
 display you have the modes you can 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.720
 to select 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.800
 of the smartex automatic camera 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.150
 expert while you can go here a 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.450
 first- born you can access 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.240
 directly to the operating system that 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.840
 as I told you it is android here in here 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.810
 This practice these screens these 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.910
 viviate are not at all different from 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.200
 designed that you have on your mobile 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.890
 android as you see there is the application 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.080
 of youtube there is chrome then the 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.650
 possibility of surfing the internet there 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.720
 are the applications there are the messages 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.820
 there is the clock in short, the settings 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.880
 a real mobile phone in one 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:42.460
 digital camera is a one device 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.020
 which is already on the market since very few 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.190
 days we could say from very few hours 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.800
 at a price of 549 euros 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.220

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.870
 much sought after I tell you all that 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.590

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.260
 stored on 50gb dropbox account 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.870
 50 GB free so they can be 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.430

 can be downloaded on micro usb 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:16.060
 hence a memory extension that can 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.920
 go up to further 64 china we are 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.600
