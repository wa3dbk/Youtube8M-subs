00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.160
 Ah 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.099
 This exercise is a flat bench press now holding the barbell on a flat bench 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:25.160
 It's pushing forward. 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:30.410
 That need to be careful is always part of my hyungga my part surface cloth front chest 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:36.110
 You have to push it , you have to go back both sides of my shoulders. 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:41.150
 In this way, you have to exercise, if the front of the shoulder comes out 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:46.970
 In the downward motion of your hand, you'll be burdened by your shoulders. 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.019
 If this happens , you will not be able to lift your chest muscles and your shoulder muscles will get hurt. 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.589
 Will be available 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.699
 The part must be very careful, watch the teacher demonstrate a party demonstration window 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.540
 Would you 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.090
 Bench Press. In Procedure 3, I'll explain the basic posture. 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:05.880
 When jusigoyo hands down 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.370
 If the angle is not too low on the waist and bench as possible, 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.450
 It 's the angle of a typical bench press. 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:17.310
 It contains little to give back to the suddenly quiet then back in Fig value 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.360
 The angle that can be used as a very powerful force or powerlifting or 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.979
 Donate 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.300
 I'm a little bit more weighted, so when I'm at the waist, I use motion. 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:32.030
 And if you are suffering from pain in the waist area 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.030
 Please give me your knees. 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.420
 When performing the punch press operates at up to me who saw the waist 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.790
 Very helpful 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.430
 Let's get down to it. I'll do a typical bench press. 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.270
 Hold your daddy . 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:58.700
 Hold fast if y University of clock in this way got out of the central part of the chest 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:04.340
 I like the development of the muscle from the center to the outside. 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:08.360
 If you hold the bar so close and less , the inner part of the chest 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:14.450
 We will develop the width of the handle 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:18.170
 The chest develops inside and outside differently just by wiping it with the cherry and broadly 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:25.740
 We recommend always important to become familiar with different angles give the movement because 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:30.000
 And in the case of , like, when you lower your foot down, 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:34.920
 When you lower it down fast, the lower part of the chest develops a lot. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.910
 When put to the end of the form in the middle of the chest part and middle part of the overall 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.660
 And when you get your foot down to three goals, 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:48.990
 The upper part of the chest can develop 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.280
 First, a regular bench press that puts the foot in the center without lifting the basic waist 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.450
 Let's accept it. 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.550
 Ready operator 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.650
 When I go down, I breathe in and breathe the rib cage . 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.310
 Push it 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.150
 In this way, 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.110
 Be careful not to hang the joint completely 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.620
 He gave back down 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.620
 Yes, give me the future again. 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.020
 Please re-done for example by drinking their breathing swell and the Breastplate 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:32.360
 Then pushing 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:35.510
 Repeat. The important thing is that most of us do not breathe when we get off. 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.730
 Tell me to spit out your breath when you are young 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:45.200
 As you move up to the upper point to rip the action, 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.200
 If the answer is not significantly correlated with work-based strength in heavy weight 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.150
 What precisely because dumping the body's presentation puleojyeo be exhausted 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.020
 like this 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:59.030
 Let the law come down for a taste and stop for a while. 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.080
 If I have a hard spot left, it is safe to exhale at the Shanghai point. 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.540
 You Read 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.530
 Please repeat 5 times 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:10.130
 1 Le 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.130
 3 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.769
 4 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.769
 That's enough . 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:26.830
 So take a little bit 10 of the anger on the outside of the chest and the middle part of the chest 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.889
 I did a bench press to exercise. 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:37.080
 I'm going to do a bench press with less grip. 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:37.080
 It is offered as a word inside the chest a lot of exercise before the operation again 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.690
 Less good place to hold jusigoyo 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:50.200
 If the handle becomes too narrow, the Triesps will take a lot of 3 2 parts. 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.570
 Now it's more than enough 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:58.360
 Do not keep chasing me. 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:03.670
 It's very important how you grip next 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.850
 This is a grip that does not wrap your feet with your thumb up 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:10.720
 The grip is not safe. 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.330
 Where the eight wrong to just thumb because it just knocks down 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.139
 Covering is a very important part. 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.520
 Here you go again. 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:26.400
 Drinking down their breathing jusigoyo 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.229
 Mirror. You want to exercise at this time . You always think about it. 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.949
 You have to. 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:35.849
 Broken to be put to the galttae is trying to develop outside the chest 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:39.810
 Doegoyo endureth to the inside when I saw it so well and just need an idea 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:42.439
 It is very important that you exercise while doing image training 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.439
 It is one of the parts. 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.960
 Two please 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.229
 Gamaa 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.349
 This completes the flat bench press 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.349
 Yes
