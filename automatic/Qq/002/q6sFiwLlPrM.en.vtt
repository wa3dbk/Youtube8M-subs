00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.340
 you can if the udc restaurants and for sin 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.769
 is also in 2013 de las vegas behind 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.710
 me there is sony bravia lx900 to a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.389
 new 4k TV by sony sony 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.710
 already released models four cases but 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.480
 the size of this one makes it 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.090
 will prove more its place in your living room 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.260
 and you see if the 65-inch version 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 know that there will also be a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.960
 version 55 inch version 4 case of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.430
 this screen an incredible number of pixels 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.140
 more precisely 3840 by 2160 is pretty 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.640
 and the colors are of good quality and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.469
 as you would expect 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.239
 the image is really net it's 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.520
 TV is also 3D compatible 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 passive this is not traditionally 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.270
 very focused on the passive 3d but this 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.760
 choice is surely due to the fox 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.500
 resolution of this screen with the 3d 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.969
 passive indeed if you divide the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.610
 resolution by two you're not going 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.379
 lose as much detail as that 3d 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.059
 passive to other benefits and glasses 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 are much cheaper and does not require 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.129
 no battery this book four pairs 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.180
 3d glasses with the purchase of the TV 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.549
 today he does not have so many 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 programs it viewable in 4k 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.820
 sony will therefore increase the size of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.439
 the image to stick to the screen for 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.439
 keep a blu ray for example the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.150
 resolution will be increased to 4 cases we 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.530
 did we see in demonstration the result 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.420
 is good even though such an increase 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.549
 size is never perfect 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.450
 we will give you more details in 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.430
 the complete test 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.200
 the new 6mm technology in the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.979
 remote control that has a chip 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.390
 nfc 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.220
 if you have a smartphone 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.470
 compatible so you can approach 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.320
 two devices and display the screen of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.939
 your phone on the TV rather 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.070
 useful if you have to store the firms 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.390
 on your phone for example there you 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.650
 do not have new it's all you can 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.110
 similarly reproduce the screen of your 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.450
 phone on this television through the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.369
 high five screen mirroring as to 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 design I am not personally 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.450
 dazzled by these thick edges but 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.729
 sony integrates and speakers really 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.710
 imposing sound quality could 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.939
 so be really at the rendezvous this 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.909
 is not yet the price but wait 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.859
 you to something really expensive 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.630
 even though this model is a little bit more 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.009
 small as the 4k TV model of 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.569
 the one that already exists 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.799
 it will arrive in the spring we 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.929
 will not wait long for 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.959
 know precisely its quality and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.790
 price the 4k seems really interesting 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.470
 it looks really nice I think it 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.220
 will be more expected than the 3d she was 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.170
 previously 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.690
 you really have to keep an eye on 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.970
