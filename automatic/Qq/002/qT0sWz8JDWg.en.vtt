00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.230
 you 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.730
 and it's good that it's not that I say it 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.619
 is that I am against nintendo not 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.520
 I know it's not that I'm against 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:19.310
 will you is that I have confirmed it 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.140
 electronic arts officially and is 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.950
 that windows will run out of games 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.800
 frostbite 3.0 at least those that 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.110
 leave during 2013 and possibly 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.650
 those of 2014 also and is that electronic 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.090
 arts has highlighted and confirmed in the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.910
 publication of your economic results 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.640
 that titles that use the engine 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.260
 frostbite 3.0 graphic will not be 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.200
 available in wii 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.280
 this condition removes games from the map 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.760
 like battlefield 4 and dragon age 3 the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.350
 rest 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.930
 responsible for the graphic engine 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.200
 designed by thais commented recently 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.750
 that the technology has never been executed 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.090
 in the nintendo console had to 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.399
 tests that they performed with luck with their 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.140
 previous version did not offer the 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.200
 desired results 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.260
 besides father feel 4 and dragon age 3 the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.020
 freshman frostbite 3.0 is the base 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.790
 technique of other titles that will come out in 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.740
 the future of mass effect and 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.229
 predictably the new games of the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.990
 saga star wars that are preparing 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.690
 bioware and visceral games and of course there's the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 appropriate is therefore very bad 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.119
 news for nintendo that stays with 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.850
 a cast of games that are going to be 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.060
 great games during the next months and 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.729
 good is a very bad news 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.910
 honestly it's very bad news and 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.490
 we'll see how nintendo reacts to this 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.270
 If you react to the check book if 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.090
 reacts by doing nothing 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.929
 let's see me I get really 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.759
 wrong 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.130
 I sincerely tell you I would not like 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.320
 give this news but they are very bad 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.810
 news for nintendo for people who 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.649
 loves the company and especially for wii I 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.950
 so a hug to everyone commenting on 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.319
 what do you really think and I recommend you 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.940
 go through the video response that is there 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.940
 a hug and until next time
