00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
six and breaks them in the two means you

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.690 
six and breaks them in the two means you

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
ponytail and then and you'll also notice

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.289 
ponytail and then and you'll also notice
that<00:03:07.200> all<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.340> here<00:03:08.549> these<00:03:08.819> are<00:03:08.940> all<00:03:08.970> your

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
that all in here these are all your

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.000 
that all in here these are all your
modular<00:03:09.540> ports<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.349> is<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> single<00:03:10.829> rail

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
modular ports now this is a single rail

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.440 
modular ports now this is a single rail
design<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.579> doesn't<00:03:11.760> really<00:03:11.819> matter<00:03:12.030> where

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
design so it doesn't really matter where

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.479 
design so it doesn't really matter where
you<00:03:12.480> plug<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.049> what<00:03:13.349> it's<00:03:13.769> all<00:03:13.980> getting<00:03:14.190> its

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
you plug in what it's all getting its

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.979 
you plug in what it's all getting its
power<00:03:14.760> from<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.120> same<00:03:15.420> place<00:03:15.569> from<00:03:15.810> that

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
power from the same place from that

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.500 
power from the same place from that
single<00:03:16.380> rail<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.700> that's<00:03:17.850> really<00:03:18.239> really<00:03:18.389> good

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
single rail so that's really really good

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.599 
single rail so that's really really good
also<00:03:18.920> unfortunately<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:19.980> can't<00:03:20.160> see<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.430> but

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
also unfortunately you can't see it but

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.430 
also unfortunately you can't see it but
if<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.850> were<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.060> look<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.420> here<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:22.319> would

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
if you were to look in here you would

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.289 
if you were to look in here you would
see<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.130> loaded<00:03:23.639> with<00:03:23.850> good<00:03:24.150> stuff

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
see that this is loaded with good stuff

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.990 
see that this is loaded with good stuff

pretty<00:04:50.160> much<00:04:50.250> if<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.550> only<00:04:50.670> have<00:04:50.790> two<00:04:50.910> hard

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
pretty much if you only have two hard

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.280 
pretty much if you only have two hard
drives<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.390> can<00:04:51.510> bring<00:04:51.630> out<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.780> one<00:04:51.930> has<00:04:52.080> to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
drives you can bring out the one has to

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.510 
drives you can bring out the one has to
if<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.530> have<00:04:52.620> three<00:04:52.860> or<00:04:52.980> four<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:53.340> can<00:04:53.430> bring

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
if you have three or four you can bring

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.070 
if you have three or four you can bring
up<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.669> ones<00:04:53.790> at<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.910> four<00:04:54.210> you're<00:04:54.870> gonna<00:04:54.960> get

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
up the ones at a four you're gonna get

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.810 
up the ones at a four you're gonna get
11<00:04:55.500> in<00:04:55.590> total<00:04:55.860> though<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.460> it's<00:04:56.550> more<00:04:56.730> than

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
11 in total though so it's more than

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.510 
11 in total though so it's more than
enough<00:04:57.030> for<00:04:57.330> most<00:04:57.480> hard<00:04:57.750> drives<00:04:57.960> also<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.070> here
