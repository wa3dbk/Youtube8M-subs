good progress that's the reason I really
really<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:18.210> don't<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.840> time<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:20.779> shoot<00:00:21.779> any

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
I can explain more I use it a while ago

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.020 
I can explain more I use it a while ago
and<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.600> don't<00:01:12.930> remember<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.740> much<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.820> now

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and I don't remember really much but now

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.960 
and I don't remember really much but now
it's<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.450> refreshing<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.350> memory<00:01:16.380> it's

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
it's just refreshing my memory it's

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.070 
it's just refreshing my memory it's
relatively<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.570> simple<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.350> operate<00:01:21.080> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
relatively is very simple to operate the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.410 
relatively is very simple to operate the
only<00:01:22.380> small<00:01:23.250> difficulties<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.240> you've

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
only small difficulties when you've

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.130 
only small difficulties when you've
doing<00:01:24.840> first<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:26.430> set<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.540> parameters

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
doing first time to set all parameters

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
doing first time to set all parameters
on<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:31.460> controller<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:35.100> play<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
on that controller then you play with it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.700 
on that controller then you play with it
you<00:01:36.060> learn<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.570> bit<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.500> will

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you learn a little bit on it and it will

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
you learn a little bit on it and it will
be<00:01:37.829> fine<00:01:38.570> right<00:01:39.570> now

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
be fine right now

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.940 
be fine right now
they<00:01:40.740> both<00:01:41.130> connected<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.570> output<00:01:43.259> 1<00:01:43.619> and

they both connected to output 1 and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
they both connected to output 1 and
output<00:01:44.420> 2<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.890> controller<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:48.350> run<00:01:49.350> them

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
output 2 of that controller but run them

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.800 
output 2 of that controller but run them
simultaneously<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> same<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.630> they're

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
simultaneously on the same and they're

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.080 
simultaneously on the same and they're
the<00:01:51.960> same<00:01:52.200> address<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:53.070> sorry<00:01:53.430> under<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the same address I'm sorry under the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.670 
the same address I'm sorry under the
same<00:01:56.450> virtual<00:01:57.450> address<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.820> railroad<00:01:59.820> &amp;<00:02:00.060> Co

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
same virtual address I use railroad &amp; Co

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.550 
same virtual address I use railroad &amp; Co
and<00:02:01.680> computer<00:02:02.490> interface<00:02:03.030> connected<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.960> my

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
lens digital system set 0 set 100 so

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:30.699 
lens digital system set 0 set 100 so
let's<00:02:09.239> run<00:02:09.450> them

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.759 

I<00:02:31.090> think<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:32.239> synchronized<00:02:32.810> very<00:02:33.140> good<00:02:33.409> I'm

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
I think it's synchronized very good I'm

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.270 
I think it's synchronized very good I'm
I<00:02:34.069> wait<00:02:34.819> till<00:02:35.120> guru<00:02:35.720> all<00:02:36.049> settle<00:02:36.560> down<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.129> I

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
I wait till guru all settle down and I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.270 
I wait till guru all settle down and I
maybe<00:02:37.849> I<00:02:38.030> need<00:02:38.450> some<00:02:38.780> adjustment<00:02:39.769> but<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.040> think

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
maybe I need some adjustment but I think

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.429 
maybe I need some adjustment but I think
speed<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.060> everything<00:02:41.510> looks<00:02:41.780> very<00:02:41.900> very

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
speed and everything looks very very

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.119 
speed and everything looks very very
cool<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:43.340> will<00:02:43.670> be<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.900> layout<00:02:45.230> I'm<00:02:45.650> working

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
cool it will be that layout I'm working

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.910 
cool it will be that layout I'm working
will<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.459> under<00:02:46.700> computer<00:02:47.030> control<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:48.140> those

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
will be under computer control so those

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.210 
will be under computer control so those
gates<00:02:49.310> will<00:02:50.109> start<00:02:51.109> running<00:02:51.290> automatically

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
gates will start running automatically

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.050 
gates will start running automatically
as<00:02:52.280> as<00:02:52.670> soon<00:02:53.000> as<00:02:55.030> train<00:02:56.030> will<00:02:56.299> be<00:02:56.409> detected

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
as as soon as train will be detected

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.059 
as as soon as train will be detected
from<00:02:59.060> from<00:02:59.450> some<00:02:59.720> distance<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.500> those

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
from from some distance of those

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.720 
from from some distance of those
crossing<00:03:04.069> gate<00:03:04.280> signals<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:07.190> pretty<00:03:07.609> much

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
crossing gate signals that's pretty much

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.180 
crossing gate signals that's pretty much
it<00:03:08.150> for<00:03:08.480> today<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.349> will<00:03:10.010> do<00:03:10.370> more<00:03:10.760> videos

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
it for today and I will do more videos

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.940 
it for today and I will do more videos
