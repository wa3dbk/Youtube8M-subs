00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.080
 I'm jose manuel garcía and I do not have 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.370
 diy idea but prow paints 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.370
 click and even I can do it 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.370
 this is the prow challenge 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.290
 until today I had no idea how to 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.960
 called 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.690
 this material this friends and friends is 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.710
 a galvanized door surely 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.880
 although I did not know is the name what 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.010
 you will have seen a lot of pieces 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.900
 doors of law of the doors like this 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.989
 etcetera etcetera what is clear that 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.670
 the galvanized if it is not bright if 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.190
 it's not as neat as it has to be 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.379
 It does not look good, I think it's her turn 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.910
 a hand of color before surely that 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.290
 it was complicated but I think that the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.650
 friends of painting is proof will have a 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.650
 good solution 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.699
 these are a glimpse on galvanized and 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.559
 It's not as easy as it seems 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.730
 with normal paintings by many 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.369
 layers that you give him is not going to hold 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.320
 there is also the primer that is something 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.330
 that is cast and that makes layer between the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.100
 galvanized and painting but even to 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.000
 Sometimes that gives some problems with the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.890
 galvanized but we have a solution already 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.270
 the bapro to the paints friends I think 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.700
 who want to make us so much easier 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.740
 and let's find out how to first see what 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.229
 materials needs 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.000
 the first thing is that we decide the color in 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.950
 that we are going to paint our door and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.149
 we acquire the painting of the bapro a si 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.670
 you have doubts about how much 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.250
 you need to measure what you are going to paint and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.170
 consult in your usual store 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.660
 how we need to clean the door well 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.520
 we will use a diluent to remove everything 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.740
 the rest of fats and dirt and 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.750
 logically to apply it we are going to 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.610
 use some old rags too 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.110
 We can use cotton threads that 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.120
 we can get in any store 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.090
 of rap or if we have many areas 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.800
 rugged use desire to do the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.080
 Galvanized surfaces are usually 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.479
 wide so Gaul to the bow is thought 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.979
 to be applied with a paint gun in 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.810
 our case and for many small 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.570
 housework the most comfortable is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.700
 use an electric but a lot of eye 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.459
 with the gun if we do not want to apply to 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.989
 the bow where it does not touch the best is tape 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.239
 to protect locks and others 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.550
 details and of course a good 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.020
 protection never hurts 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.640
 lightweight mask will allow us 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.530
 protect us from the paint that is in the 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.489
 air and last but not least 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.709
 important 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.600
 We are going to need a good plastic to 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.180
 Do not vaporize paint middle house 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.570
 because painting and messing up are not 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.570
 synonyms with all this let's go to it 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.280
 the pieces galvanized normally 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.930
 are outdoors in my case is a 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.400
 door that I can disassemble and place in 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.480
 the work area 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.459
 If your piece can not be moved 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.250
 try to cover the areas more 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.989
 close floors floors walls all 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.160
 what remains in our radius of 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.230
 action to better protect regrets the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.580
 time to clean the surface if 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.860
 we had paint or leftover grease 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.569
 we would use a thinner that yes the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.280
 boiling on the rag, nothing to wet 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.810
 the diluent in the cloth the diluent 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.489
 that we are not looking for the jet that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.590
 have part román we would give and 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.930
 we would waste a lot for this case 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.819
 we have a steel flat 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.799
 and this truth but if you look at this 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.540
 corner for example here if we play 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.959
 we have a rough surface but if 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.140
 we quietly passed these wools of 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.510
 steel 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.980
 when we go through it again we are here 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.890
 say that we can apply in each 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.780
 work this part of the work does not 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.400
 It should take us a lot but also 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.800
 depends on the surface that we go to 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.720
 paint the more careful we have the 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.600
 time to clean better will be the result 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.140
 final hurry now it may be worse to 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.390
 long term 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.819
 once the surface on the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.230
 moment to paint which means that those 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.590
 parties in this we do not want that between the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.330
 paint we have to cover the I do not know how 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.400
 will be for example here we have a 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.700
 lock and we do not want us to enter 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.700
 paint what we do 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.560
 if it was with a brush or roller at best 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.150
 we would need so much thumb but it's going to 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.290
 be with paint gun 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.290
 we have to look at these places 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.889
 we have the door ready now we 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.070
 touch catch the tool let's go 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.600
 in the exciting world of the gun if 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.220
 it's an electric gun 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.169
 here we give you a little button and this 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.180
 would start to throw the pituitary but what 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.729
 first of all it is to fill in 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.430
 our paint deposit 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.710
 first of all a notice if the one of that 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.960
 it is possible to use the gun in 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.909
 outside and if there is no other way 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.839
 do it in a closed place that has 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.839
 very good ventilation 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.220
 well it's been easy and we 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.050
 Important prepared paint is 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.610
 gun around here the paint will come out and 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.190
 around here we have a diffuser that we 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.750
 allows to expand or reduce the trickle 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.100
 that will come out here for this 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.960
 product here in this case for this 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.820
 surface let's ask it not to come out 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.100
 as broad in which we are left there 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.090
 that we get patches according to 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.460
 which is important but before this 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.460
 we have to protect ourselves and we are going 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.930
 in the market there are several models of 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.050
 pistols consulted in your store 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.280
 which is the best for your project 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.590
 it's not good that we stop long 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.180
 time at a single point since the only thing 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.090
 that we will achieve will be a puddle of 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.740
 painting and that only produces a lump or 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.530
 that runs off and we have a 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.900
 unsightly dropper remember we do not have 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.449
 to do it all at once better 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.639
 give several hands with little paint has 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.060
 a thick layer that will dry me well and 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.860
 it will look good 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.000
 that is saved the time of the second 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.650
 hand that you have to apply exactly 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.720
 same as the first but I think that 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.720
 comes the result is not bad 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.410
 in any case I think I can say that 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.410
 overcome again a proven challenge 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.580
 i 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.919
 ah
