00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.069
 the petisco code including the most recent American war 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.900
 but the code can predict the future 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.130
 some researchers have claimed that the biblical code makes one last 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.279
 prediction 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.819
 that the end of the days has begun 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.819
 that at the end of the world is near 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.699
 the code predicted the devastating earthquake of the angels in 1984 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.170
 in that same sequence of code appears another great earthquake that hit 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 the angels in 2010 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.660
 also predicts that a comet destroy the earth in 2012 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.700
 nothing 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.240
 also suggests that the recent increase in international terrorism 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.240
 could be the precursor to the arrival of the end of days 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 these predictions are future catastrophes or simply increase the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.600
 chances of it happening 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.920
 some researchers warn that codes can be changed 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.240
 that's how we can see in the example we have the gore in blue 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 the president in yellow pointed 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.910
 of this and this was found by the ritchie himself a year before the elections 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.960
 according to that we assume that something weird 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.700
 you are going to be the president 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.190
 tobacco or maybe it was thought that he was not going to be the one who has shown 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.070
 a few weeks later and with those of florida and the legal battles 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.140
 expensive 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.580
 the professor ritz 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.870
 found a few more words 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.320
 izpisúa added pieces that are in red 0 because in fact there is no 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.950
 method we do not really have an instruction manual that tells us 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.890
 what word do we have to read first and what word do we have to read afterwards and 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.340
 if we are leaving any word losses is sure we do is 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.210
 highlight a word when deciding 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.050
 according to we have no way of knowing what we are looking for is what it was 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.200
 I hope it is very difficult to make a decision matrix about the future 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.719
 perennial opinion using the codes to predict the future is to give it a use 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.939
 wrong and that you see this whole thing and anyway you can not do it and 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:19.599
 go dead 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.560
 and that is that you can not use the codes of the Torah to deprive anyone to search 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.869
 the actions that the former comptroller and in the stock market to be able to earn money tomorrow 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.279
 and it grows because not everything that looks like a placement with the singer 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.079
 corresponds to something that is usually brought forward historically and 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.489
 modify this air activity 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.269
 I got stuck facer matrices with the future should not assume any 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.489
 problem at all, he signs something that we do not know he's looking to redefine and we have 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.720
 to eliminate everything and when you work like that and it's very possible that you comets 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.469
 mistakes 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.349
 of bmx in the kirchner 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.150
 that's why I think making matrices about the future is theoretically possible in a 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.929
 100% but in practice it is very difficult to do it 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.799
 that's why you can develop a matrix about a past event maybe 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.529
 then sources develop it about future event 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.739
 because it is simply a past event that has not happened 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.959
 still without light we do not know what to look for a matrix about the future 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.289
 induce chili there is the safe limitation your new cent chevy 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:21.729
 emín x5 white that what we see is only the tip of the iceberg of the government 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:23.620
 in which we have not yet been able 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.939
 to discover systematically 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.820
 all the different aspects of how it is encoded 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.190
 central jawed this is to say according to him is that it is a complete code and yes 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.029
 we only see his usual level and another there 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:40.469
 and doing bilbao if you believe in the bible and in its prophecies you will know that it speaks of 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.189
 a period of time called the end of time or the end of days and 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.040
 good 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.180
 it is the most interesting battle between good and evil in the world in 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.400
 crisis see it picchu in tibet of terrorism the AIDS virus rs and others 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.609
 virus and walsh pyrenees all this is an indication that the bad things 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.949
 occur 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.899
 produced between living elbow 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.359
 and the bible that says 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.040
 that all those evil or devilish things 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.419
 they will happen to me as well as in Japan 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.999
 in payment the biblical Gothic only corroborates that message to the block has 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.859
 provided with weapons 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.639
 present there is a whole tradition of specific forecasts about the end 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.159
 of the world mt is 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:25.610
 I am doing well the end of the days is of course a good and bad news is a 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.250
 bad news if you are wrong and good news if you are right perez with this 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.460
 I want to say what the end of the world means 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.560
 it's just that the world as it is can not always continue like this 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.710
 that is the concept 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.590
 the 11 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.370
 it's actually a pretty important idea because it's saying that everything 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.550
 will continue like this will never ever happen will try to change anything ever 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.290
 we will understand how to transform the codes and the predictions are an invitation to 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.419
 participate in the creation of the future 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.340
 in seven innings and chaco 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.770
 many of the sequences that refer to the end of the days speak of the east 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.460
 medium 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.170
 Sóller mx ramírez 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.160
 and if a matrix on this subject in Mapuche against about six terms 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.800
 buenos aires that point 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.889
 to probably happen to do any very good test at least in my 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.360
 opinion the first open towards the end of the year 4707 the beauty and that is 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.319
 announced that it could be in the fall of 2010 encrypted in cherán 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.419
 19 if you know the prophecy and use is that the end of the days as the end of the 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.349
 world the ice is a period that lasts seven years attenti begins with a 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.050
 peace treaty between israel and the nations that surround her then mixed 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.160
 although it does not really say which are the two peoples that sign the treaty of 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.060
 a trinidense betis this treaty of peace establishes that the lands of 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.590
 israel would be that the city of jerusalem is divided the bug and in return that 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.150
 encloses the central will guarantee peace 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.229
 jaden de burgos something similar what we are seeing today with the group of 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.480
 four and its road map to the south 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.719
 The group of four is formed by the United States 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:02.929
 united nations the european union and russia are felipe are developing 

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:06.829
 some roadmap 6 to solve that problem of the Israelis and the 

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:10.629
 Palestinians southeast of west states taking that month to check baby what 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.089
 I just told you it does not sound like something like a peace treaty that will create a 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:19.929
 Palestinian nation has been sold in de I think next if so and if in 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:23.680
 the autumn of 5770 comes the end of the days 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.060
 that matrix is ​​correct section then I have tried peace will take place today in 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.060
 September or October 2003 v 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:33.520
 whether or not we believe in the code 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.240
 there is something true 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.160
 we will never know if the predictions of these hidden messages are true until 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.249
 that the events become history 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:45.249
 that's why we'll never know if the world is reaching its end 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:50.719
 pink 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:59.379
 do not

 cave
