00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.899 
going to be 25 inches wide and 77 inches
long<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.129> a<00:02:18.220> big<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:18.879> it's

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
long so it's a it's a big one but it's

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.370 
long so it's a it's a big one but it's
going<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.270> give<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.780> most<00:02:19.959> amount<00:02:20.260> of

going to give you the most amount of

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.830 
going to give you the most amount of
ground<00:02:20.620> coverage<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.910> let's<00:02:22.120> go<00:02:22.240> inflate<00:02:22.690> this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
ground coverage so let's go inflate this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.570 
ground coverage so let's go inflate this
thing<00:02:23.050> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
thing and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000 
thing and

what that does is it puts air into the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.240 
what that does is it puts air into the
pad

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250

there's<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.590> couple<00:03:56.710> different<00:03:57.100> schools<00:03:57.160> of

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
there's a couple different schools of

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.390 
there's a couple different schools of
thought<00:03:58.080> one<00:03:59.080> says<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.830> when<00:03:59.920> you<00:03:59.950> blow<00:04:00.190> in

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
thought one says that when you blow in

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.240 
thought one says that when you blow in
there<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:01.240> moisture<00:04:01.870> particularly<00:04:02.650> when

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
there the moisture particularly when

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.530 
there the moisture particularly when
it's<00:04:03.370> cold<00:04:03.580> out<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.880> moisture<00:04:04.210> from<00:04:04.330> your

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
it's cold out the moisture from your

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.840 
it's cold out the moisture from your
breath<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.990> going<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.230> form<00:04:05.470> crystals<00:04:06.130> and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
breath is going to form crystals and

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.660 
breath is going to form crystals and
condensate<00:04:07.450> inside<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.440> your<00:04:08.590> mat<00:04:08.770> could<00:04:09.460> ruin

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
condensate inside of your mat could ruin

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.290 
condensate inside of your mat could ruin
your<00:04:09.880> mat<00:04:10.080> now<00:04:11.080> according<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.560> therm-a-rest

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
your mat now according to therm-a-rest

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.130 
your mat now according to therm-a-rest
it<00:04:13.300> doesn't<00:04:13.600> matter<00:04:14.070> so<00:04:15.070> bag<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:16.390> like<00:04:16.630> couple

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
it doesn't matter so bag is like couple

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.690 
it doesn't matter so bag is like couple

camping with my kids and it's not bad

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.310 
camping with my kids and it's not bad
the<00:05:41.430> problem<00:05:41.820> that<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.000> find<00:05:42.390> is<00:05:42.660> it's<00:05:42.930> 20

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
the problem that I find is it's 20

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.060 
the problem that I find is it's 20
inches<00:05:43.530> wide<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:44.180> really<00:05:45.180> wish<00:05:45.390> that<00:05:46.070> thermal

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
inches wide I really wish that thermal

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.840 
inches wide I really wish that thermal
rest<00:05:47.250> would<00:05:47.850> make<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.120> 25<00:05:48.960> inch<00:05:49.230> wide<00:05:49.850> short

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
rest would make a 25 inch wide short

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.430 
rest would make a 25 inch wide short
model<00:05:51.390> so<00:05:51.630> it<00:05:51.840> would<00:05:51.960> be<00:05:52.080> somewhere<00:05:52.320> around

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
model so it would be somewhere around

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.460 
model so it would be somewhere around
you<00:05:52.770> know<00:05:52.890> to<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.340> 50<00:05:53.700> 47<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:55.800> 60<00:05:56.370> inches<00:05:56.730> and

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
you know to the 50 47 to 60 inches and

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.880 
you know to the 50 47 to 60 inches and
not<00:05:58.470> be<00:05:59.070> the<00:05:59.850> full<00:06:00.000> 77<00:06:00.720> but<00:06:01.260> wider<00:06:01.560> because

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
not be the full 77 but wider because

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.560 
not be the full 77 but wider because
you'll<00:06:02.340> find<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.760> your<00:06:02.940> arms<00:06:03.330> are<00:06:03.510> gonna

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
you'll find that your arms are gonna

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.990 
you'll find that your arms are gonna
fall<00:06:03.930> off<00:06:04.170> so<00:06:04.440> 20<00:06:04.860> inches<00:06:05.190> is<00:06:05.370> about<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:05.790> width

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
fall off so 20 inches is about the width

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.660 
fall off so 20 inches is about the width
of<00:06:06.120> my<00:06:06.270> back<00:06:06.570> and<00:06:06.840> my<00:06:07.710> arms<00:06:08.070> have<00:06:08.220> a<00:06:08.250> tendency

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
of my back and my arms have a tendency

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.610 
of my back and my arms have a tendency
to<00:06:08.700> fall<00:06:08.970> off<00:06:09.180> we'll<00:06:09.780> see<00:06:09.930> how<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.110> works<00:06:10.380> in

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
to fall off we'll see how that works in

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.860 
to fall off we'll see how that works in
the<00:06:10.650> winter<00:06:10.950> I've<00:06:11.910> used<00:06:12.210> this<00:06:12.360> with<00:06:12.510> a<00:06:12.570> quilt
