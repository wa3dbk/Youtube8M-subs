00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
among my many battery chargers this one

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.980 
among my many battery chargers this one
I<00:00:16.560> got<00:00:16.830> from<00:00:18.470> computer<00:00:19.470> microcenter<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.990> this

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
I got from computer microcenter and this

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.390 
I got from computer microcenter and this
particular<00:00:22.670> unit<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:24.060> easily<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.720> adapted<00:00:25.400> as

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
particular unit can easily be adapted as

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.779 
particular unit can easily be adapted as
a<00:00:26.519> solar<00:00:27.000> battery<00:00:27.990> charger<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
a solar battery charger is the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.500 
a solar battery charger is the
ultra-fast<00:00:31.279> they<00:00:32.279> kept<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.880> battery<00:00:33.360> charger

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
ultra-fast they kept the battery charger

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.860 
ultra-fast they kept the battery charger
at<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.660> back<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:39.170> powerful<00:00:40.170> DC<00:00:41.870> 500

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
at the back is as powerful DC 500

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.340 
at the back is as powerful DC 500
milliamp<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:48.260> solar<00:00:49.260> panel<00:00:49.739> here

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
milliamp so i have this solar panel here

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.420 
milliamp so i have this solar panel here
1.8<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> gives<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:56.719> 100<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
1.8 what I think it gives up the 100 to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
1.8 what I think it gives up the 100 to
130<00:00:59.430> million<00:01:02.059> about<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.270> won't<00:01:03.570> quick<00:01:04.409> charge

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
130 million about it won't quick charge

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.039 
130 million about it won't quick charge
your<00:01:05.070> battery<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:06.000> slowly<00:01:06.360> charge<00:01:06.840> your

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
your battery it will slowly charge your

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.580 
your battery it will slowly charge your
battery<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:09.409> riverfront<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.590> got

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
battery with the riverfront so I got

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.749 
battery with the riverfront so I got
these<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:15.860> battery<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:19.740> charge<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.310> using

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
these a battery and I charge it using

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.420 
these a battery and I charge it using
this<00:01:20.939> battery<00:01:21.450> charger<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> after<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> couple

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
this battery charger and after a couple

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.960 
this battery charger and after a couple
of<00:01:23.580> hours<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.570> gave<00:01:24.810> me<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.650> charge<00:01:26.130> from<00:01:26.700> less

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
of hours it gave me the charge from less

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.039 
of hours it gave me the charge from less
than<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.420> book<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.100> 1.35<00:01:29.900> vote<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:32.869> I've<00:01:33.869> seen

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
than one book to 1.35 vote so I've seen

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
than one book to 1.35 vote so I've seen
a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.350> videos<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.040> YouTube<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.820> making

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
a lot of videos on YouTube on making

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
a lot of videos on YouTube on making
your<00:01:36.329> own<00:01:38.180> solar<00:01:39.180> charger<00:01:40.970> but<00:01:43.340> with<00:01:44.340> this

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
your own solar charger but with this

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.120 
your own solar charger but with this
unit<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:48.320> built-in<00:01:49.320> protection<00:01:49.950> with

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
unit you have built-in protection with

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.530 
unit you have built-in protection with
the<00:01:50.220> fuse<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:52.259> charger<00:01:52.619> itself<00:01:53.040> has<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
the fuse and the charger itself has a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.109 
the fuse and the charger itself has a
controller<00:01:54.540> which<00:01:55.500> will<00:01:55.710> probably<00:01:56.119> prevent

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
controller which will probably prevent

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.370 
controller which will probably prevent
overcharge<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:59.240> this<00:02:00.240> unit<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.750> Africa<00:02:01.259> how

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
overcharge and this unit I Africa how

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.050 
overcharge and this unit I Africa how
much<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.100> was<00:02:02.250> very<00:02:02.549> little<00:02:02.790> money

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
much it was there was very little money

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.139 
much it was there was very little money
but<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.799> use<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.610> pluck<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
but you can use it and just pluck it in

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.410 
but you can use it and just pluck it in
AC<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.229> pluck<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.129> car

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
AC or you can pluck it in your car

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.660 
AC or you can pluck it in your car
and<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:10.050> my<00:02:10.380> case<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.340> also<00:02:11.520> use

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and in my case here you can also use

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.699 
and in my case here you can also use
your<00:02:12.360> little<00:02:13.110> solar<00:02:13.410> panel<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.750> won't<00:02:16.110> open<00:02:16.290> or

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
your little solar panel it won't open or

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.949 
your little solar panel it won't open or
it<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.130> probably<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:19.410> very<00:02:20.280> slow<00:02:20.610> charging<00:02:20.959> but

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
it it probably is very slow charging but

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.290 
it it probably is very slow charging but
I<00:02:22.260> think<00:02:22.680> that's<00:02:23.160> probably<00:02:23.459> better<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.060> your

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
I think that's probably better for your

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.150 
I think that's probably better for your
battery<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:28.170> only<00:02:28.319> thing<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.739> have<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
battery so the only thing that I have to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.570 
battery so the only thing that I have to
change<00:02:29.489> might<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.270> socket<00:02:30.840> itself<00:02:31.580> this

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
change might be the socket itself this

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.070 
change might be the socket itself this
kind<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.030> connection<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:34.110> very<00:02:34.590> good<00:02:34.890> but

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
kind of connection is not very good but

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.580 
kind of connection is not very good but
it<00:02:37.100> won't<00:02:38.100> be<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> major<00:02:39.870> problem<00:02:40.440> if

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
it won't be you know a major problem if

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.400 
it won't be you know a major problem if
I<00:02:40.709> happen<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.160> too<00:02:41.730> short<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.209> out<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:43.290> not

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
I happen to too short it out it's not

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.190 
I happen to too short it out it's not
like<00:02:43.800> you're<00:02:44.310> plugging<00:02:44.610> into<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.810> know<00:02:45.930> some

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
like you're plugging into you know some

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.890 
like you're plugging into you know some
very<00:02:46.440> heavy<00:02:47.310> current<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.150> heavy<00:02:48.420> voltage

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
very heavy current and heavy voltage

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.680 
very heavy current and heavy voltage
device<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.670> i<00:02:50.700> probably<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.450> make<00:02:51.569> an

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
device so i probably have to make an

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.860 
device so i probably have to make an
adapter<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.459> i<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.790> easily<00:02:54.180> plug<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.630> this

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
adapter so i can easily plug in this

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.900 
adapter so i can easily plug in this
unit<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.239> package<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:57.930> see<00:02:58.319> is

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
unit here in the package you can see is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:06.320 
unit here in the package you can see is
12<00:02:59.910> volt<00:03:00.239> input<00:03:01.489> 5<00:03:02.489> 500<00:03:03.269> milliamp<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:06.150> is

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
12 volt input 5 500 milliamp and this is

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.570 
12 volt input 5 500 milliamp and this is
a<00:03:06.450> 12<00:03:06.780> volt<00:03:06.959> panel<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.830> just<00:03:08.069> right<00:03:08.340> for

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
a 12 volt panel so it's just right for

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.680 
a 12 volt panel so it's just right for
the<00:03:08.670> job<00:03:09.049> so<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.470> thought<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:11.340> know<00:03:11.940> instead<00:03:12.630> of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the job so I thought you know instead of

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.490 
the job so I thought you know instead of
making<00:03:13.380> my<00:03:13.560> own<00:03:13.590> with<00:03:14.130> all<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:15.500> regulators

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
making my own with all the regulators

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.090 
making my own with all the regulators
and<00:03:16.850> controllers<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.540> might<00:03:18.720> end<00:03:18.870> up

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
and controllers and you might end up

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.580 
and controllers and you might end up
overcharging<00:03:20.570> whatever<00:03:21.570> batteries<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.350> have

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
overcharging whatever batteries you have

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.060 
overcharging whatever batteries you have
so<00:03:22.859> this<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> good<00:03:24.230> good<00:03:25.230> unit<00:03:25.590> for<00:03:25.799> doing

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
so this is a good good unit for doing

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.260 
so this is a good good unit for doing
that<00:03:26.930> okay<00:03:27.930> take<00:03:28.200> care
