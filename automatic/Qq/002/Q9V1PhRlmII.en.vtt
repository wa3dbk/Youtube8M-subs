00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
don't know how they've managed how

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.740

they've managed to get on here and this
I<00:06:19.020> can<00:06:19.500> see<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.710> being<00:06:19.830> cutesy<00:06:20.189> but<00:06:20.669> it's<00:06:20.819> no

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
I can see it being cutesy but it's no

I can see it being cutesy but it's no
more<00:06:21.210> than<00:06:21.270> a<00:06:21.449> flash<00:06:21.689> game<00:06:21.960> it's<00:06:22.800> no<00:06:23.069> more<00:06:23.339> than

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:23.399 
more than a flash game it's no more than

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.100 
more than a flash game it's no more than

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:47.259 
probably about it there's nothing really

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.189
