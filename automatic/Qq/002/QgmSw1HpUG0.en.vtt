lot of our patients have been asking me
what<00:00:37.510> though<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.930> aligners<00:00:38.260> look<00:00:38.500> like<00:00:38.860> how

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
what though the aligners look like how

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.090 
what though the aligners look like how
do<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.030> talk<00:00:40.300> with<00:00:40.600> them<00:00:40.840> have<00:00:41.590> you<00:00:41.739> put<00:00:41.949> them

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
do you talk with them have you put them

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.650 
do you talk with them have you put them
in<00:00:42.220> what<00:00:42.519> do<00:00:42.610> they<00:00:42.730> feel<00:00:42.970> like<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.269> first<00:00:43.449> time

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660

you're<00:00:43.809> putting<00:00:43.930> them<00:00:44.170> and<00:00:44.379> so<00:00:45.010> I<00:00:45.610> figured<00:00:45.850> it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
you're putting them and so I figured it

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.369 
you're putting them and so I figured it
would<00:00:46.269> be<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:46.390> good<00:00:46.510> idea<00:00:46.629> to<00:00:46.900> actually<00:00:47.050> record

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
would be a good idea to actually record

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.990 
would be a good idea to actually record
the<00:00:47.800> closest<00:00:48.250> thing<00:00:48.400> to<00:00:48.550> me<00:00:48.640> starting

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
the closest thing to me starting

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
liners as many of you know I actually

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.070

started<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.920> treatment<00:00:54.309> last<00:00:54.519> year<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.780> I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
started the treatment last year and I

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.770 
started the treatment last year and I
wore<00:00:56.409> my<00:00:56.589> aligners<00:00:56.940> full-time<00:00:57.940> 22<00:00:58.510> hours<00:00:58.659> a

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.140 
wore my aligners full-time 22 hours a
day<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:59.080> directed<00:00:59.589> and<00:01:00.309> then<00:01:00.519> I<00:01:00.610> actually<00:01:00.790> was

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
day is directed and then I actually was

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.869 
day is directed and then I actually was
very<00:01:01.390> happy<00:01:01.629> with<00:01:01.900> where<00:01:02.049> everything<00:01:02.409> went

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
very happy with where everything went

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.979 
very happy with where everything went
looking<00:01:03.879> at<00:01:03.970> a<00:01:04.000> little<00:01:04.269> bit<00:01:04.390> more<00:01:04.510> critically

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
looking at a little bit more critically

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.399 
looking at a little bit more critically
I<00:01:05.019> did<00:01:05.320> see<00:01:05.530> some<00:01:05.920> areas<00:01:06.520> where<00:01:06.729> I<00:01:06.760> wanted<00:01:07.180> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
I did see some areas where I wanted to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.740 
I did see some areas where I wanted to
have<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.440> couple<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.010> small<00:01:09.490> rotations<00:01:10.119> changed

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
have a couple of small rotations changed

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.570 
have a couple of small rotations changed
and<00:01:11.530> that's<00:01:11.680> why<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.860> decided<00:01:12.040> to<00:01:12.310> go<00:01:12.430> ahead

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
and that's why I decided to go ahead

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.359 
and that's why I decided to go ahead
with<00:01:12.820> my<00:01:13.119> refinement<00:01:13.690> aligners<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:14.369> didn't

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
with my refinement aligners I didn't

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.880 
with my refinement aligners I didn't
want<00:01:15.549> to<00:01:15.610> go<00:01:15.729> into<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.030> right<00:01:16.150> away<00:01:16.650> at<00:01:17.650> that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
want to go into it right away at that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.480 
want to go into it right away at that
time<00:01:18.190> and<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:18.760> I<00:01:18.820> did<00:01:19.060> where<00:01:19.210> my<00:01:19.420> past<00:01:20.490> liners

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490

the Invisalign aligners are a little bit

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.590 
the Invisalign aligners are a little bit
of<00:02:00.039> an<00:02:00.189> adjustment<00:02:00.280> they<00:02:00.969> do<00:02:01.030> feel<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.479> little

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
of an adjustment they do feel a little

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.260 
of an adjustment they do feel a little
bit<00:02:01.810> tight<00:02:02.049> you<00:02:02.740> may<00:02:03.009> develop<00:02:03.249> a<00:02:03.579> slight<00:02:03.909> Lisp

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
bit tight you may develop a slight Lisp

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.230 
bit tight you may develop a slight Lisp
for<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.749> couple<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.229> days<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.880> will<00:02:06.999> feel

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
for a couple of days and it will feel

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.999 
for a couple of days and it will feel
like<00:02:07.270> your<00:02:08.080> teeth<00:02:08.259> are<00:02:08.410> slightly<00:02:08.740> more

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
like your teeth are slightly more

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.410 
like your teeth are slightly more
slippery<00:02:09.310> because<00:02:09.580> they<00:02:09.880> are<00:02:10.000> coated<00:02:10.390> with

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
slippery because they are coated with

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.470 
slippery because they are coated with
something<00:02:10.840> like<00:02:10.960> plastic<00:02:11.850> do<00:02:12.850> people<00:02:13.150> notice

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
something like plastic do people notice

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.330 
something like plastic do people notice
them<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.080> thing<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.410> I've<00:02:14.530> been<00:02:14.800> told<00:02:15.040> most

them the thing that I've been told most

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.520 
them the thing that I've been told most
often<00:02:15.880> during<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.690> first<00:02:17.050> course<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.410> my

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
often during the first course of my

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.660 
often during the first course of my
treatment<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.190> my<00:02:18.310> teeth<00:02:18.460> actually

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
treatment was that my teeth actually

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.600 
treatment was that my teeth actually
looks<00:02:19.000> shinier<00:02:19.360> okay<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.680> here's<00:02:21.430> actually

anyone who is worried about the aligners

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.180 
anyone who is worried about the aligners
actually<00:02:45.640> coming<00:02:46.030> off<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:47.410> your<00:02:47.590> sleep<00:02:47.920> or

while you're talking they do fit on

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.530 
while you're talking they do fit on
quite<00:02:50.319> tightly<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.459> have<00:02:51.640> attachments<00:02:52.420> as

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
quite tightly we do have attachments as

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.360 
quite tightly we do have attachments as
well<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.959> we<00:02:53.049> do<00:02:53.260> add<00:02:53.410> on<00:02:53.590> generally<00:02:54.099> later

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
well that we do add on generally later

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.789 
well that we do add on generally later
on<00:02:54.610> ISM<00:02:54.909> treatment<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:56.079> help<00:02:56.110> grip<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
on ISM treatment to help grip the

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.440 
on ISM treatment to help grip the
aligners<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.250> little<00:02:57.430> bit<00:02:57.519> better<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.060> help

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
aligners a little bit better and to help

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.650 
aligners a little bit better and to help
correct<00:02:58.930> certain<00:02:59.260> rotations<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.920> the<00:02:59.980> teeth

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
correct certain rotations of the teeth

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.270 
correct certain rotations of the teeth
but<00:03:01.660> again<00:03:01.810> they<00:03:02.170> do<00:03:02.230> fit<00:03:02.620> quite<00:03:02.829> snugly

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
but again they do fit quite snugly

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.430 
but again they do fit quite snugly
without<00:03:03.579> that<00:03:03.819> what<00:03:04.599> we<00:03:04.720> are<00:03:04.870> looking<00:03:05.019> for<00:03:05.170> is

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
without that what we are looking for is

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.900 
without that what we are looking for is
that<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.680> aligners<00:03:06.069> actually<00:03:06.430> line<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.670> right

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
that the aligners actually line up right

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.910 
that the aligners actually line up right
against<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.569> incisal<00:03:08.049> edge<00:03:08.349> of<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.560> tooth<00:03:08.739> or

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
against the incisal edge of the tooth or

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
against the incisal edge of the tooth or
the<00:03:08.980> biting<00:03:09.250> surface<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:09.910> tooth<00:03:10.150> now<00:03:10.900> when

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
the biting surface of the tooth now when

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.300 
the biting surface of the tooth now when
you<00:03:11.230> first<00:03:11.470> start<00:03:11.739> off<00:03:11.829> with<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:11.980> aligner

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
you first start off with the aligner

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.150 
you first start off with the aligner
this<00:03:12.579> may<00:03:12.760> not<00:03:12.970> actually<00:03:13.239> happen<00:03:13.870> because<00:03:14.799> the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
this may not actually happen because the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.309 
this may not actually happen because the
aligner<00:03:15.459> is<00:03:15.790> really<00:03:16.390> how<00:03:16.720> your<00:03:16.930> team<00:03:17.109> should

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
aligner is really how your team should

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.830 
aligner is really how your team should
be<00:03:17.470> about<00:03:17.709> two<00:03:18.040> weeks<00:03:18.250> from<00:03:18.459> now<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.569> may

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
be about two weeks from now so it may

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.080 
be about two weeks from now so it may
not<00:03:19.870> line<00:03:20.260> up<00:03:20.290> right<00:03:20.440> then<00:03:20.859> but<00:03:21.400> before<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.940> go

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
not line up right then but before I go

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.789 
not line up right then but before I go
ahead<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.329> change<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.900> my<00:03:23.019> second<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.530> liner

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
ahead and change to my second the liner

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.780 
ahead and change to my second the liner
I<00:03:23.920> would<00:03:24.099> want<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.370> make<00:03:24.489> sure<00:03:24.519> that

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
I would want to make sure that

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.150 
I would want to make sure that
everything<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.329> lined<00:03:25.660> up<00:03:25.810> nicely<00:03:26.140> inside<00:03:26.950> of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
everything is lined up nicely inside of

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.129 
everything is lined up nicely inside of
that<00:03:27.250> tray<00:03:27.609> okay<00:03:28.000> what<00:03:28.540> are<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.690> other<00:03:28.810> tools

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
that tray okay what are the other tools

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.659 
that tray okay what are the other tools
that<00:03:29.319> we<00:03:29.440> use<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:30.160> help<00:03:30.340> our<00:03:30.519> patients

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
that we use to help our patients

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.430 
that we use to help our patients
actually<00:03:31.060> make<00:03:31.419> sure<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.780> they<00:03:31.900> bite<00:03:32.139> into

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
actually make sure that they bite into

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.890 
actually make sure that they bite into
the<00:03:32.560> tray<00:03:32.970> very<00:03:33.970> snuggly<00:03:34.450> as<00:03:34.510> we<00:03:34.630> give<00:03:34.780> them

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
the tray very snuggly as we give them

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.170 
the tray very snuggly as we give them
the<00:03:35.019> aligner<00:03:35.319> chuy's<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.220> I'll<00:03:36.669> go<00:03:36.849> into<00:03:36.880> that

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
the aligner chuy's and I'll go into that

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.430 
the aligner chuy's and I'll go into that
a<00:03:37.239> little<00:03:37.510> bit<00:03:37.720> later<00:03:37.959> but<00:03:38.139> I'm<00:03:38.230> gonna<00:03:38.319> go

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
a little bit later but I'm gonna go

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.809 
a little bit later but I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.620> put<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.950> bottom<00:03:39.250> aligner<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.730> as

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
ahead and put the bottom aligner in as

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.550 
ahead and put the bottom aligner in as
well<00:03:39.970> okay<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:40.840> I'm<00:03:40.959> going<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.109> bite<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.500> a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
well okay so I'm going to bite that a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.020 
well okay so I'm going to bite that a
little<00:03:41.829> bit<00:03:41.889> better<00:03:42.040> together<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.760> now<00:03:43.000> I

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
little bit better together and now I

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.789 
little bit better together and now I
actually<00:03:43.209> do<00:03:43.480> have<00:03:43.510> lower<00:03:43.989> liner<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.560> again

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
actually do have lower liner and again

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.520 
actually do have lower liner and again
that<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.130> slightly<00:03:45.579> tight<00:03:46.230> because<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.290> am

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
that is slightly tight because I am

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.110 
that is slightly tight because I am
expressing<00:03:47.919> some<00:03:48.370> movement<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.880> teeth

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
expressing some movement of the teeth

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.030 
expressing some movement of the teeth
just<00:03:49.840> what<00:03:50.019> my<00:03:50.139> lips<00:03:50.380> up<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.590> little<00:03:50.769> bit<00:03:50.889> there

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
just what my lips up a little bit there

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.069 
just what my lips up a little bit there
I<00:03:51.519> do<00:03:51.819> have<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.209> little<00:03:52.389> bit<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.810> an<00:03:52.989> adjustment

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
I do have a little bit of an adjustment

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.379 
I do have a little bit of an adjustment
Hogg<00:03:53.620> speaking<00:03:54.099> there<00:03:54.370> are<00:03:54.400> certain<00:03:54.849> sounds

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
Hogg speaking there are certain sounds

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.890 
Hogg speaking there are certain sounds
like<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:55.739> sounds<00:03:56.739> or<00:03:56.889> the<00:03:57.209> sounds<00:03:58.209> where<00:03:58.870> I

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
like this sounds or the sounds where I

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.270 
like this sounds or the sounds where I
can<00:03:59.049> actually<00:03:59.169> feel<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.650> little<00:03:59.829> bit<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.099> air

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
can actually feel a little bit of air

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.789 
can actually feel a little bit of air
going<00:04:00.310> in<00:04:00.730> between<00:04:00.989> my<00:04:01.989> teeth<00:04:02.049> in<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.500> aligner

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
going in between my teeth in the aligner

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.530 
going in between my teeth in the aligner
this<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.160> because<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.730> aligner<00:04:04.000> still<00:04:04.419> are

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
this is because the aligner still are

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.619 
this is because the aligner still are
not<00:04:04.569> snugly<00:04:05.169> fit<00:04:05.200> right<00:04:05.769> up<00:04:05.859> against<00:04:06.160> mighty

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
not snugly fit right up against mighty

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.720 
not snugly fit right up against mighty
as<00:04:07.629> I<00:04:08.319> become<00:04:08.709> more<00:04:08.950> accustomed<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.609> and

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
as I become more accustomed to it and

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.520 
as I become more accustomed to it and
because<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.239> aligners<00:04:10.629> actually<00:04:11.079> get<00:04:11.260> closer

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
because the aligners actually get closer

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.039 
because the aligners actually get closer
to<00:04:11.829> my<00:04:12.069> actual<00:04:12.430> teeth<00:04:12.970> there<00:04:13.419> should<00:04:13.660> be<00:04:13.810> less

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
to my actual teeth there should be less

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.879 
to my actual teeth there should be less
of<00:04:14.109> a<00:04:14.410> list<00:04:15.099> that<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.669> expressed<00:04:16.680> back<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.799> the

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
of a list that is expressed back to the

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.620 
of a list that is expressed back to the
aligner<00:04:18.190> chuys<00:04:18.579> what<00:04:18.760> we<00:04:18.849> have<00:04:19.120> been<00:04:19.329> telling

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
aligner chuys what we have been telling

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.930 
aligner chuys what we have been telling
patients<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.139> our<00:04:20.260> practice<00:04:20.470> now<00:04:20.949> with<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
patients in our practice now with the

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.460 
patients in our practice now with the
aligners<00:04:22.300> shoes<00:04:22.479> actually<00:04:22.840> go<00:04:23.139> ahead<00:04:23.260> and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
aligners shoes actually go ahead and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.930 
aligners shoes actually go ahead and
take<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.770> aligner<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.220> me<00:04:24.340> bite<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:24.699> it<00:04:24.729> for

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
take the aligner to me bite on it for

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.640 
take the aligner to me bite on it for
about<00:04:25.000> five<00:04:25.389> minutes<00:04:25.750> every<00:04:26.080> single<00:04:26.410> night

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
about five minutes every single night

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.680 
about five minutes every single night
what<00:04:26.889> that<00:04:27.729> does<00:04:27.940> is<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.090> actually<00:04:28.150> stimulates

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
what that does is it actually stimulates

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.990 
what that does is it actually stimulates
the<00:04:29.020> area<00:04:29.260> around<00:04:29.349> the<00:04:29.620> tooth<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:29.880> what

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
the area around the tooth and what

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.460 
the area around the tooth and what
happens<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.480> scientifically<00:04:32.260> in

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
happens is that scientifically in

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.350 
happens is that scientifically in
biological<00:04:32.830> we<00:04:33.220> know<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.850> tooth<00:04:34.060> movement

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
biological we know that tooth movement

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.840 
biological we know that tooth movement
is<00:04:34.690> generally<00:04:35.200> expressed<00:04:35.590> during<00:04:36.580> the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
is generally expressed during the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.910 
is generally expressed during the
nighttime<00:04:37.090> hours<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.260> with<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.680> we<00:04:38.830> are

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
nighttime hours so with that we are

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.440 
nighttime hours so with that we are
trying<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.190> maximize<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.030> amount<00:04:40.120> of

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
trying to maximize the amount of

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.420 
trying to maximize the amount of
movement<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:40.960> we<00:04:41.110> get<00:04:41.380> with<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.980> aligners

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
movement that we get with the aligners

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.240 
movement that we get with the aligners
okay<00:04:43.170> we<00:04:44.170> actually<00:04:44.350> have<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.710> sip<00:04:44.950> of<00:04:44.980> water

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
okay we actually have a sip of water

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.380 
okay we actually have a sip of water
that's<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.640> only<00:04:45.880> thing<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.210> will

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
that's the only thing that I will

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.220 
that's the only thing that I will
actually<00:04:46.690> have<00:04:47.430> with<00:04:48.430> my<00:04:49.000> aligners<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:49.960> I'm

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
actually have with my aligners in so I'm

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.660 
actually have with my aligners in so I'm
going<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.470> actually<00:04:50.620> take<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:50.980> swig<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.550> my

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
going to actually take a swig of my

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.810 
going to actually take a swig of my
water<00:04:51.910> just<00:04:52.920> what<00:04:53.920> up<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.130> aligners<00:04:54.490> get<00:04:54.700> the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
water just what up the aligners get the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.080 
water just what up the aligners get the
get<00:04:55.000> use<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.420> them<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:56.640> probably<00:04:57.640> go<00:04:57.850> ahead

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
get use of them and probably go ahead

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.610 
get use of them and probably go ahead
and<00:04:58.210> get<00:04:58.390> ready<00:04:58.510> for<00:04:58.780> bed<00:04:58.930> generally<00:04:59.470> i<00:04:59.500> do

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
and get ready for bed generally i do

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.350 
and get ready for bed generally i do
tell<00:05:00.040> our<00:05:00.160> patients<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.700> go<00:05:00.820> ahead<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.150> change

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
tell our patients to go ahead and change

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.090 
tell our patients to go ahead and change
their<00:05:01.690> new<00:05:01.840> aligners<00:05:02.230> just<00:05:02.530> before<00:05:02.860> they<00:05:02.980> go

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
their new aligners just before they go

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.800
