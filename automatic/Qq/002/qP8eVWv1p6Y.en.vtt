cups of water on tables as opposed to
the<00:02:27.000> individual<00:02:27.390> bottles<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.470> one<00:02:28.590> of

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
seen by our customers and there that's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.610 
seen by our customers and there that's
where<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:48.480> receive<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.050> goods<00:02:49.170> into<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
where we receive the goods into the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.220 
where we receive the goods into the
hotel<00:02:49.830> but<00:02:50.160> also<00:02:50.340> where<00:02:50.700> we<00:02:50.940> we<00:02:51.600> pass<00:02:51.840> all<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
hotel but also where we we pass all the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.680 
hotel but also where we we pass all the
the<00:02:52.500> waist<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.980> matter<00:02:53.910> out<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.510> hotel

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
the waist and matter out of the hotel

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.860 
the waist and matter out of the hotel
through<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.110> loading<00:02:55.230> bay<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.220> think<00:02:56.870> both

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
through the loading bay so I think both

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.449 
through the loading bay so I think both
complement<00:02:58.380> each<00:02:58.470> other<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.920> both<00:02:59.100> have<00:02:59.340> to

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
complement each other and both have to

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.490 
complement each other and both have to
actively<00:02:59.760> work<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.360> promoting<00:03:00.780> what<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.260> do<00:03:01.380> in

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
actively work to promoting what we do in

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.690 
actively work to promoting what we do in
environmental<00:03:02.010> management<00:03:02.280> within<00:03:02.519> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
environmental management within the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.370 
environmental management within the
hotel<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.420> think<00:03:03.540> we've<00:03:03.810> got<00:03:03.930> those<00:03:04.019> members

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
hotel so I think we've got those members

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.809 
hotel so I think we've got those members
that<00:03:04.500> come<00:03:04.680> with<00:03:04.890> past<00:03:05.130> experiences<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
that come with past experiences that

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.670 
that come with past experiences that
would<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.269> share<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.870> within<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
would like to share that within the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.500 
would like to share that within the
business<00:03:07.830> itself<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.550> at<00:03:08.640> work<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.420> it's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
business itself and at work so it's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.820 
business itself and at work so it's
opening<00:03:09.780> up<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.050> I've<00:03:10.230> anew<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:10.560> them<00:03:10.680> to

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
opening up that I've anew for them to

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.470 
opening up that I've anew for them to
communicate<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.610> have<00:03:11.790> an<00:03:11.910> impact<00:03:12.180> within

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
communicate and have an impact within

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.479 
communicate and have an impact within
the<00:03:12.989> business<00:03:13.140> itself<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.130> need<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.340> listen

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
the business itself so we need to listen

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.640 
the business itself so we need to listen
to<00:03:14.610> them<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.570> sense<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.870> perhaps<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.560> as

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
to them in the sense that perhaps we as

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.020 
to them in the sense that perhaps we as
leadership<00:03:16.920> believe<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.489> we<00:03:17.610> know<00:03:17.760> at<00:03:17.910> all

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
leadership believe that we know at all

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.509 
leadership believe that we know at all
and<00:03:18.329> i<00:03:18.750> would<00:03:19.079> like<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.380> conduct<00:03:19.650> business<00:03:19.739> but

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
and i would like to conduct business but

and i would like to conduct business but
its<00:03:20.640> opening<00:03:20.730> up<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.120> communication<00:03:21.720> channels

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
its opening up to communication channels

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.000 
its opening up to communication channels
to<00:03:22.230> seeing<00:03:22.440> how<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.769> do<00:03:22.860> things

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
to seeing how we can do things

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.830 
to seeing how we can do things
differently<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.640> likewise<00:03:24.360> i<00:03:24.510> think<00:03:24.660> some<00:03:24.810> of

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
differently and likewise i think some of

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.120 
differently and likewise i think some of
the<00:03:24.930> lessons<00:03:25.079> learned<00:03:25.440> within<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.980> workplace

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
the lessons learned within the workplace

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.400 
the lessons learned within the workplace
can<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.760> taken<00:03:27.150> home<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> staff

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
can be taken home to the staff

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.720 
can be taken home to the staff
accommodation<00:03:28.650> where<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.310> bulk<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.640> our

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
accommodation where the bulk of our

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.190 
accommodation where the bulk of our
colleagues<00:03:30.090> live<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.660> one<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:30.989> our

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
colleagues live in one of our

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.319 
colleagues live in one of our
accommodation<00:03:32.040> villages<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.579> hopefully<00:03:33.239> we

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
accommodation villages and hopefully we

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.970 
accommodation villages and hopefully we
can<00:03:33.450> transform<00:03:33.690> what<00:03:34.170> they<00:03:34.290> do<00:03:34.350> there<00:03:34.769> as

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
can transform what they do there as

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.920 
can transform what they do there as
behavioral<00:03:35.670> patterns<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.269> see<00:03:36.750> the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
behavioral patterns and see the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.120 
behavioral patterns and see the
effectiveness<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.650> change<00:03:37.890> taking

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
effectiveness and the change taking

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.400 
effectiveness and the change taking
place<00:03:38.220> in<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.609> environment<00:03:38.850> too<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.410> think

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
place in that environment too I think

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.340 
place in that environment too I think
the<00:03:40.530> biggest<00:03:40.650> success<00:03:41.160> would<00:03:41.430> be<00:03:41.459> one<00:03:41.940> of

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
the biggest success would be one of

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.599 
the biggest success would be one of
during<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.410> refurbishment<00:03:43.950> programme<00:03:44.280> which

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
is journey between five and seven years

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.050 
is journey between five and seven years
every<00:03:46.680> five<00:03:46.859> or<00:03:46.920> seven<00:03:47.310> years<00:03:47.340> one<00:03:47.670> would<00:03:47.880> go

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
every five or seven years one would go

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.340 
every five or seven years one would go
through<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.329> refurbishment<00:03:48.750> programme<00:03:49.019> within
