00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
disciple something like hibernation

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.240 
disciple something like hibernation
okay<00:04:44.530> let's<00:04:44.800> try<00:04:45.100> my<00:04:45.520> properties

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:58.640 

test<00:04:49.050> give<00:04:50.050> us<00:04:50.139> rounders

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:32.890 

you

it's<00:05:35.759> really<00:05:35.939> great<00:05:37.729> okay<00:05:38.729> what<00:05:39.000> we<00:05:39.150> see<00:05:39.360> here

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
it's really great okay what we see here

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.689 
it's really great okay what we see here
wean<00:05:40.379> doses<00:05:41.539> 12<00:05:42.539> gigs<00:05:43.129> 64-bit<00:05:44.129> windows<00:05:46.699> ce

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
wean doses 12 gigs 64-bit windows ce

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:56.559 
wean doses 12 gigs 64-bit windows ce
soir<00:05:48.439> 64<00:05:49.439> but<00:05:50.099> there's<00:05:50.280> lots<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:51.169> -<00:05:53.330> okay

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:03.399 

in<00:05:57.569> there<00:05:57.960> is<00:05:58.110> patch<00:05:58.439> file<00:06:00.259> for<00:06:01.259> gigs

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
in there is patch file for gigs

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.649 
in there is patch file for gigs
that's<00:06:04.409> good<00:06:04.650> sure<00:06:05.330> to<00:06:06.330> make<00:06:06.569> it<00:06:06.599> smaller

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
that's good sure to make it smaller

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.580 
that's good sure to make it smaller
probably<00:06:09.659> I<00:06:09.719> can<00:06:10.099> put<00:06:11.099> it<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.400> one<00:06:11.610> gig<00:06:11.909> and

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
probably I can put it to one gig and

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.499 
probably I can put it to one gig and
here<00:06:13.590> is<00:06:13.710> hibernation<00:06:14.550> file<00:06:14.819> I'm<00:06:15.060> not<00:06:15.210> quite

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
here is hibernation file I'm not quite

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:23.269 
here is hibernation file I'm not quite
sure<00:06:15.539> I<00:06:15.750> can<00:06:16.050> delete<00:06:16.349> it<00:06:16.409> in<00:06:17.219> this<00:06:17.580> way<00:06:22.279> it's

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:23.279 
sure I can delete it in this way it's

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.939 
sure I can delete it in this way it's
tricky

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
tricky

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:31.219 
tricky
so<00:06:25.949> it's<00:06:26.129> 20<00:06:26.610> gigs<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:29.490> so<00:06:29.849> we<00:06:30.120> can<00:06:30.449> say<00:06:30.810> three

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
so it's 20 gigs and so we can say three

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.070 
so it's 20 gigs and so we can say three
geeks<00:06:31.529> and<00:06:31.830> critics<00:06:32.310> from<00:06:32.669> page<00:06:32.969> four<00:06:33.360> we<00:06:33.779> can

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
geeks and critics from page four we can

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.070 
geeks and critics from page four we can
get<00:06:34.919> six<00:06:35.550> gigs

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.750
