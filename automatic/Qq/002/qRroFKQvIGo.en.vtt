00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.579
 bb1 is not working for you 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:37.230
 put the place bb1 if the numbers 1 are any 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:42.290
 figure up to 16 and 17 naturally can not 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.469
 there are two three 4 5 7 and 16 so for example bb 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.879
 sixteen 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.960
