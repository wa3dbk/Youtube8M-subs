00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.650
 hello everyone I'm aitor and we're here in 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.870
 minecraft an instructed mod that 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.059
 recently came out for version 1.6 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.560
 point 4 and it is in my opinion if I do not 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.529
 they understood is on the screen as 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.420
 always this mod combines two modes the 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.760
 First, take the squid out of the cow 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.760
 that has a life of 20,000 goal that of 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.130
 2 here is the spam and it is assumed that 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.900
 that the mutant can get milk is 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.550
 can ride in a normal way and 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.280
 In addition, obtain the squid and the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.079
 which you can not get until now but 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.720
 good leaving this aside let's 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.820
 expose here the voter that as 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.370
 can see is something particular since 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.850
 has the body of a cow and where 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.370
 should be the head of the cow 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.829
 is the body of the squid that opens and 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.440
 it closes as if they were on the web 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.480
 but it's very funny to see this 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.670
 cow is very fast this is not us 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.320
 will attack but if we interfere 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.719
 while he is there running like a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.909
 crazy with him and is not with his head to 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.690
 Squid will hurt us just like you can 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 ride this mutant as if 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.150
 a normal robe yesterday I'm doing and if 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.510
 they can not kill they're going to get a sack of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.330
 ink and rest like I think you can 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.890
 get more author have milk and neither 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.450
 the squid I estimate that is supposed to be 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.550
 get the chip pepper and right click 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.500
 but I do not play who knows why 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.570
 try and if it works for me 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.310
 tell us we continue here with the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.710
 combination between in the spider and the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.890
 clipper we are not going to take out the spam here 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.980
 and if they manage to kill before taking it out 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.590
 field they will get what is dynamite and 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.890
 a rope here we take it out and how can 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.260
 see has the body of a spider and in the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.540
 head creepers store life 36 and a 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.670
 deceptive attack of two and see why 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.040
 we pass into their lives as you can see 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.870
 being attacked a quick spider and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 explode as clippers and has killed us 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.280
 well we're back and how can you 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.690
 see here is the crater so big that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.970
 has left the tri person can kill 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.610
 return but damage and we continue with the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.130
 next mutant that is one of an elder 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 bad and also 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.830
 with skeleton there is the state has 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.450
 life 60 and a siege attack and if they achieve 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.150
 kill they will get this that would come to be 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.160
 like but the normal so to speak 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.250
 we put and as you can see there is 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.530
 our friend who is not very different or 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.780
 I expected it better but if we went to 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.610
 serve the other side with arrows and if 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.650
 we move away from this will transport you with 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.510
 an internal one and it will kill them of good good 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.130
 after two deaths and many dreams 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.770
 broken we continue with the more big 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.110
 sister who has 500 life and an attack of 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.210
 20 to 40 to begin with we are with being 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.460
 this is the rainforest under more than 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.630
 which is done with two ingots of 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.700
 iron here 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.680
 jon ander vales that we later take 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.570
 four of them a star of 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.810
 underworld and an egg and we already have the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.850
 spam from our friend morbid hobby 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.400
 sister to face it we edit this 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.680
 armor that also comes with the mod it 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.750
 uses the rainbow they get sick is kyle 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.130
 to use good to do those 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.230
 that is to say 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.950
 as a normal armor in the way that 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.180
 they are like it is not very difficult and it is 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.400
 very resistant 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.459
 which is something important for 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.760
 face this voice that is very but very 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.409
 Strong also adds a weapon that he has 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.230
 I had here but it got lost between 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.359
 so many deaths then I have to go back 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.849
 to scale and I hope to find it soon 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.769
 that if this video is not too much 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.120
 long 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:42.060
 and here it is it has a damage of 40 which 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.019
 it makes it very strong good let's expose 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:50.669
 here to our friend and how can you see 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:52.260
 that I can attack the mutant that was the 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:55.019
 of leander skeleton mania has already 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.510
 killed by the way you get that mutant 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.629
 well yes that in the permanent good here 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.879
 is this fellow here and this is not 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.889
 You can kill a normal manner or be 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.530
 without armor or anything we're going to try 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.150
 so that they look good and then 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.719
 let's try it now with the armor 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.879
 I hope not more and so fast this time and 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:17.190
 we are approaching and as you can 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.530
 see is attacking me with fire who 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.349
 know how because I'm a bit away from 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.599
 he we put the water and I hope not 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.810
 come quickly to me if I 'm not 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:30.810
 dead someone comes and has killed me already 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.030
 in one blow very well let's face it 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.860
 now with the armor which I believe 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.860
 it's going to be a bit more difficult for him 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.839
 good gentlemen I've been like 15 minutes 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.639
 fighting with this partner and I have not 

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:48.580
 could follow a lot of damage and he either 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.259
 put the armor is too strong 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.059
 He has attacked me with fire and everything 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.260
 what he has had and this attack again 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:58.810
 since not exploded so far 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.110
 this attack will not kill me for sure 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.090
 in a two by three 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.699
 good 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.230
 let's go now true is downloaded and 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.610
 installation of the mod 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.680

 start they will give click link of 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.340

 participating in a contest and it is 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.880
 important that they vote for the creator and 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.070
 who has worked hard in this mod and 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.940

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.900
 percentage they give to accept and they go to the 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.780
 Minecraft point folder by the way is 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.720
 necessary to have the force installed now

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.190
