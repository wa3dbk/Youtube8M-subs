00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
with exorcists but for me was more

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
with exorcists but for me was more
important<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> understand<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> reasons<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
important to understand the reasons that

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.799 
important to understand the reasons that
would<00:01:00.329> bring<00:01:01.039> those<00:01:02.039> guys<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:03.510> become

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
would bring those guys to become

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.280 
would bring those guys to become
exorcist<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.460> rituals<00:01:06.299> themselves<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
exorcist that the rituals themselves I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.840 
exorcist that the rituals themselves I
mean<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.680> mean<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.900> some

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
mean I mean that is a that is some

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.130 
mean I mean that is a that is some
preparation<00:01:11.850> they<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.360> through<00:01:12.390> but

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
preparation they have to go through but

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
preparation they have to go through but
for<00:01:13.380> me<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.680> more<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.820> interesting<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
for me was more more interesting to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
for me was more more interesting to
understand<00:01:15.840> why<00:01:16.140> would<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.590> something

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
understand why would they do something

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.160 
understand why would they do something
like<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.280> why<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:18.240> devote<00:01:18.990> himself

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
like that why would they devote himself

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.370 
like that why would they devote himself
to<00:01:19.680> fight<00:01:20.280> demons<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.240> know<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.930> help
