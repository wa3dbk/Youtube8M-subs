well I finally got my orange peeler in
the<00:00:02.730> mail<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.200> similar<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.529> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
the mail and this is similar to the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.320 
the mail and this is similar to the
apple<00:00:05.040> peeler<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.549> have<00:00:05.730> except<00:00:06.180> this

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
apple peeler that I have except this

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.390 
apple peeler that I have except this
thing<00:00:06.509> only<00:00:06.720> peels<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.410> doesn't<00:00:07.799> core<00:00:08.160> and

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
thing only peels it doesn't core and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.089 
thing only peels it doesn't core and
slice<00:00:08.550> anything<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:10.230> know<00:00:10.380> me<00:00:10.590> I'm<00:00:10.860> going

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
slice anything and you know me I'm going

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.879 
slice anything and you know me I'm going
to<00:00:11.160> be<00:00:11.250> honest<00:00:11.610> about<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.290> if<00:00:13.290> these<00:00:13.679> people

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
to be honest about this if these people

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.410 
to be honest about this if these people
had<00:00:14.130> any<00:00:14.280> sense<00:00:14.580> they<00:00:14.910> would<00:00:15.059> call<00:00:15.269> this

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
had any sense they would call this

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.150 
had any sense they would call this
something<00:00:15.719> besides<00:00:16.230> an<00:00:16.440> orange<00:00:16.740> peel<00:00:16.949> or

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
something besides an orange peel or

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.429 
something besides an orange peel or
because<00:00:17.520> peeling<00:00:18.449> oranges<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> worst

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
because peeling oranges is the worst

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.779 
because peeling oranges is the worst
thing<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.220> does<00:00:22.100> I'll<00:00:23.100> show<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.550> how

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
thing that it does I'll show you how

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
thing that it does I'll show you how
this<00:00:24.000> works<00:00:24.420> out

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
this works out

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.929 
this works out
unlike<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.090> apple<00:00:27.689> peeler<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:29.220> apple<00:00:29.730> just

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
unlike the apple peeler the apple just

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
unlike the apple peeler the apple just
spins<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:30.810> gets<00:00:31.019> pushed<00:00:31.349> through<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
spins and then gets pushed through the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
spins and then gets pushed through the
the<00:00:32.910> end<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.480> where<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.840> courses<00:00:34.320> sliced<00:00:34.590> well

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the end and where it courses sliced well

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.119 
the end and where it courses sliced well
this<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.670> blade<00:00:36.090> rides<00:00:36.510> along<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.440> shaft

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
this one the blade rides along a shaft

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.260 
this one the blade rides along a shaft
and<00:00:38.579> peels<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.430> uh<00:00:41.460> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and peels and you can see that uh it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.900 
and peels and you can see that uh it
does<00:00:42.510> take<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.780> peel<00:00:43.110> off<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.610> claim

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
does take the peel off and they claim

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.680 
does take the peel off and they claim
that<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.840> best<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:47.010> thin<00:00:47.910> peel<00:00:48.329> at

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that it's best to do a thin peel at

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.900 
that it's best to do a thin peel at
first<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.590> run<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> through<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.309> second

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
first and then run it through a second

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
first and then run it through a second
time<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.829> take<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> pith<00:00:53.219> off<00:00:53.899> well<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.949> took

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
time and take the pith off well it took

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.420 
time and take the pith off well it took
some<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> pith<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
some of the pith off but not all of it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
some of the pith off but not all of it
it<00:00:59.550> didn't<00:00:59.789> still<00:01:00.030> didn't<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.390> deep<00:01:00.600> enough<00:01:01.039> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it didn't still didn't go deep enough to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
it didn't still didn't go deep enough to
get<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.809> rhyme<00:01:04.080> types<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.739> don't

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
get all of that that rhyme types I don't

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.550 
get all of that that rhyme types I don't
know<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> call<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:07.170> didn't<00:01:07.409> take

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
know what you call it but it didn't take

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.140 
know what you call it but it didn't take
it<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.830> off<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> started<00:01:08.729> clogging

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it all off and then it started clogging

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.560 
it all off and then it started clogging
up<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.020> blade<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.890> went<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.330> can

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
up in the blade as I went and so you can

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
up in the blade as I went and so you can
adjust<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> blade<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.710> different

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
adjust the blade to different

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
adjust the blade to different
thicknesses<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.430> after<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.930> never<00:01:24.930> did

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
thicknesses so after this one never did

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
thicknesses so after this one never did
get<00:01:25.380> very<00:01:25.880> complete<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
get very complete as you can see it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.679 
get very complete as you can see it
keeps<00:01:27.689> clogging<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.509> next

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
keeps clogging up for me so on the next

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
keeps clogging up for me so on the next
orange<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.590> set<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> blade<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.280> deeper

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
orange I set the blade a little deeper

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.870 
orange I set the blade a little deeper
and<00:01:33.270> ran<00:01:34.259> another<00:01:34.500> orange<00:01:34.950> through<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> as

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and ran another orange through and as

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.020 
and ran another orange through and as
you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.750> run<00:01:37.310> more<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> run<00:01:38.729> came

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you can see the run more of the run came

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.569 
you can see the run more of the run came
off<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> peel<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.290> time<00:01:41.930> but<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.170> I

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
off with the peel this time but when I

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.850 
off with the peel this time but when I
ran<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> through<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.060> second<00:01:45.479> time<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:46.140> would

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
ran it through the second time it would

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
ran it through the second time it would
only<00:01:47.009> remove<00:01:47.399> part<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> blade

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
only remove part of it and the blade

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.859 
only remove part of it and the blade
kept<00:01:48.869> clogging<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.729> by<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> initially

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
kept clogging up by the way I initially

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.660 
kept clogging up by the way I initially
ordered<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.380> from<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.799> website<00:01:53.220> called

this is what they were talking about or

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.650 
this is what they were talking about or
not<00:03:01.459> but<00:03:02.240> once<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.780> end<00:03:03.560> falls<00:03:04.190> off<00:03:04.580> or<00:03:05.030> comes

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
kind of separated from the orange then

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.960 
kind of separated from the orange then
it's<00:03:09.230> kind<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.500> all<00:03:09.650> lost<00:03:09.980> at<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.490> point<00:03:12.970> but

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
it's kind of all lost at that point but

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.570 
it's kind of all lost at that point but
here's<00:03:14.270> how<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.450> third<00:03:14.930> one<00:03:15.200> goes<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.950> as<00:03:16.370> you

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
here's how the third one goes and as you

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.270 
here's how the third one goes and as you
can<00:03:16.670> see<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.880> was<00:03:17.120> down<00:03:17.480> past<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.290> pith<00:03:18.680> on<00:03:18.950> this

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
can see I was down past the pith on this

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.810 
can see I was down past the pith on this
one

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
one

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.729 
one
I<00:03:20.230> had<00:03:21.230> adjusted<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.769> blade<00:03:22.010> deeper<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:23.739> you

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
I had adjusted the blade deeper and you

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:32.080 
I had adjusted the blade deeper and you
can<00:03:24.920> see<00:03:25.130> how<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.340> went<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:31.459> that's<00:03:31.790> how<00:03:32.030> that

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
can see how that went so that's how that

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.190 
can see how that went so that's how that
peels<00:03:32.810> oranges<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:34.600> don't<00:03:35.600> think<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.989> does<00:03:36.140> a

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
peels oranges I I don't think it does a

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.170 
peels oranges I I don't think it does a
real<00:03:36.380> good<00:03:36.410> job<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:37.100> peeling<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.790> oranges

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
real good job of peeling the oranges

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.100 
real good job of peeling the oranges
actually<00:03:39.580> one<00:03:40.580> thing<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.940> can<00:03:41.180> say<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.570> favor<00:03:41.810> of

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
actually one thing I can say in favor of

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.020 
actually one thing I can say in favor of
peeling<00:03:42.530> oranges<00:03:42.709> on<00:03:43.070> this<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.610> if<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.850> want

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
peeling oranges on this is if you want

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.729 
peeling oranges on this is if you want
them<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.209> make<00:03:44.360> candied<00:03:44.780> orange<00:03:44.959> peels<00:03:45.380> it

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
them to make candied orange peels it

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.290 
them to make candied orange peels it
would<00:03:45.860> be<00:03:45.980> ideal<00:03:46.130> for<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:46.670> because<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.269> can

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
would be ideal for that because you can

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.050 
would be ideal for that because you can
get<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.930> peel<00:03:48.200> off<00:03:48.530> without<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.459> pith<00:03:49.730> and

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
get the peel off without the pith and

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.300 
get the peel off without the pith and
you<00:03:50.870> could<00:03:50.989> do<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.200> same<00:03:51.350> thing<00:03:51.650> for<00:03:51.830> lemons

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
you could do the same thing for lemons

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.199 
you could do the same thing for lemons
now<00:03:53.680> let's<00:03:54.680> peel<00:03:54.980> an<00:03:55.160> apple<00:03:55.519> in<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:55.880> thing

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
now let's peel an apple in this thing

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.170 
now let's peel an apple in this thing
and<00:03:56.510> as<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:56.870> can<00:03:56.959> see<00:03:57.019> that<00:03:57.850> blade<00:03:58.850> rides

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
and as you can see that blade rides

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.990 
and as you can see that blade rides
along<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.780> rod<00:04:00.050> on<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.470> bottom<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.550> travels

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
along that rod on the bottom and travels

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.330 
along that rod on the bottom and travels
down<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.480> side<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:02.750> whatever<00:04:03.620> fruit<00:04:04.070> you're

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
down the side of whatever fruit you're

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.550 
down the side of whatever fruit you're
peeling<00:04:04.850> and<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:05.540> actually<00:04:05.900> does<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.140> real<00:04:06.380> good

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
peeling and it actually does a real good

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.270 
peeling and it actually does a real good
job<00:04:06.739> on<00:04:06.800> apples<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:08.380> here's<00:04:09.380> another<00:04:09.709> apple

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
job on apples and here's another apple

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.070 
job on apples and here's another apple
and<00:04:10.489> this<00:04:10.610> one<00:04:10.850> was<00:04:10.970> kind<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.299> oddly<00:04:11.570> shaped

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080

job of

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.590

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
you know the peel off so now I'm going

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.540

have eyes and I'm in dips and all and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.590 
have eyes and I'm in dips and all and
turns<00:04:34.100> out<00:04:34.250> this<00:04:34.400> was<00:04:34.610> too<00:04:34.820> long<00:04:35.030> for<00:04:35.390> the

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
turns out this was too long for the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.780 
turns out this was too long for the
machine<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.380> had<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.980> cut<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.310> potato<00:04:37.610> in

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
machine so I had to cut the potato in

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.900 
machine so I had to cut the potato in
half<00:04:38.030> as<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:39.830> can<00:04:39.980> see<00:04:40.190> though<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.640> does<00:04:40.880> a

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
half as you can see though it does a

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.360 
half as you can see though it does a
pretty<00:04:41.330> good<00:04:41.420> job<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.900> pill<00:04:42.110> imitators<00:04:42.800> even

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
pretty good job of pill imitators even

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.000 
pretty good job of pill imitators even
with<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.790> eyes<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:43.940> all<00:04:44.650> there<00:04:45.650> wasn't<00:04:45.950> a

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
with the eyes and all there wasn't a

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.980 
with the eyes and all there wasn't a
whole<00:04:46.190> lot<00:04:46.220> left<00:04:46.760> that<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.120> would<00:04:47.420> have<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.750> peel

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
whole lot left that I would have to peel

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.200 
whole lot left that I would have to peel
off<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:48.650> would<00:04:48.860> have<00:04:48.980> to<00:04:49.070> peel<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.430> ends<00:04:49.970> and

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
off I would have to peel the ends and

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.750 
off I would have to peel the ends and
just<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.350> few<00:04:51.560> little<00:04:51.650> places<00:04:51.950> there<00:04:52.490> but

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
just a few little places there but

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.660 
just a few little places there but
that's<00:04:53.150> not<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.600> bad<00:04:53.900> deal<00:04:54.200> for<00:04:54.740> potatoes<00:04:55.400> in<00:04:55.640> my

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
that's not a bad deal for potatoes in my

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.140 
that's not a bad deal for potatoes in my
opinion<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:57.250> here's<00:04:58.250> how<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.520> other<00:04:58.850> half

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
opinion and here's how the other half

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.130 
opinion and here's how the other half
went<00:05:00.940> it<00:05:01.940> actually<00:05:02.300> took<00:05:02.480> everything<00:05:02.780> off<00:05:03.080> of

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
went it actually took everything off of

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.940 
went it actually took everything off of
them<00:05:03.470> this<00:05:03.740> other<00:05:03.950> half<00:05:05.410> so<00:05:06.410> I'll<00:05:06.680> definitely

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
them this other half so I'll definitely

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.970 
them this other half so I'll definitely
use<00:05:07.250> this<00:05:07.670> to<00:05:07.910> peel<00:05:08.120> potatoes<00:05:08.170> for<00:05:09.170> um<00:05:09.530> canning

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
with this little gadget but I definitely

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.960 
with this little gadget but I definitely
would<00:05:20.300> not<00:05:20.450> call<00:05:20.720> it<00:05:20.960> an<00:05:21.080> orange<00:05:21.260> peeler<00:05:21.970> hope

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
would not call it an orange peeler hope

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.660 
would not call it an orange peeler hope
it<00:05:23.180> helps
