00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
we do a great job but I think they're

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.040 
we do a great job but I think they're
instructing<00:01:34.820> staff<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.330> awesome<00:01:35.840> at<00:01:35.930> what

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
instructing staff is awesome at what

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.750 
instructing staff is awesome at what
they<00:01:36.200> do<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.920> think<00:01:37.100> that's<00:01:37.250> what<00:01:37.400> sets<00:01:37.610> us

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
they do and I think that's what sets us

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.010 
they do and I think that's what sets us
apart<00:01:37.880> from<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.270> other<00:01:38.360> schools<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:38.900> are
