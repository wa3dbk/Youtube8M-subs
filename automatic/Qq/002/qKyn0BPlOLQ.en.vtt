00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.810
 first proud of the team 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.870
 because really the effort that is 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.990
 doing for 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.960
 to reverse a lot of situations and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.090
 know that you are among the four best 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.240
 of this cup so very proud of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.630
 they explained to him that the adversary that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.120
 we were going to find is surely the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670
 best in the world because how does the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.190
 capacity that he had we had talked about 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 last week of the past days that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 We were going to face the best team and 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.570
 really today they were very superior in 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 everything handled the times the ball the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 I rest recovery but I 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.520
 I feel very proud of the team because 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.740
 the delivery he had and how he did it 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.100
 and since the cup began, not only 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.489
 this party but since the beginning of 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.520
 cup the attitude that had the dignity that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.990
 he had and I'm really happy 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.450
 with the team I think it was a 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.330
 huge experience for us to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.120
 the whole group felt the effort because 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.310
 We always had to travel to look for the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.080
 result but it 's a nice experience 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 because to find him play against 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.490
 better equipment this gives you gives you to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.990
 improve a lot of things for the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.030
 future of souls and that of the 970 profe 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.950
 how are you doing what you're profe I speak 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.170
 general in the performance of Paraguay in 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 this cup america and with respect to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.430
 today's match because it could not be more is 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.690
 true incredible things happened 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.229
 mainly the first stage two 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.180
 lessons required changes exactly 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.130
 because it was not possible anymore in the night today 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.340
 and mainly because it faces a 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.250
 team that comes with a lot of work 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.870
 it has been known for a long time 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.950
 of playing the world cup comes out 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.030
 second has high-flying players of 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.340
 high 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.770
 really a lot of category that they handle 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.230
 the times the ball the acceleration the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.380
 rest is a team with a lot 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.690
 experience and it 's really very difficult to 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.630
 times against a team that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.310
 I played well I think the team gave a 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.340
 demonstration is I believe in the first time 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.190
 when we were going 2 to 1 try 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.110
 recover yourself sometimes end 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.450
 but when a team in this category 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.690
 and from this level you disarm what happens 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.690
 He passed
