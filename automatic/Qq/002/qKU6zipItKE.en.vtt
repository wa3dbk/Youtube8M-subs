00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
this thing and really just to think that

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.620 
this thing and really just to think that
it<00:02:10.860> was<00:02:10.950> maybe<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.730> us<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.269> did<00:02:12.480> all

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
it was maybe just one of us that did all

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.390 
it was maybe just one of us that did all
this<00:02:12.780> work<00:02:12.989> it's<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.380> culmination<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
this work it's a culmination of the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.220 
this work it's a culmination of the
entire<00:02:14.700> problem<00:02:15.030> then

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
entire problem then

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.140 
entire problem then
so<00:02:17.500> how<00:02:17.740> was<00:02:17.980> working<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.580> project<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
so how was working on this project a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.520 
so how was working on this project a
little<00:02:19.240> bit<00:02:19.420> different<00:02:19.810> than<00:02:20.020> doing<00:02:20.380> like

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
little bit different than doing like

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.110 
little bit different than doing like
some<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.860> private<00:02:21.220> commissions<00:02:21.760> or<00:02:21.970> like

I know that you guys were involved in
the<00:02:23.650> Jeremy<00:02:23.920> Bulloch<00:02:24.100> project<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.790> was<00:02:24.940> a

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
the Jeremy Bulloch project that was a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.990 
the Jeremy Bulloch project that was a
great<00:02:25.180> big<00:02:25.390> huge<00:02:25.810> success<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.430> amazing

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
great big huge success in a just amazing

great big huge success in a just amazing
experience<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.540> be<00:02:28.630> involved<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:29.080> how<00:02:29.710> is

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
experience to be involved in how is

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.800 
experience to be involved in how is
working<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.790> little<00:02:31.090> different<00:02:31.630> than

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
working on this a little different than

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.600 
working on this a little different than
doing<00:02:31.990> those<00:02:32.410> kind<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.920> projects<00:02:33.340> well<00:02:33.459> you

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
doing those kind of projects well you

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.270 
doing those kind of projects well you
have<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.880> think<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.600> terms<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:35.170> okay<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:35.830> this

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
have to think in terms of okay so this

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.710 
have to think in terms of okay so this
is<00:02:36.459> going<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.790> be<00:02:36.940> something<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.360> someone's

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
is going to be something that someone's

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.420 
is going to be something that someone's
going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.930> purchase<00:02:38.140> which<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.280> this

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
going to purchase which is this is this

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.060 
going to purchase which is this is this
is<00:02:39.610> for<00:02:40.080> as<00:02:41.080> far<00:02:41.290> as<00:02:41.380> price<00:02:41.590> point<00:02:41.800> by<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.950> way

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
is for as far as price point by the way

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.870 
is for as far as price point by the way
we<00:02:42.190> have<00:02:42.340> no<00:02:42.550> clue<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.580> think<00:02:45.790> in

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
we have no clue but you have to think in

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.010 
we have no clue but you have to think in
terms<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.180> how<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:46.660> going<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.930> be

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
terms of how is this going to be

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.350 
terms of how is this going to be
replicated<00:02:47.760> how<00:02:48.760> are<00:02:48.820> we<00:02:48.970> gonna<00:02:49.060> get<00:02:49.209> the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
replicated how are we gonna get the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.500 
replicated how are we gonna get the
exact<00:02:50.100> piece<00:02:51.100> every<00:02:51.430> single<00:02:51.730> time<00:02:51.940> what's<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
exact piece every single time what's the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.820 
exact piece every single time what's the
best<00:02:52.720> way<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.870> do<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.470> then<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.680> course

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
best way to do that and then of course

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.710 
best way to do that and then of course
that<00:02:53.950> gets<00:02:54.190> sent<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:55.090> China<00:02:55.330> and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
that gets sent to to China and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.630 
that gets sent to to China and
replicated<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.410> we<00:02:56.560> have<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.830> dumb<00:02:57.070> down<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.340> lot

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
replicated so we have to dumb down a lot

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.490 
replicated so we have to dumb down a lot
of<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.850> ways<00:02:58.270> that<00:02:58.300> we<00:02:58.600> did<00:02:58.750> stuff<00:02:59.020> okay

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
of the ways that we did stuff okay

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.620 
of the ways that we did stuff okay
there's<00:02:59.800> a<00:02:59.860> or<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.520> would<00:03:00.940> say<00:03:01.090> at<00:03:01.239> this<00:03:01.360> point

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
there's a or I would say at this point

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.260 
there's a or I would say at this point
and<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.680> chest<00:03:02.920> piece<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.489> in<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.880> helmet

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
and in the chest piece and in the helmet

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.020 
and in the chest piece and in the helmet
which<00:03:04.720> we<00:03:05.020> paint<00:03:05.320> in<00:03:05.950> which<00:03:06.100> we<00:03:06.280> assemble<00:03:06.700> just

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
which we paint in which we assemble just

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.449 
which we paint in which we assemble just
the<00:03:07.660> fact<00:03:07.870> though<00:03:08.050> this<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:09.010> how<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.310> see

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
the fact though this is how you see

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.160 
the fact though this is how you see
replicated<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.180> it'll<00:03:10.390> look<00:03:10.510> exactly<00:03:10.660> like

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
replicated so it'll look exactly like

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.070 
replicated so it'll look exactly like
what<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:12.160> looks<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:12.459> today<00:03:12.850> an<00:03:13.000> example<00:03:13.989> of

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
what this looks like today an example of

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.100 
what this looks like today an example of
the<00:03:14.200> scratches<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:15.520> use<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.940> format<00:03:16.510> where<00:03:17.080> we

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
the scratches we use the format where we

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.860 
the scratches we use the format where we
basically<00:03:17.470> put<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.920> vinyl<00:03:18.250> sticker<00:03:18.640> or<00:03:19.420> the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
basically put a vinyl sticker or the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.170 
basically put a vinyl sticker or the
gray<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.500> yellow<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.610> silver<00:03:22.030> on

gray and the yellow and the silver on
top<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.600> that<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.200> that's<00:03:23.320> essentially<00:03:23.769> what

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
top of that and that's essentially what

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.930 
top of that and that's essentially what
they're<00:03:24.010> gonna<00:03:24.160> do<00:03:24.400> with<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.670> production

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
they're gonna do with the production

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.380 
they're gonna do with the production
fees<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:26.680> get<00:03:26.890> every<00:03:27.190> scratch<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.820> iconic

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
fees to get every scratch the iconic

fees to get every scratch the iconic
scratches<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.019> we're<00:03:29.170> looking<00:03:29.380> at<00:03:29.500> like<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
scratches that we're looking at like the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.370 
scratches that we're looking at like the

so one of the features that I do like

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.510 
so one of the features that I do like
the<00:04:28.840> best<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.910> through<00:04:30.910> Tom<00:04:31.150> subpoenas

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
the best is through Tom subpoenas

the best is through Tom subpoenas
collaboration<00:04:33.520> was<00:04:34.150> that<00:04:34.389> on<00:04:34.960> some<00:04:35.349> of<00:04:35.410> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
collaboration was that on some of the

to work great belonging from the

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.200 
to work great belonging from the
continuity<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:45.130> so<00:04:45.699> one<00:04:46.000> of<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.120> features

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
continuity and so one of the features

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.570 
continuity and so one of the features
that<00:04:46.360> we<00:04:46.539> put<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.990> actual<00:04:47.380> fete<00:04:48.250> itself

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
that we put on the actual fete itself

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.550 
that we put on the actual fete itself
was<00:04:48.729> that<00:04:48.909> and<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.599> Carbonite<00:04:50.020> scene<00:04:50.260> which

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
was that and the Carbonite scene which

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.230 
was that and the Carbonite scene which
is<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.039> base<00:04:51.190> is<00:04:51.220> based<00:04:51.610> off<00:04:51.849> of<00:04:51.880> the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
is that the base is based off of the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.279 
is that the base is based off of the
knees<00:04:53.050> in<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.979> hole<00:04:54.130> see<00:04:54.400> were<00:04:54.550> upside<00:04:55.090> down

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
knees in that hole see were upside down

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.360 
knees in that hole see were upside down
what<00:04:56.289> we<00:04:56.409> think<00:04:56.680> they're<00:04:56.800> upside<00:04:57.130> down

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
what we think they're upside down

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.710 
what we think they're upside down
so<00:04:57.580> we<00:04:57.729> got<00:04:57.909> people<00:04:58.090> II<00:04:58.240> don't<00:04:58.360> know<00:04:58.539> whether

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
so we got people II don't know whether

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.820 
so we got people II don't know whether
it's<00:04:58.900> right<00:04:59.050> or<00:04:59.080> wrong

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it's right or wrong

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.230 
it's right or wrong
the<00:05:00.190> point<00:05:00.400> is<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:00.639> that<00:05:00.669> this<00:05:00.879> is<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.060> nice

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
the point is is that this is a nice
