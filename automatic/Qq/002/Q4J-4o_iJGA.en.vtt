00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
picture it Crosby Crosby I don't know

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.260

you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> good<00:00:36.090> argument

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you can you can have a good argument

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.819 
you can you can have a good argument
against<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> Crosby<00:00:37.530> hit<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:39.829> personally

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
against the Crosby hit and I personally

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.729 
against the Crosby hit and I personally
think<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.430> somewhat<00:00:41.850> his<00:00:42.030> fault<00:00:42.410> but<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
think it was somewhat his fault but I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.420 
think it was somewhat his fault but I
think<00:00:44.579> David<00:00:44.910> Steckel<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.420> still<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> blame

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
think David Steckel is still to blame

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.250 
think David Steckel is still to blame
also<00:00:47.430> look<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> marc<00:00:48.059> savard<00:00:48.270> hit<00:00:48.690> Matt

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
also look at the marc savard hit Matt

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.630 
also look at the marc savard hit Matt
Cooke<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.460> was<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.300> dirty<00:00:51.660> hit<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.289> was

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
Cooke that was a dirty hit that was

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.689 
Cooke that was a dirty hit that was
intentional<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> head<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.739> those

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
intentional for the head to that those

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.420 
intentional for the head to that those
kinds<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.090> hits<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:58.350> she'd<00:00:59.219> like

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
kinds of hits I think she'd like

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.279 
kinds of hits I think she'd like
literally<00:01:00.120> kick<00:01:00.390> out<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> play<00:01:00.840> keep<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
player out of bleep I think that she

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.500
