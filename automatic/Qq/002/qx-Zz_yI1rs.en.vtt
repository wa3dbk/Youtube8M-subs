00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
time in this program I've gotten to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.980 
time in this program I've gotten to
learn<00:01:10.000> quite<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.300> bit<00:01:10.390> about<00:01:10.509> all<00:01:10.869> the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
learn quite a bit about all the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.210 
learn quite a bit about all the
different<00:01:11.080> types<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.649> food<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:11.860> cooking

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
different types of food and cooking

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.460 
different types of food and cooking
methods<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.850> whatnot<00:01:13.149> but<00:01:13.479> I'd<00:01:13.780> say<00:01:14.050> if<00:01:14.229> I<00:01:14.320> had

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
methods and whatnot but I'd say if I had

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.249 
methods and whatnot but I'd say if I had
to<00:01:14.560> pinpoint<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:15.130> my<00:01:15.509> best<00:01:16.509> thing<00:01:16.780> would<00:01:17.080> be

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
to pinpoint it my best thing would be

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.070 
to pinpoint it my best thing would be
the<00:01:17.460> baking<00:01:18.460> portion<00:01:18.789> pies<00:01:19.149> pastries<00:01:19.539> cookies

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
the baking portion pies pastries cookies

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.770 
the baking portion pies pastries cookies
cakes<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.800> whatnot<00:01:21.100> I'm<00:01:21.789> considering<00:01:22.450> taking

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
cakes and whatnot I'm considering taking

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.840 
cakes and whatnot I'm considering taking
the<00:01:23.170> pastry<00:01:23.680> program<00:01:24.009> as<00:01:24.100> well<00:01:24.250> after<00:01:24.759> I'm

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
the pastry program as well after I'm

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.350 
the pastry program as well after I'm
done<00:01:25.030> with<00:01:25.180> it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
done with it

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.880 
done with it
and<00:01:25.539> eventually<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.140> think<00:01:26.259> it<00:01:26.500> would<00:01:26.590> be<00:01:26.710> very

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
and eventually I think it would be very

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.060 
and eventually I think it would be very
cool<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:27.690> just<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.750> good<00:01:28.930> step<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.470> possibly

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
cool and just a good step to possibly

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.070 
cool and just a good step to possibly
owning<00:01:30.430> my<00:01:30.580> own<00:01:30.610> bakery<00:01:30.940> one<00:01:31.240> day<00:01:31.390> culinary

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
did my research I even went to a

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.089 
did my research I even went to a
different<00:02:02.289> state<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.649> go<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.800> some

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
different state to go to some

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.100 
different state to go to some
researchers<00:02:03.459> and<00:02:03.970> if<00:02:04.450> you're<00:02:04.750> into<00:02:04.990> the

researchers and if you're into the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.139 
researchers and if you're into the
patient<00:02:05.470> program<00:02:05.770> this<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.489> the<00:02:06.700> best<00:02:06.940> patient

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
patient program this is the best patient

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.639 
patient program this is the best patient
program<00:02:07.569> that<00:02:07.690> I've<00:02:07.810> came<00:02:08.050> across<00:02:08.229> here<00:02:08.560> as

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
program that I've came across here as

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.640 
program that I've came across here as
far<00:02:08.860> as<00:02:09.060> devotion<00:02:10.060> dedication<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.230> classes

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
far as devotion dedication the classes

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.380 
far as devotion dedication the classes
are<00:02:11.770> not<00:02:11.890> as<00:02:12.069> big<00:02:12.280> they<00:02:12.489> are<00:02:12.520> smaller<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.239> what

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
are not as big they are smaller so what

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.620 
are not as big they are smaller so what
does<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.510> mean<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.870> means<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.560> little<00:02:14.860> more

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
does that mean that means a little more

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.990 
does that mean that means a little more
dedication<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.780> per<00:02:16.930> students<00:02:17.410> it's<00:02:17.500> more

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
dedication to per students it's more

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.220 
dedication to per students it's more
hands-on<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.209> individuals<00:02:19.810> that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
hands-on to individuals that

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.170 
hands-on to individuals that
would<00:02:20.319> be<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> bigger<00:02:20.680> class<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.610> remember<00:02:22.030> we

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
would be a bigger class so remember we

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.920 
would be a bigger class so remember we
