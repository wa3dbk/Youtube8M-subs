so that's the a section now we've got we

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
so that's the a section now we've got we
have<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> bridge<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:19.759> half<00:01:20.759> diminished

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
seven and that's G minor and then you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.870 
seven and that's G minor and then you
can<00:01:30.869> also<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.229> 13<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> bottom<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:34.880> C

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
can also have 13 on the bottom there C

this<00:01:43.649> time<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> make<00:01:44.939> sure<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.210> notice

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
this time now to make sure you notice

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.840 
this time now to make sure you notice
how<00:01:45.659> there's<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> major<00:01:46.259> 7<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> 1<00:01:46.950> 3<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.789> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
how there's the major 7 the 1 3 and the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.319 
how there's the major 7 the 1 3 and the
5<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.840> now<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.679> a<00:01:53.149> half<00:01:54.149> diminished

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
5 there so now that's a half diminished

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:03.440 
5 there so now that's a half diminished
to<00:01:57.740> d7<00:01:58.740> flat<00:01:58.890> 9<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.640> now<00:02:02.789> this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.209> tricky

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to d7 flat 9 so now this is the tricky

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.999 
to d7 flat 9 so now this is the tricky
part<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.720> is<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> walk<00:02:04.049> down<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:05.009> G<00:02:05.640> minor

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
part this is the walk down the G minor

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.309 
part this is the walk down the G minor
but<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:09.090> F<00:02:09.360> sharp<00:02:11.480> augmented<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:13.140> F

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
but then it's F sharp augmented to F

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:21.770 
but then it's F sharp augmented to F
minor<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.420> then<00:02:15.980> augment<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:21.510> back

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
minor so and then augment it then back

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.680 
minor so and then augment it then back
to<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.510> half<00:02:27.900> diminished<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:29.690> d7

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
to the a the a half diminished to d7

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.460 
to the a the a half diminished to d7
with<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.320> flat<00:02:31.530> 9<00:02:35.810> ok<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.989> know<00:02:37.109> that<00:02:37.140> went

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
with the flat 9 ok so I know that went

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.660 
with the flat 9 ok so I know that went
by<00:02:37.560> rather<00:02:37.709> quickly<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.340> may<00:02:38.459> want<00:02:38.609> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
by rather quickly so you may want to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.069 
by rather quickly so you may want to
like<00:02:39.030> kind<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.450> go<00:02:39.569> through<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> couple

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
like kind of go through that a couple

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.860 
like kind of go through that a couple
times<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.299> is<00:02:42.359> what<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.660> sounds

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
times but now this is what it sounds

00:02:42.870 --> 00:03:41.009 
times but now this is what it sounds
like<00:02:42.900> when<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.170> play<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.769> at<00:02:44.160> tempo

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.530 

um<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.650> now<00:03:42.680> I'm<00:03:43.010> also<00:03:43.129> gonna<00:03:43.310> run<00:03:44.299> through<00:03:44.450> it

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
um so now I'm also gonna run through it

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.030 
um so now I'm also gonna run through it
once<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.900> can<00:03:44.930> see<00:03:45.230> how<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.590> works<00:03:45.739> with<00:03:45.920> the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
once you can see how it works with the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.089 
once you can see how it works with the
base<00:03:46.220> notes<00:03:46.599> so<00:03:47.599> I'll<00:03:48.290> be<00:03:48.470> playing<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:48.859> bass

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
base notes so I'll be playing the bass

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.330 
base notes so I'll be playing the bass
in<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.400> left<00:03:49.579> hand<00:03:49.819> now<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:51.859> chords<00:03:52.220> in

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
in the left hand now and the chords in

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.059 
in the left hand now and the chords in
the<00:03:52.489> right<00:03:52.639> hand<00:03:52.909> so<00:03:53.569> it'll<00:03:54.079> be<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:54.859> is<00:03:55.040> the

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
the right hand so it'll be this is the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.339 
the right hand so it'll be this is the
first<00:03:55.340> chord<00:03:55.579> it's<00:03:56.180> just<00:03:56.359> a<00:03:56.420> two<00:03:56.599> five<00:03:56.810> one<00:03:59.349> to

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
first chord it's just a two five one to

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.069 
first chord it's just a two five one to
B<00:04:00.500> flat<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.069> then<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> two<00:04:01.970> five<00:04:02.180> one<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:05.900> G

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
B flat and then a two five one to G

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.360 
B flat and then a two five one to G
minor<00:04:06.319> that's<00:04:06.650> how<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.829> whole<00:04:07.010> song<00:04:07.220> is

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
minor that's how the whole song is

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.539 
minor that's how the whole song is
constructed<00:04:07.939> pretty<00:04:08.150> much<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:10.129> then<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.459> do

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
constructed pretty much and then you do

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.539 
constructed pretty much and then you do
that<00:04:10.699> again<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.449> two<00:04:12.109> which<00:04:12.859> is<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.099> C<00:04:13.340> minor

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
that again the two which is the C minor

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.170 
that again the two which is the C minor
nine<00:04:14.919> to<00:04:15.919> the<00:04:16.039> F<00:04:16.190> which<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.760> could<00:04:16.910> also<00:04:17.000> have

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
nine to the F which you could also have

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.159

I<00:04:28.639> left<00:04:28.900> mine<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:31.659> back<00:04:32.659> to<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.900> gene<00:04:33.110> then

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
I left mine and back to the gene then

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.909 
I left mine and back to the gene then
the<00:04:33.560> bridge<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:34.099> just<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.610> two<00:04:34.760> tied<00:04:35.030> one<00:04:35.300> to<00:04:35.919> G

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
the bridge is just the two tied one to G

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.050 
the bridge is just the two tied one to G
and<00:04:37.220> then<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.120> two<00:04:38.240> five<00:04:38.419> one<00:04:38.539> to<00:04:38.659> B<00:04:38.780> flat
