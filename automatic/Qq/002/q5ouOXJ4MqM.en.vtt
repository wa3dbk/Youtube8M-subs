00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.180
 hi all the guys here is fixed 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.560
 gaming and today I present 9 of fifa 13 e 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.690
 with this video start a new one 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.019
 series that will be called to school with fifa 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.900
 where I will show you in these videos how 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.390
 improve in the game with various games 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.150
 short strategies of tricks and of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 away today so I'll talk about 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 optimal controller settings from 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.439
 use and then start immediately with the first 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.050
 setting that will be the change 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.309
 automatic and I advise you to put it up 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 high balls as often as the cpc 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.500
 the player changes and we can't 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.600
 then to check optimally and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.450
 also in the cross then when there will be 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.520
 some high balls will move there 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.370
 it will then immediately move to the player 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.399
 closer to the ball and here instead 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.320
 we do limited in what we can 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 be more flexible with the player 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.570
 move it as we want strength help 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.960
 passages we do as it is better 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.930
 which says send you the upload of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.570
 passage and here we go all his own 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.170
 witnessed that I think it is already from 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.320
 default but some people and play 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.290
 better with the manual as they can 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.450
 decide them and there are people 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.720
 who play better with witness 3 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.520
 with manual is like a little to say with the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.130
 cod sensitivity 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.140
 there are those who play better with sensitivity 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.540
 high instead there are those who play better with 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.509
 the low one 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.479
 and then here let's move on to the cross and 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.360
 we put seeds this is a setting 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.820
 very important as we could 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.570
 to decide 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.540
 loading the cross while it is 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.180
 we leave his client we will leave that 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.869
 we no longer control loading and often 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.040
 the crosses will be a little bit wrong 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.310
 in conclusion 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.180
 and then here we assisted witness 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.430
 also on the goalkeeper and then the shot 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.970
 analogue we do no and defense 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.150
 tactics 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.000
 let's leave that default e 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.520
