my<00:01:20.340> recommendation<00:01:20.430> could<00:01:21.000> work<00:01:21.180> through<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
my recommendation could work through a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.749 
my recommendation could work through a
lot<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.630> muscle<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.470> train<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.280> people<00:01:23.610> who

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
lot of muscle go train with people who

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210 
lot of muscle go train with people who
got<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.479> muscle<00:01:24.900> train<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.500> more<00:01:25.680> time<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
got a muscle train with more time and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.399 
got a muscle train with more time and
you'll<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.000> lot<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> muscle<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.720> train<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you'll get a lot of muscle I train the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.230 
you'll get a lot of muscle I train the
fastest<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.100> us<00:01:29.250> around<00:01:29.490> that's<00:01:30.030> why<00:01:30.180> I'm

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
fastest like us around that's why I'm

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.469 
fastest like us around that's why I'm
good<00:01:30.420> cyclist<00:01:30.810> cuz<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.040> training
