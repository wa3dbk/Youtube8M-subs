real difference between them bleached
and<00:00:36.960> unbleached<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.559> pretty<00:00:37.800> well<00:00:38.010> obvious

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and unbleached just pretty well obvious

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.830 
and unbleached just pretty well obvious
I<00:00:41.059> can't<00:00:42.059> remember<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.660> they

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I can't remember what it is they

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
I can't remember what it is they
actually<00:00:43.020> used<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> bleach<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.100> make<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
actually used to bleach it to make the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.220 
actually used to bleach it to make the
color<00:00:44.789> brighter<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.660> always<00:00:46.079> buy

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
color brighter but I always buy

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.080 
color brighter but I always buy
unbleached<00:00:46.590> flour<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> choice<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
unbleached flour if I have a choice and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.540 
unbleached flour if I have a choice and
then<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.289> bread<00:00:49.530> flour<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> higher

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
then the bread flour has a higher

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
then the bread flour has a higher
protein<00:00:51.539> content<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> higher<00:00:52.440> gluten

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
protein content or a higher gluten

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
protein content or a higher gluten
content<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.760> talked<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.030> gluten<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
content we just talked about gluten in a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.990 
content we just talked about gluten in a
previous<00:00:55.230> video<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.760> more

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
previous video and and so you get more

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.229 
previous video and and so you get more
of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> elasticity<00:01:01.160> stretchiness<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> in

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of the elasticity stretchiness in the in

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.340 
of the elasticity stretchiness in the in
the<00:01:03.780> bread<00:01:04.379> flour<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.760> found<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.810> I

hard wheat has more gluten more
stretchiness<00:01:43.409> hard<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.399> generally<00:01:45.119> used

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
stretchiness hard we just generally used

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.420 
stretchiness hard we just generally used
for<00:01:45.540> bread<00:01:45.720> flour<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.770> soft<00:01:47.040> wheat<00:01:47.280> is

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
for bread flour the soft wheat is

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.010 
for bread flour the soft wheat is
generally<00:01:48.030> used<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.329> pastry<00:01:48.960> flour<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:51.020> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
generally used for pastry flour so the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.399 
generally used for pastry flour so the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.980 
leading name-brand flour in the United
States<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.610> told<00:01:56.909> has<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> combination<00:01:57.509> of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
States I was told has a combination of

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.910 
States I was told has a combination of
both<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.530> has<00:01:58.710> soft<00:01:59.509> wheat<00:02:00.509> flour<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> hard

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
both it has soft wheat flour and hard

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.270 
both it has soft wheat flour and hard
wheat<00:02:02.310> flour<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.110> use<00:02:04.110> all-purpose<00:02:04.439> flour<00:02:04.890> most

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
wheat flour I use all-purpose flour most

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.749 
wheat flour I use all-purpose flour most
of<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> time<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.090> my<00:02:06.240> French<00:02:06.570> bread<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.759> I

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
of the time for my French bread and I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.550 
of the time for my French bread and I
have<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.330> good<00:02:09.420> results<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
have really good results with it so I

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
have really good results with it so I
haven't<00:02:11.039> gone<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.280> my<00:02:11.430> way<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:12.000> get<00:02:12.180> the
