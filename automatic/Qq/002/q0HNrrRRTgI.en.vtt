00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.280
 hello everyone I want to share with 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.009
 you are good news 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.889
 surely many know what gel 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:15.669
 damping plugs for drums and 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.880
 plates so recently I bought a great 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.360
 a set of such caps for only 80 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.960
 rubles 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.060
 it turned out that such things are sold in 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.210
 jewelry store for holidays and 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.330
 This toy is called developing 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.859
 for glass and other hard surfaces 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.949
 we are well suited 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:39.149
 I think because we will play and 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.109
 various shapes and colors will develop 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.480
 literally for every taste 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.909
 which will definitely help you create 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.909
 positive attitude during class is 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.960
 the product is simply cleaned with water 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:55.600
 pollution and regains the necessary 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.909
 flexibility and the most important thing is that they 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.780
 really great with 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.729
 eliminating unwanted sustain 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.939
 drums and cymbals and it is very important 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.689
 with studio recording and live performances 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.689
 sounds too 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 the sound engineer will be much easier 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.020
 output the correct sound if your drum 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.680
 or the plate will not give too much 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.680
 sustain 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.680
 best to stick this damper 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.110
 on the back of the plate so as not to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.360
 hit him with a stick while playing 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.450
 and the closer to the edge of the plate 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.850
 you stick this damper 7 he's bigger 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.400
 drown out the plate I must say that with 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.000
 the back of the plate holds this 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.229
 damper 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.229
 pretty good 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.110
 these things keep well on the resonator 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.570
 us plastics 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.580
 besides if you stick that 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:28.090
 damper in the center of the resonator plastic 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.090
 then the sound of the house will drop by whole tons 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.549
 at the same time feeling while hitting that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.480
 change and become more viscous in 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.150
 in general it can be very easy 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.700
 experiment and in the end 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.269
 get the sound you want to new 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.150
 meeting 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:58.090
 in the third season of video lessons which 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.090
 still called just drums
