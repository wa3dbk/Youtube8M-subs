00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
pattern I'm just going to trace over it

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.090 
pattern I'm just going to trace over it
really<00:00:18.180> hard<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.990> see<00:00:19.230> where<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.859> white

lines are this is from the imprint of
tracing<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:24.480> design<00:00:24.660> I've<00:00:25.109> cut<00:00:25.320> out<00:00:25.350> both

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
tracing out my design I've cut out both

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.609 
tracing out my design I've cut out both
sets<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.789> appliques<00:00:27.390> I'm<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> take

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
sets of my appliques I'm going to take

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
sets of my appliques I'm going to take
my<00:00:28.800> pieces<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.029> Center<00:00:30.539> them

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
my pieces and I'm going to Center them

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.530 
my pieces and I'm going to Center them
remember<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.949> our<00:00:32.250> center<00:00:32.820> back<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.420> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
remember this is our center back so you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
remember this is our center back so you
don't<00:00:33.570> want<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> put<00:00:34.140> anything<00:00:34.350> close<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
don't want to put anything close to that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.069 
don't want to put anything close to that
someone<00:00:35.399> put<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.390> middle<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
someone put this right in the middle and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.380 
someone put this right in the middle and
I'm<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> same<00:00:37.860> thing<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
I'm going to do the same thing for the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.180 
I'm going to do the same thing for the
other<00:00:39.420> side<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.379> sure<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.920> you're

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
other side and make sure that you're

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.240 
other side and make sure that you're
mirroring<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.790> pieces<00:00:42.950> because<00:00:43.950> I've<00:00:44.070> got

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
mirroring the pieces because I've got

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.990 
mirroring the pieces because I've got
both<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.520> my<00:00:44.850> boot<00:00:45.090> covers<00:00:45.539> facing<00:00:46.020> each<00:00:46.140> other

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
both of my boot covers facing each other

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.430 
both of my boot covers facing each other
so<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.329> position<00:00:48.870> them<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.170> that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
so I'm going to position them so that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.740 
so I'm going to position them so that
they're<00:00:49.590> about<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> same<00:00:50.579> spot<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.420> I'll

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
they're about in the same spot and I'll

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.689 
they're about in the same spot and I'll
repeat<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> same<00:00:52.530> thing<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> backside

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
repeat the same thing for the backside

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.689 
repeat the same thing for the backside
so<00:00:54.090> I've<00:00:54.539> gotten<00:00:54.870> positioned<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.489> then<00:00:56.640> I'm

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
how did that and I also made one for the

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.240 
how did that and I also made one for the
actual<00:03:54.600> loops<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.080> are<00:03:55.200> gonna<00:03:55.320> go<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.770> the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
actual loops that are gonna go in the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.160 
actual loops that are gonna go in the
back<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:57.090> what<00:03:57.330> I'm<00:03:57.420> going<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.600> do<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.990> I'm

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
back so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.070 
back so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.380> kind<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.680> position<00:03:59.330> how<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.360> want<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
going to kind of position how I want the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.010 
going to kind of position how I want the
boots<00:04:01.350> or<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.250> lace<00:04:02.490> up<00:04:02.790> tie<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.209> be<00:04:03.540> and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
boots or the the lace up tie to be and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.449 
boots or the the lace up tie to be and
that<00:04:04.050> kind<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.410> gives<00:04:04.590> me<00:04:04.650> an<00:04:04.800> idea<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.370> looks

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
that kind of gives me an idea it looks

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.550 
that kind of gives me an idea it looks
like<00:04:05.880> each<00:04:06.060> one<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.390> my<00:04:06.420> loops<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.959> about<00:04:07.230> two

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
like each one of my loops is about two

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.900 
like each one of my loops is about two
and<00:04:07.740> three<00:04:07.890> quarters<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.340> an<00:04:08.430> inch<00:04:08.520> so<00:04:08.790> I'm

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
and three quarters of an inch so I'm

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.390 
and three quarters of an inch so I'm
going<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.120> cut<00:04:09.360> all<00:04:09.750> my<00:04:09.959> loops<00:04:10.440> now<00:04:10.680> I've<00:04:10.950> cut<00:04:11.250> a

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
going to cut all my loops now I've cut a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.230 
going to cut all my loops now I've cut a
total<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.850> 24<00:04:12.590> loops<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:13.920> each<00:04:14.100> boot<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.030> I'm

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
total of 24 loops for each boot and I'm

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.240 
total of 24 loops for each boot and I'm
going<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.540> go<00:04:15.750> ahead<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.350> place<00:04:16.770> the<00:04:17.040> loops

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
going to go ahead and place the loops

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.140 
going to go ahead and place the loops
and<00:04:17.580> I'm<00:04:18.299> only<00:04:18.570> sewing<00:04:19.380> on<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:20.370> right<00:04:20.640> side<00:04:21.000> of

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
and I'm only sewing on the right side of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.300 
and I'm only sewing on the right side of
the<00:04:21.210> material<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.500> I'm<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.830> going<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.070> pin<00:04:23.280> it

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
the material so I'm just going to pin it

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.610 
the material so I'm just going to pin it
to<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.640> right<00:04:23.820> side

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
to the right side

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.950 
to the right side
and<00:04:24.800> I'm<00:04:25.190> going<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.370> pin<00:04:25.669> each<00:04:25.940> loop<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.870> make

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
and I'm going to pin each loop and make

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.550 
and I'm going to pin each loop and make
sure<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.470> make<00:04:27.650> sure<00:04:27.860> every<00:04:28.280> loop<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
sure you make sure every loop is the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.939 
sure you make sure every loop is the
same<00:04:31.030> width<00:04:32.030> but<00:04:32.360> I'm<00:04:33.229> going<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.410> go<00:04:33.500> ahead<00:04:33.620> and

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
same width but I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.640 
same width but I'm going to go ahead and
get<00:04:34.100> all<00:04:34.250> of<00:04:34.370> my<00:04:34.400> loops<00:04:35.139> pinned<00:04:36.139> in<00:04:36.260> place<00:04:36.470> and

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
get all of my loops pinned in place and

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.659 
get all of my loops pinned in place and
then<00:04:36.740> we'll<00:04:36.889> come<00:04:37.040> back<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.250> show<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.520> the

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
then we'll come back and show you the

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.280 
then we'll come back and show you the
next<00:04:37.970> step<00:04:38.150> well<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.510> have<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.840> loops<00:04:39.080> all

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
next step well I have the loops all

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.659 
next step well I have the loops all
pinned<00:04:39.590> in<00:04:39.740> place<00:04:39.889> I<00:04:40.190> don't<00:04:40.310> know<00:04:40.370> if<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:40.520> can

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
pinned in place I don't know if you can

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.540 
pinned in place I don't know if you can
see<00:04:40.940> this<00:04:41.169> so<00:04:42.169> I'm<00:04:42.350> going<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.650> sew<00:04:42.919> down<00:04:42.949> my

see this so I'm going to sew down my

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.420 
see this so I'm going to sew down my
loops<00:04:43.790> on<00:04:44.060> both<00:04:44.300> boots<00:04:44.830> my<00:04:45.830> loops<00:04:46.070> have<00:04:46.280> been

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
loops on both boots my loops have been

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.850 
loops on both boots my loops have been
sewn<00:04:46.699> in<00:04:46.940> so<00:04:47.870> what<00:04:48.020> I'm<00:04:48.110> going<00:04:48.260> to<00:04:48.290> do<00:04:48.470> is<00:04:48.680> I'm

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
sewn in so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.850 
sewn in so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.100> sew<00:04:49.310> a<00:04:49.340> piece<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.910> boning<00:04:50.360> on<00:04:51.020> top<00:04:51.620> of

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
going to sew a piece of boning on top of

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.580 
going to sew a piece of boning on top of
what<00:04:52.100> I've<00:04:52.220> just<00:04:52.250> sewn<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:53.900> it'll<00:04:54.410> have

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
what I've just sewn so that it'll have

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.620 
what I've just sewn so that it'll have
some<00:04:54.800> stability<00:04:55.040> and<00:04:55.550> then<00:04:56.330> we're<00:04:56.449> going<00:04:56.570> to

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
some stability and then we're going to

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.260 
some stability and then we're going to
take<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:57.139> and<00:04:57.410> roll<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.889> in<00:04:58.280> make<00:04:59.060> sure<00:04:59.090> the

take that and roll it in make sure the

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.879 
take that and roll it in make sure the
boning<00:04:59.690> is<00:04:59.780> sitting<00:05:00.080> like<00:05:00.139> sitting<00:05:00.680> on<00:05:00.770> the

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
boning is sitting like sitting on the

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.219 
boning is sitting like sitting on the
inside<00:05:01.310> we're<00:05:02.240> going<00:05:02.389> to<00:05:02.450> roll<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:02.810> in<00:05:02.990> and

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
inside we're going to roll it in and

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.460 
inside we're going to roll it in and
then<00:05:03.440> we're<00:05:03.590> going<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:03.800> top<00:05:04.130> stitch<00:05:05.320> check<00:05:06.320> the

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
then we're going to top stitch check the

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.230 
then we're going to top stitch check the
back<00:05:06.650> roll<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.190> back<00:05:07.400> in<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:07.940> we're<00:05:08.060> going<00:05:08.180> to

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
back roll the back in and we're going to

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.780 
back roll the back in and we're going to
top<00:05:08.510> stitch<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.870> down<00:05:09.229> just<00:05:10.040> like<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.310> so

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
top stitch it down just like that so

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.440 
top stitch it down just like that so
your<00:05:10.970> sandwich<00:05:11.479> in<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:13.720> boning<00:05:14.720> inside<00:05:15.290> of

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
your sandwich in the boning inside of

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.790 
your sandwich in the boning inside of
where<00:05:17.450> your<00:05:17.630> loops<00:05:17.870> are<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.320> then<00:05:18.680> you're

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
where your loops are and then you're

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.110 
where your loops are and then you're
just<00:05:18.860> going<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.100> top<00:05:19.340> stitch<00:05:19.370> down<00:05:19.820> through

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
just going to top stitch down through

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.300 
just going to top stitch down through
all<00:05:20.270> thickness<00:05:20.780> now<00:05:21.350> that<00:05:21.530> my<00:05:21.620> loops<00:05:21.860> are<00:05:22.039> sewn

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
all thickness now that my loops are sewn

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.100 
all thickness now that my loops are sewn
in<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.789> I've<00:05:22.910> got<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.270> boning<00:05:23.600> sewn<00:05:23.870> in<00:05:24.020> on

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
in and I've got the boning sewn in on

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.500 
in and I've got the boning sewn in on
one<00:05:24.350> side<00:05:24.680> we're<00:05:25.280> gonna<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.490> double<00:05:26.030> touch<00:05:26.240> the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
one side we're gonna a double touch the

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.969 
one side we're gonna a double touch the
boning<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.199> other<00:05:27.380> side<00:05:27.680> because<00:05:27.889> the

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
boning to the other side because the

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.379 
boning to the other side because the
bone<00:05:28.160> is<00:05:28.370> pretty<00:05:28.610> wide<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:28.910> you<00:05:29.120> want<00:05:29.300> to

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
bone is pretty wide and you want to

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:55.279 
boot and it's gonna add a nice nice

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.100 
boot and it's gonna add a nice nice
character<00:06:55.909> to<00:06:56.059> the<00:06:56.149> top<00:06:56.389> of<00:06:56.569> the<00:06:56.629> boot<00:06:56.839> just

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
character to the top of the boot just

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.600 
character to the top of the boot just

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.149 
add a little decorative stitch and I

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159 
think it matches perfectly well the trim

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.029 
think it matches perfectly well the trim
has<00:07:01.339> been<00:07:01.489> attached<00:07:02.139> and<00:07:03.139> I<00:07:03.349> think<00:07:03.589> the<00:07:03.829> boot

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
has been attached and I think the boot

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:06.429 
has been attached and I think the boot
looks<00:07:04.309> rather<00:07:04.519> nice<00:07:04.789> so<00:07:05.689> now<00:07:05.869> all<00:07:06.110> you<00:07:06.229> have<00:07:06.259> to

looks rather nice so now all you have to

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.399 
looks rather nice so now all you have to
