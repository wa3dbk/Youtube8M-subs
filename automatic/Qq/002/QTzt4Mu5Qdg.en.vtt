00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
but guess is a lot of fun to use as well

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.890 
but guess is a lot of fun to use as well
it<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.220> depends<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.820> change<00:01:27.509> them<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it all depends I change them up all the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630 
it all depends I change them up all the
time<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.040> pretty<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.250> change<00:01:29.490> them

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
time so you can pretty much change them

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
time so you can pretty much change them

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.009 
chopper Gunners and things like that but
I<00:03:42.040> use<00:03:42.190> hardline<00:03:42.580> Pro<00:03:42.790> on<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.330> class<00:03:43.599> because

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
I use hardline Pro on that class because

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.600 
I use hardline Pro on that class because
with<00:03:44.379> hardline<00:03:44.680> Pro<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.099> change<00:03:45.340> care

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
with hardline Pro you can change care

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.460 
with hardline Pro you can change care
packages<00:03:46.030> usually<00:03:46.989> when<00:03:47.110> I'm<00:03:47.200> using<00:03:47.349> that

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
packages usually when I'm using that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.580 
packages usually when I'm using that
class<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.860> use<00:03:48.010> care<00:03:48.250> package<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.700> Sam<00:03:49.030> turret

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.870 
class I use care package and Sam turret
Sam<00:03:50.590> turret<00:03:50.830> so<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> can<00:03:51.400> because<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.700> can

Sam turret so that I can because you can

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.309 
Sam turret so that I can because you can
change<00:03:52.030> both<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.330> those<00:03:52.540> which<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.900> really

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
change both of those which is really

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.920 
change both of those which is really
good<00:03:53.500> it's<00:03:53.890> literally<00:03:54.610> just<00:03:54.810> amazing<00:03:55.810> you'll

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
because I don't like it with a red dot I

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.250 
because I don't like it with a red dot I
like<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.150> iron<00:04:13.299> sights<00:04:13.599> that<00:04:13.750> just<00:04:14.049> find

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
like the iron sights that just find

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.199 
like the iron sights that just find
their<00:04:14.470> amazing<00:04:14.709> iron<00:04:14.980> sights<00:04:15.280> kind<00:04:16.150> of

their amazing iron sights kind of

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.280 
their amazing iron sights kind of
reminds<00:04:16.479> me<00:04:16.510> of<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.780> scar-h

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290

better<00:04:22.270> than<00:04:22.479> that<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.440> used<00:04:23.800> sleight<00:04:24.040> of

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
better than that so I used sleight of

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.100 
better than that so I used sleight of
hand<00:04:24.310> throw<00:04:24.729> so<00:04:25.419> that<00:04:25.540> I<00:04:25.600> can<00:04:25.720> zoom<00:04:25.900> in<00:04:26.050> on
