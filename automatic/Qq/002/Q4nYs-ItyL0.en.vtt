00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.060 

so<00:00:38.610> anyways<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.149> thinking<00:00:39.649> of<00:00:40.649> thinking

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so anyways I was thinking of thinking

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.690 
so anyways I was thinking of thinking
about<00:00:41.220> Montreal<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.050> are<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:44.309> Montreal

about Montreal and are you like Montreal

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.830 
about Montreal and are you like Montreal
related<00:00:45.329> stories<00:00:45.720> that<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> could<00:00:46.170> tell<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
related stories that I could tell you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.290 
related stories that I could tell you
that<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> might<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.199> interested<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:53.150> from<00:00:54.150> my

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that you might be interested in from my

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.049 
that you might be interested in from my
perspective<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.080> then<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> thought<00:00:56.030> then<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
perspective and then I thought then I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
perspective and then I thought then I
thought<00:00:57.269> maybe<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.750> wasn't<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.170> interesting

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
thought maybe that wasn't so interesting

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.259 
thought maybe that wasn't so interesting
like<00:00:58.829> hearing<00:00:59.190> about<00:00:59.280> Montreal<00:00:59.909> for<00:01:00.150> my

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
like hearing about Montreal for my

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.380 
like hearing about Montreal for my
perspective<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> thought<00:01:02.970> I<00:01:03.120> don't

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
perspective but then I thought I don't

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.850 
perspective but then I thought I don't
care<00:01:03.540> that's<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> want<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> talk<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
care that's what I want to talk about it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.440 
care that's what I want to talk about it
so<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.740> thought<00:01:10.920> until<00:01:11.160> uses<00:01:11.550> story<00:01:12.149> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so so I thought until uses story that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.719 
so so I thought until uses story that
we've<00:01:12.660> actually<00:01:12.899> told<00:01:13.259> before<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:14.460> we

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
we've actually told before which we

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.279 
we've actually told before which we
generally<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.570> repeat<00:01:15.690> stories

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
generally don't like to repeat stories

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.109 
generally don't like to repeat stories
because<00:01:16.649> we<00:01:16.680> figure<00:01:17.550> there's<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.970> many

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
because we figure there's so many

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.440 
because we figure there's so many
stories<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.039> that<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.210> start

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
stories that we have that if we start

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.350 
stories that we have that if we start
repeating<00:01:21.780> them<00:01:22.110> both<00:01:23.009> let<00:01:23.910> me<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
repeating them both let me get to the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
repeating them both let me get to the
end<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.630> our<00:01:24.720> lives<00:01:25.020> they'll<00:01:25.649> be<00:01:25.800> only

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
end of our lives they'll be only

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.490 
end of our lives they'll be only
leftover<00:01:26.640> stories<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> it'll<00:01:27.509> feel<00:01:27.690> sad<00:01:28.470> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
leftover stories and it'll feel sad that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.219 
leftover stories and it'll feel sad that
we<00:01:28.950> had<00:01:29.070> about<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.460> tell<00:01:29.640> them<00:01:30.179> so<00:01:30.899> I<00:01:30.929> tried

I don't know it was a gay and so we

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.289 
I don't know it was a gay and so we
thought<00:02:00.950> we'll<00:02:01.950> drive<00:02:02.250> from<00:02:02.549> Canada<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
it'll be great and and so we did and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.470 
it'll be great and and so we did and
when<00:02:09.269> we<00:02:09.390> arrived<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:10.519> quickly<00:02:11.519> realized<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
when we arrived we quickly realized that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.140 
when we arrived we quickly realized that
we<00:02:13.049> were<00:02:13.200> playing<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.829> stage<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.670> was<00:02:15.030> in

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
we were playing a stage that was in

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.730 
we were playing a stage that was in
front<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.570> swimming<00:02:15.959> pool

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
front of a swimming pool

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.010 
front of a swimming pool
this<00:02:18.740> was<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.040> stage<00:02:19.460> called<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.600> swimming

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
this was the stage called the swimming

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.960 
this was the stage called the swimming
pools<00:02:21.290> age<00:02:22.210> not<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.420> actual<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:25.340> don't

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
pools age not the actual now I don't

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.000 
pools age not the actual now I don't
know<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.120> was<00:02:26.300> both<00:02:26.420> probably<00:02:27.140> felt<00:02:27.350> like<00:02:27.560> wet

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
know it was both probably felt like wet

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.530 
know it was both probably felt like wet
and<00:02:28.190> wild<00:02:28.340> stage<00:02:30.790> or<00:02:31.790> something<00:02:32.150> upsetting

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
and wild stage or something upsetting

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.200 
and wild stage or something upsetting
like<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.490> T<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:34.970> we<00:02:35.210> were<00:02:35.330> 19<00:02:35.590> 480

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
like that and so T and I we were 19 480

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.710 
like that and so T and I we were 19 480

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
across the country and we arrived at the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.280 
across the country and we arrived at the
swimming<00:02:43.580> pool<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.150> we<00:02:44.570> thought<00:02:44.720> helpful

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
make the best of it and so we climbed up

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.020 
make the best of it and so we climbed up
onto<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.110> stage<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:49.070> was<00:02:49.190> next<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.760> to
