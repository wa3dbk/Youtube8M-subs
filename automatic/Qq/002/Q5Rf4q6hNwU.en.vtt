and<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.250> like<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.520> it<00:04:26.849> just<00:04:26.879> kind<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.240> add<00:04:27.389> some

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
and I like that it just kind of add some

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020 
and I like that it just kind of add some
weight<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.199> figure<00:04:28.530> like<00:04:29.490> minimates<00:04:29.910> are

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
weight to the figure like minimates are

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.710 
weight to the figure like minimates are
pretty<00:04:30.300> small<00:04:30.599> as<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.830> tell<00:04:32.069> but<00:04:32.720> just

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
pretty small as you can tell but just

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.360 
pretty small as you can tell but just
having<00:04:34.050> those<00:04:34.139> extra<00:04:34.560> parts<00:04:34.889> just<00:04:35.099> kind<00:04:35.310> of

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
having those extra parts just kind of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.119 
having those extra parts just kind of
emphasizing<00:04:35.879> size<00:04:36.270> somewhere<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.199> think<00:04:37.800> it

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
emphasizing size somewhere I think it

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.510 
emphasizing size somewhere I think it
turns<00:04:38.430> out<00:04:38.580> very<00:04:38.849> well<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.860> then<00:04:40.860> he<00:04:41.280> has<00:04:41.460> a

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
turns out very well and then he has a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.749 
turns out very well and then he has a
belt<00:04:42.080> less<00:04:43.080> grenades<00:04:43.500> than<00:04:43.770> Deadpool<00:04:44.129> has<00:04:44.159> but

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
belt less grenades than Deadpool has but

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.540 
belt less grenades than Deadpool has but
his<00:04:45.090> belt<00:04:45.300> has<00:04:45.509> a<00:04:45.539> bunch<00:04:45.780> of<00:04:45.900> pockets<00:04:46.550> sculpted

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
his belt has a bunch of pockets sculpted

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.460 
his belt has a bunch of pockets sculpted
on<00:04:47.669> there<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.479> I<00:04:48.509> really<00:04:48.960> like<00:04:49.139> how<00:04:49.259> that<00:04:49.319> looks

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
on there so I really like how that looks

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.790 
on there so I really like how that looks
and<00:04:50.030> then<00:04:51.030> Wolverine<00:04:51.690> also<00:04:51.960> came<00:04:52.169> with<00:04:52.199> a

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
and then Wolverine also came with a

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.180 
and then Wolverine also came with a
changeable<00:04:53.400> head<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.139> mask<00:04:55.349> is<00:04:55.560> here<00:04:55.889> the

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
changeable head so the mask is here the

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.399 
changeable head so the mask is here the
eyes<00:04:56.340> are<00:04:56.370> painted<00:04:56.789> directly<00:04:57.240> on<00:04:57.659> to<00:04:57.930> his<00:04:58.139> mask

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
eyes are painted directly on to his mask

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.790 
eyes are painted directly on to his mask
or<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.460> can<00:04:59.610> have<00:04:59.789> him<00:05:00.199> without<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:01.259> mask<00:05:01.560> on

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
or you can have him without a mask on

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.249 
or you can have him without a mask on
and<00:05:02.069> just<00:05:02.639> throw<00:05:02.940> his<00:05:03.180> hair<00:05:03.419> on<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:06.259> personally

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.230 
and just throw his hair on I personally
prefer<00:05:07.409> the<00:05:07.800> mask<00:05:08.569> but<00:05:09.569> if<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:10.050> like<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:11.240> hair

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
prefer the mask but if you like the hair

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.879 
prefer the mask but if you like the hair
that<00:05:12.720> Wolverine<00:05:13.139> has<00:05:13.289> if<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.590> like<00:05:13.740> his

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.850 
thing i don't like about him is he's
kind<00:06:32.669> kind<00:06:33.599> of<00:06:33.839> tough<00:06:34.050> to<00:06:34.080> balance<00:06:34.380> sometimes

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
kind kind of tough to balance sometimes

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.399 
kind kind of tough to balance sometimes
in<00:06:35.279> certain<00:06:35.460> poses<00:06:35.849> but<00:06:36.330> you<00:06:36.449> can<00:06:36.570> always<00:06:36.870> find

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
in certain poses but you can always find

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.030 
in certain poses but you can always find
a<00:06:37.560> way<00:06:37.589> like<00:06:38.099> here<00:06:38.370> it's

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
a way like here it's

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.460 
a way like here it's
too<00:06:39.250> bad<00:06:39.520> like<00:06:40.330> right<00:06:40.540> there<00:06:40.720> I<00:06:40.780> got<00:06:41.230> him

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
too bad like right there I got him

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.230 
too bad like right there I got him
standing<00:06:41.890> up<00:06:42.040> on<00:06:42.160> his<00:06:42.340> own<00:06:42.460> pretty<00:06:42.730> well<00:06:42.940> and

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
standing up on his own pretty well and

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.800 
standing up on his own pretty well and
he's<00:06:43.570> not<00:06:43.780> balancing<00:06:44.350> on<00:06:44.500> his<00:06:44.650> wing<00:06:45.300> but<00:06:46.300> yeah

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
he's not balancing on his wing but yeah

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.660 
he's not balancing on his wing but yeah
I<00:06:47.050> really<00:06:47.410> like<00:06:47.500> how<00:06:47.890> they<00:06:48.160> did<00:06:48.340> the<00:06:48.460> wings

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
I really like how they did the wings

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.820 
I really like how they did the wings
there's<00:06:49.480> not<00:06:49.600> a<00:06:49.660> lot<00:06:49.810> of<00:06:49.840> detail<00:06:50.320> in<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.590> pain

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
there's not a lot of detail in the pain

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.560 
there's not a lot of detail in the pain
or<00:06:50.980> anything<00:06:51.040> but<00:06:51.460> it's<00:06:51.610> minimates<00:06:52.090> so<00:06:52.360> they

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
or anything but it's minimates so they

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.050 
or anything but it's minimates so they
really<00:06:52.930> never<00:06:53.170> have<00:06:53.440> that<00:06:53.590> much<00:06:53.800> detail<00:06:54.060> so

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
really never have that much detail so

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.090 
really never have that much detail so
the<00:06:55.210> wings<00:06:55.390> are<00:06:55.540> just<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:56.080> solid<00:06:56.470> silver<00:06:56.770> but

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
the wings are just the solid silver but

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.320 
the wings are just the solid silver but
the<00:06:57.190> sculpt<00:06:57.550> in<00:06:57.670> them<00:06:57.790> you<00:06:57.940> can<00:06:58.060> see<00:06:58.210> the

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
the sculpt in them you can see the

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.380 
the sculpt in them you can see the
feathers<00:06:58.510> in<00:06:58.840> there<00:06:59.080> the<00:06:59.710> metal<00:06:59.950> feathers<00:07:00.390> so

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.390 
feathers in there the metal feathers so

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.750 
feathers in there the metal feathers so
I<00:07:01.420> think<00:07:01.630> it<00:07:01.840> looks<00:07:01.870> really<00:07:02.260> good<00:07:02.530> so<00:07:03.160> if<00:07:03.520> your

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
I think it looks really good so if your

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.940 
I think it looks really good so if your
boot<00:07:04.120> if<00:07:04.510> you're<00:07:04.750> a<00:07:04.780> fan<00:07:05.050> of<00:07:05.080> minimates<00:07:05.620> and

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:05.950 
boot if you're a fan of minimates and

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.850 
boot if you're a fan of minimates and
you<00:07:06.310> like<00:07:06.520> x-force<00:07:07.180> then<00:07:08.080> I'd<00:07:08.320> say<00:07:08.590> these<00:07:08.830> are

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860

pick up even if you aren't really an
x-force<00:07:15.670> fan<00:07:16.030> I<00:07:16.060> think<00:07:16.300> these<00:07:16.600> are<00:07:16.660> just<00:07:16.870> very
