I'm ready at this point to install the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.939 
I'm ready at this point to install the
cylinder<00:01:00.780> head<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> did<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.739> put

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
cylinder head and what I did is I put

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.460 
cylinder head and what I did is I put
that<00:01:02.100> put<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> o-rings<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> head<00:01:03.929> gasket

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that put the o-rings on the head gasket

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.969 
that put the o-rings on the head gasket
and<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:05.729> used<00:01:08.000> Loctite<00:01:09.030> 242<00:01:09.869> blue<00:01:10.350> loctite<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and I used Loctite 242 blue loctite is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
and I used Loctite 242 blue loctite is
what<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:11.789> that's<00:01:12.179> how<00:01:12.360> I'm<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.570> seal

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
what it is and that's how I'm gonna seal

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.839 
what it is and that's how I'm gonna seal
the<00:01:12.990> bolts<00:01:13.440> I'm<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.220> gonna<00:01:14.340> put<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.759> the

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:14.849 
the bolts I'm not gonna put it on the

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:16.880 
the bolts I'm not gonna put it on the
bolts<00:01:15.209> what<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.899> do<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.349> like<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> put<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
bolts what I do is I like to put it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.370 
bolts what I do is I like to put it
inside<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.670> holes<00:01:17.910> I<00:01:18.300> think<00:01:18.959> if<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.110> put<00:01:19.289> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
inside of the holes I think if I put it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.630 
inside of the holes I think if I put it
on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> bowl<00:01:19.740> I'm<00:01:19.950> running<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> risk<00:01:20.429> of

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
on the bowl I'm running a risk of

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.800 
on the bowl I'm running a risk of
getting<00:01:20.789> that<00:01:21.060> Permatex

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
getting that Permatex

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.350 
getting that Permatex
on<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.289> top<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.459> the<00:01:23.759> cylinder<00:01:24.209> head

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
on the top of the of the cylinder head

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.320 
on the top of the of the cylinder head
so<00:01:24.660> what<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:25.649> gonna<00:01:25.739> do<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.940> this<00:01:27.149> head

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
so what I'm gonna do is get this head

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.469 
so what I'm gonna do is get this head
lined<00:01:27.569> up<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:28.349> it<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.149> put<00:01:30.149> these<00:01:30.270> bolts

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
lined up get it on and put these bolts

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.370 
lined up get it on and put these bolts
in<00:01:31.880> got<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.119> head<00:01:33.270> bolts<00:01:33.599> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.140> next

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
in got all my head bolts in the next

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.570 
in got all my head bolts in the next
thing<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.590> gonna<00:01:34.679> do<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.099> apply<00:01:35.550> a

is<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.310> these<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.420> torque<00:02:33.690> down<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
is get these so on this torque down the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.190 
is get these so on this torque down the
finish<00:02:37.200> tightening<00:02:37.410> up<00:02:37.739> all<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.220> cylinder

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
finish tightening up all the cylinder

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.140 
finish tightening up all the cylinder
base<00:02:40.200> nuts<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.550> get<00:02:41.730> asked<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.060> question

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
base nuts and I get asked this question

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.870 
base nuts and I get asked this question
a<00:02:42.570> lot<00:02:42.780> what's<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.410> secret<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.010> always

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
a lot what's it on a secret I always

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.270 
a lot what's it on a secret I always
talk<00:02:45.060> about<00:02:45.090> torque<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.320> really<00:02:46.620> can't<00:02:47.069> get<00:02:47.220> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
talk about torque you really can't get a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.430 
talk about torque you really can't get a
torque<00:02:47.550> wrench<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:48.330> or<00:02:48.690> here<00:02:49.050> or<00:02:49.380> here

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
torque wrench in here or here or here

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.530 
torque wrench in here or here or here
we're<00:02:50.130> here<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.209> we<00:02:51.330> came<00:02:51.480> up<00:02:51.540> with<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.019> a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
we're here so we came up with this a

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.360 
we're here so we came up with this a
couple<00:02:54.540> little<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:55.530> tools<00:02:55.829> that<00:02:56.070> we<00:02:56.160> made

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
couple little just tools that we made

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.009 
couple little just tools that we made
it's<00:02:56.700> about<00:02:56.820> an<00:02:56.970> inch<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.269> half<00:02:57.299> long<00:02:57.720> from

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
it's about an inch and a half long from

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.920 
it's about an inch and a half long from
Senator<00:02:58.410> Santa<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.340> all<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.690> was<00:03:00.900> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
Senator Santa and all this is it was a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.259 
Senator Santa and all this is it was a
fourteen<00:03:01.530> millimeter<00:03:01.560> wrench<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.579> then<00:03:03.239> I

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
fourteen millimeter wrench and then I

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.199 
fourteen millimeter wrench and then I
just<00:03:03.480> took<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.630> socket<00:03:03.959> with<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> 3/8<00:03:05.130> drive<00:03:05.940> on

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
just took a socket with a 3/8 drive on

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.630 
just took a socket with a 3/8 drive on
the<00:03:06.299> end<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:06.959> welded<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.709> one

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the end of it and we welded it to it one

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.009 
the end of it and we welded it to it one
thing<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.000> keep<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.329> mind<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.810> does

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
thing you have to keep in mind that does

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.620 
thing you have to keep in mind that does
increase<00:03:10.350> leverage<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.730> our<00:03:12.090> closest

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
increase leverage so our closest

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.650 
increase leverage so our closest
calculations<00:03:13.670> approximately<00:03:14.670> 10%<00:03:14.910> it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
calculations approximately 10% it

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.720 
calculations approximately 10% it
increases<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.290> by<00:03:16.410> 10%<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.340> at<00:03:18.799> 34<00:03:19.799> foot-pounds

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
increases it by 10% so at 34 foot-pounds

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.660 
increases it by 10% so at 34 foot-pounds
just<00:03:21.690> back<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.110> off<00:03:22.230> for<00:03:22.650> foot-pounds<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
just back it off for foot-pounds and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.670 
just back it off for foot-pounds and
it's<00:03:24.060> going<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.299> equal<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.019> required<00:03:25.380> torque

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
it's going to equal the required torque

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.440 
it's going to equal the required torque
of<00:03:25.950> 34<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:28.400> went<00:03:29.400> ahead<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.760> installed<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.269> new

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
of 34 I went ahead and installed a new

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.580 
of 34 I went ahead and installed a new
crankshaft<00:03:30.720> seal<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.549> water<00:03:32.880> pump<00:03:33.209> seal

I'm gonna start assembling this side
next<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:43.880> went<00:03:44.880> ahead<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.239> applied<00:03:45.329> Kay's<00:03:45.930> bond

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
next I went ahead and applied Kay's bond

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.650 
next I went ahead and applied Kay's bond
to<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.130> backside<00:03:47.579> of<00:03:47.609> this<00:03:47.880> cover<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.510> the
