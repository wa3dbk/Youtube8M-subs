is what we're aiming to wearing to go up

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.260 
is what we're aiming to wearing to go up
and<00:00:58.440> over<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.829> wall<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.579> into<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> top

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and over the wall and then into the top

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
and over the wall and then into the top
corner<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> net<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.500> powerful

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
corner of the net so if it's powerful

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.410 
corner of the net so if it's powerful
it's<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> work<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.300> going

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it's not going to work it's just going

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.359 
it's not going to work it's just going
to<00:01:03.539> go<00:01:03.690> straight<00:01:03.719> into<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> wall<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> you're

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
to go straight into the wall and you're

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
to go straight into the wall and you're
not<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.909> go<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.080> second<00:01:07.470> thing

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
not going to get go and the second thing

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.210 
not going to get go and the second thing
I<00:01:08.000> assume<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> rule<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:10.619> doing<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:10.979> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
I assume as a rule for doing this is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.920 
I assume as a rule for doing this is
speed<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:12.060> thing<00:01:12.090> you'll<00:01:12.450> encounter<00:01:12.689> on

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
speed now one thing you'll encounter on

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.039 
speed now one thing you'll encounter on
line<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.470> people<00:01:13.979> putting<00:01:14.520> p<00:01:15.180> players<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
line is people putting p players on the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.230 
line is people putting p players on the
line<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.340> quick<00:01:17.580> enough<00:01:17.610> they

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
line now if you're quick enough they

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
line now if you're quick enough they
don't<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> time<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.619> will<00:01:19.799> not

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
don't have time to do this they will not

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.320 
don't have time to do this they will not
have<00:01:20.130> time<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.759> probably<00:01:20.939> mean<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
have time and it will probably mean that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.940 
have time and it will probably mean that
they're<00:01:21.450> trying<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> focus<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.439> hard<00:01:22.470> on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
they're trying to focus so hard on

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
they're trying to focus so hard on
putting<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> player<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> line<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.360> they

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
putting a player on the line that they

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.969 
putting a player on the line that they
forget<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> jump<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> wall<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:25.619> makes<00:01:25.860> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
forget to jump the wall which makes it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
forget to jump the wall which makes it
twice<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.310> easy<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.630> much

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
twice as easy for you because so much

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.510 
twice as easy for you because so much
