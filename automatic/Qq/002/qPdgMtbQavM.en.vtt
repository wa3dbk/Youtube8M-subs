could mean the hard drives on its way
out<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.600> well<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.740> assuming<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.789> you've

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
access denied and whatnot when they try

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.619 
access denied and whatnot when they try
and<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.309> anything<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.120> I'm<00:00:39.210> gonna<00:00:39.300> show<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.600> a

way to actually get the access denied

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.330 
way to actually get the access denied
lifted<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.960> go<00:00:43.110> into<00:00:43.410> recovery

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
lifted and actually go into recovery

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.049 
lifted and actually go into recovery
console<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> fix<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.510> similar<00:00:46.280> problem<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
console to fix this similar problem in a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.720 
console to fix this similar problem in a
different<00:00:48.120> way<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.070> let's<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.280> started

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
different way so let's get started

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.080 
different way so let's get started
anyway<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> what<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.800> need<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.969> into

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
anyway so what we need to do is go into

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.330 
anyway so what we need to do is go into
my<00:00:54.210> virtual<00:00:54.690> machine<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.170> actually<00:00:55.920> access

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
my virtual machine and actually access

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.319 
my virtual machine and actually access
the<00:00:56.489> recovery<00:00:57.360> console<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:59.090> so<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> can

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the recovery console so are so you can

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.970 
the recovery console so are so you can
have<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.690> mix<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> virtual<00:01:01.680> machine<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
have to be a mix is a virtual machine I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.660 
have to be a mix is a virtual machine I
know<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.309> very<00:01:02.489> small<00:01:03.379> right<00:01:04.460> now<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.549> need

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
know it's very small right now we need

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.280 
know it's very small right now we need
to<00:01:05.790> push<00:01:06.000> money<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.479> may<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> dual<00:01:07.080> boot

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to push money you may have a dual boot

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.870 
to push money you may have a dual boot
so<00:01:07.619> I'm<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:07.950> gonna<00:01:08.070> push<00:01:08.310> one<00:01:08.549> because

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
do is go CD C colon backslash and then

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.830 
do is go CD C colon backslash and then
type<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.320> system<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
type in your system like so and then I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.100 
type in your system like so and then I
need<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.710> squiggly<00:01:29.189> line<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> don't

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
need to do this squiggly line so I don't

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.719 
need to do this squiggly line so I don't
know<00:01:31.229> what<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:31.530> called<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.610> need

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
know what that's called and then I need

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.310 
know what that's called and then I need
to<00:01:32.759> put<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.869> need<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> put

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
to put one there we need to put

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
to put one there we need to put
backslash<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.430> under<00:01:35.700> school<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
backslash and then I'm under school and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.719 
backslash and then I'm under school and
then<00:01:37.409> rest<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> squiggly<00:01:40.890> line<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
then rest and then a squiggly line and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.289 
then rest and then a squiggly line and
then<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.570> won't<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.820> we're<00:01:44.820> getting<00:01:45.030> access

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
then I won't now we're getting access

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:45.859 
then I won't now we're getting access
denied

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
denied

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.480 
denied
and<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.259> perfect<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.130> means<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and that's perfect so that means up to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.010 
and that's perfect so that means up to
show<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> how<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> rectify<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.869> now<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
show you how to rectify this and now to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.289 
show you how to rectify this and now to
carry<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:49.950> process<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.180> you're

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
carry on with this process so if you're

basically as well this is only gonna

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.740 
basically as well this is only gonna
achieve<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.680> cover<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.250> small<00:03:21.000> tiny<00:03:21.269> part<00:03:21.600> of

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
achieve a cover a small tiny part of

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.060 
achieve a cover a small tiny part of
registry<00:03:22.110> it's<00:03:22.260> not<00:03:22.380> going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.620> take<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.890> home

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
registry it's not going to take the home

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.199 
registry it's not going to take the home
registry<00:03:23.610> ok<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:25.250> that's<00:03:26.250> very<00:03:26.670> net<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.000> mind

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
registry ok so that's very net in mind

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.880 
registry ok so that's very net in mind
this<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.690> what<00:03:27.900> you're<00:03:28.050> gonna<00:03:28.170> have<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.470> do<00:03:28.620> so

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
this is what you're gonna have to do so

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.210 
this is what you're gonna have to do so
once<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.400> fully<00:03:29.640> loaded<00:03:29.850> we<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:30.870> then

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
once this is fully loaded we can then

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
once this is fully loaded we can then
access<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.640> restore<00:03:33.239> box<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.630> open<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:33.930> a

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
access the restore box just open this a

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.509 
access the restore box just open this a
few<00:03:34.260> restore<00:03:34.650> points<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.040> need<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.310> show<00:03:35.489> you

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
few restore points I need to show you

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.820 
few restore points I need to show you
because<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.330> virtual<00:03:36.720> machine<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.560> just

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
because it is a virtual machine so just

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:46.460 
because it is a virtual machine so just
quickly<00:03:37.920> pause<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.519> second<00:03:45.110> ok<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.170> we're

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
quickly pause this a second ok so we're

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.110 
quickly pause this a second ok so we're
back<00:03:46.560> at<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.040> point<00:03:47.340> where<00:03:47.670> we're<00:03:47.820> gonna<00:03:47.880> get

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
back at the point where we're gonna get

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.360 
back at the point where we're gonna get

into the recovery console gain I'm gonna

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.420 
into the recovery console gain I'm gonna
need<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.640> push<00:03:50.820> our<00:03:51.030> when<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:51.959> comes<00:03:52.200> up<00:03:52.430> so

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
this will come back into the recovery

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.050 
this will come back into the recovery

console look so I'm gonna do one I'm
just<00:04:07.330> gonna<00:04:07.510> type<00:04:07.780> in<00:04:08.080> now<00:04:08.260> CD<00:04:08.830> okay<00:04:09.819> so<00:04:09.879> we

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
just gonna type in now CD okay so we

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.630 
just gonna type in now CD okay so we
need<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.330> go<00:04:10.480> back<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.290> actual<00:04:11.440> C<00:04:12.099> colon

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
need to go back to the actual C colon

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:24.420 
need to go back to the actual C colon
backslash<00:04:12.810> your<00:04:13.810> system<00:04:19.590> already<00:04:22.950> okay<00:04:23.950> I've

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
backslash your system already okay I've

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.510 
backslash your system already okay I've
got<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> new<00:04:24.760> keyboard<00:04:25.650> it's<00:04:26.650> not<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.250> really

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
got a new keyboard it's not a really

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.950 
got a new keyboard it's not a really
nice<00:04:27.700> one<00:04:27.940> it's<00:04:28.330> one<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.540> those<00:04:28.630> ones<00:04:28.840> that

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
nice one it's one of those ones that

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.480 
nice one it's one of those ones that
have<00:04:29.050> been<00:04:29.200> to<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.380> middle<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.910> don't<00:04:31.300> like

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
have been to the middle so I don't like

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.409 
have been to the middle so I don't like
this<00:04:33.490> tomorrow

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
this tomorrow

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.500 
this tomorrow
and<00:04:34.990> then<00:04:35.380> get<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.560> new<00:04:35.740> one<00:04:35.889> so<00:04:36.880> basically<00:04:37.030> once

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
and then get a new one so basically once

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.030 
and then get a new one so basically once
we've<00:04:37.660> done<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:37.870> we<00:04:38.139> need<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.500> backslash

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
we've done that we need to do backslash

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:49.200 
we've done that we need to do backslash
underscore<00:04:46.229> that's<00:04:47.229> in<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.280> directory<00:04:48.760> okay

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
underscore that's in that directory okay

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.320 
underscore that's in that directory okay
so<00:04:49.750> once<00:04:49.960> we're<00:04:50.169> in<00:04:50.229> there<00:04:50.440> we<00:04:50.560> can<00:04:50.680> type<00:04:50.919> dir

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
so once we're in there we can type dir

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.850 
so once we're in there we can type dir
and<00:04:52.330> now<00:04:52.510> we<00:04:52.570> can<00:04:52.840> see<00:04:53.020> we've<00:04:53.139> got<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.350> beat<00:04:53.530> we

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
and now we can see we've got the beat we

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.310 
and now we can see we've got the beat we
store<00:04:54.370> points<00:04:54.729> there<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.450> I'll<00:04:55.570> use<00:04:55.750> of<00:04:55.930> harpy

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
store points there so I'll use of harpy

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.280 
store points there so I'll use of harpy
one<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.860> could<00:04:57.520> did<00:04:57.639> last<00:04:57.850> time<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.330> basically

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
one I could did last time so basically

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.370 
one I could did last time so basically
to<00:04:59.919> change<00:05:00.160> directory<00:05:00.639> to<00:05:02.220> RP<00:05:03.220> one<00:05:04.320> okay<00:05:05.320> so

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
to change directory to RP one okay so

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.020 
to change directory to RP one okay so
we're<00:05:05.680> now<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:06.100> point<00:05:06.400> now<00:05:06.669> we<00:05:06.729> need<00:05:06.910> to

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
we're now in that point now we need to

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.540 
we're now in that point now we need to
do<00:05:07.289> CD<00:05:08.289> snapshot<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.740> as<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:11.979> can<00:05:12.070> see<00:05:12.130> it's

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
do CD snapshot and as you can see it's

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.810 
do CD snapshot and as you can see it's
letting<00:05:12.880> us<00:05:13.919> it's<00:05:14.919> letting<00:05:15.220> us<00:05:15.310> actually<00:05:15.639> do

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
letting us it's letting us actually do

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.550 
letting us it's letting us actually do
that<00:05:16.030> now<00:05:16.090> whereas<00:05:16.510> before<00:05:16.870> it<00:05:16.960> wasn't<00:05:17.139> so

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
that now whereas before it wasn't so

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.550 
that now whereas before it wasn't so
it's<00:05:17.680> letting<00:05:17.860> us<00:05:18.900> it's<00:05:19.900> letting<00:05:20.169> us<00:05:20.229> get<00:05:20.380> into

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
it's letting us it's letting us get into

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.990 
it's letting us it's letting us get into
that<00:05:20.740> direct<00:05:21.039> our<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.430> directory<00:05:21.760> we<00:05:21.820> weren't

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
that direct our the directory we weren't

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.029 
that direct our the directory we weren't
saying<00:05:22.210> no<00:05:22.479> before<00:05:22.630> so<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.229> access<00:05:23.560> denied<00:05:23.830> so

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
saying no before so and access denied so

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.650 
saying no before so and access denied so
we've<00:05:24.190> actually<00:05:24.340> proved<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.060> point<00:05:25.240> where<00:05:25.570> it

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
we've actually proved the point where it

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.230 
we've actually proved the point where it
actually<00:05:25.960> does<00:05:26.110> work<00:05:26.320> so<00:05:27.310> once<00:05:27.940> we're<00:05:28.150> in<00:05:28.210> here

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
actually does work so once we're in here

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.629 
actually does work so once we're in here
we<00:05:28.479> need<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.750> type<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.200> now<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:30.070> actual<00:05:30.340> command

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
we need to type a now the actual command

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.210 
we need to type a now the actual command
to<00:05:30.880> actually<00:05:31.289> copying<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.590> part<00:05:32.830> we<00:05:32.950> need<00:05:33.100> to

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
to actually copying the part we need to

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.529 
to actually copying the part we need to
do<00:05:33.400> okay<00:05:33.850> so<00:05:33.880> we<00:05:34.150> need<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.450> copy<00:05:35.550> space<00:05:36.550> under

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
do okay so we need to copy space under

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:47.690 
do okay so we need to copy space under
school<00:05:40.169> registry<00:05:41.970> on<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.270> school<00:05:43.570> machine

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.320 

its<00:05:48.700> keys<00:05:48.970> not<00:05:49.210> very<00:05:50.490> system

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
its keys not very system

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.010 
its keys not very system
and<00:05:52.599> then<00:05:52.990> we<00:05:53.080> need<00:05:53.229> to<00:05:53.349> do<00:05:53.500> space<00:05:53.830> C<00:05:55.020> colon

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
and then we need to do space C colon

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.839 
and then we need to do space C colon
backslash<00:05:57.150> and<00:05:58.150> we<00:05:58.479> need<00:05:58.629> to<00:05:58.780> type<00:05:58.990> in<00:05:59.229> their

backslash and we need to type in their
sister<00:06:00.849> windows<00:06:03.000> so<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.629> then<00:06:05.050> we<00:06:05.110> need<00:06:05.259> to<00:06:05.379> do

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
sister windows so and then we need to do

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:13.499 
sister windows so and then we need to do

fastest type in the world I'm afraid

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.300 
fastest type in the world I'm afraid
it's<00:06:21.220> not<00:06:21.430> my<00:06:21.580> forte

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310
