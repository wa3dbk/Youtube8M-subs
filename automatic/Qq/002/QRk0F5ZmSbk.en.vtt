00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.380
 or 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.469
 hello press friends je web welcome 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.880
 to chapter number 6 of the tutorial of 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:22.419
 joomla 3.0 in which we will address a 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.220
 issue that has nothing to do with respect 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.369
 what is the operation of joomla 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.210
 in itself but not for that reason is less 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.640
 important is the issue related to how 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.280
 we are going to structure the information of 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.410
 our site 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.100
 currently on our site 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.500
 until the current chapter is as is 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.730
 we have it here that is to say it comes with 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.329
 information 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.100
 by default it gives us the name obviously 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.910
 this information we are going to 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.300
 eliminate and start filling with our 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.300
 information 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.530
 when you structure the menu of 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.350
 options or the information that they are going to 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.270
 present to your visitors also in 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.270
 account the following detail 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.890
 try that your visitors do not give 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.860
 too many laps to find the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.560
 information is to say the options menu 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.470
 that is very well structured that does not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.980
 are too many options if you do not 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.460
 require 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.160
 uses only the necessary 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.580
 preference if you find a template 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:39.780
 where in the part what is the foot of 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.780
 page the future they find out there 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.290
 some template that allows you to put 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.110
 links do it but later we'll see 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.310
 how to do it by modifying 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 of the php index then try that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.170
 have the options both in the part of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.530
 up like in the bottom part and like 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.140
 I tell you that users at the time 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.940
 to navigate, do not give so many clicks 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.720
 and be able to find the information that 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.950
 needed because otherwise because it 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.080
 most likely do not last too long 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.830
 on your site 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.150
 so those are the two main 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.310
 recommendations at the time of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.739
 structure in your information 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.770
 the structure of your site obviously 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.849
 depends a lot on the type of activity 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.090
 that are dedicated in this case I'm going to 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.030
 propose them 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.830
 a basic structure so to speak and 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.370
 Well, it depends on everyone 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.459
 add or delete those options that 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.170
 consider that they are necessary or not 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.890
 obviously they file it by and in some 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.620
 application for this case the options 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.620
 that I am going to use are the following 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.790
 first the start button or the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.700
 start menu when the visitor gives 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.340
 click to this start option what will 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.170
 is is going to bring you in what is the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.170
 main screen of our site 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.340
 rain will allow us to place the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.610
 start of our site the number of 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.209
 items that we want and in the 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.099
 distribution that we order it in 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.380
 this moment because only this one is 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.060
 article but when we start 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:34.480
 to create our series of articles as 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.830
 we are going to be able to order them 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.140
 tell you that it is a starting article or 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.549
 not then we're going to see it more 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.980
 forward the idea is that by using the 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.989
 menu or the start option then the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.850
 user what is going to bring the 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.970
 information that will bring you is this the 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.270
 from the main page 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.480
 then in the option of who we are 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.090
 really this 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.880
 a little bit about the history of the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.890
 company in which we are representing 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.770
 within who we are you can 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.710
 put the location or if you like 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.350
 You can put a separate option if 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.920
 they handle products or services 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.930
 we can be able to put there between the 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.020
 less of options is that it's products 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.910
 or services depending on the case 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.900
 What we are going to do is add a 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.700
 table of prices and products or 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.880
 well we can put a woman a gallery 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.860
 of images about it if you guys 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.550
 they handle downloads of articles of 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.600
 information programs can put 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.660
 an option to download 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.420
 the gallery that I tell you that in this 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.120
 case is the gallery of asia of our 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.950
 products or some other information that 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.620
 let's handle 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.430
 the map is very important especially 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.060
 for the seekers in the jungle there are 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.950
 there some tools for the map of 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.190
 our site 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.590
 basically because it presents us in a 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.290
 ordered all the options that 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.190
 currently contain our site all 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.980
 the articles 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.280
 and finally our contact option 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:28.460
 so that potential visitors can 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.370
 can you contact us by phone or 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.949
 allows us to put information 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.980
 about the location where we are 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:40.960
 the phone and so on then this is the 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.960
 the basic structure that I'm going to 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.200
 use for the example of this 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:51.460
 tutorial and it's up to everyone to add 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.380
 or eliminate any of these options what 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.720
 important to take into account how they 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.300
 commented at the beginning is that the 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.820
 visitor to your page then you are 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.630
 the information you need and stay 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:08.260
 there as long as possible in the other 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:12.060
 structure in the also based on the 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.060
 type of product or service that they sell 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.550
 and finally remember to put the 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.130
 links of the same options that we have 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.340
 in our menu they try to put it up 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.220
 since it is another way that the the 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.950
 potential visitor as in sailing from 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.230
 more nicer way inside your 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.020
 site so up here this 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.000
 chapter on the structure of the site and 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.830
 In the next chapter we will start 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.830
 address the subject of the article manager 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.830
