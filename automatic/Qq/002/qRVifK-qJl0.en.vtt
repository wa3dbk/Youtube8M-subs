00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.750
 but we are very happy because we finished 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.600
 to receive a call that has some 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.950
 star wars figures in their packaging not 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.900
 I 'm going to tell you what figures because 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.529
 I always like to leave them as well as with 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.360
 the doubt so that they get excited like me and 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.099
 Well, now we're running 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.470
 there what we are going to see outside of 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.570
 one meter hopefully be it truth 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.570
 actually this and we search 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.210
 it's a lot of work to get 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.990
 we have a look here in the good ones we 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.820
 frame for 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.160
 to tell us that he has some figures of 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.630
 the war of the galaxies' and then 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.920
 tell us a little about these pieces 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.430
 for me this is a treasure 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.950
 I found the pieces in the house 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.210
 in which I worked because the Lord 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.870
 I said that anything is that I 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:20.860
 I found on the floor it was mine 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:24.160
 as two figures plus the Lord in 36 years 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.430
 and the others where it is and also I had to 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.080
 sell the thing and right now you stayed 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.570
 these 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.400
 the truth are very beautiful pieces 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.540
 parents of these you see that never the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.670
 they used a little 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.580
 badly guarded must have been not 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.510
 because sir he had Romanian chairs 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.510
 on the ground like this 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.990
 well the value of the cards is fine 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.730
 well stuck this because even though it's a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.890
 little review here many times 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.940
 then that totally lowers them 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.620
 value if not even dust 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.340
 and now if you what is the one you 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.340
 like this 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.430
 markel gioda 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.970
 I am fascinated by the whole base is one of 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.440
 the most wanted 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.210
 the truth suspense until when I 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.070
 you talked, I thought to do a jet because 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.900
 many people then I worked I have some of 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.260
 star wars embassy where the new 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.260
 channels 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.510
 let's go for the companies I just wanted that 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.390
 and followers and the people who watch the channel 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.160
 Well, now you can see this finding and 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.140
 also know the people who are the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.970
 and who brought this story 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.970
 transcend not like the lord's 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.270
 as well as two years 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.219
 Well, now we have already done the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.000
 negotiation 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:26.579
 the truth I leave them at a very good price 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.489
 and well he says that after a while of 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.980
 be looking for who was the best 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.959
 bidder and everything because I convinced him not the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.079
 time they are very rare pieces what more 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.450
 it thrills me is that I do not have any 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:42.389
 I have some scott card as it is from me 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.200
 in humble gioda but finally I have the 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.389
 variation of me I give that it is that of another 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.120
 eye color with the instructive by the 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.660
 back this is the most 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.910
 common 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.220
 but it's still very rare age very 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.530
 sought not 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.900
 I was very happy to meet this person 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.930
 and more than good now I would like 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.460
 leave in the video without any problem 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.590
 so that for you to know him 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.020
 and I like him to live in moments like this 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.710
 as they arise we are not going to how they are going 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.420
 giving are how they were presented and thus 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.130
 we will be filled with more stories 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.980
 so I wanted us to throw them a 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.540
 look at each one bring the typical ojito 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.170
 you have to go back so that you do not vote 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.170
 bubble 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.880
 they are all with the normal back 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.090
 none comes negative in any return 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.700
 of pure jedi returned the advantage here 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.190
 are the conditions have a bit of 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.260
 details on the card but the bubbles 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.270
 they are totally glued which is what 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.010
 I love it and what it is that 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.330
 I recommend for when they acquire this 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.400
 type of figures 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.150
 Well, I'm very happy with this 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.050
 find we did a more look at 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.050
 each figure 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.470
 how can you see where the giant does not 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.470
 It was 479 pesos 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.729
 and what I also like a lot is that 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.220
 the diurex are not yellowish at all 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.680
 they are totally stuck to the bubble 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.470
 inside and the funny thing here in the 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.020
 detail of yoga is that good of a 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.000
 ex hit him first and they left him 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.310
 out and then they hit the bubble 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.910
 then from the first times that 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.440
 I see that mistake in these things but it is 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.440
 totally natural not 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.409
 Well now I say goodbye with this 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.929
 great find for my collection them 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.270
 I will look for some projects and I hope to have you 

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:39.959
 more stories soon you're seeing more 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.959
 people channel
