00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.040
 excellent result such a launch in general 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.190
 easy and the system stood here here 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.800
 in the open and just a pack 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:38.530
 and covered the rain 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:41.110
 generator itself wintered and instead we 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.950
 live as it were naturally where 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:51.610
 metal, in general, endured such 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:55.149
 thats how a field test generator 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:00.330
 chick this take with a trip 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.330
 we will prepare a trip to the north 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.759
 actually satisfied and and of course 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.269
 the engine itself was processed 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.159
 In this case, Arvis is still us 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.140
 better like something asked 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.950
 reagent 2000 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.720
 and we have access 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.209
 stream luther is actually all 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.209
