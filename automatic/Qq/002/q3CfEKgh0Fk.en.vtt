going to allow me do is to access the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000 
going to allow me do is to access the
macbook<00:00:24.750> from<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.109> computer<00:00:25.560> using<00:00:25.859> just

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
macbook from this computer using just

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.429 
macbook from this computer using just
firewire<00:00:26.460> cable<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.080> that's<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.260> quick

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
firewire cable so and that's a quick

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.839 
firewire cable so and that's a quick
start<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.039> already<00:00:29.250> started<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
start up it's already started up and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.220 
start up it's already started up and
there's<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.210> symbol<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> screen<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
there's a symbol on the screen of a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530 
there's a symbol on the screen of a
FireWire<00:00:31.590> symbol<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.149> firewire

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
FireWire symbol so we have a firewire

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.770 
FireWire symbol so we have a firewire
cable<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.079> i'm<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> plug<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
cable here i'm going to plug this in and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.000 
cable here i'm going to plug this in and
so<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.050> plug<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.530> guy<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:40.010> there

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so when we plug this guy in here there

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.040 
so when we plug this guy in here there
we<00:00:41.070> go<00:00:42.170> now<00:00:43.170> we're<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> plug<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.890> in

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
we go now we're going to plug this in

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.830 
we go now we're going to plug this in
plug<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.450> what<00:00:48.450> we're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> do

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
plug this in and what we're going to do

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.650 
plug this in and what we're going to do
now<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.969> macbook<00:00:51.510> is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
now is we see that that the macbook is

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.139 
now is we see that that the macbook is
now<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.410> desktop<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> firewire<00:00:53.670> icon

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
now on the desktop as a firewire icon

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
now on the desktop as a firewire icon
and<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.600> down<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.460> have

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and it's down right here and so we have

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.090 
and it's down right here and so we have
full<00:00:56.910> access<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.140> system<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.859> can

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
full access to this system so we can

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.660 
full access to this system so we can
pull<00:00:59.309> any<00:00:59.489> files<00:00:59.879> over<00:01:00.859> here's<00:01:01.859> some<00:01:02.039> work<00:01:03.110> and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
pull any files over here's some work and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.340 
pull any files over here's some work and
you<00:01:05.670> treat<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.570> an<00:01:06.900> external

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you treat this just like an external

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.670 
you treat this just like an external
hard<00:01:07.380> drive<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.010> what<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
hard drive so what I'm going to do is

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.950 
hard drive so what I'm going to do is
take<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.920> 3d<00:01:11.400> man<00:01:11.640> file<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> over

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
take this 3d man file and take it over

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.149 
take this 3d man file and take it over
to<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> desktop<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.950> let<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> when

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
to the desktop and let it go and so when

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980 
to the desktop and let it go and so when
you<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.909> your<00:01:18.720> other<00:01:18.840> computer

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you have this your other computer

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.469 
you have this your other computer
mounted<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.280> mounts<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.240> hard

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
mounted on here it mounts like a hard

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.490 
mounted on here it mounts like a hard
drive<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> show<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.439> your

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
drive so it's going to show up in your

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
drive so it's going to show up in your
panel<00:01:22.950> over<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> left<00:01:23.670> side<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
panel over on the left side here and you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.289 
panel over on the left side here and you
can<00:01:24.840> eject<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.350> from<00:01:25.560> there<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.040> want<00:01:26.299> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
can eject it from there if you want and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.700 
can eject it from there if you want and
what<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:27.960> eject<00:01:28.290> using<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
what that will do was eject using the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.940 
what that will do was eject using the
firewire<00:01:29.540> each<00:01:30.540> after<00:01:30.840> port<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.920> go

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
firewire each after port and there we go

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
firewire each after port and there we go
so--but<00:01:34.950> basically<00:01:35.520> again<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:36.090> we're<00:01:36.210> doing

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so--but basically again what we're doing

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.870 
so--but basically again what we're doing
is<00:01:36.630> we're<00:01:36.840> taking<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.560> computer<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.400> we

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
is we're taking the computer that we

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
is we're taking the computer that we
want<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> access<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> starting<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.770> up

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
want to access and starting that up

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.830 
want to access and starting that up
using<00:01:41.189> firewire<00:01:41.640> target<00:01:42.030> disk<00:01:42.240> mode<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.689> do

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
using firewire target disk mode we do

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
using firewire target disk mode we do
that<00:01:43.020> by<00:01:43.259> holding<00:01:43.439> down<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.890> T<00:01:44.100> key<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that by holding down the T key on the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.270 
that by holding down the T key on the
keyboard<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.560> plug<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> firewire

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
keyboard and then we plug the firewire

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.940 
keyboard and then we plug the firewire
cable<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.810> basically<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.530> access
