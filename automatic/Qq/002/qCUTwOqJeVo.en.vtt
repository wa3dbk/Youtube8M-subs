the other side it had been a tough time
for<00:00:07.649> me<00:00:07.710> before<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.220> way<00:00:08.340> I'd<00:00:09.300> been<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
for me before the way I'd been on the

making any significant impact

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.140 
making any significant impact
I<00:00:13.230> think<00:00:13.769> I'd<00:00:13.920> played<00:00:14.160> four<00:00:14.460> matches<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.849> two

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
I think I'd played four matches in two

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.970 
I think I'd played four matches in two
years<00:00:15.420> then<00:00:16.049> they<00:00:16.139> asked<00:00:16.440> me<00:00:16.470> before<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
years then they asked me before the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.349 
years then they asked me before the
first<00:00:17.190> match<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.609> second<00:00:18.119> group<00:00:18.300> stage

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
first match in the second group stage

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.870 
first match in the second group stage
against<00:00:19.170> Yugoslavia<00:00:19.859> if<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.580> ready<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
against Yugoslavia if I was ready to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.570

play<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> said<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> coach<00:00:22.830> helmet<00:00:23.250> tion

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
play so I said to the coach helmet tion

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.710 
play so I said to the coach helmet tion
that's<00:00:24.119> why<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:26.449> right

the<00:01:25.350> winning<00:01:25.620> side<00:01:25.650> was<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.160> greatest<00:01:26.550> thing

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
