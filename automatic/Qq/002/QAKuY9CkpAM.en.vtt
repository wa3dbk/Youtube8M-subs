00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:08.740
 hello friends today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.610
 puff pastry stuffed with cream and strawberries and 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.879
 we're going to need a sheet of puff pastry 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.670
 strawberries and cream to assemble good what 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.100
 first thing we're going to do is to mass 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.830
 of puff pastry to give a little flour 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.060
 because as you can see it sticks if a little 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.550
 to put it in the oven 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.710
 and we have faced on the one hand we have 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.030
 put in our tray and now we're going 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.030
 to join a little bit for the other 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 I have left it with the thickness that it brings 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.520
 because what I want is that zuma 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.910
 to later be able to start the game 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.800
 half then we're going to leave it that good and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.360
 Now what we are going to do is put it into 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.790
 oven up and down and when we see that 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.520
 He has risen and the state ladito 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.550
 we will remove now with much careful 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.640
 let's put the knife 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.640
 to split it and fill it inside 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.790
 well we have our mass here 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.640
 we have game we are going to remove the part 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.150
 from above and now as you see 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.729
 I cut the strawberries into slices and 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.070
 I have here already the whipped cream what 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.979
 let's go doing exposing capable of 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.979
 cream and strawberry alternatively 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.049
 then the entire first layer of material 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.049
 and we will be putting strawberries 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.760
 good we have put the strawberries and now 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.760
 we will cover again with nothing 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.910
 Well, it's already finished in my total 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.640
 I have put a liter of whipped cream and 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.330
 about half a kilo of strawberries for 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.090
 capital 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.090
 Now what we will do is close it 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.690
 and sprinkle we have with icing sugar 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.870
