green drink and let's not let me drink
it<00:01:18.130> right<00:01:18.190> now<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.550> don't<00:01:18.880> know<00:01:19.000> why<00:01:19.149> I<00:01:19.180> think

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
it right now I don't know why I think

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.609 
it right now I don't know why I think
it's<00:01:19.570> because<00:01:19.690> this<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.170> second<00:01:20.530> time

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
it's because this is the second time

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.980 
it's because this is the second time
I've<00:01:20.770> done<00:01:20.800> this<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.310> just<00:01:21.789> drank<00:01:22.030> one<00:01:22.330> but

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
I've done this and I just drank one but

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.560 
I've done this and I just drank one but
i<00:01:23.020> think<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.759> actually<00:01:24.759> might<00:01:25.030> heal<00:01:25.390> you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
i think that actually might heal you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.210 
i think that actually might heal you
because<00:01:25.869> it's<00:01:26.020> like<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> fruit<00:01:26.470> drink<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.979> i

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
because it's like a fruit drink so i

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.770 
because it's like a fruit drink so i
think<00:01:27.580> if<00:01:27.759> you<00:01:27.820> drink<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.270> low<00:01:28.390> health<00:01:28.600> it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
think if you drink that of low health it

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.120 
think if you drink that of low health it
might<00:01:29.020> help<00:01:29.229> you<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:29.500> do<00:01:29.649> not<00:01:29.740> quote<00:01:29.950> me<00:01:30.009> on

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
might help you but do not quote me on

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.100 
might help you but do not quote me on
that<00:01:30.220> because<00:01:30.550> i'm<00:01:30.670> not<00:01:30.820> too<00:01:31.030> sure<00:01:31.110> kitchen

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.280 
however you can use the shower take a
shower<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.480> think<00:03:47.660> this<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.870> pretty<00:03:48.079> cool

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
shower and I think this is a pretty cool

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.379 
shower and I think this is a pretty cool
thing<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.650> they<00:03:48.739> added<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.130> as<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.180> can<00:03:50.299> see

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
thing that they added in as you can see

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.849 
thing that they added in as you can see
in<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.540> bottom<00:03:50.630> right<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.079> says<00:03:51.230> singing<00:03:51.680> and

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
in the bottom right it says singing and

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.340 
in the bottom right it says singing and
then<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.310> says<00:03:52.519> on<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.790> top<00:03:53.060> left<00:03:53.290> singing<00:03:54.290> to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
then it says on the top left singing to

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.870 
then it says on the top left singing to
your<00:03:54.410> headset<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:55.010> earn<00:03:55.190> our<00:03:55.489> P<00:03:55.730> which

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
your headset to earn our P which

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.940 
your headset to earn our P which
basically<00:03:56.239> if<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.630> sing<00:03:56.959> each<00:03:57.230> time<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.590> fill

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
basically if you sing each time you fill

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.670
