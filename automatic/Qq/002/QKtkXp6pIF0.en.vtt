00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.380
 what we now see in front of me 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.200
 that's what an embassy we are 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.730
 have silage once here is that 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.550
 so our cut grass in the summer 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.660
 what we then do in the conserve and im 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.750
 can feed winter 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.300
 that's about 25 kilos the click 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.750
 closes again is this heap 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.760
 behind it we have the maissilage that 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.260
 is the champion in the summer 6 and in the 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 winter then learned or march traded 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 becomes 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.430
 these are again as in approximately 20 kilo 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.860
 So that the ball structure has as 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.960
 ruminant is still perhaps a 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.520
 Half a kilo straw to that is the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.619
 little yellow bunch here right 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.570
 Cool more to ruminate on it 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.390
 also makes saliva and all that well 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.979
 The cows are a silent digest 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.660
 who like the food most like that 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.640
 want it to be the same every day 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.530
 we should go with spaghetti every day 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.860
 So bolognese sauce just a mere the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.860
 komanis 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.409
 and if we just now the reason 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.509
 have then seen feed sitting 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.229
 We now here with the motorists we 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.060
 have to eat here again from Switzerland 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.159
 what we give after we have the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.350
 Analysis of the reason photos have made 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.410
 and have calculated for the cow like her 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.369
 because her body with care then 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.680
 there are perhaps more likely that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.269
 deficits which we then realized on 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.920
 twitter on feed 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.780
 whether a bit lack of energy now or 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.030
 lack of white the same we have here 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.019
 over it and usually this would be 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.209
 now without reaction 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.239
 That would be milk for 22 liters 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.739
 pass with the photo ID and if 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.569
 the cow gives 40 liters then we need 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.640
 yet for 18 liter milk a 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.900
 dairy feed and that would be 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.349
 this once full 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.420
 The cow has been up for decades 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.019
 milk performance has been concentrated but 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.160
 they feared that because earlier 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.920
 that just matters to the population 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.900
 had to be fed and become ireland 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.579
 were obliged to more and more milk 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.530
 to breed with the animals 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.959
 that is not so today 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.489
 Still, the cow is simply genetic 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.989
 able to pass through today 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.900
 to give performance and if the cow now 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.950
 40 liters then I have to visits 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.230
 to supply the songs 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.530
 otherwise tomorrow will be sick and 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.880
 That's why I have the cow appropriate 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.410
 fodder then against it too 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.780
 Healthy in the next day comes that is 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.610
 a small transmitter for the cows i did 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.410
 Here we have your hand 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.780
 or we start our cows with it 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.420
 that's how christie co was so involved 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.060
 and then that is the recognition for the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.530
 Computer in this case that is now 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.690
 the 104th 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.970
 and this one runs well with the ball 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.620
 we have indeed seen in the feed and 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.750
 Of course, you get feed from the feed 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.600
 the basic funding is here on 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.010
 the lining trained and the sorry lining 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.160
 or louder 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.530
 These are, of course, watching where the ball 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.209
 just a few miles from the deadline and they have to 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.590
 they are exactly dosed then they are 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.720
 the photo box and in this foster reports 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.820
 Contact the sender and then say 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.370
 practically always nice stretch 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.470
 I am the cow 104 and I would like to 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.040
 that of my father and the computer 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.560
 white is giving so much milk right now 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.480
 has had something once or twice today 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.850
 from the fodder quantity picked up the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.709
 reserved for you and if so 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.520
 even after that is then the divide 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.090
 computer too 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.440
 and if not then rather nothing to and 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.440
 the copies automatically out again 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.050
 she presses a call on his tongue 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.490
 that one and that releases the water and 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.870
 then it must be the water so that 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.510
 not even out of the line 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.220
 but that green shell that there 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.680
 is water down there running the free one 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.930
 and she drinks all on then 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.699
 that too has turned out to be a little calf 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.580
 learned and push button to water 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.340
 to get and they accompanied the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.870
 whole lives because they are always on this 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.389
 had to walk as are cows 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.900
 actually very good 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.070
 they can learn something quickly and 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.479
 people can not judge how 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.540
 far as they understand or retain that 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.550
 but they are quickly used to something 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.500
 and can recognize that if 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.419
 me if she does that and that it does 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.419
 the duck reward is therefor
