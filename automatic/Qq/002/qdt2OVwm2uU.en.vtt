there's<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.540> reason<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.740> reason<00:00:07.770> is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
post put a whole lot of numbers in here

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.880 
post put a whole lot of numbers in here
but<00:01:05.909> usually<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.330> illustrate<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> size<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but usually to illustrate the size of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.850 
but usually to illustrate the size of
something<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.670> it'd<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:08.909> no

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
something so you know it'd be like no

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.670 
something so you know it'd be like no
1048<00:01:10.860> power<00:01:11.159> or<00:01:11.520> something<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:13.470> he

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
1048 power or something like that and he

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320 
1048 power or something like that and he
actually<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.000> point<00:01:15.150> he

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
actually I think at one point he

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.080 
actually I think at one point he
actually<00:01:15.450> puts<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.320> number<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.680> zeroes<00:01:17.090> to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
actually puts the number of zeroes to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
actually puts the number of zeroes to
show<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.570> many<00:01:18.630> zeroes<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.500> this

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
show you how many zeroes is in this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.300 
show you how many zeroes is in this
number<00:01:20.100> how<00:01:20.340> big<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:21.030> how<00:01:21.150> small<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> is

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
number how big it is or how small it is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.640 
number how big it is or how small it is
and<00:01:23.310> again<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> starts<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.150> Newton

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
and again it starts with Newton

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
and again it starts with Newton
classical<00:01:25.650> physics<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> moves

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
classical physics and then it moves

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 
classical physics and then it moves
through<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> 19th<00:01:28.320> century<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> moves

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
through the 19th century and it moves

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 
through the 19th century and it moves
into<00:01:29.670> people<00:01:30.420> who<00:01:30.509> were<00:01:30.600> trying<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> reconcile

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
into people who were trying to reconcile

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.929 
into people who were trying to reconcile
some<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> things<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.189> Newton<00:01:32.610> had<00:01:32.759> done

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
some of the things that Newton had done

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
some of the things that Newton had done
with<00:01:33.180> new<00:01:33.329> discoveries<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> eventually<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
with new discoveries and eventually it

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.219 
with new discoveries and eventually it
moved<00:01:35.460> into<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.880> early<00:01:36.180> 20th<00:01:36.600> century<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
moved into the early 20th century and it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.190 
moved into the early 20th century and it
deals<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.530> Einstein's<00:01:38.159> special<00:01:38.549> relativity

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200

deals with Einstein's special relativity

theory<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.060> relativity<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.250> deals

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
theory of relativity and then it deals

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.030 
theory of relativity and then it deals
with<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.909> revolution<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.049> quantum<00:01:46.560> mechanics

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
two theories didn't mesh so people begin

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.479 
two theories didn't mesh so people begin
to<00:02:03.990> look<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.380> why<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:05.009> don't<00:02:05.219> mesh<00:02:06.079> and

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
to look at why they don't mesh and

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.940 
to look at why they don't mesh and
eventually<00:02:08.489> out<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.030> research<00:02:09.649> grew

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
eventually out of this research grew

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.150 
eventually out of this research grew
quantum<00:02:11.849> grew<00:02:12.680> superstring<00:02:13.680> theory<00:02:14.010> which

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
quantum grew superstring theory which

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.130 
quantum grew superstring theory which
became<00:02:14.430> super<00:02:14.790> string<00:02:15.000> theory<00:02:15.239> which<00:02:15.840> then

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
became super string theory which then

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.530 
became super string theory which then
has<00:02:16.410> an<00:02:16.560> adjunct<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.130> M<00:02:17.610> theory<00:02:18.000> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
has an adjunct of M theory and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.130 
has an adjunct of M theory and
eventually<00:02:19.020> into<00:02:19.319> membrane<00:02:19.800> or<00:02:20.040> brain<00:02:20.370> theory

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
eventually into membrane or brain theory

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.360 
eventually into membrane or brain theory
now<00:02:22.140> yes<00:02:22.410> these<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:22.770> kinds<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.130> weird

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
now yes these are all kinds of weird

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.979 
now yes these are all kinds of weird
terms<00:02:23.700> I'm<00:02:23.880> throwing<00:02:24.150> at<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> understand

terms I'm throwing at you I understand

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.250 
terms I'm throwing at you I understand
this<00:02:25.819> but<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.970> book<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.300> approachable<00:02:27.870> it's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
this but the book is approachable it's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.199 
this but the book is approachable it's
not<00:02:28.530> an<00:02:28.709> easy<00:02:29.010> read<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
not an easy read you really have to

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.640 
not an easy read you really have to
concentrate<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.780> what<00:02:30.989> you're<00:02:31.140> doing<00:02:31.170> which

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
concentrate on what you're doing which

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.290 
concentrate on what you're doing which
is<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> reasons<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.760> recently<00:02:33.030> got

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
is one of the reasons I recently got

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.840 
is one of the reasons I recently got
myself<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.810> radio<00:02:34.290> headset<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:35.130> can<00:02:35.430> wear<00:02:35.700> it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
myself a radio headset I can wear it

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.090 
myself a radio headset I can wear it
work<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.080> don't<00:02:37.260> have<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.590> listen<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
work so I don't have to listen to the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.380 
work so I don't have to listen to the
news<00:02:38.310> programs<00:02:38.819> anymore

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
news programs anymore

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.660 
news programs anymore
I<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.810> put<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.140> some<00:02:40.349> absolutely<00:02:41.069> mindless

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
I can put on some absolutely mindless

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.090 
I can put on some absolutely mindless
soft<00:02:41.940> rock<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.630> background<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.950> the

soft rock in the background that the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.340 
soft rock in the background that the
headphones<00:02:44.459> themselves<00:02:44.670> cut<00:02:45.209> out<00:02:45.330> 25<00:02:45.810> DB<00:02:46.319> a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
headphones themselves cut out 25 DB a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.920 
headphones themselves cut out 25 DB a
sound<00:02:46.769> with<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.489> music<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.300> hear<00:02:48.510> nothing

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
sound with the music I can hear nothing

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.170 
sound with the music I can hear nothing
in<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.440> room<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:50.100> awesome

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
in that room it's awesome

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.150 
in that room it's awesome
so<00:02:53.450> what<00:02:54.450> Brian<00:02:54.900> Greene<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.350> done<00:02:55.560> here<00:02:55.860> has

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
so what Brian Greene is done here has

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.300 
so what Brian Greene is done here has
helped<00:02:56.580> me<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:58.200> understand<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.920> speed<00:02:59.190> of

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
helped me to understand the speed of

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.979 
helped me to understand the speed of
lightning<00:02:59.519> now<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.239> speed<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.600> light<00:03:00.780> maybe

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
lightning now the speed of light maybe

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.710 
lightning now the speed of light maybe
something<00:03:01.500> simple<00:03:02.040> too<00:03:02.160> many<00:03:02.310> people<00:03:02.720> I'm

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
something simple too many people I'm

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.240 
something simple too many people I'm
saying<00:03:04.080> coming<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.350> with<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.530> idea<00:03:04.860> if<00:03:05.130> you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
saying coming up with the idea if you

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.470 
saying coming up with the idea if you
know<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.790> whole<00:03:05.880> concept<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.299> might

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
know that the whole concept that might

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.880 
know that the whole concept that might
have<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.840> too<00:03:06.930> light<00:03:07.049> being<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> constant<00:03:07.769> in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
have to be too light being a constant in

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.259 
have to be too light being a constant in
1905<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.940> done<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> new<00:03:09.420> theory<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.030> just

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
1905 it's done a new theory and I just

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.150 
1905 it's done a new theory and I just
took<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.569> word<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.230> physicists<00:03:13.860> when<00:03:14.040> they

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
took the word of physicists when they

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.530 
took the word of physicists when they
said<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.610> can't<00:03:14.790> go<00:03:14.910> back<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.329> speed<00:03:15.510> of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
said you can't go back to the speed of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.970 
said you can't go back to the speed of
light<00:03:15.660> I'm<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:15.959> okay<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.320> can't<00:03:16.590> go<00:03:16.680> faster

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
light I'm like okay you can't go faster

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.199 
light I'm like okay you can't go faster
just<00:03:17.010> be<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> light<00:03:17.489> these<00:03:17.670> people<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.060> much

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
just be the light these people are much

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.030 
just be the light these people are much
smarter<00:03:18.780> than<00:03:18.930> me<00:03:19.049> they<00:03:19.320> understand<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.890> math

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
smarter than me they understand the math

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.830 
smarter than me they understand the math
I'm<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:20.940> gonna<00:03:21.090> try<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.359> take<00:03:21.510> their<00:03:21.690> word

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
I'm just gonna try to take their word

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.180 
I'm just gonna try to take their word
for<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.350> can't<00:03:22.560> go<00:03:22.680> faster<00:03:23.040> than<00:03:23.100> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
for it that you can't go faster than the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.090 
for it that you can't go faster than the
speed<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.430> light<00:03:23.660> Brian<00:03:24.660> Green<00:03:24.959> explained<00:03:25.709> to

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
speed of light Brian Green explained to

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.819 
speed of light Brian Green explained to
me<00:03:26.250> why<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:27.630> can't<00:03:27.959> go<00:03:28.200> faster<00:03:28.620> than<00:03:28.709> the

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
me why you can't go faster than the

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.190 
me why you can't go faster than the
speed<00:03:28.859> of<00:03:29.070> light<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:30.570> was<00:03:30.690> wonderfully

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
speed of light and it was wonderfully

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.410 
speed of light and it was wonderfully
simple<00:03:32.450> he<00:03:33.450> brings<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.140> concept<00:03:34.680> that

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
simple he brings for the concept that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.930 
simple he brings for the concept that
everything<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.720> moving<00:03:37.500> at<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.579> speed<00:03:38.700> of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
everything is moving at the speed of

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.699 
everything is moving at the speed of
light<00:03:39.120> already<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:40.530> mean<00:03:41.180> everything<00:03:42.709> it's

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
light already you mean everything it's

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.190 
light already you mean everything it's
just<00:03:43.829> that<00:03:44.160> most<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.609> that<00:03:44.640> energy<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:46.140> being

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
just that most of that energy is being

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.470 
just that most of that energy is being
taken<00:03:46.799> up<00:03:47.010> by<00:03:47.340> moving<00:03:47.519> us<00:03:47.850> through<00:03:48.320> time<00:03:50.480> and

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
taken up by moving us through time and

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.830 
taken up by moving us through time and
as<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.019> go<00:03:52.709> faster<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.430> faster<00:03:53.609> in<00:03:54.030> velocity

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
as you go faster and faster in velocity

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.809 
as you go faster and faster in velocity
through<00:03:55.319> space-time<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.340> begin<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.730> pick

up<00:03:57.000> speed<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.260> begin<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.560> pick<00:03:58.709> up<00:03:58.890> as<00:03:59.040> you

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
up speed and you begin to pick up as you

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.190 
up speed and you begin to pick up as you
get<00:03:59.609> closer<00:03:59.850> closer<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.480> physical<00:04:00.959> speed

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
get closer closer to the physical speed

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.250 
get closer closer to the physical speed

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
fuel time grow smaller it's a sliding

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.610

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
scale if the ones here and you get

faster<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.490> that's<00:04:24.270> what<00:04:24.419> light<00:04:24.630> is<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
faster and that's what light is the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.580

in time it can't go any faster and

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.210 
in time it can't go any faster and
that's<00:04:33.240> why<00:04:33.510> if<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.930> were<00:04:34.020> on<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.260> vehicle<00:04:34.949> a

for<00:05:02.790> real<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:04.620> would<00:05:04.770> work<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.310> they've

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
for real and it would work and they've

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.330 
for real and it would work and they've
tested<00:05:06.479> this<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.440> faster<00:05:07.800> you<00:05:07.889> go<00:05:08.070> the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
tested this that the faster you go the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.129 
tested this that the faster you go the
less<00:05:08.490> new<00:05:08.700> energy<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.150> have<00:05:09.300> for<00:05:09.479> time<00:05:09.660> with

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
less new energy you have for time with

with orbital tests and things like that

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.500 
with orbital tests and things like that
I<00:05:17.100> think<00:05:17.250> they<00:05:17.460> even<00:05:17.490> test<00:05:17.850> it<00:05:17.970> on<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.180> plane

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
I think they even test it on a plane

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.290 
I think they even test it on a plane
once<00:05:18.830> incredibly<00:05:19.830> state<00:05:20.300> accurate

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.330 
take a whole lot of science and math
courses<00:07:08.730> which<00:07:09.510> I'm<00:07:09.690> not<00:07:09.840> going<00:07:10.110> to<00:07:10.250> but<00:07:11.250> if

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
courses which I'm not going to but if
