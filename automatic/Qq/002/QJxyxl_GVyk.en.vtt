00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.130 
we didn't want to cook expensive parts
we<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:39.599> help<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:41.030> now<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.150> we<00:03:42.239> know<00:03:42.269> that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
we can help it so now that we know that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.250 
we can help it so now that we know that
the<00:03:43.349> oil<00:03:43.920> bath<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.750> very<00:03:46.560> stable<00:03:46.799> platform

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
the oil bath is a very stable platform

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.680 
the oil bath is a very stable platform
will<00:03:49.260> be<00:03:49.409> able<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.829> incorporate<00:03:50.700> much<00:03:51.480> better

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
will be able to incorporate much better

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.979 
will be able to incorporate much better
parts<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.769> future<00:03:53.129> and<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:54.569> second<00:03:54.900> part

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
parts in the future and the second part

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.089 
parts in the future and the second part
of<00:03:55.079> our<00:03:55.200> operation<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.939> improving<00:03:56.939> the

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
of our operation is improving the

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.099 
of our operation is improving the
further<00:03:59.099> improving<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.989> constant<00:04:00.989> cooling

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
further improving that constant cooling

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.559 
further improving that constant cooling
capability<00:04:01.409> rather<00:04:02.040> than<00:04:02.220> doing<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.730> dry

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
capability rather than doing this a dry

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.410 
capability rather than doing this a dry
ice<00:04:03.720> experiment<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:05.819> that's<00:04:06.030> with<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.209> use

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
ice experiment and that's with the use

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.030 
ice experiment and that's with the use
of<00:04:06.450> our<00:04:06.659> cooler<00:04:07.319> which<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.650> totally

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
of our cooler which is a totally

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.129 
of our cooler which is a totally
separate<00:04:08.370> entity<00:04:08.730> from<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.120> computer<00:04:10.019> itself

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
separate entity from the computer itself

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.330 
separate entity from the computer itself
it<00:04:10.590> does<00:04:10.799> have<00:04:11.040> shares<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.769> impeller<00:04:13.769> to

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
it does have shares the impeller to

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.670 
it does have shares the impeller to
share<00:04:14.549> some<00:04:14.790> power<00:04:15.030> from<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> computer<00:04:16.440> it's

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
share some power from the computer it's

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.990 
share some power from the computer it's
12<00:04:17.039> volt<00:04:19.010> so<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.130> does<00:04:20.310> plug<00:04:20.669> into<00:04:20.910> the

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
12 volt so that does plug into the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.960 
12 volt so that does plug into the
computer<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:21.800> otherwise<00:04:22.800> than<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.100> it's<00:04:23.370> so

computer but otherwise than that it's so

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.830 
computer but otherwise than that it's so
