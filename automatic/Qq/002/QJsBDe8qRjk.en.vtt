one of these beautiful well it's a

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.490 
one of these beautiful well it's a
little<00:01:11.409> bit<00:01:11.590> older<00:01:11.950> now<00:01:12.090> wooden<00:01:13.500> bamboo

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
little bit older now wooden bamboo

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.620 
little bit older now wooden bamboo
cutting<00:01:14.890> board<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.460> this<00:01:15.729> one<00:01:15.969> here<00:01:16.240> we<00:01:16.360> only

use for vegetables now this one is

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.209 
use for vegetables now this one is
starting<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.960> wear<00:01:20.110> down<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.409> little<00:01:20.740> bit<00:01:20.979> too

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
starting to wear down a little bit too

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.850 
starting to wear down a little bit too
so<00:01:21.789> at<00:01:21.909> that<00:01:22.060> point<00:01:22.360> I<00:01:22.539> had<00:01:22.780> two<00:01:23.049> boards<00:01:23.439> one

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
so at that point I had two boards one

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.420 
so at that point I had two boards one
for<00:01:24.100> meats

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
for meats

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.590 
for meats
one<00:01:25.299> vegetables<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.409> for<00:01:26.799> cutting<00:01:27.009> bread<00:01:27.600> now

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
one vegetables and for cutting bread now

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.770 
one vegetables and for cutting bread now
here's<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.990> thing<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:31.060> certainly<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.539> good

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
here's the thing it's certainly a good

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.899 
here's the thing it's certainly a good
option<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.170> go<00:01:32.409> in<00:01:32.560> but<00:01:32.740> there's<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.130> cheaper

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
option to go in but there's a cheaper

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.300 
option to go in but there's a cheaper
much<00:01:34.539> more<00:01:34.899> efficient<00:01:35.530> way<00:01:35.649> of<00:01:35.680> doing<00:01:35.979> this

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
much more efficient way of doing this

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.190 
much more efficient way of doing this
and<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.640> picked<00:01:39.909> up<00:01:40.060> these<00:01:40.299> guys<00:01:40.570> here<00:01:41.049> and

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
and I just picked up these guys here and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.789 
and I just picked up these guys here and
these<00:01:41.500> are<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:42.070> red<00:01:42.729> an<00:01:43.299> orange<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.259> blue<00:01:44.289> and<00:01:44.710> a

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
these are a red an orange a blue and a

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.630 
these are a red an orange a blue and a
green<00:01:44.939> sort<00:01:45.939> of<00:01:46.030> cutting<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:48.100> just<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.399> hard

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
green sort of cutting it's just a hard

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.249 
green sort of cutting it's just a hard
plastic<00:01:48.909> or<00:01:49.329> something<00:01:49.659> I'm<00:01:49.719> not<00:01:49.750> sure<00:01:49.869> what

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
plastic or something I'm not sure what

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.919 
plastic or something I'm not sure what
the<00:01:50.350> material<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.039> but<00:01:51.880> what<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.210> can<00:01:52.359> do<00:01:52.630> is

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
the material is but what you can do is

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.200 
the material is but what you can do is
to<00:01:53.259> use<00:01:53.530> these<00:01:53.890> according<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.640> color<00:01:54.909> so

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
to use these according to the color so

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.389 
to use these according to the color so
for<00:01:55.390> instance<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:56.380> green<00:01:56.740> would<00:01:57.039> be<00:01:57.159> good

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
for instance this green would be good

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.239 
for instance this green would be good
for<00:01:57.670> breads<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.469> vegetables<00:01:59.469> so<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.770> have

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249 
for breads and vegetables so you have

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.940 
for breads and vegetables so you have
this<00:02:00.399> designated<00:02:01.270> for<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.479> tell<00:02:02.170> your<00:02:02.409> kids

this designated for that tell your kids

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.279 
this designated for that tell your kids
tell<00:02:03.159> whoever<00:02:03.280> uses<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:03.999> kitchen<00:02:04.149> go<00:02:05.109> by

tell whoever uses in the kitchen go by
the<00:02:05.350> colors<00:02:05.799> have<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.070> little<00:02:06.310> chart<00:02:06.549> set<00:02:06.759> up<00:02:06.850> a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
the colors have a little chart set up a

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.160 
the colors have a little chart set up a
little<00:02:07.090> chart<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:07.479> they<00:02:07.570> all<00:02:07.659> know<00:02:07.840> what<00:02:08.020> to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
little chart so they all know what to

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.810 
little chart so they all know what to
follow<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:09.039> a<00:02:09.100> matter<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.460> fact<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.759> can

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
follow as a matter of fact you can

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.869 
follow as a matter of fact you can
probably<00:02:10.090> take<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.360> marker<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:10.929> put<00:02:11.140> on<00:02:11.319> here

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
probably take a marker and put on here

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.240 
probably take a marker and put on here
somewhere<00:02:12.879> on<00:02:13.030> here<00:02:13.269> vegetables<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.140> bread

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
somewhere on here vegetables and bread

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.060 
somewhere on here vegetables and bread
then<00:02:16.060> we<00:02:16.420> have<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.960> red<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.500> can<00:02:17.740> use<00:02:17.920> this

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
then we have the red so we can use this

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.240 
then we have the red so we can use this
for<00:02:18.280> red<00:02:18.490> meat<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.030> my<00:02:19.840> Coulier<00:02:20.230> your<00:02:20.650> beef<00:02:20.920> and

for red meat so my Coulier your beef and
everything<00:02:21.580> else<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.210> use<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.600> for<00:02:22.780> that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
everything else you can use it for that

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.050 
everything else you can use it for that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
even your pork I'm gonna say it's not

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.540 
even your pork I'm gonna say it's not
really<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> red<00:02:25.690> meat<00:02:25.900> but<00:02:26.140> again<00:02:27.130> we<00:02:27.400> can<00:02:27.520> put

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
really a red meat but again we can put

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.190 
really a red meat but again we can put
meat<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.060> there<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.300> blue<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.959> use

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
meat on there and the blue we can use

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.180 
meat on there and the blue we can use
for<00:02:32.590> poultry

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
for poultry

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.910

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
I'm guessing oh we can use the orange

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.010 
I'm guessing oh we can use the orange
either<00:02:36.220> one<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.850> can<00:02:37.240> put<00:02:37.390> pull<00:02:37.600> -<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:37.900> like

chicken turkey all those sorts of things
you<00:02:40.390> can<00:02:40.870> use<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.590> one<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.180> finally

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
you can use it on this one and finally

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.790 
you can use it on this one and finally
with<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.270> one<00:02:46.450> here<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.780> orange<00:02:47.200> one<00:02:47.440> we<00:02:47.590> can

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
with this one here the orange one we can

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.610 
with this one here the orange one we can
use<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:49.030> seafood<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.810> fish<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:50.590> on

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
so you know but here's the thing they're

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.080 
so you know but here's the thing they're
very<00:02:52.540> thin<00:02:53.170> as<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.440> can<00:02:53.620> see<00:02:53.860> very<00:02:54.550> very<00:02:54.640> thin

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
so I'm not sure how sturdy they're gonna

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.850 
so I'm not sure how sturdy they're gonna
be<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.730> if<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.239> get<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.690> wooden<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.380> solid

wooden board what you can do is then

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.949 
wooden board what you can do is then
align<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.280> with<00:03:03.610> for<00:03:04.420> instance<00:03:04.720> with<00:03:04.840> this

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
align that with for instance with this
