 ps4 xbox love you and ps it's these days and it's 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.939
 lately there with games with viera 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 some rumors that some rumors have not 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.890
 statements that the pc would lose 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.070
 quality would lose some things 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.239
 and would lose quality in the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.600
 total right 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.300
 and this was done more or less proposed 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.390
 konami for some other people and you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.989
 Do you know the konami? 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.960
 journalist has already tripled him 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.180
 quadrupled the thing by saying that the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.579
 crazy difference in your 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.829
 recently said that economy is not 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.710
 so much difference that the gameplay 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.880
 it would even be the difference would only be 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.799
 graphic rather than with the putting and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.310
 I will hd ct inter almost barely more 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.009
 so the staff today is is a user 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.580
 asked there on the pro's facebook 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580
 evolution soccer 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:32.280
 the differences between the pc version of the foot 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:36.659
 da next de is and there the economy responded 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.860
 with all to all the differences the list 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.200
 resources is that most of the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.659
 all died are visual 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.119
 so I 'm going to pass by here for you 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.009
 is happening and on the screen also these 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.200
 resources I'm going to talk about here now 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.579
 forward are that they are present in the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.369
 new generation ps4 xbox the year and on the pc no 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.210
 are so in the first time the lighting 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.700
 during the game that the brightness change 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.009
 and shadow during real-time gaming 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.080
 according to the time of the game or 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.869
 The game is going through the day and the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.870
 move 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.950
 shadow lighting is also not this 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.440
 pc cheerleading 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.080
 is the cheerleader on the consoles of the new generation 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.170
 will be ten times greater than 10 times greater 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.440
 I'm sorry 10 times more varied or 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:37.540
 they will have more caves 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.209
 more bodies plus a flame will have more 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.290
 easy but style of fans this 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:48.220
 improvement is in the consoles of the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:54.099
 new generation will have ten times more 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:58.260
 and it's fans it 's varied 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:03.489
 beauty is the other lighting of the player is 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.829
 that in the new generation will have a 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.079
 better rendering nor indemnification 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:13.000
 different and improved shirt too 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.569
 only new generation will be present 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.160
 which will be added tweaks ie 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.910
 a new generation you will be able to see 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.049
 tugging and in passing 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.799
 width 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.150
 depth of field 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.859
 I do not quite understand how it goes. 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.530
 this will be the size of the 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:37.599
 field or is the angle of the camera that 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.519
 can do something different not 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.269
 I know why you can customize the 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.060
 camera 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.299
 I think it 's the field I did not understand 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.449
 very much more beauty 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:54.340
 the konami also added that of game 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:57.430
 animations and modes with everything being the same 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.440
 I'm leaving the list and in the 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.699
 description for you guys take a look 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.260
