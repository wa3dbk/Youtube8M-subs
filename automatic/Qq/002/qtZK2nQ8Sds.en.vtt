00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
to set it as a spawn as last location

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.580 
to set it as a spawn as last location
and<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> need<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> go<00:00:51.449> into<00:00:51.750> story<00:00:52.320> mode

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and then you need to go into story mode

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
and then you need to go into story mode
now<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.010> already<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.520> mine<00:00:53.850> set<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.239> properly

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
now I already have mine set up properly

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.770 
now I already have mine set up properly
so<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.379> automatically<00:00:55.980> spawns<00:00:56.489> me<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
so it automatically spawns me in to this

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.799 
so it automatically spawns me in to this
odd<00:00:58.079> story<00:00:58.949> mode<00:00:59.309> where<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.210> starts<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.719> right

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
odd story mode where it starts up right

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.720 
odd story mode where it starts up right
