00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.310
 let's make a custard curd 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.830
 cheese is a very simple recipe to fix 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 we need an envelope of curd if not 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.379
 we have curd we can use an envelope of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.480
 gelatin 500 milliliters of cream 160 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.030
 grams of sugar plus 80 grams for the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.360
 candy 200 milliliters of milk and one 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.980
 cheese pot good because it's so easy 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.130
 as the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.380
 the candy to make the candy 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.500
 we take 80 grams of sugar and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.789
 we add 2 tablespoons of water stir 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.589
 well and we put the pan to the fire 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.569
 we have to get the candy 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.909
 go doing little by little you see first 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:44.100
 begins to bubble after it changes 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.870
 a little bit of color even they stay like 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.929
 scabs do not worry about that later 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.749
 is undone and finally the 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.159
 good candy if you do not dare to do 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.450
 candy you can use the candy that 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.070
 I have already done 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.920
 well then once our candy 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.290
 take color what we do is put it 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.540
 on top of our mold what we want 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.480
 is to caramelize the mold is to say that the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.490
 candy re cover the part of the mold that 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.350
 is going to have then our flan for that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.390
 once the candy is made with care 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.760
 we are passing the candy for the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.350
 different mold walls you see 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.960
 we have used this mold but 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.430
 you can use the mold that you want there 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.260
 people who use crown mold and in the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.050
 center then put jam to serve 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.350
 once the mold is caramelized 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.640
 let it cool and while it cools let's go to 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.409
 keep making the flan 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.780
 to do it the first thing we do is 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.790
 put in a saucepan or something we can 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.550
 put on fire the 500 milliliters of 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.560
 cream is cream to mount cream 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.150
 pastry and we add the cheese 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.790
 we have or cheese philadelphia but 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.290
 you can also put mascarpone or the one 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.970
 you want we also throw away the sugar and what 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.480
 we put everything on fire and we start 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.370
 stir 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.740
 we have put it on the weak fire and 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.720
 meanwhile we are dissolving the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.510
 curd in our glass of milk in the 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.060
 200 milliliters the one with gelatin 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.710
 dissolves the gelatin and once the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.450
 Previous preparation starts to boil 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.040
 remove from the fire and incorporate the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.930
 curd who does it with other 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.520
 quantities I would love to have it put 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.070
 in comments what is the recipe that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.710
 you use well well well once you are 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.690
 all dissolved we put everything in the mold 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.640
 that we had previously caramelized or 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.590
 to which we had thrown candy and what 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.420
 let's put a minimum of 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.330
 two hours if you put more time will be 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.670
 fresher and richer, well, he has already 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.920
 After that time we are going to unmold for 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.320
 unmolding use a knife edge 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.360
 and we separated a little the true wall that 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.770
 never sticks but I just in case 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.960
 I'm going to make the video come out 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.690
 bad and vierais micha whore 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.220
 I decided to separate it a bit once 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.560
 that we have separated what we do is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.770
 take the tray in which we are going to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.530
 serve put on top of our mold 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.420
 we passed our hands by the sides and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.690
 we hold with them the mold we give the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.790
 turn and unmold and see what 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.700
 wonder has been very good and for 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.940
 inside I do not tell you if you liked to give 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.940
 I like it
