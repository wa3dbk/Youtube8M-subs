change depending on the sample rate you
select<00:01:01.000> for<00:01:01.329> output<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:03.269> it's<00:01:04.269> got<00:01:04.420> like<00:01:04.570> green

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869

and blue and orange and pink my favorite

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.480 
and blue and orange and pink my favorite
was<00:01:09.070> blue<00:01:09.369> but<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.970> happens<00:01:10.149> to<00:01:10.390> be<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.690> 48

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
was blue but that happens to be the 48

kilohertz<00:01:12.490> output<00:01:13.060> sample<00:01:13.420> rate<00:01:14.369> most<00:01:15.369> of<00:01:15.490> my

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
kilohertz output sample rate most of my

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.460 
kilohertz output sample rate most of my

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
files are 1644 CD quality stuff so I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.169 
files are 1644 CD quality stuff so I
don't<00:01:20.470> really<00:01:20.530> have<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> huge<00:01:21.310> need<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.819> have

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
don't really have a huge need to have

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.210 
don't really have a huge need to have
the<00:01:22.300> higher<00:01:22.420> resolution<00:01:22.990> output<00:01:23.319> but<00:01:23.590> if<00:01:24.069> I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
the higher resolution output but if I

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.580 
the higher resolution output but if I
ever<00:01:24.369> get<00:01:24.550> into<00:01:24.789> some<00:01:25.030> more<00:01:25.330> high-risk<00:01:26.110> stuff

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
ever get into some more high-risk stuff

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.440 
ever get into some more high-risk stuff
than<00:01:26.920> I<00:01:27.280> will<00:01:27.490> probably<00:01:27.700> be<00:01:28.030> using<00:01:28.239> a

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
than I will probably be using a

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.710 
than I will probably be using a
dragonfly<00:01:28.959> in<00:01:29.229> that<00:01:29.410> manner<00:01:30.179> only<00:01:31.179> downside

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
dragonfly in that manner only downside

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.960 
dragonfly in that manner only downside
on<00:01:31.750> this<00:01:32.110> for<00:01:32.319> me<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.890> that<00:01:33.130> if<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:33.610> plug<00:01:33.849> it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
on this for me is that if you plug it

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.419 
on this for me is that if you plug it
right<00:01:34.000> into<00:01:34.300> your<00:01:34.420> computer<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.190> little

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
right into your computer it's a little

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.300 
right into your computer it's a little
loose<00:01:36.690> it<00:01:37.690> holds<00:01:37.869> into<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.319> USB<00:01:38.619> jack<00:01:39.039> fine

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
loose it holds into the USB jack fine

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.130 
loose it holds into the USB jack fine
but<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:39.700> just<00:01:39.819> has<00:01:39.970> some<00:01:40.119> play<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.690> it<00:01:40.780> seems<00:01:41.020> a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
but it just has some play and it seems a

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.389 
but it just has some play and it seems a
little<00:01:41.289> bit<00:01:43.050> just<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.200> little<00:01:44.229> bit<00:01:44.590> unfortunate

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
little bit just a little bit unfortunate

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.830 
little bit just a little bit unfortunate
that<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.640> moves<00:01:45.849> around<00:01:45.970> like<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.509> but<00:01:46.720> if

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
that it moves around like that but if

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.010 
that it moves around like that but if
you<00:01:47.020> grab<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.649> dragon<00:01:48.099> tail<00:01:48.750> which<00:01:49.750> is<00:01:49.989> a

built-in volume control
kind<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.810> HRT<00:02:18.350> micro<00:02:18.680> streamer<00:02:19.130> it's

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
kind of like the HRT micro streamer it's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.800 
kind of like the HRT micro streamer it's
going<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.610> drive<00:02:20.270> right<00:02:20.450> from<00:02:20.660> your

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
going to drive right from your

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.740 
going to drive right from your
computer's<00:02:21.530> volume<00:02:21.830> control<00:02:22.420> with<00:02:23.420> something

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
computer's volume control with something

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.559 
computer's volume control with something
like<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.990> 650<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.740> was<00:02:25.010> about<00:02:25.190> halfway<00:02:25.459> up<00:02:25.700> so

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
like the 650 I was about halfway up so

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.240 
like the 650 I was about halfway up so
that's<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.350> good<00:02:27.380> example<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.100> high

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
that's a good example of a high

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.220 
that's a good example of a high
impedance<00:02:28.610> phone<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.420> thought<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.840> did<00:02:30.050> quite

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
impedance phone I thought it did quite

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.530 
impedance phone I thought it did quite
well<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.500> those<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.640> did<00:02:31.880> seem<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> have<00:02:32.510> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
well on those it did seem to have a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.290 
well on those it did seem to have a
little<00:02:32.840> bit<00:02:33.050> more<00:02:33.200> power<00:02:33.470> than<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.160> HRT<00:02:34.790> micro

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
little bit more power than the HRT micro

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.449 
little bit more power than the HRT micro
streamer<00:02:35.690> but<00:02:35.989> sounded<00:02:36.440> pretty<00:02:36.890> similar

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
streamer but sounded pretty similar

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.150 
streamer but sounded pretty similar
maybe<00:02:38.360> slightly<00:02:38.900> more<00:02:39.260> authoritative<00:02:39.800> in<00:02:40.069> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
maybe slightly more authoritative in the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.150 
maybe slightly more authoritative in the
base<00:02:40.370> than<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.209> micro<00:02:41.540> streamer<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.590> really

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
base than the micro streamer but really

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.420 
base than the micro streamer but really
pretty<00:02:43.340> similar<00:02:43.700> products<00:02:44.120> there<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:46.160> overall

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
pretty similar products there so overall

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.670 
pretty similar products there so overall
very<00:02:46.910> impressive<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.569> dragonfly<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.530> should

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
very impressive the dragonfly you should

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.590 
very impressive the dragonfly you should

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
probably the smallest simplest and best

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.650 
probably the smallest simplest and best
