00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.060 
were a great safety finish top last year
it<00:05:51.990> was<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.140> game<00:05:52.350> that<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.590> thought<00:05:52.740> could<00:05:52.800> have

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
it was a game that I thought could have

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.760 
it was a game that I thought could have
you<00:05:53.490> know<00:05:53.610> gone<00:05:54.390> either<00:05:54.540> way<00:05:54.660> I<00:05:55.050> thought<00:05:55.590> in

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
you know gone either way I thought in

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.860 
you know gone either way I thought in
the<00:05:55.860> end<00:05:55.980> we<00:05:56.190> we<00:05:56.460> certainly<00:05:56.670> created<00:05:57.120> enough

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
the end we we certainly created enough

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.810 
the end we we certainly created enough
chances<00:05:58.290> to<00:05:58.470> score<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.890> couple<00:05:59.010> more<00:05:59.310> goals<00:05:59.490> but

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
chances to score a couple more goals but

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.610 
chances to score a couple more goals but
I'll<00:06:00.330> take<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.690> one<00:06:00.720> there<00:06:01.020> went<00:06:01.230> in<00:06:01.350> the

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
I'll take the one there went in the

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.160 
I'll take the one there went in the
three<00:06:01.830> points
