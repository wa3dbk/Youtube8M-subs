Laura Vesta actually has significantly
higher<00:00:42.859> physical<00:00:43.399> attack<00:00:43.730> then<00:00:44.120> volcarona

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
higher physical attack then volcarona

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.959 
higher physical attack then volcarona
does<00:00:45.230> whereas<00:00:45.859> volcarona<00:00:46.219> is<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.640> special

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
attacker of the evolution so with that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.130 
attacker of the evolution so with that
80<00:00:49.370> base<00:00:49.640> physical<00:00:50.120> attack<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.600> larve<00:00:50.809> esta

this set that I'm showing you today was
probably<00:01:01.190> meant<00:01:01.760> for<00:01:02.089> little<00:01:02.329> cup<00:01:02.510> settings

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
probably meant for little cup settings

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.299 
probably meant for little cup settings
and<00:01:03.229> if<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:03.469> don't<00:01:03.649> know<00:01:03.710> what<00:01:03.800> little<00:01:04.010> cup<00:01:04.129> is

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
going to go with the flame body ability

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.420 
going to go with the flame body ability
just<00:01:38.960> because<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:39.469> the<00:01:39.649> only<00:01:39.680> ability

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
just because that's the only ability

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.520 
just because that's the only ability
that<00:01:40.609> lower<00:01:41.210> Vesta<00:01:41.570> can<00:01:41.750> currently<00:01:41.930> get<00:01:42.289> and

that lower Vesta can currently get and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.529 
that lower Vesta can currently get and
it's<00:01:43.100> really<00:01:43.250> great<00:01:43.490> because<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.090> has<00:01:44.329> that

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
it's really great because it has that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.090

of damage off if it switches in with
those<00:02:34.810> entry<00:02:35.260> hazards<00:02:35.620> up<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.000> that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
those entry hazards up so with that

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.840 
those entry hazards up so with that
leftovers<00:02:37.930> will<00:02:38.140> also<00:02:38.410> help<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.770> recover<00:02:39.190> some

HP even though it's not going to be

HP even though it's not going to be
recovering<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.260> ton<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.620> HP<00:02:45.040> but<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.400> will<00:02:45.550> help

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
recovering a ton of HP but it will help

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.000 
recovering a ton of HP but it will help
its<00:02:45.970> survivability<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.320> also<00:02:47.500> will<00:02:47.830> help

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
its survivability and it also will help

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.830 
its survivability and it also will help
with<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.519> few<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> moves<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.690> are

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
with a few of the moves that we are

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.720 
with a few of the moves that we are
using<00:02:50.110> with<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.769> set<00:02:51.040> which<00:02:51.280> I'll<00:02:51.430> get<00:02:51.580> you

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
using with this set which I'll get you

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.699 
using with this set which I'll get you
right<00:02:51.910> now<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.080> first<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.560> we're

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
right now but the first one that we're

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.920 
right now but the first one that we're
gonna<00:02:53.800> make<00:02:54.010> use<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.610> Flame<00:02:54.970> Charge<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.660> as

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
gonna make use of is Flame Charge and as

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.720 
gonna make use of is Flame Charge and as
a<00:02:56.170> lot<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.680> know<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.130> love<00:02:57.400> Flame<00:02:57.700> Charge

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
a lot of you know I love Flame Charge

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.180 
a lot of you know I love Flame Charge
and<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.300> think<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.720> lot<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:59.050> fire<00:02:59.380> pokemon<00:02:59.769> should

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
and I think a lot of fire pokemon should

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.920 
and I think a lot of fire pokemon should
be<00:03:00.280> using<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:00.790> move<00:03:01.030> more<00:03:01.300> instead<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.720> like

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
be using this move more instead of like

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.320 
be using this move more instead of like
scarfing<00:03:02.470> themselves<00:03:03.010> or<00:03:03.160> something<00:03:03.550> because

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
scarfing themselves or something because

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.150 
scarfing themselves or something because
having<00:03:05.050> Flame<00:03:05.230> Charge<00:03:05.260> allows<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
having Flame Charge allows you to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.370 
having Flame Charge allows you to
basically<00:03:06.340> get<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.360> benefits<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.170> choice

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
basically get the benefits of a choice

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.930 
basically get the benefits of a choice
scarf<00:03:08.709> which<00:03:08.920> out<00:03:09.100> without<00:03:09.400> being<00:03:09.640> locked

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
scarf which out without being locked

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.180 
scarf which out without being locked
into<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.300> move<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:11.290> why<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:11.860> great<00:03:12.040> on

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
into a move and why this is so great on

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.280 
into a move and why this is so great on
in<00:03:12.280> our<00:03:12.400> Vesta<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.819> because<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.420> only<00:03:13.540> has<00:03:13.780> 60

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
in our Vesta is because it only has 60

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.770 
in our Vesta is because it only has 60
base<00:03:14.500> speed<00:03:14.860> so<00:03:15.519> it's<00:03:15.730> not<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:15.940> fastest<00:03:16.569> thing

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
base speed so it's not the fastest thing

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.470 
base speed so it's not the fastest thing
ever<00:03:17.050> so<00:03:17.650> having<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.100> flame<00:03:18.310> charge<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:19.239> boost

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
ever so having a flame charge to boost

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.990 
ever so having a flame charge to boost
your<00:03:19.660> speed<00:03:19.989> will<00:03:20.350> be<00:03:20.709> almost<00:03:20.980> essential<00:03:21.610> to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
automatic plus one speed from it is

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.479 
automatic plus one speed from it is
excellent<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.810> essential<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.440> set<00:03:32.709> but

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
excellent and essential to the set but

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.160 
excellent and essential to the set but
with<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.820> with<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.750> way<00:03:34.930> we're

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
with the with that the way we're

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.900 
with the with that the way we're
basically<00:03:35.530> going<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.920> be<00:03:36.010> making<00:03:36.400> use<00:03:36.549> of<00:03:36.579> the

basically going to be making use of the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.580 
basically going to be making use of the
speed<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.600> power<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.959> lower<00:03:38.230> Vesta<00:03:38.560> has

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
speed and the power that lower Vesta has

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.130 
speed and the power that lower Vesta has
is<00:03:39.040> by<00:03:39.700> using<00:03:39.970> these<00:03:40.299> three<00:03:40.600> attacking<00:03:41.049> moves

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
is by using these three attacking moves

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.229 
is by using these three attacking moves
which<00:03:41.380> I<00:03:41.500> have<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.820> were<00:03:42.910> also<00:03:43.060> you

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
which I have for you that were also you

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.080 
which I have for you that were also you
know<00:03:43.450> given<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.019> me<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.470> set<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.850> the

know given to me in the set and the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.759 
know given to me in the set and the
first<00:03:46.299> of<00:03:46.480> which<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.630> flame<00:03:47.140> flare<00:03:47.590> blitz

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
first of which is flame flare blitz

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.620 
first of which is flame flare blitz
which<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.519> obviously<00:03:49.060> one<00:03:49.299> of<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.420> most

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
which is obviously one of the most

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.190 
which is obviously one of the most
powerful<00:03:49.840> physical<00:03:50.650> fire<00:03:51.370> type<00:03:51.700> moves<00:03:52.200> it's

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
powerful physical fire type moves it's

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.160 
powerful physical fire type moves it's
120<00:03:53.890> base<00:03:54.100> but<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.519> does<00:03:54.700> have<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:55.120> nasty<00:03:55.420> recoil

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
120 base but it does have a nasty recoil

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.259 
120 base but it does have a nasty recoil
when<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.410> use<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.519> also<00:03:57.850> is<00:03:58.060> where

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
when you use it so that also is where

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.750 
when you use it so that also is where
leftovers<00:03:58.870> comes<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.320> handy<00:03:59.500> because<00:03:59.980> having

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
leftovers comes in handy because having

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.699 
leftovers comes in handy because having
leftovers<00:04:01.359> to<00:04:01.510> recover<00:04:01.810> some<00:04:02.109> of<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.380> recoil

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
leftovers to recover some of that recoil

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.210 
leftovers to recover some of that recoil
is<00:04:03.239> very<00:04:04.239> essential<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:05.079> allow<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.680> last

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
is very essential to allow you to last

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.759 
is very essential to allow you to last
longer<00:04:06.579> in<00:04:06.850> battle<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.420> deal<00:04:07.810> more<00:04:08.079> damage<00:04:08.140> to

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
longer in battle and deal more damage to

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.680 
longer in battle and deal more damage to
the<00:04:08.859> Pokemon<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.430> you're<00:04:09.549> up<00:04:09.670> against<00:04:10.060> it's

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
the Pokemon that you're up against it's

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.110 
the Pokemon that you're up against it's
also<00:04:10.870> really<00:04:11.230> useful<00:04:11.530> because<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.700> fact<00:04:12.940> that

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
also really useful because the fact that

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.460 
also really useful because the fact that
if<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.200> do<00:04:14.500> happen<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.299> land<00:04:16.299> or<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.750> switch<00:04:17.289> in

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
if you do happen to land or a switch in

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.860 
if you do happen to land or a switch in
when<00:04:17.769> there<00:04:17.979> is<00:04:18.130> stealth<00:04:18.459> rock<00:04:18.700> up<00:04:18.910> after

when there is stealth rock up after
flare<00:04:20.200> blitzing<00:04:20.620> something<00:04:21.039> you're<00:04:21.280> not

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
flare blitzing something you're not

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.279 
flare blitzing something you're not
going<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.760> be<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.910> lot<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.330> health<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:22.960> having

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
going to be a lot of health so having

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.510 
going to be a lot of health so having
leftovers<00:04:23.919> is

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
leftovers is

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.210 
leftovers is
very<00:04:25.180> useful<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:26.379> allow<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.800> survive

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
very useful to allow you to survive

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.300 
very useful to allow you to survive
ability<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.940> be<00:04:28.900> increased<00:04:29.379> a<00:04:29.740> little<00:04:30.069> bit

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
ability to be increased a little bit

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.879 
ability to be increased a little bit
more<00:04:30.539> um<00:04:31.539> and<00:04:31.810> then<00:04:32.020> up<00:04:32.169> next<00:04:32.199> we're<00:04:32.740> going<00:04:32.830> to

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
more um and then up next we're going to

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.529 
more um and then up next we're going to
be<00:04:33.039> going<00:04:33.190> with<00:04:33.430> wild<00:04:33.759> charge<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.300> wild

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
be going with wild charge and wild

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.689 
be going with wild charge and wild
charge<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:34.900> excellent<00:04:35.470> for<00:04:35.620> larve<00:04:36.370> esta

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
charge is excellent for larve esta

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.550 
charge is excellent for larve esta
because<00:04:37.060> it's<00:04:37.300> weak<00:04:37.509> to<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.720> few<00:04:38.020> things<00:04:38.199> that

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
because it's weak to a few things that

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.110 
because it's weak to a few things that
wild<00:04:38.860> charge<00:04:39.039> would<00:04:39.430> be<00:04:39.610> super<00:04:39.879> effective

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
wild charge would be super effective

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.939 
wild charge would be super effective
against<00:04:40.629> namely<00:04:42.180> flying<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.949> electrified

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
against namely flying and electrified

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.860 
against namely flying and electrified
water<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:45.940> that's<00:04:46.120> really<00:04:46.270> good<00:04:46.509> for<00:04:46.539> type

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
water so that's really good for type

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.230 
water so that's really good for type
coverage<00:04:47.319> on<00:04:47.590> la<00:04:47.740> festa<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.400> also<00:04:48.610> has<00:04:48.879> a<00:04:48.909> nasty

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
coverage on la festa it also has a nasty

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.020 
coverage on la festa it also has a nasty
recoil<00:04:49.810> so<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.710> leftovers<00:04:51.430> will<00:04:51.610> also<00:04:51.849> help

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
recoil so the leftovers will also help

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.790 
recoil so the leftovers will also help
out<00:04:52.210> there<00:04:52.449> as<00:04:52.659> well<00:04:52.840> as<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.139> know<00:04:53.169> rapid<00:04:53.590> spin

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
out there as well as you know rapid spin

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.860 
out there as well as you know rapid spin
support<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.400> then<00:04:55.060> lastly<00:04:55.419> we're<00:04:55.690> going<00:04:55.810> to

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
support and then lastly we're going to

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.779 
support and then lastly we're going to
round<00:04:56.050> off<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.259> set<00:04:56.680> with<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.889> stab<00:04:57.250> bug<00:04:57.550> bite

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
round off the set with a stab bug bite

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.760 
round off the set with a stab bug bite
from<00:04:58.030> our<00:04:58.240> Vesta<00:04:58.630> which<00:04:58.810> even<00:04:59.229> though<00:04:59.620> it

check of damage to the things that it

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.230 
check of damage to the things that it
will<00:05:05.860> be<00:05:05.889> super<00:05:06.159> effective<00:05:06.550> against<00:05:07.090> the

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.920 
things you'll want to be using it
against<00:05:08.830> but<00:05:09.430> overall<00:05:09.669> this<00:05:10.180> is<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.449> pretty

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
against but overall this is a pretty

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.320 
against but overall this is a pretty
solid<00:05:11.259> set<00:05:11.889> for<00:05:12.159> this<00:05:12.250> Pokemon<00:05:12.699> and<00:05:12.940> in<00:05:13.150> all

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
solid set for this Pokemon and in all

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.480 
solid set for this Pokemon and in all
honesty<00:05:13.360> I've<00:05:14.020> never<00:05:14.349> really<00:05:14.740> explored<00:05:15.220> what

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
honesty I've never really explored what

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.330 
honesty I've never really explored what
lar<00:05:15.699> Vesta<00:05:16.060> could<00:05:16.270> do<00:05:16.419> ever<00:05:16.659> before<00:05:17.110> but<00:05:17.949> this

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
lar Vesta could do ever before but this

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.159 
lar Vesta could do ever before but this
person<00:05:18.580> was<00:05:18.849> obviously<00:05:19.210> able<00:05:19.569> to<00:05:19.690> open<00:05:20.050> my

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
person was obviously able to open my

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.899 
person was obviously able to open my
eyes<00:05:20.349> to<00:05:20.650> what<00:05:20.770> L<00:05:20.860> are<00:05:20.949> Vesta<00:05:21.280> could<00:05:21.430> do<00:05:21.610> and

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
eyes to what L are Vesta could do and

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.240 
eyes to what L are Vesta could do and
regardless<00:05:22.719> of<00:05:23.020> whether<00:05:23.710> or<00:05:23.830> not<00:05:24.039> you're

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
using this Pokemon and little cup or an

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.890 
using this Pokemon and little cup or an
nu<00:05:26.949> i<00:05:27.159> see<00:05:27.759> this<00:05:27.909> having<00:05:28.210> a<00:05:28.300> lot<00:05:28.479> of<00:05:28.599> potential

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
nu i see this having a lot of potential

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.420 
nu i see this having a lot of potential
due<00:05:29.259> to<00:05:29.349> the<00:05:29.469> fact<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:29.830> you're<00:05:30.099> able<00:05:30.219> to

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
due to the fact that you're able to

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.089 
due to the fact that you're able to
boost<00:05:30.639> your<00:05:30.789> speed<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.330> also<00:05:32.169> make<00:05:32.830> use<00:05:33.069> of

boost your speed and also make use of

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.610 
boost your speed and also make use of
some<00:05:33.340> pretty<00:05:33.759> powerful<00:05:34.169> physical<00:05:35.169> attacking

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
some pretty powerful physical attacking

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.200 
some pretty powerful physical attacking
moves<00:05:35.770> with<00:05:36.039> really<00:05:36.400> good<00:05:36.550> type<00:05:36.789> coverage

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
moves with really good type coverage

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.350 
moves with really good type coverage
like<00:05:38.050> fire<00:05:38.590> electric<00:05:39.130> bug<00:05:39.400> is<00:05:39.699> something<00:05:40.270> that

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
like fire electric bug is something that

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.999 
like fire electric bug is something that
not<00:05:40.569> a<00:05:40.630> lot<00:05:40.719> of<00:05:40.870> Pokemon<00:05:41.349> can<00:05:41.560> see<00:05:41.770> that<00:05:41.889> they

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
not a lot of Pokemon can see that they

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.249 
not a lot of Pokemon can see that they

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
stabbed on two of them it's going to be

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.689 
stabbed on two of them it's going to be
doing<00:05:47.050> a<00:05:47.259> lot<00:05:47.289> of<00:05:47.440> damage<00:05:47.740> even<00:05:48.279> though<00:05:48.460> it's

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
doing a lot of damage even though it's

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.730 
doing a lot of damage even though it's
not<00:05:48.819> really<00:05:49.330> seen<00:05:49.599> as<00:05:49.810> that<00:05:50.050> powerful<00:05:50.560> of<00:05:50.680> a

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
not really seen as that powerful of a

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.339 
not really seen as that powerful of a
Pokemon<00:05:51.219> but<00:05:51.909> i<00:05:51.940> really<00:05:52.419> like<00:05:52.569> the<00:05:52.719> set<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.199> i

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
Pokemon but i really like the set and i

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.839 
Pokemon but i really like the set and i
think<00:05:53.560> laura<00:05:53.770> Vesta<00:05:54.069> has<00:05:54.099> one<00:05:54.370> of<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.580> coolest

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
think laura Vesta has one of the coolest

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.260 
think laura Vesta has one of the coolest
designs<00:05:55.419> from<00:05:55.690> 5th<00:05:55.990> gen<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:57.340> that's<00:05:57.580> probably

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
designs from 5th gen and that's probably

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.610 
designs from 5th gen and that's probably
one<00:05:58.509> of<00:05:58.539> the<00:05:58.690> main<00:05:58.840> reasons<00:05:59.169> why<00:05:59.289> I<00:05:59.319> think<00:05:59.409> this

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
one of the main reasons why I think this

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.980 
one of the main reasons why I think this
Pokemon<00:06:00.069> is<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:00.279> cool<00:06:00.520> anyway<00:06:00.880> but<00:06:01.659> that<00:06:01.870> is
