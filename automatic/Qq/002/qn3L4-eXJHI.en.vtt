 shinagawa station let's pick up the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.800
 view to the immigration offices here 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.410
 in Tokyo a few days ago I received the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.230
 notification by mail that was 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.980

 another occasion just like 4 million and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.640
 I also bring the foreign card that 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.920
 apparently it's going to be replaced by a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 new so I'll probably be picked up 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.489
 I know it's Monday fortunately I have the day 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.129
 free so we take the opportunity to collect 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 the visa only give limited time for 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.239
 that you go to pick it up they do not send it to you 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.460
 address and if you can not go you can 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.649
 send someone who is authorized to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.629
 I can pick it up for you if you do not have 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.360
 If you do not have time to go pick it up 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.890
 for some reason there is the bus that 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.890
 let's operate us for more time 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.800
 I arrived in this collective is equipped 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.570
 with free internet access great without 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.890
 I can explain your email so 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.400
 same you have to make the trip 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.400
 ah 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.670
 we are here 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.020
 a sumo wrestler probably 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.840
 renewing your sight there are also many 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.569
 foreigners as sumo wrestlers 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.399
 professionally here in japan the already 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.609
 stamped call my number we carry as 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.340
 three hours here is my number and we are the 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.380
 next here is the new visa the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 visa is this card that also serves 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.429
 as your identification they no longer give you the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.859
 visa in the passport as they did 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.149
 before so to leave or enter the country 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.709
 you have to carry the new card 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.840
 even here in japan 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.969
 you have to charge it by law all the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.860
 we will be back here in 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.869
 another three years if we still 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.750
 on foot in japan at least for the next 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.860
 we already know how the movement is 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.500
 continue memories you can see the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.390
 studies of the fujii channel and from here or 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.310
 of sample practically there in front 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.470
 I do not know if they can see the building with 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.049
 sphere shape but it is seems if we go 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.329
 to eat here we will check places where 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.620
 eat in this area without water and 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.069
 we found that there is a restaurant 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.840
 Korean I have a lot that I do not like 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.750
 food peaks so let's take advantage 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.190
 that in a restaurant was here close 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.940
 according to the maps heading and my phone is 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.460
 marked 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.950
 that is here in fact no longer 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.050
 we found nothing else that we are giving 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.510
 the return in these alleys that are 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.240
 interesting these restaurants are 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.600
 small at most have to accumulate 20 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.280
 people or less but they feel very 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.720
 runners I really like the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.030
 environment these alleys with 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.520
 restaurants I was feeling that the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.400
 Food is very tasty and you can put 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.800
 back with friends but how is it 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.960
 midweek and there are many offices I'm 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.880
 sure we will see only workers from 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.880
 office eating at this time 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.140
 as we said well only worker of 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.909
 office taking lunch which maybe 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.440
 everything we have is hungry and not 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.390
 we have the opportunity to eat food 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.569
 Korean have been so let's eat 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.519
 what we can to what burns the most 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.180
 the stomach we see the soup well 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.180
 spicy 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.390
 It was not bad at all, lunch was given 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.890
 Korean chewing gum and europe the breath the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.640
 Korean food leaves you breathless 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.489
 little strong I had enough conchi 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.750
 I need one I do not know if it's just me but 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.270
 whenever I go to different places 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.970
 Here in Tokyo I feel a little deja 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.459
 vu 'I need many areas have the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.040
 same configurations many buildings 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.010
 they look like they do not have much color they are 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.100
 more gray or white with screens 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.160
 very distinctive large ads but 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.040
 they do not have the same design and when you go 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.190
 on the train in areas like for example 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.730
 shibuya yokohama in the tour you can 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.460
 see the city and you can see the colors 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.590
 of buildings that are almost the same in 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.410
 the houses also have shades of 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.960
 discreet colors and almost always in the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.760
 same color also good that's all 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.410
 for today I leave the links to 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.330
 the other two channels that I'm at 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.430
 phoenix and the technology channel already 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.350

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.230
 Crouch and sound in Japanese and do the
