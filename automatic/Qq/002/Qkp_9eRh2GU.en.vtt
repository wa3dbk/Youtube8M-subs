how you met him I'll tell you I was tell
you<00:00:58.640> shorter<00:00:59.180> abbreviated<00:00:59.870> version<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:00.469> it's

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
you shorter abbreviated version but it's

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.279 
you shorter abbreviated version but it's
AI<00:01:00.860> really<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:01.910> hard<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:02.360> even<00:01:02.480> believe<00:01:03.020> now

AI really it's hard to even believe now

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.139 
AI really it's hard to even believe now
but<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.890> irony<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.399> that<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.610> didn't<00:01:04.910> know<00:01:04.970> who

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
but the irony is that I didn't know who

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.660 
but the irony is that I didn't know who
Gene<00:01:05.330> Kelly<00:01:05.479> was<00:01:05.750> when<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:06.170> met<00:01:06.440> him<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:06.920> I<00:01:07.190> wrote

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
Gene Kelly was when I met him so I wrote

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.490 
Gene Kelly was when I met him so I wrote
a<00:01:07.700> television<00:01:08.119> special<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:08.899> he<00:01:09.020> was<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.319> host

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
a television special and he was the host

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.580 
a television special and he was the host
narrator<00:01:10.039> and<00:01:10.459> but<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:11.360> honestly<00:01:12.050> think<00:01:12.259> it<00:01:12.470> was

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
narrator and but I honestly think it was

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.590 
narrator and but I honestly think it was
kind<00:01:12.830> of<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.069> way<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.220> meet<00:01:13.700> him<00:01:13.850> because<00:01:14.000> my

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
kind of the way to meet him because my

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.779 
kind of the way to meet him because my
pet<00:01:14.929> study<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.410> graduate<00:01:15.860> school<00:01:16.160> was<00:01:16.490> word
