00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
bunny I think that was pretty much a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300 
bunny I think that was pretty much a
cast<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.390> studs<00:01:09.780> most<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> heroes<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
cast of studs most of the heroes in that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.450 
cast of studs most of the heroes in that
show<00:01:11.610> were<00:01:11.850> quite<00:01:12.540> studly<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.229> buff<00:01:13.470> but

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
sky-high was the Golden Boy when I think

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.760 
sky-high was the Golden Boy when I think
of<00:01:17.729> him<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.509> old-school<00:01:18.990> Superman

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
