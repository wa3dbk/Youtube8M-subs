00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
you know minecraft isn't he come steve-o

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.030 
you know minecraft isn't he come steve-o
here<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.179> another<00:00:12.389> video<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.960> today<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.769> want

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
here with another video and today I want

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.369 
here with another video and today I want
to<00:00:14.130> bring<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.540> do<00:00:15.540> ledge<00:00:15.780> from<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.109> estate

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
to bring you do ledge from on estate

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.019 
to bring you do ledge from on estate
with<00:00:16.500> circuits<00:00:16.890> now<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.490> has<00:00:17.609> probably<00:00:17.820> been

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
with circuits now this has probably been

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.700 
with circuits now this has probably been
done<00:00:18.330> before<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.690> I'm<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:18.900> gonna<00:00:19.140> claim<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.650> be

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
done before so I'm not gonna claim to be

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.439 
done before so I'm not gonna claim to be
the<00:00:19.830> first<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.250> done<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.580> I'm<00:00:21.300> probably

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the first to have done it I'm probably

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.179 
the first to have done it I'm probably
do<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> search<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> find<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.710> someone<00:00:23.010> has

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
do a search and find that someone has

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.730 
do a search and find that someone has
done<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.180> was<00:00:24.660> directing<00:00:25.050> around<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
done it but I was directing around as I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.540 
done it but I was directing around as I
normally<00:00:25.800> would<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:27.330> found<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.990> way<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.800> make

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
normally would and I found a way to make

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.600 
normally would and I found a way to make
ace<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.119> dual<00:00:30.449> edge<00:00:30.679> more<00:00:31.679> stable<00:00:32.189> circuit

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
ace a dual edge more stable circuit

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.420 
ace a dual edge more stable circuit
which<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.820> want<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> show<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> show<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.430> for

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
which I want to show it show to you for

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.720 
which I want to show it show to you for
a<00:00:35.489> few<00:00:35.640> more<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.770> it's<00:00:37.770> let's<00:00:38.550> work

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
a few more in there and it's let's work

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.270 
a few more in there and it's let's work
of<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.739> say<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
of it so this one here is just say I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.240 
of it so this one here is just say I
guess<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.030> use<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.710> let<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:43.950> first<00:00:44.160> show

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
guess I use for it but let me first show

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.220 
guess I use for it but let me first show
you<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> system<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> my<00:00:45.539> daughter's<00:00:45.930> -

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you the system this is my daughter's -

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.529 
you the system this is my daughter's -
Nova<00:00:46.469> circuit<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.300> works

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
Nova circuit as you can see it works

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.160 
Nova circuit as you can see it works
with<00:00:48.780> lever<00:00:49.079> input<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.210> also<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.539> button

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
with lever input and also with button

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.330 
with lever input and also with button
input<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.530> doesn't<00:00:52.770> matter<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> input

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
input it doesn't matter what the input

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
input it doesn't matter what the input
is<00:00:53.930> as<00:00:54.930> long<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.039> input<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:57.260> longer<00:00:58.260> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
is as long as the input is longer I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.240 
is as long as the input is longer I
guess<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> then<00:00:59.670> two<00:01:00.000> tix

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
guess if it then two tix

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.460 
guess if it then two tix
it<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.460> work<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.699> fine<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.080> less

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
it will work just fine if it is less

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
it will work just fine if it is less
than<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:04.830> tix<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> needed<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.330> stable

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
than two tix so you I needed more stable

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.060 
than two tix so you I needed more stable
circuit<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.260> you've<00:01:07.439> already<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:07.740> one

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
circuit because you've already got one

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.330 
circuit because you've already got one
to<00:01:08.340> create<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.060> tick<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.140> basically<00:01:11.070> how

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
to create the one tick so basically how

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
to create the one tick so basically how
it<00:01:11.460> works<00:01:11.520> let's<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.299> into<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> science

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it works let's get into the science

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.570 
it works let's get into the science
behind<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.549> we've<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.869> piston

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
behind it we've got here is a piston

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.510 
behind it we've got here is a piston
with<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> block<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> repeater<00:01:19.250> like<00:01:20.250> so

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
with a block and then a repeater like so

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.480 
with a block and then a repeater like so
so<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> input<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.869> either<00:01:22.710> from<00:01:23.009> back<00:01:23.189> there

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
so the input is either from back there

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.910 
so the input is either from back there
or<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.540> whatever<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.350> from<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> sides

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
or up here or whatever or from the sides

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
or up here or whatever or from the sides
doesn't<00:01:26.310> matter<00:01:26.430> how<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> input<00:01:27.299> but

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
doesn't matter how you do the input but

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.980 
doesn't matter how you do the input but
the<00:01:27.840> input<00:01:28.640> sends<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.820> tick<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the input sends one tick down here and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.109 
the input sends one tick down here and
it<00:01:31.110> takes<00:01:31.290> two<00:01:31.500> ticks<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.009> close<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> cert<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
it takes two ticks to close the cert to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.730 
it takes two ticks to close the cert to
close<00:01:33.329> off<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.750> piston<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> piston

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
close off this piston so the piston

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.090 
close off this piston so the piston
takes<00:01:34.920> two<00:01:35.070> person<00:01:35.430> two<00:01:35.729> ticks<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.630> extend<00:01:37.100> in

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
takes two person two ticks to extend in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.399 
takes two person two ticks to extend in
the<00:01:38.220> meantime<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.909> tick<00:01:39.210> from<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:40.020> repeater

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the meantime one tick from this repeater

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.030 
the meantime one tick from this repeater
has<00:01:40.680> got<00:01:40.890> through<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:43.470> wherever<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> needs

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
has got through and to wherever it needs

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.590 
has got through and to wherever it needs
to<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.759> tick<00:01:44.939> goes<00:01:45.090> through<00:01:45.390> from<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
to go so one tick goes through from the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.910 
to go so one tick goes through from the
repeater<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> piston<00:01:46.409> extends<00:01:46.710> one

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
repeater and then the piston extends one

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
repeater and then the piston extends one
tick<00:01:47.070> later<00:01:47.299> now<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> falling<00:01:48.899> edge

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
tick later now on the falling edge

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.700 
tick later now on the falling edge
because<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> piston<00:01:51.290> because<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> piston

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
because the piston because the piston

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.730 
because the piston because the piston
takes<00:01:52.920> two<00:01:53.100> ticks<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:54.049> fully<00:01:55.049> retract<00:01:55.470> means

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
takes two ticks to fully retract means

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.429 
takes two ticks to fully retract means
nothing<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.509> does<00:01:57.719> happen<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.200> we've

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
nothing but what does happen is we've

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.520 
nothing but what does happen is we've
got<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.860> tick<00:01:59.390> delay<00:02:00.390> stored<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.290> here

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
got one tick delay stored in here

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
got one tick delay stored in here
because<00:02:01.799> there's<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.100> repeater<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.240> when

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
because there's a repeater and so when

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.969 
because there's a repeater and so when
we<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.110> same<00:02:04.290> with<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> new<00:02:04.649> system

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
we it's the same with the new system

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.760 
we it's the same with the new system
really<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.930> piece<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> redstone

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
really if we have a piece of redstone

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.160 
really if we have a piece of redstone
and<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.849> repeater<00:02:09.950> with<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> lever

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and a repeater with a lever

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.940 
and a repeater with a lever
let's<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.100> connect<00:02:14.430> them<00:02:14.580> shall<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:14.960> as<00:02:15.960> you

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
let's not connect them shall we as you

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.309 
let's not connect them shall we as you
can<00:02:17.130> see<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.850> one<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.300> repeater<00:02:18.630> turns<00:02:19.140> off

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
can see the one the repeater turns off

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.430 
can see the one the repeater turns off
one<00:02:19.590> tick<00:02:19.860> after<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.520> rest<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:20.970> so

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
one tick after the rest of it so

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.660 
one tick after the rest of it so
regardless<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.620> what<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> system<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.310> made<00:02:23.520> of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
regardless of what the system is made of

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.380 
regardless of what the system is made of
but<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.720> piston<00:02:25.520> retracting<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:27.150> doesn't

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
but the piston retracting it doesn't

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.940 
but the piston retracting it doesn't
need<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.569> be<00:02:27.660> fully<00:02:27.870> retracted<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.590> order<00:02:28.800> for

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
need to be fully retracted in order for

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.490 
need to be fully retracted in order for
resident<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> escape<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.180> allows<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:31.260> tick

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
resident to escape so it allows one tick

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.949 
resident to escape so it allows one tick
out<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.130> when<00:02:32.610> we<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.390> sends<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> tick

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
out so when we do that it sends the tick

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.330 
out so when we do that it sends the tick
and<00:02:34.200> when<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.740> at<00:02:34.860> end<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.160> tick

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
and when we do that at end of the tick

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.790 
and when we do that at end of the tick
so<00:02:35.700> yeah<00:02:36.360> that's<00:02:36.600> how<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.780> works<00:02:36.959> now<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.620> can

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
so yeah that's how it works now this can

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.620 
so yeah that's how it works now this can
also<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:38.070> tiled<00:02:38.490> as<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.820> can<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.180> over<00:02:39.420> there

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
also be tiled as you can see over there

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.100 
also be tiled as you can see over there
as<00:02:39.750> well<00:02:40.100> one<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.310> has<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.870> one<00:02:42.870> walk

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
as well one this has to be one walk

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.440 
as well one this has to be one walk
higher<00:02:43.380> than<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> other<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:44.940> work<00:02:45.180> just

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
higher than the other and they work just

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.330 
higher than the other and they work just
fine<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.020> can<00:02:46.260> see<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.950> they<00:02:47.130> work

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
fine as you can see here they work

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
fine as you can see here they work
individually<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:50.450> don't<00:02:51.450> affect<00:02:51.750> each

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
individually and and don't affect each

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.199 
individually and and don't affect each
other<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.680> if<00:02:53.340> we<00:02:53.489> wanted<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.760> use<00:02:53.910> them<00:02:54.090> for

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
other so if we wanted to use them for

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.790 
other so if we wanted to use them for
the<00:02:54.300> same<00:02:54.540> sort<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.959> sequence<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.500> I've<00:02:55.650> done

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
the same sort of sequence like I've done

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.470 
the same sort of sequence like I've done
here

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
here

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.740 
here
you<00:02:57.480> might<00:02:57.630> add<00:02:57.840> some<00:02:58.110> kind<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.470> tricky

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
you might add some kind of tricky

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.640 
you might add some kind of tricky
mechanism<00:03:00.750> like<00:03:00.900> I've<00:03:01.050> done<00:03:01.200> here<00:03:01.260> with<00:03:01.620> a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
mechanism like I've done here with a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.340 
mechanism like I've done here with a
falling<00:03:02.130> edge<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.640> sorry<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.350> diminishing

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
falling edge or a sorry a diminishing

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.220 
falling edge or a sorry a diminishing
edge<00:03:04.489> where<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:06.120> will<00:03:06.300> diminish<00:03:06.570> one<00:03:07.019> each

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
edge where this will diminish one each

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.220 
edge where this will diminish one each
tick<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.090> each<00:03:09.090> time<00:03:09.450> one<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.810> these<00:03:09.989> is

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
tick and each time one of these is

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.270 
tick and each time one of these is
retracted<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.280> sends<00:03:11.580> one<00:03:11.610> tick<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
retracted and it sends one tick to to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.430 
retracted and it sends one tick to to
finish<00:03:14.580> off<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.880> circuit<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.660> then<00:03:16.290> when<00:03:16.410> I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
finish off the circuit and then when I

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.050 
finish off the circuit and then when I
pull<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.739> automat<00:03:17.070> for<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.310> last<00:03:17.489> time<00:03:17.700> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
pull the automat for the last time that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.490 
pull the automat for the last time that
block<00:03:18.390> or<00:03:18.720> fall<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.690> see<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
block or fall and if you can see in the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.229 
block or fall and if you can see in the
corner<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.829> your<00:03:22.920> eye<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.310> that's<00:03:23.910> it

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
corner of your eye and that's it

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.330 
corner of your eye and that's it
so<00:03:24.989> really<00:03:25.290> simple<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.769> build<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.130> really

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
so really simple to build and really

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.069 
so really simple to build and really
easy<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.820> play<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.060> let<00:03:27.510> me<00:03:27.600> show<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.900> how<00:03:28.049> to

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
easy to play with let me show you how to

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.759 
easy to play with let me show you how to
how<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:28.500> built<00:03:29.390> so<00:03:30.390> we<00:03:30.510> go<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.170> then<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.560> make

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
how it's built so we go and then we make

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.039 
how it's built so we go and then we make
a<00:03:31.950> four<00:03:32.459> sorry<00:03:33.060> three<00:03:33.299> blocks<00:03:33.540> alone<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
a four sorry three blocks alone on the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.130 
a four sorry three blocks alone on the
bottom<00:03:34.320> with<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.280> repeater<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.940> here<00:03:36.630> now<00:03:37.019> if

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
bottom with a repeater on here now if

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.770 
bottom with a repeater on here now if
you<00:03:37.170> were<00:03:37.380> gonna<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:38.100> tileable<00:03:39.000> version<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
you were gonna do a tileable version you

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.180 
you were gonna do a tileable version you
would<00:03:39.900> need<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.230> alternate<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:40.829> one<00:03:40.980> here

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
would need to alternate this one here

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.470 
would need to alternate this one here
would<00:03:41.250> be<00:03:41.400> redstone<00:03:41.850> at<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.030> bottom<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.390> this

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
would be redstone at the bottom and this

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.530 
would be redstone at the bottom and this
one<00:03:42.690> here<00:03:42.989> still<00:03:43.140> stays<00:03:43.500> or<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:43.980> repeater

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
one here still stays or as a repeater

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.050 
one here still stays or as a repeater
but<00:03:45.540> we're<00:03:45.750> gonna<00:03:45.989> do<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.739> one

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
but we're gonna do that just the one

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.670 
but we're gonna do that just the one
wide<00:03:48.060> one<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.299> might<00:03:48.540> actually<00:03:49.140> add<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.560> other

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
wide one I might actually add the other

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.430 
wide one I might actually add the other
on<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.950> end<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.880> other<00:03:51.030> one<00:03:51.410> we<00:03:52.410> just

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
on the end so the other one we just

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.660 
on the end so the other one we just
simply<00:03:52.920> put<00:03:52.980> our<00:03:53.720> piston<00:03:54.720> on<00:03:54.840> there<00:03:55.079> we<00:03:56.040> say<00:03:56.370> a

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
simply put our piston on there we say a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.360 
simply put our piston on there we say a
block<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.239> there<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.890> piece<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.220> redstone

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
block on there and a piece of redstone

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.670 
block on there and a piece of redstone
on<00:03:59.670> there<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.030> we're<00:04:00.239> done<00:04:00.390> that's<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.140> that's

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
on there and we're done that's it that's

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.900 
on there and we're done that's it that's
the<00:04:01.829> whole<00:04:01.980> seek<00:04:02.250> system<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:05.160> works<00:04:05.370> just

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
the whole seek system and it works just

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.060 
the whole seek system and it works just
to<00:04:06.060> show<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.390> works<00:04:06.630> let's<00:04:07.560> add<00:04:07.769> some

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
to show that it works let's add some

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.770 
to show that it works let's add some
move<00:04:08.489> these<00:04:08.640> off<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:08.940> side<00:04:09.000> only<00:04:09.329> because

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
move these off to the side only because

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.750 
move these off to the side only because
this<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.500> powering<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.130> block<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.549> we<00:04:11.579> don't

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
this is powering that block so we don't

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.099 
this is powering that block so we don't
want<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:11.910> attach<00:04:12.150> anything<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.780> block

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
want to attach anything to that block

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.800 
want to attach anything to that block
just<00:04:13.440> because<00:04:14.040> we<00:04:14.190> get<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.370> false<00:04:14.579> reading<00:04:14.810> so

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
just because we get a false reading so

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.509 
just because we get a false reading so
we<00:04:15.930> go<00:04:16.700> boom<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.090> boom<00:04:18.479> done<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.500> works<00:04:19.680> now

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
we go boom and boom done it works now

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.310 
we go boom and boom done it works now
for<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:21.120> toilet<00:04:21.479> we'll<00:04:21.599> design<00:04:21.840> we<00:04:22.200> do

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
for the toilet we'll design we do

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.450 
for the toilet we'll design we do
something<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.710> little<00:04:22.919> bit<00:04:23.010> different<00:04:23.340> let's

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
something a little bit different let's

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.550 
something a little bit different let's
do<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.669> bottom<00:04:23.820> one<00:04:24.060> first<00:04:24.330> we<00:04:24.930> one<00:04:25.169> do<00:04:25.320> two

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
do the bottom one first we one do two

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.540 
do the bottom one first we one do two
blocks<00:04:25.890> and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
blocks and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.730 
blocks and
two<00:04:26.789> blocks<00:04:26.970> at<00:04:27.090> redstone<00:04:27.419> then<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.900> repeater

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
two blocks at redstone then a repeater

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.330 
two blocks at redstone then a repeater
if<00:04:29.490> another<00:04:29.789> one<00:04:30.030> there<00:04:30.319> come<00:04:31.319> up<00:04:31.470> here<00:04:31.949> for

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
if another one there come up here for

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.189 
if another one there come up here for
our<00:04:32.580> output<00:04:32.789> it's<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> little<00:04:33.389> bit<00:04:33.479> longer<00:04:33.720> and

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
our output it's a little bit longer and

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.320 
our output it's a little bit longer and
then<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.919> other<00:04:35.099> one<00:04:35.220> now<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.639> one<00:04:35.699> comes<00:04:36.000> in

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
then the other one now this one comes in

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.680 
then the other one now this one comes in
a<00:04:36.389> little<00:04:36.720> bit<00:04:36.810> more<00:04:37.050> than<00:04:37.409> the<00:04:37.680> previous<00:04:38.400> and

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
a little bit more than the previous and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.839 
a little bit more than the previous and
that's<00:04:39.690> -<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.379> guess<00:04:40.590> compensate<00:04:41.250> for<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
that's - I guess compensate for the

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.999 
that's - I guess compensate for the
other<00:04:42.000> now<00:04:42.750> let's<00:04:43.080> start<00:04:43.560> making<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.889> other

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
other now let's start making the other

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.920 
other now let's start making the other
one<00:04:44.159> before<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:44.550> get<00:04:45.000> too<00:04:45.120> ahead<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.389> myself<00:04:45.539> but

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
one before I get too ahead of myself but

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.379 
one before I get too ahead of myself but
we<00:04:46.050> want<00:04:46.229> to<00:04:46.289> put<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.710> repeater<00:04:47.490> on<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:48.180> backs

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
we want to put a repeater on the backs

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.330 
we want to put a repeater on the backs
of<00:04:48.569> those<00:04:48.750> two<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.229> they<00:04:49.349> go<00:04:49.500> into<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:50.069> block

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
of those two so they go into this block

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.939 
of those two so they go into this block
here<00:04:50.669> so<00:04:50.819> it's<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.060> little<00:04:51.240> bit<00:04:51.389> different<00:04:51.949> have

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
here so it's a little bit different have

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.129 
here so it's a little bit different have
a<00:04:52.979> repeater<00:04:53.759> on<00:04:53.849> or<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.330> piston<00:04:54.780> on<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.900> top

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
a repeater on or a piston on the top

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.869 
a repeater on or a piston on the top
there<00:04:55.409> with<00:04:56.280> some<00:04:57.590> blocks<00:04:58.590> underneath<00:04:59.219> it's

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
there with some blocks underneath it's

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.330 
there with some blocks underneath it's
fun<00:05:00.090> being<00:05:00.389> a<00:05:00.629> repeater<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.469> this<00:05:01.949> one<00:05:02.129> being

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
fun being a repeater and this one being

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.189 
fun being a repeater and this one being
a<00:05:02.460> piece<00:05:02.610> of<00:05:02.759> redstone<00:05:02.909> so<00:05:03.719> it'll<00:05:04.110> look

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
a piece of redstone so it'll look

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.320 
a piece of redstone so it'll look
slightly<00:05:04.620> different<00:05:05.069> this<00:05:05.430> one<00:05:05.639> comes<00:05:05.849> up<00:05:06.000> one

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
slightly different this one comes up one

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.149 
slightly different this one comes up one
earlier<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:06.990> let's<00:05:07.379> just<00:05:07.560> so<00:05:07.650> we<00:05:07.830> don't<00:05:08.009> have

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
earlier and let's just so we don't have

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.129 
earlier and let's just so we don't have
the<00:05:08.310> two<00:05:08.460> of<00:05:08.490> them<00:05:08.759> mixing<00:05:09.509> and<00:05:09.659> matching<00:05:09.810> and

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
the two of them mixing and matching and

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.680 
the two of them mixing and matching and
whatever<00:05:10.379> and<00:05:11.039> that's<00:05:11.849> it<00:05:12.000> now<00:05:12.180> stop<00:05:12.509> these

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
whatever and that's it now stop these

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.680 
whatever and that's it now stop these
two<00:05:12.900> from<00:05:13.490> from<00:05:14.490> mixing<00:05:14.909> and<00:05:15.030> matching<00:05:15.180> we<00:05:15.479> put

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
two from from mixing and matching we put

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.240 
two from from mixing and matching we put
a<00:05:15.719> block<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.199> air<00:05:16.319> so<00:05:16.500> it's<00:05:16.620> like<00:05:16.770> honeycombing

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
a block of air so it's like honeycombing

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.830 
a block of air so it's like honeycombing
it<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:18.469> let's<00:05:19.469> put<00:05:20.069> this<00:05:20.340> up<00:05:21.030> one<00:05:21.479> actually

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
it and let's put this up one actually

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.369 
it and let's put this up one actually
let's<00:05:22.650> put<00:05:22.830> our<00:05:23.069> outputs<00:05:23.460> on<00:05:23.580> here<00:05:23.909> just<00:05:24.690> to<00:05:24.930> to

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
let's put our outputs on here just to to

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:30.860 
let's put our outputs on here just to to
show<00:05:25.560> that<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.830> works<00:05:27.710> upwards<00:05:29.030> and<00:05:30.030> that's<00:05:30.690> it

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
show that it works upwards and that's it

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.080 
show that it works upwards and that's it
so<00:05:31.199> let's<00:05:31.229> put<00:05:31.529> some<00:05:31.680> some<00:05:32.400> levers<00:05:32.729> on<00:05:32.880> there

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
so let's put some some levers on there

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.860 
so let's put some some levers on there
and<00:05:33.409> take<00:05:34.409> a<00:05:34.440> look<00:05:34.680> so<00:05:35.039> this<00:05:35.069> is<00:05:35.569> input<00:05:36.569> number

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
and take a look so this is input number

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.230 
and take a look so this is input number
one<00:05:37.340> that<00:05:38.340> works<00:05:38.550> just<00:05:38.639> fine<00:05:38.969> doesn't

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
one that works just fine doesn't

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.360 
one that works just fine doesn't
activate<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.719> other<00:05:39.810> piston<00:05:40.229> and<00:05:40.500> if<00:05:41.099> for<00:05:41.250> two

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
activate the other piston and if for two
