 Hi, people, I received the capes today. 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.930
 that I bought on the boxed site and 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.720
 instead without charging the 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.260
 Thank God, then I'm going to open, do not you see? 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.710
 in fact, people like that I bought - 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.370
 now it's your turn right because the first 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.960
 Once I bought it I bought a lot of 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:48.519
 programs 10 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:52.179
 This is a plane from china that is really 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.219
 I bought some people for my iphone 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.280
 6 plus 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:02.670
 Look here and play with it. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:06.420
 see your lawyer 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:13.810
 There's always something cat 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 Look at people who look beautiful, look at aline. 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:26.380
 I also bought a fondle on my ipad 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.500
 my hair is nothing to ruin my life 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.500
 I bought in the grass my ipad 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.800
 Hmm 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.430
 beautiful people do not work a kitten 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.430
 also 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.180
 Look, beautiful people have been trapped since 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:12.470
 cute village kitten 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:15.260
 look at the details there that love our mei is 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.420
 this one is my mother do with this 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.090
 a clear theory that is neither legal nor 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.090
 Did you know we'll take it on c? 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.420
 iss is more malleable 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.910
 this line also said that it was because 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:48.160
 This one was beautiful, too. 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:59.269
 I found it beautiful and a movie that brand 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:10.310
 beautiful people come along and the one I adore 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:17.000
 also countered I have a pro west 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.859
 so look how beautiful so that was what 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.870
 I wanted it but it 's for you. 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:30.980
 thank god it was not charged 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:33.819
 show you here never charge 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.819
 China 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.300
 I bought - with 3 to 4 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.420
 there the way now I already know we go 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:51.170
 always tell a little bit for not having 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:53.540
 problem of picking up and charging 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.180
 rate is because if it was a normal rate 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.640
 Needs people but it's absurd right? 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.760
 for the first time I paid 65 reais only 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.760
 of rates I'm not mistaken was this 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.110
 so there is an absurd hotel to 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.430
 you 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:20.600
 she's with the captain for 20 year olds're 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:25.570
 this extra fat that bad relationship 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.570
 nicotine that we look at there beautiful people 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:50.180
 arriving to put them looks that beautiful 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:59.240
 This dude, we look like pretty sock. 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:05:03.669
 Our too slow to take is always 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.669
 good because they're so tight right 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.760
 I thought I loved it 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.289
 Oh, look how handsome it is, what a beautiful kitten. 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.460
 oh how difficult it is to draw is that it has 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.330
 fear even that brian wells 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:36.020
 I do not think I want to not only take people away 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:38.830
 slowly and finally the most beautiful 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.830
 I loved 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:54.490
 Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:58.520
 ayaaz here because it's what I liked the most 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.990
 of the betinho the very beautiful pebbles 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.720
 very delicate 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.250
 so many people think it was right to give 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.669
 You see the same things that I 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.700
 I bought this time and it was not taxed. 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.260
 no they did not catch me 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.820
 I bought a little because then it comes 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.230
 in a box the box as well 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.840
 tiny 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.400
 I think so, right when we go 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.419
 shopping 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.640
 so on the international china sites 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.410
 even we always buy a little 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.840
 the number of people who will see in 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:34.910
 small boxes or also in a 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.600
 they do not charge a fee that usually 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.890
 choose any doubt anything 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:46.640
 You ask me to come back. 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:48.400
 answering for you is and until the 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.400
