00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
to talk a little bit about what I was

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.480 
to talk a little bit about what I was
thinking<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.620> some<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.009> improvised

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
thinking for some of the improvised

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.840 
thinking for some of the improvised
fills<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.480> saw<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.529> video<00:00:16.850> so

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
fills that you saw in that video so

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.950 
fills that you saw in that video so
again<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> was<00:00:18.359> starting<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.310> then<00:00:21.240> I'll<00:00:21.420> go

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
again I was starting and then I'll go

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.689 
again I was starting and then I'll go
right<00:00:22.170> into<00:00:22.350> one<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:22.830> fills<00:00:23.220> these

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
right into one of these fills these

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.700 
right into one of these fills these
fills<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.539> based<00:00:24.810> off<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> our<00:00:25.410> Peggy

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
fills are all based off of our Peggy

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.470 
fills are all based off of our Peggy
Oates<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.189> Gloria<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> chord<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.090> moment

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
Oates of Gloria the chord of the moment

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.970 
Oates of Gloria the chord of the moment
is<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> few<00:00:28.320> things<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
is and that and a few things get a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.669 
is and that and a few things get a
little<00:00:29.220> more<00:00:29.340> complicated<00:00:29.760> later<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.510> some

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
little more complicated later with some

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.229 
little more complicated later with some
superimpositions<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> most<00:00:33.120> part

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
superimpositions but for the most part

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.479 
superimpositions but for the most part
for<00:00:34.020> an<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.230> minor<00:00:34.500> 7<00:00:34.920> chord<00:00:34.950> I'm<00:00:35.190> thinking

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
for an a minor 7 chord I'm thinking

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.970 
for an a minor 7 chord I'm thinking
about<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.059> minor<00:00:36.690> chord<00:00:37.050> tones<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.770> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
about a minor chord tones you know so

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.490 
about a minor chord tones you know so
its<00:00:38.520> most<00:00:38.760> basic<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.660> minor<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.320> know

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
its most basic you have a minor you know

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
its most basic you have a minor you know
a<00:00:40.820> CD<00:00:46.160> but<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.579> add<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.420> 7th<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
a CD but we can also add in the 7th to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.639 
a CD but we can also add in the 7th to
that<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.440> AC<00:00:49.680> e<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.250> g<00:00:50.309> AC<00:00:50.940> e<00:00:51.780> g<00:00:52.500> AC<00:00:52.860> e<00:00:53.430> g<00:00:54.120> AC

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
that see if AC e and g AC e g AC e g AC

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.270 
that see if AC e and g AC e g AC e g AC
v<00:00:56.000> g<00:00:57.109> and<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> other<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.500> I'll<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.010> I'll

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
v g and the other thing I'll do is I'll

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
v g and the other thing I'll do is I'll
also<00:00:59.520> throw<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.969> some<00:01:00.329> chromatic<00:01:00.690> passing

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
also throw in some chromatic passing

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.990 
also throw in some chromatic passing
tones<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:02.010> from<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> those<00:01:02.730> chord

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
tones to get from one of those chord

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
tones to get from one of those chord
tones<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> other<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> times<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
tones to the other a lot of times I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.170 
tones to the other a lot of times I
might<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> arpeggio<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> way<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:08.180> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
might use the arpeggio on the way up and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.810 
might use the arpeggio on the way up and
then<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.170> back<00:01:10.200> down<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.950> chromatic

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
then on the way back down some chromatic

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.219 
then on the way back down some chromatic
so<00:01:12.780> that's<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:14.070> side<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.369> time

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.390 

approaching<00:01:19.229> notes<00:01:19.439> from<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> half-step

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
approaching notes from just a half-step

Allah all the way up here so it's a
pretty<00:02:46.340> simple<00:02:46.790> approach<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.480> doing

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
pretty simple approach to doing

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.910 
pretty simple approach to doing
something<00:02:48.050> like<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.380> mean<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.680> can<00:02:48.709> get

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
something like that I mean you can get

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.680 
something like that I mean you can get
as<00:02:49.040> complicated<00:02:49.370> as<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.790> want<00:02:50.030> there's<00:02:50.630> a

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
as complicated as you want there's a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.420 
as complicated as you want there's a
million<00:02:51.110> of<00:02:51.230> these<00:02:51.320> arpeggios<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.280> can

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
million of these arpeggios that you can

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.810 
million of these arpeggios that you can
learn<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.910> have<00:02:53.030> them<00:02:53.180> connect<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:55.550> start

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
learn and have them connect but to start

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.070 
learn and have them connect but to start
out<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:56.390> get<00:02:56.510> some<00:02:56.720> really<00:02:56.870> effective

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
out you can get some really effective

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.870 
out you can get some really effective
sounds<00:02:57.800> which<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.040> some<00:02:58.220> very<00:02:58.459> basic

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
sounds which is some very basic

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.670 
sounds which is some very basic
understanding<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.720> a<00:03:00.080> couple<00:03:00.410> different

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
understanding of a couple different

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.880 
understanding of a couple different
places<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.160> grab<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.550> courts<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.709> did<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.739> video

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
places to grab the courts I did a video

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.310 
places to grab the courts I did a video
in<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.250> past<00:03:04.280> about<00:03:04.820> wanting<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.780> know<00:03:05.989> chord

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
in the past about wanting to know chord

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.050 
in the past about wanting to know chord
with<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.560> root<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.519> sixth<00:03:07.820> string

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
with the root on the the sixth string

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.660 
with the root on the the sixth string
with<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.780> root<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.080> fifth<00:03:09.350> string<00:03:09.640> with<00:03:10.640> a

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
with the root on the fifth string with a

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.430 
with the root on the fifth string with a
root<00:03:10.910> on<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.150> 4th<00:03:11.600> string<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:12.080> thought<00:03:12.260> that

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
root on the 4th string I thought that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.550 
root on the 4th string I thought that
was<00:03:12.620> really

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
was really

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.920 
was really
and<00:03:14.520> also<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.330> know<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.480> learn<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
and also you know to learn the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.600 
and also you know to learn the
inversions<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.590> those<00:03:16.740> courts<00:03:17.069> by<00:03:17.220> taking<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
inversions of those courts by taking the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.070 
inversions of those courts by taking the
notes<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.150> know<00:03:18.240> flip-flopping<00:03:18.900> them

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
notes and you know flip-flopping them

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.470 
notes and you know flip-flopping them
and<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.680> won't<00:03:20.370> go<00:03:20.490> into<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.700> here<00:03:20.850> because

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
and I won't go into that here because

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.420 
and I won't go into that here because
this<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.840> just<00:03:21.959> about<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.410> improvisation<00:03:23.130> but

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
this is just about the improvisation but

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.190 
this is just about the improvisation but
once<00:03:24.000> you've<00:03:24.150> learned<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.660> once<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.050> have

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
once you've learned that once you have

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.530 
once you've learned that once you have
that<00:03:25.230> under<00:03:25.590> your<00:03:25.650> belt<00:03:25.740> you've<00:03:26.130> got<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
that under your belt you've got just the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.780 
that under your belt you've got just the
fret<00:03:27.990> board<00:03:28.020> is<00:03:28.350> lights<00:03:28.620> up<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.310> anytime<00:03:29.520> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
fret board is lights up so anytime the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.120 
fret board is lights up so anytime the
chord<00:03:30.030> changes<00:03:30.270> if<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.690> see<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.230> minor<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:32.040> a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
chord changes if I see a minor in a

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.650 
chord changes if I see a minor in a
chart<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.610> know<00:03:32.670> I've<00:03:32.910> got<00:03:33.090> all<00:03:33.300> these

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.570 
chart I know I've got all these
different<00:03:34.140> notes<00:03:34.350> available<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.550> me<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:38.459> are

just all over the neck of the guitar so
I'll<00:03:46.709> go<00:03:46.830> through<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.310> section<00:03:47.760> again<00:03:48.090> and

as<00:04:40.940> far<00:04:40.970> as<00:04:41.210> getting<00:04:41.840> into<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:43.160> beginning<00:04:43.550> of

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
as far as getting into the beginning of

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.409 
as far as getting into the beginning of
court<00:04:43.970> tone<00:04:44.180> solo<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.740> your<00:04:46.699> next<00:04:46.940> step<00:04:47.060> would

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
court tone solo so your next step would

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.930 
court tone solo so your next step would
probably<00:04:47.810> want<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.020> be<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.669> start<00:04:49.819> to

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
probably want to be to to just start to

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.520 
probably want to be to to just start to
map<00:04:50.120> out<00:04:50.360> those<00:04:50.509> arpeggios<00:04:51.050> for<00:04:51.229> yourself

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
map out those arpeggios for yourself

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.279 
map out those arpeggios for yourself
look<00:04:52.069> at<00:04:52.250> major<00:04:52.520> 7<00:04:53.150> s<00:04:53.240> look<00:04:53.389> at<00:04:53.479> minor<00:04:53.690> 7<00:04:54.080> s<00:04:54.169> look

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
look at major 7 s look at minor 7 s look

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.710 
look at major 7 s look at minor 7 s look
at<00:04:54.380> dominant<00:04:54.860> chords<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.370> look<00:04:56.060> at<00:04:56.240> half

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
at dominant chords and look at half

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.589 
at dominant chords and look at half
diminished<00:04:57.139> chords<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.740> then<00:04:58.599> especially

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
diminished chords and then especially

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.240 
diminished chords and then especially
with<00:04:59.960> dominance<00:05:00.410> look<00:05:00.680> at<00:05:00.800> all<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.099> different

dominant chord is is root third fifth

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.719 
dominant chord is is root third fifth
and<00:05:05.930> flat<00:05:06.229> seventh<00:05:06.770> but<00:05:07.039> you<00:05:07.280> know<00:05:07.370> all<00:05:07.550> those

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.760 
have so many options as to you know
creating<00:05:16.490> tension<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.570> there's<00:05:18.530> little

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
creating tension and there's little

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.469 
creating tension and there's little
shapes<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.400> these<00:05:19.669> things<00:05:19.849> kind<00:05:20.150> of<00:05:20.270> take

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
shapes that these things kind of take

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.600 
shapes that these things kind of take
there's<00:05:20.780> one<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:21.110> like<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.889> just<00:05:22.430> probably

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
there's one that I like I just probably

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.310 
there's one that I like I just probably
used<00:05:22.880> way<00:05:23.000> too<00:05:23.030> much<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.630> be<00:05:23.660> honest<00:05:23.990> with<00:05:24.139> you

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
used way too much to be honest with you

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.170 
used way too much to be honest with you
but<00:05:24.949> I'm<00:05:25.039> definitely<00:05:25.400> based<00:05:25.789> on<00:05:25.910> some<00:05:26.090> of

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
but I'm definitely based on some of

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:37.570 
but I'm definitely based on some of
those<00:05:26.270> b7<00:05:26.990> alter<00:05:27.500> tones<00:05:27.770> off<00:05:28.039> of<00:05:28.190> there<00:05:32.590> so<00:05:36.580> you

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
those b7 alter tones off of there so you

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.890 
those b7 alter tones off of there so you
know<00:05:37.669> you'll<00:05:37.819> fall<00:05:38.030> into<00:05:38.240> you'll<00:05:38.509> will<00:05:38.780> have

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
know you'll fall into you'll will have

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.360 
know you'll fall into you'll will have
your<00:05:39.020> pet<00:05:39.199> likes<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.650> things<00:05:39.800> like<00:05:39.979> that<00:05:40.039> to
