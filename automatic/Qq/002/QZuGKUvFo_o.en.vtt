under soft or some now you can see the
chana<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> coming<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.210> leaf<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.549> now

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
chana is coming out of the leaf and now

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.170 
chana is coming out of the leaf and now

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.550 

and<00:01:10.960> keep<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.800> in<00:01:11.920> principle<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.320> we<00:01:14.440> have

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
and keep it in principle so we have

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.910 
and keep it in principle so we have
taken<00:01:14.860> a<00:01:14.980> a<00:01:15.160> pimp<00:01:15.700> load<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.270> now<00:01:16.660> your<00:01:16.960> pointer

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
taken a a pimp load and now your pointer

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.070

finger<00:01:20.820> slowly<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.530> water<00:01:23.740> will<00:01:24.870> go<00:01:25.870> down

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
finger slowly and the water will go down

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.950 
finger slowly and the water will go down
and<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:27.430> channel<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:27.970> this<00:01:28.540> behind

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.370
