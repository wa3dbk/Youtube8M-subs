00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:05.690
 My name is to Mac and in turn I show you how he does not 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.600
 already existing 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.900
 ISG or 1 DEK or just one partition in retrospect with Fight 4 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.589
 2 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.240
 can and do encrypt 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.929
 though these too 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.080
 around the Skoda on the 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.470
 the 11 are already data on it 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.599
 first of all, I normally have my hard disk utility up i've got 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.669
 not only prepared and although I have an 8 gigabyte stick here like you 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.090
 I've created with small partition with 512 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.870
 Weger far and there from one 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.680
 greater tradition the two years 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.660
 that has done something to the round that goes faster 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.660
 yes, unfortunately, here in the Grundig 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.410
 no program to the possibility or at least I know this now 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.020
 Not 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.750
 how that should work percent that I also have an existing partitions 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.600
 or a moving stick 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.820
 in hindsight can encrypt 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.280
 yes now, of course, looking for maybe would first make one I do 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.380
 but this time 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.750
 1 on this 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.030
 do me the same 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.210
 new window 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.820
 Prokop me something on the stick so that you also in hindsight 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.940
 seen 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.040
 so 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.870
 I have that you are also copied 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.860
 so that in hindsight you can see after them that it's still on it 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.000
 what she has to do first 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.020
 is 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.120
 So he should definitely open the hard disk utility 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.050
 It's the easiest and we should find out about Max for one 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.050
 Jung wants to mean like or media a deep Olpe partition or yours 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.920
 Device has 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.230
 what you 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.840
 Encrypt Percent reports 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.479
 I want to make that at partition 1 is finally on the partition indentation 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.170
 he on the forum 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.220
 that's exactly what media critic Zion means in German 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.409
 and exactly this value 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.240
 Do we need to write down this is really important or Merck is yes 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.810
 whatever we do 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.860
 when I go to the device myself 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.839
 if only there was none 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.569
 if then only one partition would be 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.409
 then i want exactly this one this partition i want 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.340
 now closures i would like in the case 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.660
 not the two yes 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.910
 Here is another identification here 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.120
 many roads lead to Rome of course 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.150
 Is there any other option 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.319
 the whole thing around 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.869
 ech display 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:32.739
 but 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.769
 Per cent in my opinion, the disk utility is really on 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.680
 The simplest and safest you do not need to make it in the mud 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.719
 around 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.529
 And I do not want you now either 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:42.299
 confuse 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.969
 only if neither Labor nor thoughts come 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.229
 Of course there are other ways to find out 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.019
 so 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.229
 how do I do that now I want as I said both partitions 1 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.939
 like to encode retrospectively, but both came up to give one 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:57.519
 1 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.619
 Events 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.999
 and gives the command 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.619
 EWE Tel 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:04.610
 for the past 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.320
 angry CS for Costa Rica could also advertise it if you want 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.389
 I can do it now and then I want to 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.079
 make conwert 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.879
 and now I need 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.809
 while Meyer weighted Zion 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:19.869
 that was 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:20.659
 Teske 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.150
 1 second, it checks partition 1 again 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.999
 info 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.739
 is 1 s 2 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.929
 correctly 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.469
 and then I want the whole thing 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.369
 encode 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.049
 Benny behind it is entering the password 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.879
 I'm not going to do that now 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.909
 van Dinther asks it again 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.149
 if easy 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:46.229
 Engter expresses then he will now password the best attention that is not the 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.939
 Word under the more you in retrospect 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.019
 to open 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.459
 when he said that Leon Woldt is the encrypted volley and Edward 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.459
 as Erkrath the password for the encrypted want as well 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.699
 once a password enter the whole once confirmed 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.339
 and then he starts 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:07.339
 that costs the right course German anyway 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.819
 to encrypt 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.979
 but now a very small moment 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.650
 better the animal has through 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.870
 As I said that is the possibility in retrospect plates with data 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.800
 Sugar can also be used to encrypt sugar, for example 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.210
 Percentage of machines 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.190
 hard disk 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.479
 Penalty since percent I do not know how much 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.009
 say if Modern Art and maybe already 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.009
 As Snow Leopard times could be the hindsight 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.050
 So the data remains encrypted and encrypted 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.970
 the whole 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.460
 would be a case 4 2 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.279
 encrypted 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.979
 so he said it's done i can handle that with the command 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.039
 here that Kia Co 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.039
 Kossdorff you see so you can also write it out 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.219
 Leave ads 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.760
 to show you 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.059
 the 4 um 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.669
 the partition is also encrypted 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.639
 so it relates banks are not holding Mainz partition Mainz like that 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.960
 but then are 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.289
 if I look great here now with Kommern 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.389
 Plopp prime-1 viewing window 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.560
 her Mac OS 10 Extended already old 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.339
 encoded 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.339
 under the tradition 2 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.439
 which is not encrypted as we only have possible now 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:34.869
 a the partition 1 of the stick he encrypted and the data on it 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:35.969
 are 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.969
 Of course, there were still some problems involved 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.069
 see here 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:42.550
 you can in hindsight 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.569
 Percent, so to speak, still partitions or 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.810
 for data 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.919
 Encrypt usb-sticks 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.419
 without losing the data if, for example, your hard disk 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.419
 Macintosh AG divided several partitions 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.550
 this boat volley around the maXXim Porsche AG in itself 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.089
 encrypted via the system settings 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:09.209
 could have the other partitions on this path in retrospect 

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:11.569
 locked 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.659
 that's it already 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.919
 I say thank you for watching and see you next time
