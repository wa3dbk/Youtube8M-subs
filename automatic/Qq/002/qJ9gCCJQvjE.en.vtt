 england in wembley already led a 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.970
 German 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.310
 and it is also that he directed ejects fast 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.710
 progress because there were no cards and 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.990
 irrati happens as good argentinian is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.960
 starts making crazy as they saw 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.690
 a short right and I looked at him and said 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 do not worry and they spent five minutes 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.730
 spend eight minutes pass ten minutes and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.560
 ramiro onions this is an institute 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.840

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.250
 soccer referee professional soccer 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.680
 among other races every referee who 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 today militates in professional soccer 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.760
 Chilean graduation from the National Institute of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.619
 how it is created or how a referee is formed 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.030
 professional soccer first two years 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.979
 of study in a professional career 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.710
 where graduate professional umpire 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.290
 football after that they go to the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.930
 ampp as an extension of his practice 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.540
 professional to go alternating and go 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.030
 learning what it means to arbitrate 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.860
 this is you if you see a hand 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.270
 if you like the options if you do not 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.070
 it seems they have to make a technical gesture 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.190
 that no one doubts that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.000
 you saw it but evaluated and considered that 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.000
 was not 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.580
 and it is another topic to consider but 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.450
 if you hand the ball to the valve 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.180
 you are the one who saw and if you do not see them 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.149
 whom I have to ask for help from 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.649
 assistant this is an activity 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.560
 disciplined and very hierarchical so 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.289
 other the referee also has as a rule 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.719
 get to your place where you will exercise the 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.060
 activity of being formal we should not 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.729
 never lose sight of us 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.280
 we carry a sign in which we have 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.660
 an investiture of judges like 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.040
 a judge of the republic you never 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.930
 has seen on the stand with Uruguay to 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.030
 right today a referee is 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.730
 evaluate in three big concepts first 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.799
 and most importantly the court also in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.810
 the theoretical part and finally in the 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.610
 physical part these are the moments 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.890
 where they show you why 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.110
 they were appointed for this match 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.630
 they are higher instances where perhaps 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.860
 everyone wants to be but unfortunately 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.060
 one has to decide on four 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.709
 people and those four people are 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.480
 logical to become a great 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.340
 referee is very important of the court 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.080
 football also helps you have a 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.650
 better reading of games helps you too 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.810
 to have more contact and greater empathy 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.310
 with the players because this was you already 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.330
 the best you behave as a habit 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.840
 How did you like this attitude? 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.000
 behave the referee apart 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.800
 of having external pressure has the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.280
 internal pressure because it is let's say 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.569
 always battling against a decision the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.569
 heart the line 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.709
 she 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.170
 of first edition today has 12 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.610
 cameras in a world cup had 46 cameras 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.130
 then the usual decisions 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.040
 they are too vulnerable and that 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.720
 makes activity very sensitive to 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.970
 personal one where you go people you 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.650
 recognize people tell you 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.630
 hear you are a referee if you were 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.210
 exit if I'm consell then and the 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.700
 people begin to locate therefore the fact 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.150
 that people are already doing 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.840
 pressure on their behaviors in your 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.580
 way of proceeding in which it stops 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.200
 I manifest that your behavior and your 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.600
 behavior has to be faultless 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.690
 so that for the eyes that watch you 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.990
 we have 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.990
 Y
