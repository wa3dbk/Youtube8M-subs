00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.260 

I'm<00:00:16.930> gonna<00:00:17.110> put<00:00:17.380> it<00:00:17.500> in<00:00:17.620> six<00:00:18.010> so<00:00:18.730> you<00:00:18.820> can<00:00:19.000> hear

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270

there's<00:00:44.960> like<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.140> little<00:00:45.350> whoop<00:00:45.710> above<00:00:46.070> over

there's like a little whoop above over
but<00:00:46.970> it's<00:00:47.120> very<00:00:47.239> faint

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.700 

and<00:00:52.490> I'm<00:00:53.390> going<00:00:53.840> you<00:00:54.230> know<00:00:54.380> 20<00:00:54.860> miles<00:00:55.580> an<00:00:55.760> hour

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.490 

that's<00:01:01.280> exhaust

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.780 

exhaust

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
exhaust

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.970 
exhaust
now<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:10.390> hear<00:01:10.720> how<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:10.990> sound<00:01:11.440> is<00:01:11.710> drowning

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
now you hear how the sound is drowning

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:21.980 
now you hear how the sound is drowning
out<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.640> exhaust

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.830 

you<00:01:22.530> hear<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.790> wall

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.870 

that's<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.650> noise<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:31.130> I've<00:01:32.130> balanced<00:01:32.760> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that's the noise and I've balanced the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.510 
that's the noise and I've balanced the
tires<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.020> now<00:01:37.250> or<00:01:38.250> whatever

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
tires so it's not that now or whatever

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.760 
tires so it's not that now or whatever
I'll<00:01:38.850> post<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.780> description<00:01:40.229> below<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I'll post it in the description below so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.249 
I'll post it in the description below so
you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.190> see<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.520> I'm<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:42.240> I've<00:01:42.360> done<00:01:42.540> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
you can see what I'm what I've done so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
you can see what I'm what I've done so
far<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.800> I'm<00:01:44.610> gonna<00:01:44.820> guess<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
far but I'm gonna guess it's the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.320 
far but I'm gonna guess it's the
bearings<00:01:46.580> even<00:01:47.580> though<00:01:47.700> I've<00:01:47.850> already<00:01:47.970> done

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
bearings even though I've already done

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.080 
bearings even though I've already done
the<00:01:48.450> bearing<00:01:48.750> test<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.380> doesn't<00:01:49.909> show<00:01:50.909> up

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the bearing test and it doesn't show up

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.050 
the bearing test and it doesn't show up
as<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> bad<00:01:51.899> bearing<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.670> hear<00:01:53.880> right

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
as a bad bearing you can hear right

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.169 
as a bad bearing you can hear right
there<00:01:55.820> there's<00:01:56.820> no<00:01:57.030> exhaust<00:01:57.509> Li<00:01:57.810> there's<00:01:58.500> no<00:02:00.050> I

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
there there's no exhaust Li there's no I

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.359 
there there's no exhaust Li there's no I
don't<00:02:03.179> know<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:04.649> I'm<00:02:04.890> trying<00:02:05.160> to<00:02:05.220> think

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
don't know that I'm trying to think

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.749 
don't know that I'm trying to think
right<00:02:05.580> now<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.630> driving<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.399> did<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.519> diff

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
right now as I'm driving I did the diff

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880 
right now as I'm driving I did the diff
bushings<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.450> white<00:02:09.630> lines<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.619> helped

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
bushings the white lines so that helped

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.340 
bushings the white lines so that helped
a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.130> bit<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.580> noise<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.569> push<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
a little bit with the noise the push the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.009 
a little bit with the noise the push the
diff<00:02:14.190> also<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:14.790> new<00:02:15.090> AMSOIL<00:02:15.720> fluid<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.350> so

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
diff also has new AMSOIL fluid in it so

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.780 
diff also has new AMSOIL fluid in it so
but<00:02:19.019> yeah<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.500> clearly<00:02:20.100> here<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.640> it's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
but yeah you get clearly here and it's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.030 
but yeah you get clearly here and it's
pretty<00:02:21.390> loud<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.080> pop<00:02:22.290> music<00:02:24.920> might<00:02:25.920> be

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
pretty loud like a pop music might be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.160 
pretty loud like a pop music might be
able<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.280> hear<00:02:26.489> even<00:02:26.790> what<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.239> music

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.190 

but<00:02:32.830> that's<00:02:33.790> without<00:02:34.120> music<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:36.239> alright<00:02:37.239> I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
but that's without music so alright I

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.290 
but that's without music so alright I
think<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:39.160> probably<00:02:39.459> gonna<00:02:39.670> be<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.970> bushing

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
think it's probably gonna be the bushing

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.140 
think it's probably gonna be the bushing
I<00:02:40.480> mean<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.290> bearing<00:02:41.680> I'm<00:02:41.800> sorry<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.819> let's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
I mean the bearing I'm sorry so let's

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.699 
I mean the bearing I'm sorry so let's
see<00:02:43.239> what<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.569> I'm<00:02:43.840> going<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> see<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.260> one

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
see what it is I'm going to see if one

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.380 
see what it is I'm going to see if one
of<00:02:44.739> these<00:02:44.950> weekend's<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.550> can<00:02:45.730> go<00:02:46.060> ahead<00:02:46.150> and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
of these weekend's I can go ahead and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.050 
of these weekend's I can go ahead and
take<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.860> bearing<00:02:47.860> out<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.310> see<00:02:48.489> if<00:02:48.700> that's

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
take the bearing out and see if that's

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.350 
take the bearing out and see if that's
what<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.480> problem<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.989> but<00:02:50.830> yeah<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.970> bearing

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
what the problem is but yeah the bearing

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.740 
what the problem is but yeah the bearing
test<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.830> by<00:02:54.010> removing<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.910> notice<00:02:55.239> how

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
test just by removing you notice how

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.130 
test just by removing you notice how
when<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:55.959> stops<00:02:56.350> completely<00:02:57.220> stops<00:02:57.700> so<00:03:01.140> that's

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
when it stops completely stops so that's

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.540 
when it stops completely stops so that's
the<00:03:02.410> exhaust<00:03:02.860> so

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
the exhaust so

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.740 
the exhaust so
all<00:03:05.090> right<00:03:05.620> hopefully<00:03:06.620> is
