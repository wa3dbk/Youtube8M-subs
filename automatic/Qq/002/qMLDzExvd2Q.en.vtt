00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello hello everyone hello today I want to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.049
 you talk to such a little bit 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.410
 probably a strange topic 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.070
 this is a woman with a knives character given 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 positions 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 dash bitch here for some reason, many put 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.830
 between these notions of shooting range and I rebelled 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.890
 on this subject to think lately 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.869
 time and what I know from this deduced that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.460
 behave like that bitch me 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.240
 it is these people who are forcing 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.099
 who see that I don't always go for 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
 concessions that I have 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.649
 marital opposition and looks up how 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.890
 let's say go my life 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.230
 until they perceive it as if I want 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.090
 make him have the word or something here 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.570
 such people are not even ready 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.700
 take toulouse that's just my life 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.010
 a different position will not back down not because I 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.739
 bad man or his such bitchy 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.230
 identity but just because it's mine 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.670
 wife position which I have developed 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 times over the years i count for my life this 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.650
 true and i don't accept their opinion 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.570
 because she doesn't take me to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.970
 the fact that I'm bad or bad, but just 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.460
 I have my own opinion about me my life 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.159
 position she continues to be mine 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 I think about it like this 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.270
 I come to the conclusion that I am leading to those people 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.250
 yourself very brought up very nice very 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.009
 beautiful never try know here 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.560
 this smooth corners do not do 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.600
 never for evil things if that special 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.759
 I try to do it the other way 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.490
 arrange but still they already have 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.810
 I know that you are so strong enough 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.030
 self-confident character is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 certain life oppositionist there she is 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 the same bitch she's always in her own 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.659
 get here I can not understand why 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 there are always parallels and as soon as 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.280
 this man draws parallel wounds 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.170
 guys as soon as he spends them you 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 you notice them and sooner or later you have 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.299
 a thought arises about the head 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.210
 accusative ageeva yes i need this here 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.040
 anti-aliasing is all so good 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.079
 to try so that the man you 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.450
 I understand and maybe you really know why 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.649
 when you can already be and why 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 strain yourself 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.329
 you somehow nice ibex when you can 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.280
 just give up on people who 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.730
 decided in advance that you are so behave 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.500
 respectively is why why you need 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.200
 try to do something when people are all 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.000
 anyway you just came a little bit like that 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.799
 you know not the mood of someone a little 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.769
 angry upset something said so 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.040
 not a year, but we knew that you knew and 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.629
 studied the essence then came out and here 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.010
 I began to think about this topic 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.829
 whether to strain 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.750
 Yes, and try to prove to people that I 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.549
 it seems as if you are not bitchy to us 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.329
 from the bottom of my heart just because I'm there 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.700
 with all my heart 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.829
 This does not mean that I should now all 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.250
 their life positions all that me in 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.959
 living on all your basics just 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.519
 destroy to make you better than me 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.049
 have my be able to be positive again 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.989
 position me your views on the world 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.790
 but at the same time I try to harm him to me 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.069
 how would you not be forced to do what 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.659
 i like just let me live like this 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.480
 how I want but people often do it 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.540
 perceive exactly the other way I noticed 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.159
 for the last time like this 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.440
 say the inclination is probably just that 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.060
 such people were given to hand over the gentlemen 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.769
 Well if you think I'm a bitch, I 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.720
 I will crawl vomit why am I going to 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.359
 strain 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.269
 be good and that's what all this is about 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.250
 such demagogy which was before 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.349
 just a call for people to look around 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.530
 yourself note that not all 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.970
 women who have strong character and 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.159
 office position some kind of your personal 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.129
 look nonterov numbers they just 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.959
 women with strong temper pay 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.209
 attention to what they are trying 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.060
 smooth corners and that they are very cute and 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.129
 nice and simple they have strong 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.280
 nature and your view of the world and on 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.329
 situation does not mean that they 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.019
 bitchy it means they just 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.479
 personalities and that's fine therefore not 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.639
 need a priori thinks they are 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.790
 here's a wall to them absolutely yes anyway 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.519
 They want to achieve there at any cost 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.440
 its all put there and so on 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.310
 lest you think and include 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.479
 currently in the concept yes this bitch why 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.090
 note that not all 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:20.700
 women want bitchiness 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.590
 you whom you yourself raised to this rank 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.750
 they are absolutely not 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.810
 they are ordinary dreams for women 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.880
 strong character do not bring your 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.340

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.470

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.030
 will tell you if you think this is why 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.830

 you advance you will not see here such 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.120
 strange for a long time and although it is to express 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.660
 so strange . my vision is ripe 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.669

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.610
 very arrogant and that's all that 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.889
 many sticking know that many include 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.770
 this concept make us do it 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.940
 it is our people who surround us not 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.150
 sure relatives yes there on 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.490
 work in the store wherever it is 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.200
 It was the people who pre- hung 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.139
 labels for everyone and believe that this is 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.000

 from this ice and get something bad 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.000

 waiting because knowing who is waiting for him 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.539
