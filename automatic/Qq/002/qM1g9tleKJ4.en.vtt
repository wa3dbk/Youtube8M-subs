00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:13.520
First spot was covered in the Beginner's Guide, it's near the start, and is mostly for low level farming.

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:32.794
Make sure no one is left behind :)

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.960
Aggro these two and head back into the building.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.880
Now just kill them off.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.880
And head back for the lamp.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.280
Second spot is for levels 20+, but it's fairly easy.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.640
Make your way to the second shortcut (the gate).

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.860
I also suggest killing all these babushkas, as they are slow and pose little threat even for low levels.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.200
This dude is fast, but can also be killed with 2 combos.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.840
Kill all these too, they will add up to the run.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.820
Now you must unlock this gate first, by naturally progressing through the area first.

00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:50.854
Head for the building to the right.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.240
And now aggro one big dude at a time.

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:34.894
They swing pretty far, don't risk too much.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.800
Pick your style and kill him off.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.720
You can do the same trick here, or fight him off.

00:04:27.023 --> 00:04:29.743
Saw Cleaver &lt;3

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.720
That way lies the "Lake" Rune, tbh.

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:41.615
Head back for the lamp.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.260
If you killed everyone up to now, you should have around 15.000 blood echoes or so.

00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:17.135
Rince and repeat, or die near the lamp.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.140
This spot is perfect for farming regular and twin Shards.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.620
You can watch "Cutscenes &amp; Bosses 08" on how to get here.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.160
Aggro one dude at a time or risk with both.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.900
They will stuck here, making each kill very easy.

00:05:56.867 --> 00:06:02.707
Don't get careless, and if you die, lamp is close.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.480
Now the second one.

00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:18.135
Everything is better with your own Saw Cleaver &lt;3

00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:24.295
Thank you for watching!
