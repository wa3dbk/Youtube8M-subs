hands<00:01:21.500> with<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> wet<00:01:23.250> cloth<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.950> she<00:01:25.950> usually

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
hands with a wet cloth and she usually

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.810 
hands with a wet cloth and she usually
just<00:01:26.460> lets<00:01:26.880> me<00:01:27.180> why<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.840> him<00:01:28.400> here<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> had<00:01:29.670> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
just lets me why for him here I had to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120 
just lets me why for him here I had to
repeat<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:31.020> two<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.320> three<00:01:31.380> times<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
repeat it like two or three times and I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
repeat it like two or three times and I
think<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> was<00:01:32.579> mostly<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.390> camera

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
think it was mostly because the camera

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.010 
think it was mostly because the camera
was<00:01:33.990> there<00:01:34.250> looking<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.400> her<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.840> when

was there looking at her and then when

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.460 
was there looking at her and then when
she<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.520> clean<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.329> gift<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.810> her<00:01:40.020> bowl<00:01:40.259> of

that<00:01:55.060> eating<00:01:56.060> mode<00:01:57.010> one<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.280> biggest

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
that eating mode one of the biggest

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.700 
that eating mode one of the biggest
challenges<00:01:59.120> has<00:01:59.360> been<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.840> get<00:02:00.020> her<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.229> remain

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
challenges has been to get her to remain

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.190 
challenges has been to get her to remain
seated<00:02:01.160> while<00:02:01.610> eating<00:02:01.970> because<00:02:02.780> she<00:02:03.020> has<00:02:03.170> a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
seated while eating because she has a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.740 
seated while eating because she has a
freedom<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.770> get<00:02:03.920> up<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.760> I've<00:02:05.119> just<00:02:05.150> made<00:02:05.510> that

freedom to get up so I've just made that

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.139 
freedom to get up so I've just made that
a<00:02:05.810> firm<00:02:06.170> boundary<00:02:06.680> she<00:02:06.950> cannot<00:02:07.400> eat<00:02:07.820> unless

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
to it and i'll remind her that she needs

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.830 
to it and i'll remind her that she needs
to<00:02:16.010> be<00:02:16.190> sitting<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.670> eat<00:02:16.760> usually<00:02:17.690> though

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
to be sitting to eat usually though

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.570 
to be sitting to eat usually though
works<00:02:18.080> really<00:02:18.290> well<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.830> she<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.280> sits<00:02:19.430> back

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
works really well and she just sits back

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.760 
works really well and she just sits back
and<00:02:19.760> continuous<00:02:20.450> eating<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.320> I've<00:02:21.440> really

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
and continuous eating but I've really

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.370 
and continuous eating but I've really
found<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.190> she<00:02:23.090> won't<00:02:23.390> really<00:02:23.750> get<00:02:24.020> up<00:02:24.200> if

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
found that she won't really get up if

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.590 
found that she won't really get up if
she's<00:02:24.620> really<00:02:24.830> hungry<00:02:25.160> usually<00:02:26.120> she<00:02:26.270> starts

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
she's really hungry usually she starts

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.390 
she's really hungry usually she starts
getting<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.380> getting<00:02:27.500> more<00:02:27.739> playful<00:02:28.040> when

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
getting up and getting more playful when

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.020 
getting up and getting more playful when
she's<00:02:28.810> not<00:02:29.810> hungry<00:02:30.410> anymore<00:02:30.860> or<00:02:31.250> done<00:02:31.550> eating

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
she's not hungry anymore or done eating

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.170 
she's not hungry anymore or done eating
so<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:32.630> might<00:02:33.080> tell<00:02:33.380> her<00:02:33.620> once<00:02:34.250> or<00:02:34.430> twice<00:02:34.640> that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
so I might tell her once or twice that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.790 
so I might tell her once or twice that
she<00:02:35.390> can't<00:02:35.600> eat<00:02:35.810> unless<00:02:35.989> she's<00:02:36.320> sitting<00:02:36.650> and
