so<00:00:57.230> after<00:00:58.230> looking<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> secondary<00:00:59.129> air

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so after looking at the secondary air

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.970 
so after looking at the secondary air
pump<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.670> could<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.329> were<00:01:00.390> cracks

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
pump I could see that there were cracks

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
pump I could see that there were cracks
well<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.460> open<00:01:02.670> space<00:01:03.149> where<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
well there was open space where the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.370 
well there was open space where the
rivets<00:01:04.830> go<00:01:05.040> these<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.210> rivets<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
rivets go these are not the rivets the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.280 
rivets go these are not the rivets the
rivets<00:01:08.070> were<00:01:08.540> busted<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> could<00:01:09.869> clearly<00:01:10.170> see

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
rivets were busted you could clearly see

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.750 
rivets were busted you could clearly see
that<00:01:10.500> because<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that because there was a little bit of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.350 
that because there was a little bit of
opening<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:14.460> ends<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> rivets

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
opening here and the ends of the rivets

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.980 
opening here and the ends of the rivets
were<00:01:15.540> afraid<00:01:16.049> didn't<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> normal<00:01:17.430> lips

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
were afraid didn't have the normal lips

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.710 
were afraid didn't have the normal lips
so<00:01:19.100> upon<00:01:20.100> looking<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.520> another<00:01:20.909> YouTube<00:01:21.390> video

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
so upon looking at another YouTube video

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.890 
so upon looking at another YouTube video
I<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.350> seen<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.689> drill<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I have seen that you can drill the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.219 
I have seen that you can drill the
rivets<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.150> put<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.960> some

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
rivets out and then I put in some

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
rivets out and then I put in some
replacement<00:01:29.070> bolts<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:29.909> these<00:01:30.090> bolts<00:01:30.509> were

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
replacement bolts now these bolts were

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.929 
replacement bolts now these bolts were
again<00:01:31.290> from<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.710> suggestion<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.280> another<00:01:32.520> video

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
again from a suggestion of another video

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.620 
again from a suggestion of another video
they<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.479> m4<00:01:34.049> bolts<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.740> four<00:01:35.100> by<00:01:35.280> 0.7<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.450> was

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
they are m4 bolts and four by 0.7 it was

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.980 
they are m4 bolts and four by 0.7 it was
suggested<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.229> use<00:01:37.610> nylon<00:01:38.610> insert<00:01:39.240> nuts<00:01:39.570> which

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
suggested to use nylon insert nuts which

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.499 
suggested to use nylon insert nuts which
I<00:01:40.110> didn't<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.130> used<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.640> washer

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
I didn't have so I just used a washer

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.190 
I didn't have so I just used a washer
and<00:01:42.720> bolt<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.320> hopefully<00:01:44.130> they<00:01:44.790> work<00:01:45.030> out<00:01:45.240> so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and bolt and hopefully they work out so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
and bolt and hopefully they work out so
just<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.829> couple<00:01:47.009> things<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.759> terms<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.119> how<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
just a couple things in terms of how to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.960 
just a couple things in terms of how to
get<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> off<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.100> least<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.549> had<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> go

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
get it off or at least what I had to go

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.810 
get it off or at least what I had to go
through

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
through

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.400 
through
like<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.910> said<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.300> pretty<00:01:54.480> easy<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.990> get<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
like I said it's pretty easy to get to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
where there are two air hoses and you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.469 
where there are two air hoses and you
have<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.380> squeeze<00:02:07.380> these<00:02:07.800> here<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.580> then<00:02:09.210> pull

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
have to squeeze these here and then pull

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.900 
have to squeeze these here and then pull
them<00:02:09.690> off<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.350> kind<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.679> tough<00:02:10.910> they

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
them off it can be kind of tough they

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.490 
them off it can be kind of tough they
managed<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.420> get<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:13.440> a

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
managed to get it and then there's a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.630 
managed to get it and then there's a
hose<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.970> took<00:02:15.120> off<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.190> get<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.490> out

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
hose that I took off that to get it out

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.000 
hose that I took off that to get it out
of<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.790> way<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.230> it's<00:02:19.230> leaking<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.650> little<00:02:19.920> bit

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
of the way now it's leaking a little bit

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.160 
of the way now it's leaking a little bit
of<00:02:20.100> oil<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.400> because<00:02:20.850> I've<00:02:21.030> been

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
of oil here because I've been

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.510 
of oil here because I've been
procrastinating<00:02:22.170> because<00:02:22.920> I'm<00:02:23.130> making<00:02:23.430> this

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
procrastinating because I'm making this

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.830 
procrastinating because I'm making this
video<00:02:23.850> but<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.900> clamped<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.040> clamp<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.910> hose<00:02:27.120> so

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
video but I clamped it clamp the hose so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.860 
video but I clamped it clamp the hose so
not<00:02:28.260> too<00:02:28.440> much<00:02:28.620> oil<00:02:28.770> will<00:02:29.010> flow<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.690> also

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
not too much oil will flow but you also

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.160 
not too much oil will flow but you also
have<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.200> plug<00:02:31.560> where<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:32.610> going<00:02:32.910> into<00:02:33.170> and
