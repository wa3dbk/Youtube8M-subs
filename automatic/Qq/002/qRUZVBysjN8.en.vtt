 you had thought what would happen if the cakes 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.110
 for 30 days 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.210
 we are all in mourning for the 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.740
 dead disappeared but we have to 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.960
 recognize that they have not always been the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.970
 better food for us which we 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.550
 leads to the documentary Super Size Me or 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.439
 super make me up this movie shows the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.779
 evolution of morgan spurlock for 30 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.270
 days in February 2003 during the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.670
 which is fed exclusively and 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.410
 exclusively of thugs during the 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.300
 filming is by topcom and in the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.309
 mcdonald's restaurants 3 times a day 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.280
 arriving to consume an average of 5 thousand 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.470
 daily kilocalories the recommended for 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.909
 an adult man varied from 2 thousand to 2 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.769
 1,700 kilocalories 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.559
 although I knew that michael phelps 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.390
 Olympic swimmer consumes 12 thousand 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.390
 kilocalories a day 12 thousand way 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.800
 before the experiment is for what it was 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.530
 healthy and thin and average 188 centimeters 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.690
 of height with a weight of 84.1 kilograms 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.960
 after 30 days obtained a gain 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.940
 of 1.1 kilograms a 13% increase of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.430
 body mass by increasing its rate of 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.950
 body mass from 23.2 inside the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.210
 healthy range 19 to 25 to 26 with overweight

 he also experienced mood swings 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.619
 sexual dysfunction and liver damage is 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.200
 so it took 14 months to lose 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.280
 the weight that had won all this with 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.970
 the eagerness to show the growing 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.830
 Propagation of obesity throughout the USA 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.780
 but they have begun to think that Mexico 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.790
 It is one of the countries with more people 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.979
 obese in the world mexico has a 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.500
 estimated percentage of 32.8 percent 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.369
 of obese adults above the United States who 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.050
 reports 31.8 percent close to 70% of 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.910
 adult Mexicans are overweight and 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.190
 4 out of 5 children currently suffering 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.830
 obesity will remain with that condition 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.420
 the rest of his life and that is why 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.580
 least in the city ​​of Mexico we have 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.310
 always at our disposal some 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.170
 cake stand 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.010
 fritangas etc that although they are extreme 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.790
 delicious are not entirely healthy 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.130
 approximately 20 percent of the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.900
 Mexican population eats away from home and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.640
 a quarter of this percentage that 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.280
 they are more or less 5 million people 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.650
 they go out day with day 5 of suadero or 2 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.870
 chicharron gorditas or the famous cake 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.930
 Cuban what brings us to our 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.580
 next point the 1st cake the engines 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.260
 resided in a cruise south of the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.970
 city in a series of posts 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.520
 ambulantes in which hygiene was the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.410
 last of the worries there were 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.790
 of all types and combinations but 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.920
 always respecting the rule of being 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.100
 incredibly great to cook everything 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.290
 with oil and without mercy like that and the bread 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.000
 he kept on the roof of the 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.040
 now disappeared dead are you were 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.180
 famous for its exaggerated size and it is not 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.340
 joke 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.989
 they were the answer to the little equation 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.060
 money more hunger is common to the highest 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.069
 blood alcohol level so 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.010
 what would have happened if there was super 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.060
 make me region 4 Mexico City 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.069
 feeding three times a day 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.439
 only and exclusively from the 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.299
 the dead ones we start by making a 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.739
 comparison between a big time and the 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.139
 Ronald's most caloric burger 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.299
 mcdonald and a Cuban dead woman the most 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.010
 stuck in the very short ones 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.430
 ingredients of the big tex and they were bread 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.639
 meat with bound american cheese lettuce 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.639
 tomato onions gherkins salt pepper 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:21.489
 and the special sauce the sum of their 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.319
 ingredients gives us 909 kilocalories that 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.840
 added to a cola drink of 600 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.719
 milliliters gives us a total of 1,159 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.480
 kilocalories now the ingredients of 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.700
 a Cuban cake Milanese sausage egg

 yellow and chops avocado beans 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.489
 mayonnaise 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.930
 to the sum of the ingredients gives us a 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.730
 total of thousand 743 kilocalories and if you 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.930
 we add the 600 milliliter soda 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.849
 we have a total of 1993 kilocalories the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.379
 death horta roundly defeats the 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.719
 view and for almost double 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.670
 kilocalories the amount of calories in 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.200
 a diet varies for each person but 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.939
 the caloric tables of food are 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.859
 usually based on an intake in the 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.139
 range from two thousand to two thousand 700 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.909
 kilocalories which means that 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.590
 with just eating a dead we will not have 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.260
 enough kilocalories for all 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.760
 day now it is so if there were 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.439
 fed three times a day in the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.739
 other deaths would have had an average 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:21.410
 of six thousand kilocalories per day and 180 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.479
 thousand to conclude the month is three times what 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.460
 recommended remember that with a diet 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.160
 of 2,000 daily kilocalories 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.960
 60,000 at the end of the month a third of 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.720
 the kilocalories that with a woman cake 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.490
 at breakfast, lunch and dinner does not 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.800
 it's missing to point out that the damage to his body 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.780
 would have been certainly greater and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.370
 although it is unlikely that any 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.080
 Dish person take three loaves 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.639
 Cuban every day if it's a 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.230
 reality that many people perform 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.540
 more than one meal a day 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.980
 street stalls and neither are we 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.290
 saying that the street stalls 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.140
 be bad are our favorites for 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.030
 a lot what we are trying to say 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.160
 is that if you decide to pack some tacos 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.930
 or a cake does not hurt to do a little 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.940
 of physical activity and try to eat 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.340
 Something healthier in your other meals 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.870
 in order to continue to enjoy 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.800
 our Mexican snacks without the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.800
 consequences of overweight 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.380
 with chipotle the parts were 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.160
 short for nonsense say it in the 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.760
 comments 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.760
 three powers 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.200
 I do not know
