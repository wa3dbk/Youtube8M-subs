Thanks to Dave Moore for the lyrics

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:57.640
look at all my things
out in the yard

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:10.840
not many things
but the moving was hard

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:22.200
they took a man on the run
for moving like that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:36.760
a man on the run...grows tired
when all the lovin' he asked for died.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.210
and oh the parades
on the 4th of july

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.680
riders on horses
under national lights

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:23.760
a band that kept playing
the very same notes...

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:39.600
that was the 4th of july
things like that just won't fly.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:58.080
put on your stockings
and put on your shoes

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:08.600
put on your makeup
and put on your blues

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:20.520
put on your dress
you wore when you knew

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:36.000
that there was nothing to say
and all my words just got in the way

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:03.280
out of good graces
and into the rain

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:14.200
i book some pictures
it's in to the rain

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:26.400
i pray for summer
and not a cold spring

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:42.120
'cause summer's a long ways away
to be left without no place to stay.ï»¿
