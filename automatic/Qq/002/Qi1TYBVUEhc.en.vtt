00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.340
 alongside the devices are designed to 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.190
 battery charge is one of the main 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.080
 factors by which they are separated 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.159
 is in battery life 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.570
 this term may be 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.400
 full 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400
 in the event that burn is made 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.169
 ten percent capacity 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.749
 for 14 16 hours 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:23.800
 middle 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.460
 about five seven hours 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.050
 In this mode, the charger works 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.089
 industrial charge devices 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.659
 let's say in our flight 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.900
 or announce 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
 and brief 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.580
 in this mode can be charged 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.170
 only special Kabule authors 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.010
 and it lasts two hours and 15 minutes 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.900
 another factor is 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.790
 battery factor form 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.730
 rechargeable charger 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.150
 by this principle 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.600
 chargers are divided into 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.940
 universal in which you can 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.340
 charge any batteries 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.030
 combined in which you can 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.720
 charge 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.890
 size 2 batteries now i'm 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.800
 and not universal which can 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.399
 charge 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.570
 only batteries 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.960
 type 2 and not only battery types 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.880
 rio 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.510
 by the number of elements 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.260
 charging can be shared 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.770
 rechargeable 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.330
 in this case 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.140
 four rechargeable both 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200
 in this case 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 six rechargeable as in this case 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510
 and more 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.320
 In addition, yes may be rechargeable 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.370
 In order to feed the birds 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.920
 most common 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.799
 and special let's say so ii as peter 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.799
 able to decide here if bye computer 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.190
 charger camelion bc 09 06 cis 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.100
 designed to charge 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.270
 anyone who is aviators on stream 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.189
 so is 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.070
 universal 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.980
 have you can charge the batteries from the most 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.720
 little ones 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.909
 sizes nice 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.280
 to the biggest 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.299
 size lunch 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.729
 at the same time including sample plates 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.329
 variators 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.560
 type except 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.060
 however the charge here is the so-called secret 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.470
 namely, we manually installed in advance 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.230
 battery charge time 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.280
 3 6 9 and 24 hours 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.200
 and after that here's your past tense 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.189
 at this 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.749
 charger turn off 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.760
 In addition, we can with the help of China Club 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.819
 check suitable or not suitable 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.579
 battery 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.079
 for charging 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.279
 further, this device is valid 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.299
 only on the fifth predetermined by us 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.339
 the program 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.739
 charger chatting 8 03 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.020
 give out a few valuable features 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.279
 so first it is a very inexpensive device 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:33.659
 which at the same time 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.479
 allows you to charge batteries 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.359
 in in a very large range of bones 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.399
 from the smallest 300 million 5 hours to the most 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.019
 large 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.589
 but with a half thousand tons 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.839
 it works because of the deportations of summer 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.070
 and allows 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.100
 charge the smallest akmole 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.179
 the actors 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:52.599
 3 numbers 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.029
 and the largest in 10 hours 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:57.899
 microprocessor coveted device 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.199
 such as data messiah 510 is 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.509
 most perfect types of chargers 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:03.599
 devices 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.029
 they allow to discharge 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:07.379
 battery 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.449
 fast charge hit normal charge 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.279
 during charging is displayed on this 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.109
 among indicators 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.499
 using this charger 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.930
 we can dilute nickel cadmium 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.209
 batteries that will avoid them 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.459
 Respect memory 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.589
 besides quickly charge the metal 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.129
 hydride kul are intended for 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.589
 fast charging or normal cycle 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.649
 charge any other batteries 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:31.549
 maximum amount 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.159
 rechargeable battery here 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.919
 makes 4 pieces maximum capacity 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.259
 about two hours olympiad 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.089
 also here can be charged as 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.169
 such as well as size 2a 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.769
 since we are this fare rate 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 Someone if charging the amount of burning 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.029
 sectors shows the degree of charge 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:49.959
 battery 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.849
 and you are not this case shows that 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.889
 confirms not completed yet 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.550
 documents loaded 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.569
 kiss the LEDs go out 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.789
 Anna EU among the monitor we will see 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.169
 however, the charged battery will be 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.979
 burn indicator essential tags 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.169
 and the inscription ok under each of the charged 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.899
 batteries 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.339
 charger wart 57 0 62 different 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.819
 at small dimensions a large number 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.150
 rechargeable battery 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.609
 except two batteries on 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.650
 front panel 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.859
 can not be posted four more 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.840
 battery on the back 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.790
 and it can be communicators as 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.090
 size 2 about 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.849
 so pen measurements 3 2 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.469
 it is very safe because 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:32.169
 built transformer 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.300
 pattern 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.289
 and further the electric network market 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.680
 latest type a chargers 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.339
 which we wanted to watch it and 

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:43.339
 is komlenok sky charging model 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.319
 09 05 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.000
 they can charge 4 batteries 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.450
 sizes 2 a or 3 c 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.999
 various capacities 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.129
 and so she has useful properties 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.050
 called jumping star 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.210
 meaning she can charge 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.990
 Batteries cheeky to zero 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.139
 will be 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.039
 we only watched a few models 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.539
 chargers that are in our 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.660
 assortment 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.070
 the whole range of you 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.530
 you can find out on our website and in ours 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.570
 stores have a pleasant selection
