00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.680
 hi girls today I will teach you 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 do this in the fake gop 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.730
 so let's get 2 scoops for you 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.570
 firm grip is wheat flour and ink 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:24.330
 gouache wheat flour gouache 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 orange water and a large bakery voice 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.300
 begin 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 take the wheat flour and beat 2 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.270
 spoons 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:45.780
 if you want another email 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:50.820
 you take water and killed half of it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 begin to move since you have to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.699
 until it reaches the point where it is 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.340
 the whole line 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.520
 if she does not like that mass 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.729
 when she does something, you too 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.520
 kill me more to do better lay low 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.189
 very exaggerated 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.600
 they will get to a lot you can 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:20.240
 back to doing what he said and said 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.240
 that arrived to the point 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.939
 But I think we have water and 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.090
 Sewer 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:37.159
 I find a little more and have to leave 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.740
 that flat thing that if not let 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.050
 that thick piece will not let your 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.690
 Doll 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:55.020
 It looks like we got to lose the camera 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:58.550
 to - you have to look like this will 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.550
 vote the camera back 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.950
 Sorry guys, football, I just do not have it. 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.100
 fault 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:15.200
 Moved it's good to spoon it in the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:20.580
 gouache ink zone takes the boot 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:31.500
 in a pot or two and put two 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:34.040
 spoons all but I'll put the rest 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040
 Score 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.650
 Are you choice I just found the spoon that 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:48.030
 You picked it up with the wheat flour and stir it. 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.940
 Keep moving, keep the screen moving. 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 That little pink thing, James. 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:03.830
 I do not know how to get old, it's getting old. 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.830
 bring back a little water 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.880
 I'll move the others fast because they 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.070
 do not mess around fast and she has to stay 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.670
 Clean thing is watching there I'll get the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:25.680

 Our people look who is 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:41.269
 It looks like you're using a 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:42.650
 orange camera but not okay if we 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.409
 you want to vote 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.409

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.409
 Itagua 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:04:03.409

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.629

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:21.260
 O 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.110

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.350
 did I will join with this good I okay 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.979
 get very full and that's what I did 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.060
 before she became clearer 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.460
 dark 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.000
 then it gets darker you can 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.010
 add some more wheat flour 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.010
 there are more people left to harvest 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:56.600
 I swap a spoon and I'm going to 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.600

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:14.860

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:21.580
 bottom plate 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:23.170

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.150
