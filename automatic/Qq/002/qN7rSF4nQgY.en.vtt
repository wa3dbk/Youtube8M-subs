00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 life is arranged you would understand none of us 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.550
 no loners above two social 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.510
 society 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.879
 where there are different people and so important to play 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.909
 in the village but there are such carvers and many 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.850
 of you need to have noticed this excitement but in 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.530
 first to play play someone what 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.880
 you don't have to be there 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.350
 master super there will be something this to me 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.060
 you need to hand over here 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.310
 simple simplest eyebrow most 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.259
 a simple song that you learned for you 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.860
 it seems or a blow to you seems to 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.960
 there that there is any it can but in fact 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.979
 In fact, you can do it from there another 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.450
 this cannot yet therefore as soon as you 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.060
 learned there the song pack cigarettes or 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.610
 song in a special first mother of God 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.850
 I will learn my own will. 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.460
 play now let's get closer to the topic we 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.300
 talking today about excitement and so 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.700
 addition 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.070
 but there are some who think that only 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.800
 I'm worried now prompting mom what 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.840
 I can only beginner musician but 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.500
 actually know i saw people who 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.800
 by 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.780
 many decades already on stage and I poured 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.390
 how they are done more skillfully they are exactly the same 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.670
 worried like beginners high 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.640
 performance if what nature 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.060
 excitement in my opinion the fact is that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.060
 our body our essence is so arranged 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.210
 that so before you stands to her beyond 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.650
 task some unusual task 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.740
 some energy is released 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.320
 more than usual for this task 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.560
 hurry and from here this montage appears 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.350
 but it does it is energy and we can 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.800
 direct this energy in excitement how 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.480
 way 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.450
 when you start to concentrate on 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.000
 when we think I will play right now 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.360
 everyone can look at me to me 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 listen and i can fucked up now i would 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.300
 a lot of sugar is not the right note 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.560
 I can now put this city and all 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.630
 I, I, I, I, I, I will disgrace myself and I will 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 tuna me with 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.200
 They are all like that when we concentrate on 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.970
 here it appears from here 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.830
 bad both sides but in fact 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.100
 if you direct this energy to the right one 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.980
 mainstream in which way I will tell you I 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.140
 tell you now how to direct energy 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.600
 which stands out from you which you 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.980
 feel like this imitate it 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.250
 and there is energy 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:22.080
 if you start to concentrate not on 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.590
 I started a question like this vidos 9 I 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.710
 I will play before starting to concentrate 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.870
 listen to 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.450
 very important thick I will say when 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.910
 you don't play you must in your head 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.100
 to draw 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.650
 we found in the head to draw submit 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.780
 some kind of image and man so arranged that 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.230
 he can't concentrate right on 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.660
 two things image i mean what is it 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.580
 maybe any picture with nature either 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.470
 this could be some person who 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.040
 you love or it could be some 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.730
 situation or something else seals star and 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.880
 sun whatever but you submitted this 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.920
 picture and through the sound you start about 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.130
 This rumble sounds of his own 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.959
 and song in your own words with your notes you 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.270
 start talking about what 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.400
 submitted if this song can be 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.989
 a song already laid some image 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.569
 which you can draw 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.690
 and you can survive as an actor 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.450
 live this image of your song and yet 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.070
 time I repeat a person can not think them 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.930
 to invest at once about two things like 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.660
 only you concentrated on the image 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.090
 and start playing about it you stop 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.280
 concentrates on itself and then no 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.550
 so negative that 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.720
 replenishment will not be you play all 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.880
 cool that's all I'll tell you you 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.050
 need to listen listen think missed 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.000
 through yourself and see it in your game 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.639
 thank you very much for your life 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.639
 and good luck in all the best
