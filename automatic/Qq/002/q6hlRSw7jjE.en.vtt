00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.399
 in montreal it's the only Basque relationship 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.210
 what people have always thought if I'm not going to talk to the past it's 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.980
 not really it stays tight 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.980
 current products 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 my goal this season is not the same 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.320
 paris-roubaix has the fact of having made it serbia also a step in the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.350
 tour de France 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 thanks to a rather large gap 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.370
 so for me today when I see johnny I tell him 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.010
 you have to do paris-roubaix at the start 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.930
 the first two or three years when we're not the pivotal role 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.650
 to learn 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.299
 but after when we learned 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.340
 it can serve the day when the rate will pass as we saw last year 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.500
 the ride went on the cobblestones for a few minutes the waves were 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.400
 just surprised what pavers are part of the tour de france om 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.350
 it's part of dubai and hong kong like the track like cyclo-cross 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.440
 like them the mountain bike is joined so the champion is able to be able 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.170
 adapt to all disciplines 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.439
 when you're a professional runner and you're lucky we see in 1980 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.970
 to take away what on the velodrome we have a real joy or the suffering 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.280
 prevail 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.290
 no it's a real joy especially to say February 10 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.040
 because yes I won in front of specialists it's the same misery to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.460
 him two individuals becomes the mixed voice 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.930
 I arrived 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.990
 it may be a chance 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.850
 it's a champion's answer to just become shown that it was 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.550
 possible for you to win this race 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.550
 this range of champion is the answer of world champion at the club 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.150
 the fact of having been world champion with the sale 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
 80 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.999
 demers 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:12.379
 super how how to explain it may be more want to work from 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.129
 to honor this jersey 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.999
 therefore to be present from the beginning of the season compared to other years 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.559
 where I was rather light we started well reacted I started 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.429
 last after paris-roubaix often 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.059
 and there I start the season to go until October 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.409
 so there that year is working more and winning the city of 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.999
 international titan that was in March when I usually got you 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.389
 never present in Paris I could have attended 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.759
 the girls I found myself at the bottom 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.929
 to paris-roubaix with the shape that I had because when I was the turn 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:40.739
 of France 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.759
 very very very very early and that I kept elsewhere after 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.319
 summoned world champion is a real motivation toru heating there on 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.950
 shoulders this year no more world champion then you 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.119
 he won paris-roubaix with that jersey on the shoulders 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.509
 that's understandable it's in his strings this season 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.649
 I have just seen him at the wrong but he is already very sharp 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.579
 when we learned today that he was yesterday in gratitude 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.509
 so that's really the thing he wants to win he did second and 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.319
 third he has never won 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.369
 and I think that that it is dear to him 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:11.759
 l he has the abilities to do it
