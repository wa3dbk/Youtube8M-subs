once you fill them all up you close it

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.670 
once you fill them all up you close it

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
balls turned out and I'm just using the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.650 
balls turned out and I'm just using the
remainder<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.700> cake<00:01:19.910> batter<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.450> I'm

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.359 
filling it out on the bottom of the cake
tray<00:01:22.759> there<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.770> then<00:01:24.770> all<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.009> need<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.190> do

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
tray there and then all you need to do

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.969 
tray there and then all you need to do
is<00:01:25.640> put<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.330> cake<00:01:26.540> balls<00:01:26.840> in<00:01:27.110> one<00:01:27.590> at<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.770> time

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
is put the cake balls in one at a time

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.710 
is put the cake balls in one at a time
just<00:01:28.280> on<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.460> bottoms<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:28.940> rearranged<00:01:29.450> them

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
just on the bottoms I rearranged them

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.109 
just on the bottoms I rearranged them
just<00:01:29.899> randomly<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:31.399> tried<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.759> separate

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
just randomly and I tried to separate

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:40.570 
just randomly and I tried to separate
the<00:01:32.270> colors<00:01:32.420> as<00:01:32.660> much<00:01:32.810> as<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.050> could<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:40.310> just

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
the colors as much as I could and I just

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.310 
the colors as much as I could and I just
topped<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.060> rest<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.750> cake<00:01:41.930> batter<00:01:42.110> on

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
topped the rest of the cake batter on

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.650 
topped the rest of the cake batter on
top<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> cake<00:01:43.100> pops<00:01:43.399> at<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.270> stage<00:01:44.509> I

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
top of the cake pops at this stage I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.270 
top of the cake pops at this stage I
probably<00:01:44.869> should<00:01:45.200> have<00:01:45.229> put<00:01:45.500> more<00:01:45.740> cake<00:01:46.009> balls

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
probably should have put more cake balls

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.260 
probably should have put more cake balls
in<00:01:46.550> you<00:01:47.149> see<00:01:47.630> why<00:01:47.840> at<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.110> end<00:01:48.430> but<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:49.759> didn't

I did however try to make it look a
little<00:02:14.530> bit<00:02:14.740> cute<00:02:15.010> with<00:02:15.190> those<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:15.640> button

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
little bit cute with those little button

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.450 
little bit cute with those little button
things<00:02:16.290> maybe<00:02:17.290> not<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.560> don't<00:02:17.740> know<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:18.250> um

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
things maybe not I don't know but um

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.760 
things maybe not I don't know but um
we'll<00:02:19.210> see<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:21.100> cut<00:02:21.310> into<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.770> I

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
we'll see so I just cut into it and I

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.170 
we'll see so I just cut into it and I
think<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.980> turned<00:02:24.130> out<00:02:24.220> all<00:02:24.400> right<00:02:24.700> look<00:02:25.000> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
think it turned out all right look you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.170 
think it turned out all right look you
can<00:02:25.360> see<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.380> cake<00:02:26.590> balls<00:02:26.850> rose<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> top

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
can see the cake balls rose to the top

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.760 
can see the cake balls rose to the top
since<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.780> did<00:02:28.960> flip<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> cakes<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.650> now

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
since I did flip the cakes and now

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.710 
since I did flip the cakes and now
they're<00:02:29.920> all<00:02:30.040> at<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.250> bottom<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.540> said

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
they're all at the bottom so as I said

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.970 
they're all at the bottom so as I said
before<00:02:31.750> probably<00:02:32.290> could<00:02:32.470> have<00:02:32.530> added<00:02:32.830> in

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
before probably could have added in

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.490 
before probably could have added in
another<00:02:33.460> layer<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.910> cake<00:02:34.060> balls<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.900> think

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
another layer of cake balls but I think

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.010 
another layer of cake balls but I think
it<00:02:35.560> turned<00:02:35.710> out<00:02:35.830> all<00:02:36.100> right<00:02:36.130> um<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:37.510> could<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.990> a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
it turned out all right um it could be a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.610 
it turned out all right um it could be a
fail<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:39.460> way<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.760> made<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.240> but<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:41.080> don't

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
fail the way that I made it but I don't

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.900 
fail the way that I made it but I don't
know<00:02:41.710> I<00:02:41.740> think<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.250> probably<00:02:42.370> would<00:02:42.580> do<00:02:42.790> this

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
know I think I probably would do this

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.460 
know I think I probably would do this
again<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.480> give<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.810> thumbs<00:02:44.050> up<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.410> think

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
again so I give it a thumbs up I think

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.140 
again so I give it a thumbs up I think
it's<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.740> win<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.460> let<00:02:45.580> me<00:02:45.640> know<00:02:45.760> what<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.000> guys
