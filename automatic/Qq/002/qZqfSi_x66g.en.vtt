see<00:01:55.549> these<00:01:55.759> are<00:01:55.969> slanted<00:01:56.270> style<00:01:56.719> saddlebags

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
see these are slanted style saddlebags

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.770 
see these are slanted style saddlebags
so<00:01:57.859> with<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.100> saddle<00:01:58.549> bag<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.850> that<00:01:59.030> nature<00:01:59.270> you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
so with a saddle bag of that nature you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.389 
so with a saddle bag of that nature you
want<00:01:59.929> to<00:02:00.020> have<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.259> slant<00:02:00.560> facing<00:02:01.009> forward<00:02:01.310> so

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
want to have the slant facing forward so

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.529 
want to have the slant facing forward so
we're<00:02:01.520> going<00:02:01.609> to<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:01.759> it<00:02:01.909> facing<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.479> way

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
we're going to have it facing this way

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.980 
we're going to have it facing this way
on<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.079> bike<00:02:03.259> got<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.130> all<00:02:04.280> set<00:02:04.520> up<00:02:04.899> slide<00:02:05.899> them

on the bike got it all set up slide them

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.070 
on the bike got it all set up slide them
over<00:02:06.109> the<00:02:06.469> fender<00:02:06.819> just<00:02:07.819> like<00:02:07.969> so<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.660> now<00:02:09.020> we

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
over the fender just like so and now we

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.840 
over the fender just like so and now we
can<00:02:09.289> check<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> adjustment<00:02:10.039> against<00:02:10.729> the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
can check the adjustment against the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.660 
can check the adjustment against the
exhaust<00:02:11.240> pipe<00:02:11.830> with<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.920> saddlebags<00:02:13.370> over

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
exhaust pipe with the saddlebags over

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.010 
exhaust pipe with the saddlebags over
the<00:02:13.760> fender<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.300> can<00:02:14.420> start<00:02:14.600> checking<00:02:14.840> our

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the fender we can start checking our

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.390 
the fender we can start checking our
clearances<00:02:15.440> as<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.920> see<00:02:16.069> we've<00:02:16.220> got

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
clearances as we can see we've got

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.190 
clearances as we can see we've got
plenty<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.880> gap<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:17.330> between<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.870> exhaust

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
plenty of gap here between the exhaust

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.260 
plenty of gap here between the exhaust
and<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.470> bottom<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.250> saddlebag<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:20.060> keep

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
and the bottom of the saddlebag but keep

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.700 
and the bottom of the saddlebag but keep
in<00:02:20.390> mind<00:02:20.420> once<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.170> start<00:02:21.410> loading<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
in mind once you start loading the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.200 
in mind once you start loading the
saddlebags<00:02:22.070> up<00:02:22.280> they're<00:02:22.850> going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.030> start

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
saddlebags up they're going to start

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.130 
saddlebags up they're going to start
sagging<00:02:23.420> down<00:02:23.720> even

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
sagging down even

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.200 
sagging down even
getting<00:02:24.500> closer<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:24.980> exhaust<00:02:25.460> so<00:02:26.030> if<00:02:26.120> you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
getting closer to that exhaust so if you

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.670 
getting closer to that exhaust so if you
need<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.630> them<00:02:26.780> higher<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.140> can<00:02:27.290> do<00:02:27.440> so

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
need to just them higher you can do so

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.490 
need to just them higher you can do so
by<00:02:27.920> pulling<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.940> velcro<00:02:29.240> back<00:02:29.540> bringing<00:02:30.350> that

higher<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.510> get<00:02:32.930> your<00:02:33.110> clearance<00:02:33.410> as<00:02:33.560> needed

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
higher and get your clearance as needed

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.010 
higher and get your clearance as needed
now<00:02:34.820> these<00:02:34.970> saddle<00:02:35.270> bags<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.630> four

loops which can thread around a secure
point<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.140> bike<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.530> then<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.340> just

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
point on the bike and then you just

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.430 
point on the bike and then you just
connect<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.940> two<00:02:47.120> together<00:02:48.520> as<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:51.290> see

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
connect the two together as you can see

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.050 
connect the two together as you can see
we<00:02:51.620> went<00:02:51.800> off<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.070> passenger<00:02:52.400> foot<00:02:52.670> peg<00:02:52.850> here

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
we went off the passenger foot peg here

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.630 
we went off the passenger foot peg here
which<00:02:53.540> gives<00:02:53.840> us<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.110> nice<00:02:54.290> secure<00:02:55.070> spot<00:02:55.370> for

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
which gives us a nice secure spot for

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.190 
which gives us a nice secure spot for
the<00:02:55.700> front<00:02:55.940> now<00:02:56.510> finding<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> secure

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
the front now finding the secure

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.570 
the front now finding the secure
attachment<00:02:57.620> point<00:02:57.800> at<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.070> back<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.430> bike

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
attachment point at the back of the bike

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.760 
attachment point at the back of the bike
can<00:02:59.030> be<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.209> little<00:02:59.450> more<00:02:59.540> difficult<00:02:59.770> these

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
can be a little more difficult these

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.800 
can be a little more difficult these
turn<00:03:01.100> signals<00:03:01.520> look<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> good<00:03:02.330> spot<00:03:02.570> but

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
turn signals look like a good spot but

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.060 
turn signals look like a good spot but
on<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:03.050> bike<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.380> wouldn't<00:03:03.620> recommend<00:03:03.830> it

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
on this bike I wouldn't recommend it

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.740 
on this bike I wouldn't recommend it
because<00:03:04.190> they're<00:03:04.370> kind<00:03:04.520> of<00:03:04.580> flimsy<00:03:04.790> we<00:03:05.540> found

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
because they're kind of flimsy we found

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.720 
because they're kind of flimsy we found
a<00:03:05.810> nice<00:03:05.989> spot<00:03:06.140> on<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.950> hard<00:03:07.220> model<00:03:07.520> point

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
a nice spot on a hard model point

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.030 
a nice spot on a hard model point
underneath<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.390> fender<00:03:08.600> which<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.440> use<00:03:09.650> to

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
underneath the fender which we use to

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.390
