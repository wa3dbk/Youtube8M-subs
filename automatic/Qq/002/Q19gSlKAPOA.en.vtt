to<00:02:30.650> lay<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.920> fair<00:02:31.340> bit<00:02:31.579> of<00:02:31.640> charcoal<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.019> you

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
to lay a fair bit of charcoal on so you

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.670 
to lay a fair bit of charcoal on so you
can<00:02:33.349> blend<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.510> I'm<00:02:35.510> using<00:02:35.810> my<00:02:36.049> finger<00:02:36.440> here

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
can blend it in I'm using my finger here

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.460 
can blend it in I'm using my finger here
this<00:02:37.190> gives<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.579> lovely<00:02:37.909> soft<00:02:38.450> effect<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.140> I

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
this gives a lovely soft effect and I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.800 
this gives a lovely soft effect and I
find<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:39.920> have<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.129> lot<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.459> control<00:02:40.970> it's<00:02:41.599> also

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
find you have a lot of control it's also

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.410 
find you have a lot of control it's also
easy<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.560> paper<00:02:42.769> surface<00:02:43.069> now<00:02:43.970> I'm<00:02:44.150> using

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
easy on the paper surface now I'm using

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.839 
easy on the paper surface now I'm using
a<00:02:44.599> tissue<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.530> spreads<00:02:46.040> out<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.310> charcoal

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
a tissue this spreads out the charcoal

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.149 
a tissue this spreads out the charcoal
evenly<00:02:47.480> but<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.170> allows<00:02:48.349> me<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.680> get<00:02:48.950> rid<00:02:49.129> of

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
evenly but it allows me to get rid of

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.699 
evenly but it allows me to get rid of
any<00:02:49.489> excess<00:02:50.000> powder<00:02:50.329> be<00:02:51.049> careful<00:02:51.440> not<00:02:51.560> to

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
any excess powder be careful not to

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.399 
any excess powder be careful not to
damage<00:02:51.859> the<00:02:52.010> paper<00:02:52.340> surface<00:02:52.870> with<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.019> excess

charcoal<00:02:54.980> powder<00:02:55.280> on<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:55.700> tissue<00:02:55.909> I'm

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
charcoal powder on the tissue I'm

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.930 
charcoal powder on the tissue I'm
transferring<00:02:57.139> this<00:02:57.470> onto<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:57.920> table<00:02:58.280> top<00:02:58.489> and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
transferring this onto the table top and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.089 
transferring this onto the table top and
this<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.629> good<00:02:59.840> technique<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.500> use<00:03:00.530> as<00:03:00.920> it

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
this is a good technique to use as it

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.210 
this is a good technique to use as it
lays<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.340> most<00:03:01.790> subtle<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.480> tones<00:03:02.829> there<00:03:03.829> that

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
lays the most subtle of tones there that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.390 
lays the most subtle of tones there that
looks<00:03:04.430> good<00:03:05.530> okay<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:06.590> that's<00:03:06.950> our<00:03:07.129> background

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
looks good okay so that's our background

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.569 
looks good okay so that's our background
done<00:03:07.909> now<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:09.019> move<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.379> to<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.620> boots<00:03:09.859> and

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
done now we can move on to the boots and

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.550 
done now we can move on to the boots and
this<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.790> basically<00:03:11.120> just<00:03:11.629> building<00:03:11.900> up<00:03:12.200> tone

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
this is basically just building up tone

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.349 
this is basically just building up tone
so<00:03:12.859> we'll<00:03:13.010> be<00:03:13.129> doing<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.519> with<00:03:13.700> our<00:03:13.879> charcoal

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
so we'll be doing this with our charcoal

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.110 
so we'll be doing this with our charcoal
pencils<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.950> basically<00:03:16.489> we<00:03:16.609> just<00:03:16.639> have<00:03:16.849> to

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
pencils so basically we just have to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.849 
pencils so basically we just have to
build<00:03:17.329> up<00:03:17.480> tone<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.079> this<00:03:18.290> isn't<00:03:18.500> very

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
build up tone and this isn't very

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.580 
build up tone and this isn't very
different<00:03:19.220> from<00:03:19.579> using<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.060> pencil<00:03:20.530> I'm<00:03:21.530> using

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
different from using a pencil I'm using

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.159 
different from using a pencil I'm using
small<00:03:22.430> circular<00:03:23.090> motions<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.660> build<00:03:23.870> up<00:03:24.049> the

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
small circular motions to build up the

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.439 
small circular motions to build up the
tone<00:03:24.379> in<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:24.709> case<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.819> back<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.269> boot

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
tone in this case the back of the boot

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.599 
tone in this case the back of the boot
will<00:03:26.629> be<00:03:26.750> in<00:03:26.900> shadow<00:03:27.139> so<00:03:27.530> I'll<00:03:27.889> make<00:03:28.069> it<00:03:28.220> darker

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
will be in shadow so I'll make it darker

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.360 
will be in shadow so I'll make it darker
there<00:03:28.959> I'm<00:03:29.959> suggesting<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.739> folds<00:03:31.129> in<00:03:31.220> the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
there I'm suggesting the folds in the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.759 
there I'm suggesting the folds in the
leather<00:03:31.639> here<00:03:31.970> bear<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.900> mind<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.290> highlight

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
leather here bear in mind the highlight

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.280 
leather here bear in mind the highlight
on<00:03:33.919> the<00:03:34.099> top<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.459> each<00:03:34.699> fold<00:03:35.120> or<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> apex

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
on the top of each fold or the apex

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.830 
on the top of each fold or the apex
point<00:03:36.590> I'm<00:03:37.250> using<00:03:37.519> horizontal<00:03:37.849> strokes<00:03:38.599> for

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
point I'm using horizontal strokes for

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.300 
point I'm using horizontal strokes for
this

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.589 

remember<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> toe<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> heel<00:03:48.090> are

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
remember the toe and the heel are

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.259 
remember the toe and the heel are
compound<00:03:49.230> curves<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.340> our<00:03:50.579> shading<00:03:51.060> must

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
compound curves so our shading must

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.190 
compound curves so our shading must
suggest<00:03:51.720> this

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
suggest this

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.559

so relaxing I've put the detail of the
zipper<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:12.629> I've<00:04:13.230> used<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.739> herringbone<00:04:14.099> type

zipper in I've used the herringbone type
patterns<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.209> suggest<00:04:15.629> it<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.320> busy<00:04:16.709> nature

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
patterns to suggest it the busy nature

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.750 

again<00:04:25.720> I'm<00:04:25.930> using<00:04:26.110> my<00:04:26.440> finger<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:26.920> create<00:04:27.340> soft

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
once you get to this stage there's

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.020 
once you get to this stage there's
really<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:38.009> a<00:04:38.129> case<00:04:38.310> of<00:04:38.370> refining

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
really just a case of refining

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.960 
really just a case of refining
everything<00:04:39.629> and<00:04:39.870> darkening<00:04:40.680> here<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:41.099> there
