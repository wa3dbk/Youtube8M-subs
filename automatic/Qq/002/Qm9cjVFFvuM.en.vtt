options so I'm on my Windows 7 machine

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.140 
options so I'm on my Windows 7 machine
here<00:00:08.610> so<00:00:08.790> let<00:00:08.940> me<00:00:08.970> do<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.500> CMD<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.030> since<00:00:12.030> this

here so let me do a CMD and since this
is<00:00:12.389> 7<00:00:12.870> if<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.500> were<00:00:13.620> Vista<00:00:13.889> I'd<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
is 7 if it were Vista I'd have to do the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.250 
is 7 if it were Vista I'd have to do the
same<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.940> want<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> right<00:00:15.809> click<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
same I want to right click on the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.510 
same I want to right click on the
command<00:00:16.529> prompt<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.010> run<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.490> administrator

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
command prompt and run as administrator

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.189 
command prompt and run as administrator
that<00:00:19.340> way<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.369> elevate<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.150> command<00:00:21.449> prompt<00:00:21.720> so

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
that way I elevate the command prompt so

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.650 
that way I elevate the command prompt so
let's<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> IP<00:00:24.500> config<00:00:25.500> slash<00:00:26.160> all<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.480> see

let's do a IP config slash all to see

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.550 
let's do a IP config slash all to see
all<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> data<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.840> as<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> have

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
but I'm still deleting it so I want to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.850 
but I'm still deleting it so I want to
configure<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.720> scope<00:01:34.079> options<00:01:34.439> which<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.680> have

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
configure my scope options which I have

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.670 
configure my scope options which I have
none<00:01:35.159> configured<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.900> how<00:01:37.049> clients

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
none configured so this is how clients

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.260 
none configured so this is how clients
figure<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.189> where<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> default<00:01:38.759> gateway<00:01:38.820> is

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
figure out where the default gateway is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.620 
figure out where the default gateway is
and<00:01:39.450> where<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> DNS<00:01:39.960> server<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.630> configure

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and where the DNS server is so configure

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.219 
and where the DNS server is so configure
options<00:01:44.030> router<00:01:45.030> 3<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> default<00:01:45.869> gateway

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
options router 3 is default gateway

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.280 
options router 3 is default gateway
which<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.710> 1000<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:48.799> 254<00:01:51.079> make<00:01:52.079> sure<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
which will be 1000 to 254 make sure you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.490 
which will be 1000 to 254 make sure you
click<00:01:52.500> Add<00:01:53.540> DNS<00:01:54.540> server<00:01:54.780> should<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.229> scope

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
click Add DNS server should be scope

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.010 
click Add DNS server should be scope
option<00:01:55.920> 6<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.890> that'll<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.219> 10<00:01:59.610> 0<00:02:00.060> dot<00:02:00.240> 0<00:02:00.270> dot<00:02:00.600> 1

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
option 6 so that'll be 10 0 dot 0 dot 1

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
option 6 so that'll be 10 0 dot 0 dot 1

fine<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:23.200> don't<00:02:24.200> know<00:02:24.260> why<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.470> wants<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.770> verify

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
fine I don't know why it wants to verify

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.340 
fine I don't know why it wants to verify
that<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:26.230> whatever

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
that but whatever
