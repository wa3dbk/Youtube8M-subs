well<00:00:25.260> you'll<00:00:25.410> see<00:00:25.590> initially<00:00:26.000> is<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> unit

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
well you'll see initially is the unit

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.560 
well you'll see initially is the unit
itself<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:28.230> similar<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:29.179> scope<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.449> then

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
itself is very similar in scope and then

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.990 
itself is very similar in scope and then
also<00:00:30.900> size<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.529> traditional<00:00:32.099> PW<00:00:32.579> 50s

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
little bit different is that we moved

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.639 
little bit different is that we moved
the<00:00:38.250> controls<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.059> front<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.350> unit

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
singer-songwriter type events now what's

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.140 
singer-songwriter type events now what's
really<00:01:04.860> cool<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.519> units<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.000> we

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
really cool about these units is we

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
really cool about these units is we
still<00:01:06.420> coorporate<00:01:06.960> our<00:01:07.170> power<00:01:07.409> link<00:01:07.680> system

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
still coorporate our power link system

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.130 
still coorporate our power link system
so<00:01:08.790> that's<00:01:09.030> where<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.540> actually<00:01:09.720> daisy

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so that's where you can actually daisy

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
so that's where you can actually daisy
chain<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.590> many<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.950> these<00:01:11.070> units<00:01:11.430> together<00:01:11.760> as

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
chain as many of these units together as

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.789 
chain as many of these units together as
you<00:01:12.240> need<00:01:12.479> depending<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> size<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.500> room

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you need depending on the size of room

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.070
