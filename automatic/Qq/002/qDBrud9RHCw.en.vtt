00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
a solution of a problem what I mean by

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.419 
a solution of a problem what I mean by
that<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.380> used<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.160> nice

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
little bottle next slide glass thing

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.400 
little bottle next slide glass thing
lightweight<00:00:18.240> worked<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> charm

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
lightweight worked like a charm

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.349 
lightweight worked like a charm
and<00:00:19.560> somehow<00:00:20.250> another<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.970> playing<00:00:21.240> the

come up with two or three different
contraptions<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> none<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.920> them<00:00:26.099> exactly

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
contraptions and none of them exactly

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.929 
contraptions and none of them exactly
work<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.150> pretty<00:00:27.330> close<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.939> 5/8

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
work this is pretty close this is a 5/8

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.450 
work this is pretty close this is a 5/8
inch<00:00:30.210> deep<00:00:30.779> well<00:00:31.080> socket<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> cheap<00:00:32.099> thing

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
inch deep well socket it's a cheap thing

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.160 
inch deep well socket it's a cheap thing
it's<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.850> anything<00:00:33.270> good<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:33.989> like

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it's not anything good it's not like

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.220 
it's not anything good it's not like
it's<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> craftsmen<00:00:34.950> or<00:00:35.690> SK<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.870> anything<00:00:36.989> like

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
it's a craftsmen or SK or anything like

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.700 
it's a craftsmen or SK or anything like
that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
that
and<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> worked<00:00:38.489> pretty<00:00:38.670> good<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and it worked pretty good but it's a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.030 
and it worked pretty good but it's a
little<00:00:39.390> heavy<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> end<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.590> end<00:00:40.890> down

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
little heavy on the end on this end down

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
little heavy on the end on this end down
here<00:00:41.309> where<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.520> where<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> socket<00:00:42.989> would

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
here where the where the socket would

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
here where the where the socket would
you<00:00:43.559> know<00:00:43.710> go<00:00:43.890> into<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> ratchet<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you know go into the ratchet there so I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.819 
you know go into the ratchet there so I
think<00:00:45.600> I'm<00:00:45.840> gonna<00:00:45.960> take<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.649> shed

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
think I'm gonna take this out and shed

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.430 
think I'm gonna take this out and shed
and<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.940> solve<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.390> end<00:00:48.660> right<00:00:48.899> off<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and just solve this end right off of it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139 
and just solve this end right off of it
I<00:00:49.530> had<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> friend<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> put<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
bottle neck and make a slide that way
and<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.860> sounds<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> lot<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.579> fun<00:00:56.820> it's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and that sounds like a lot of fun it's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.549
