doesn't really matter I actually
stumbled<00:00:58.289> upon<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.800> method<00:00:59.309> well<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.579> I'm

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
stumbled upon this method well as I'm

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.840 
stumbled upon this method well as I'm
trying<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:01.050> another<00:01:01.500> achievement<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.489> at

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
trying to do another achievement or at

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
trying to do another achievement or at
least<00:01:03.030> trying<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> figure<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.110> could<00:01:04.170> do

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
least trying to figure out if I could do

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.830 
least trying to figure out if I could do
it<00:01:04.710> another<00:01:04.890> way<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:06.150> seemed<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
it another way and it seemed kind of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.969 
it another way and it seemed kind of
interesting<00:01:07.110> we're<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.530> gonna<00:01:07.650> do

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
interesting we're not actually gonna do

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.109 
interesting we're not actually gonna do
anything<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> first<00:01:08.880> player

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
anything with the first player

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
anything with the first player
controller<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:10.200> we're<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.590> gonna<00:01:10.860> do

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
controller what we're actually gonna do

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
controller what we're actually gonna do
is<00:01:11.400> we're<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> bunch<00:01:13.260> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
is we're just going to do a bunch of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.109 
is we're just going to do a bunch of
where<00:01:14.130> we're<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.549> pretty<00:01:14.820> much<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
where we're just pretty much going to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.999 
where we're just pretty much going to
kill<00:01:15.330> our<00:01:15.479> own<00:01:15.689> team<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.860> some

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
kill our own team because for some

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.320 
kill our own team because for some
reason<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.369> game<00:01:17.520> doesn't<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.030> recognize

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
reason the game doesn't really recognize

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.530 
reason the game doesn't really recognize
if<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.710> team<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.490> own<00:01:20.729> team<00:01:21.000> killing<00:01:21.270> all

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
if it's a team your own team killing all

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.640 
if it's a team your own team killing all
three<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.340> enemies<00:01:24.650> possibly

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
three of you or the enemies possibly

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.230 
three of you or the enemies possibly
might<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.100> patched<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> other<00:01:27.060> one

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
might be patched just like the other one

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.510 
might be patched just like the other one
and<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> later<00:01:28.350> time<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.340> it's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and at a later time but right now it's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.950 
and at a later time but right now it's
not<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.240> might<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:30.720> take<00:01:30.900> advantage

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
not so I might as well take advantage

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.170 
not so I might as well take advantage
right<00:01:31.530> alright<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.030> want

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
right alright so right now what you want

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.850 
right alright so right now what you want
to<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.750> them<00:01:33.900> down<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> lowest

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to do is get them down to the lowest

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.179 
to do is get them down to the lowest
health<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.729> pretty<00:01:36.270> much<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:37.409> only<00:01:37.680> one

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
health so pretty much they take only one

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
health so pretty much they take only one
more<00:01:38.430> hit<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.270> take<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.780> all

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
more hit so you can just take them all

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
more hit so you can just take them all
out<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.259> they're<00:01:40.470> gonna<00:01:40.560> start<00:01:40.890> trying<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> get

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
out or they're gonna start trying to get

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.539 
out or they're gonna start trying to get
each<00:01:41.490> other<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:42.799> alright<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.130> said<00:01:44.340> once

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
each other up alright like I said once

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.800 
each other up alright like I said once
you<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.030> them<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.360> hit<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.659> all

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

I<00:02:01.929> had<00:02:02.649> already<00:02:02.829> done<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.189> tutorial<00:02:03.700> for<00:02:03.850> this

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
I had already done the tutorial for this

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.929 
I had already done the tutorial for this
but<00:02:04.270> it's<00:02:04.509> since<00:02:05.079> been<00:02:05.229> patched<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.429> the

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
but it's since been patched the the

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.190 
but it's since been patched the the
method<00:02:07.270> for<00:02:07.479> doing<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:09.369> know<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:10.200> some

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
method for doing it and I know that some

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.420 
method for doing it and I know that some
of<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.379> newer<00:02:11.650> versions<00:02:12.099> of<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.280> game<00:02:12.400> were

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
of the newer versions of the game were

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.670 
of the newer versions of the game were
from<00:02:12.879> what<00:02:13.090> I've<00:02:13.209> heard<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.500> patch

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
from what I've heard is that the patch

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.100 
from what I've heard is that the patch
is<00:02:14.890> already<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.549> game<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.299> it<00:02:16.599> pretty

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
is already in the game so that it pretty

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.500 
is already in the game so that it pretty
much<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.500> useless<00:02:17.920> for<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.160> good<00:02:18.940> chunk<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.299> view

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
much is useless for a good chunk of view

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.850 
much is useless for a good chunk of view
so<00:02:20.080> I'm<00:02:20.170> actually<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.590> show<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.769> a
