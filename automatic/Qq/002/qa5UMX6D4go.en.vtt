fun and because I like to do it it's a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560

fun<00:00:31.320> way<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> spend<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.369> time<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.270> for

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
fun way to spend my time but I think for

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.330 
fun way to spend my time but I think for
all<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.870> us<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.079> goes<00:00:34.200> beyond<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.100> mean<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
all of us it goes beyond that I mean I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.950

think<00:00:35.430> there's<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> bit<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.000> nostalgia<00:00:36.600> as

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
think there's a bit of a nostalgia as

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.270 
think there's a bit of a nostalgia as
something<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> did<00:00:37.860> when<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.070> were<00:00:38.250> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
something that you did when you were a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
something that you did when you were a
kid<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.570> something<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:39.899> continue

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
kid and it's something you just continue

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.520 
kid and it's something you just continue
to<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.790> became<00:00:42.090> an<00:00:42.300> adult<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:43.140> maybe

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
to do as you became an adult or maybe

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.010 
to do as you became an adult or maybe
you<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:45.120> competitive<00:00:45.840> reasons

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
