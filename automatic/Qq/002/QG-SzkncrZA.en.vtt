 welcome and exact new details 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.260
 our opinions that we rattle off every 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.500
 so much and that we share with you and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.370
 we would like there to be a participation 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.080
 active 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.539
 this Christmas also thanks to these 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.340
 in-depth arguments than many 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.439
 of us they asked us and then it was us 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.779
 let's remember these topics before it was 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 it is not the second channel they had a 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.199
 great success and lots of you there 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.900
 they asked us this is more stuff from 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.440
 well first we are here on the fact that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.149
 it says the surprise in a script 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.500
 even written the newspaper I see it 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.360
 well then we are where these 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.390
 measures are born can navigate 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.610
 on the internet maybe while we are inquiring 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.760
 on the news of the week the news 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.320
 the onle we discover this information 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.539
 incredible this absurd news and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.469
 look here never wrong that there is a sign of 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.809
 turn as at 9 not talk to us 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.449
 our pc with our north of lg 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.890
 they don't hurt anyone though in 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.839
 this case we are talking about addiction 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.240
 kennedy and games addiction way of 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.140
 see the kids you are independent of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.900
 games 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.390
 there is the dependence of video games yes 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.610
 can be so eye dependent 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.310
 to make it almost an illness 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.619
 according to some studies yes but let's start from 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 a rather ridiculous study or one 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.270
 I study Korean in everything but it is in 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:33.509
 question is you throw down a jumbo 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:36.399
 john is in the second this study 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.190
 some social conditions are enough 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.200
 according to you you would be more predisposed to 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.229
 become addicted to video games that 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.000
 this based on 650 4 analyzed cases 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.399
 so not pizza and figs ie neither 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.740
 analyzed a lot even though it was 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.429
 a statistical certainty maybe there is 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.910
 they would like more 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.649
 according to these studies to be able to be 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.460
 prepared to be employees of 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.429
 video games 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.820
 you must first be a teenager 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.869
 male in 8.2 percent of dogs has 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.880
 affixed goods shelter spray look 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.780
 unless these are the more likely you 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.000
 which are also two so do not do 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.130
 part of a family that is not extended 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.530
 emilia does not widen badly it is a family 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.870
 normal see this in 88 per 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.710
 hundred of cases analyzed without 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.440
 religion 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.190
 therefore the militiamen are more predisposed 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.780
 to be useful but to be gods 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.600
 firstborn therefore if you are i 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.290
 firstborn of your family 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.209
 arranged to tell about yours 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.520
 little brother to the fender and play 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.700
 all the time to bridge the oil I know 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.020
 nothing I am third is the only clear one 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.430
 the lap climber who set us up 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.470
 brother in the fridge that 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.989
 actually fond of the days 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.110
 but he never more teenager 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.200
 no he is not a bad teenager if to his brothers 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.520
 sisters this in 54 percent of cases 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.709
 so if you have brothers sisters 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.260
 be careful because most of it 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.400
 cases and deported because you are more 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.860
 video game employee because vi 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.830
 close this being to extrapolate i 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.010
 not for the cups so I decide in the minute 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.800
 my room I don't give a shit about it 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.510
 I play all the time to do that 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.580
 passionate we put ourselves in so many ne mer 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.350
 53.2 percent euro a working mother 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.010
 at home at home doing the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.870
 housewife 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.590
 so if your send the whole home 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.719
 of the previous speech to isolate oneself from 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.400
 our mother housewife could cede to 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:39.530
 desperate housewives and then then for the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.239
 room elevates all the things you do 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.659
 and not all spirit of whites 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.969
 nations if they form then has the 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.370
 sons showed that then the acts with 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.709
 four children of dessÃ¬ but it is not true e 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:58.519
 what more or less and possibly it was 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:00.469
 the homonymous certain being you are more 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.019
 predisposed to be employees in 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.959
 video games if we are more in one say 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.239
 relationship of closeness to parents 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.730
 described as normal that you will be i 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.790
 normal parents worry songs 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.940
 kind of normal normal channels don't 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.370
 normal ski mistral 34.900 so not 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.720
 so many series of normal parents 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.220
 you don't find so many alive because yes 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.810
 regimes that perhaps can become kings 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.360
 because my father too normal that 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.160
 disgust but I now lock myself in mine 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.710
 room and just video game game 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.009
 these basically the accusation and then if 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.870
 you are students and models asks the 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.090
 higher high school student on this 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.320
 is at 32.5 percent of the cases 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.150
 obviously this store 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.250
 nice a minchiata in the sense that it is 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.110
 true it was done widely in 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.210
 so they really believe bus 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.090
 have been spent have been released as 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.570
 they said they had a lot of money with them 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.030
 friends I do not know is a gentleman to the author 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.600
 in question and wants you to take in 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.760
 question this study to prevent the 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.110
 instead difference then parents if i 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.420
 your children respond to these 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.280
 features be careful i hope that 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.960
 could become junkies of 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.970
 video games has no regions 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.410
 well now we have all this e 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.630
 michele that they are to have charity there 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.700
 we enjoyed it but the part comes 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.040
 serious of this heading or can 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.290
 video game addiction exists 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.880
 yes yes the dependence on exists 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.520
 video games and there are also some 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.020
 cases we remember that Korean man and yes 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.150
 is forgotten in the eating area to his son 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.040
 three consecutive days and then children is 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.350
 died because he was playing league of 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.840
 legends dott.sa does not remind me now 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.030
 so in an internet cafe these are 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.830
 things very fat but not about 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.720
 only video games because all this 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.000
 which is used excessively 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.650
 it can be addictive but it is not the fault of the 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.480
 average in the evening in the guilt of what 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.000
 we are doing is true that nature 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.890
 human to also be food can 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.280
 also be any other activity 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.400
 that move deer 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.770
 the circus of all that is 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.560
 pleasant that stimulates us pleasure 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.530
 stimulates the most remote areas of the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.790
 our brain l and stimulates it can 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.800
 create dependency 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.810
 but obviously the purpose of this column 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.580
 to open a debate with us then 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.570
 we launch a topic we tell you 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.700
 briefly something he did 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.500
 real then we say ours finally 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.450
 we want to know your opinion 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.700
 according to him he wants the threshold beyond 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.840
 which can be defined as dependent on 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.040
 video games 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.020
 I mean we all mean we are 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.760
 video game enthusiasts us you 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.220
 surely we are all passions 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.750
 we play many hours sometimes I think but I'm 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.800
 playing so much but not a problem 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.240
 my 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.640
 actually I don't know it 's simply 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.280
 one moment the most beautiful game came out 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.410
 I've been waiting for a long time but it's not 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:52.030
 same date 90 hours yes but I don't know how I got it 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.950
 made the played 90 hours a day ie 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.639
 of content question now you have it from 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.200
 24 hours do not know do not know this 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.380
 reason is not good guys 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.390
 the word definitely does to you 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.250
 we think in the liturgy in the middle 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.110
 so use things in moderation 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.090
 but when you always want to overdo it 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.130
 avoid falling into the association anymore 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.870
 total let us know night if this 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.590
 I like the address book if you have suggestions 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.570
 if you have things to bbc they can 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.070
 to improve this section and vi 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.870
 look forward to the next one at the moment 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.950
 propose us that moments yourself 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.950
 we will reflect together
