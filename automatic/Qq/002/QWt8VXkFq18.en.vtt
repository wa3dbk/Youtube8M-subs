 continues the season of formula 1 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.939
 with the twelfth date run this 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.190
 Sunday at the circuit of 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.690
 spa-francorchamps in belgium on behalf of 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.670
 How easy it is for them to talk to me about the lion 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.279
 thanks for joining us in gray fish 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.410
 sebastian vettel seeks his victory 42 in 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.090
 the highest category and to get it 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.050
 will be exceeding in the third place of 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.630
 all the times 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.250
 ayrton senna da silva instead prince and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.710
 different ways of forecasting in the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.930
 formula one has resulted where is the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.390
 lewis hamilton option or Nico Rosberg 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.370
 phil which is any other pilot 11 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.230
 direct duel between two competitors of 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.989
 similar results and finally the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.519
 propositions with various options in 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.960
 As for the Great Prize of Belgium, 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.850
 Spa circuit should be noted that it is 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.949
 quite complex and is that there is usually 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.139
 rain and too much sun during all 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.120
 careers which requires a 

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:52.010
 good tire handling daniel ricciardo 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.079
 was the winner in the 2014 edition 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.210
 but do not rule out Finnish 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.829
 kimi raikkonen who won it already in 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.899
 four editions 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.519
 louis hamilton won in 2010 in 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.289
 spa-francorchamps but in three of the 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.269
 last four tests in this circuit 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.030
 has had to retire 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.090
 sebastian vettel is now at 41 points 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.970
 for the leadership of the cereal and to 21 of 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.140
 nico rosberg for the second location 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.000
 let's talk now about the football of the series 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.950
 because in Italy the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.350
 rubber and orientan and milan have the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.540
 highlight party of the week and it 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.220
 will face these two teams that in the 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.290
 last four have finished on the line 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.360
 of the losses the fiorentina sum three 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.979
 consecutive seasons ending in 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.930
 the fourth place of the general in the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.630
 series while the milan was the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.909
 third three years ago seventh two ago 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.039
 and last season ended in the 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.720
 tenth site however not all are 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.580
 bad news and that is that every time 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.649
 Visit the Artemio Franchi 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.869
 well has won in five of the past 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.149
 eight visitor commitments to the 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.009
 fiorentina with two draws and one solo 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.710
 triumph of the fiore that was the year 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.929
 passed by a score of 2 to 1 we give a 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.610
 step now england because in london 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.039
 is going to play on this day number 3 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.009
 another classic the arsenal receives the 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.080
 liverpool will be match 151 of by 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.239
 life in the premier league between both the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.489
 Arsenal takes the hand but also say 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.300
 that the average of so many historical between 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.090
 both when measured 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.370
 from 2.72 I go to the last four 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.580
 matches between arsenal and liverpool have 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.530
 been high webber with an average of 4.5 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.940

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.290

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.540
