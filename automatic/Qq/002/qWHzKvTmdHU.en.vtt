you could go in like a specific wager

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
you could go in like a specific wager
match<00:01:25.799> Lobby<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.670> it'd<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.180> fun

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
match Lobby and it'd just be so fun

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
match Lobby and it'd just be so fun
knowing<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.680> you're<00:01:28.860> playing<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.460> your

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
knowing that you're playing for your

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.190 
knowing that you're playing for your
precious<00:01:30.060> points<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> line<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
precious points on the line so

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.710 
precious points on the line so
definitely<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.329> would<00:01:33.540> just

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
definitely I think that this would just

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.050 
definitely I think that this would just
up<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.229> competition<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.460> amount<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
up the competition and up the amount of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.149 
up the competition and up the amount of
fun<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.479> people<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.259> these<00:01:37.680> lobbies

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
fun that people have in these lobbies

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.429 
fun that people have in these lobbies
because<00:01:38.579> what's<00:01:39.180> more<00:01:39.420> fun<00:01:39.720> than<00:01:39.750> knowing<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
because what's more fun than knowing you

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
because what's more fun than knowing you
put<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.770> points<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.250> someone<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:41.970> they

like<00:01:50.790> streams<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.750> other<00:01:51.960> stuff<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.500> that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
like streams and other stuff like that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800 
like streams and other stuff like that
because<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.700> makes<00:01:54.210> people<00:01:54.600> more

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

exciting<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.649> also<00:01:55.890> think<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.700> system

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
exciting and I also think little system

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.630 
exciting and I also think little system
like<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:57.479> are<00:01:57.780> kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.310> essential<00:01:59.310> for

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
like these are kind of essential for

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.810 
like these are kind of essential for
games<00:02:00.170> longevity<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.890> playing<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.610> game

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
games longevity because playing a game

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.060 
games longevity because playing a game
for<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> long<00:02:03.270> time<00:02:03.630> is

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
for a long time is

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.860 
for a long time is
be<00:02:04.159> hard<00:02:04.400> if<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.880> doesn't<00:02:05.150> have<00:02:05.270> stuff<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:05.659> keep

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
be hard if it doesn't have stuff to keep

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.499 
be hard if it doesn't have stuff to keep
it<00:02:06.020> back<00:02:06.260> on<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.800> game<00:02:07.040> for<00:02:07.670> long<00:02:08.030> periods<00:02:08.060> of

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
it back on the game for long periods of

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.470 
it back on the game for long periods of
time<00:02:08.630> so<00:02:09.280> adding<00:02:10.280> little<00:02:10.729> stuff<00:02:11.060> like<00:02:11.270> this

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
time so adding little stuff like this

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.430 
time so adding little stuff like this
would<00:02:11.750> definitely<00:02:11.930> be<00:02:12.459> some<00:02:13.459> pluses<00:02:13.970> for

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440
