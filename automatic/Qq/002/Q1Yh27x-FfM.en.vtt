edge of it on there so you can get a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.690 
edge of it on there so you can get a
closer<00:01:03.149> view<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.920> pretty<00:01:05.250> thick

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
closer view of it but it's pretty thick

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
closer view of it but it's pretty thick
on<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.880> edge<00:01:06.110> soon<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.530> right

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
on the edge soon as you can see right

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.530 
on the edge soon as you can see right
there<00:01:07.860> there's<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.159> quite<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> bit<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> lip<00:01:09.360> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
there there's a quite a bit of a lip of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
there there's a quite a bit of a lip of
it<00:01:09.860> which<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.950> pretty<00:01:11.010> nice<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> know<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it which is pretty nice so you know it's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.310 
it which is pretty nice so you know it's
really<00:01:12.180> protecting<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.780> screen<00:01:13.080> it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
really protecting your screen it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.670 
really protecting your screen it's
pretty<00:01:13.530> thick<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.210> for<00:01:15.210> being<00:01:15.360> 3995<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.290> think

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
pretty thick and for being 3995 I think

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.020 
pretty thick and for being 3995 I think
this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> definitely<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> reasonable<00:01:17.850> price

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this is definitely a reasonable price

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.219 
this is definitely a reasonable price
for<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.299> screen<00:01:18.479> particular<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> honestly
