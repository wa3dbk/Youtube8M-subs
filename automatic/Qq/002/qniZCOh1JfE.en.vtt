00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
against this team it's a it's a BPL team

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.810 
against this team it's a it's a BPL team
but<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.859> whole<00:00:16.949> lot<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.279> chemistry<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:17.730> it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
but not a whole lot of chemistry but it

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.099 
but not a whole lot of chemistry but it
does<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.119> some<00:00:18.270> decent<00:00:18.570> players<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.960> there

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
does have some decent players in there

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.480 
does have some decent players in there
but<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.289> doesn't<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:19.560> matter<00:00:19.770> because<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
but it doesn't really matter because the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.250 
but it doesn't really matter because the
game<00:00:20.640> didn't<00:00:20.880> last<00:00:21.029> very<00:00:21.180> long<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> started

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
game didn't last very long so I started

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.929 
game didn't last very long so I started
off<00:00:22.350> really<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> disconnection

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
off really well with a disconnection

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.460 
off really well with a disconnection
which<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.359> which<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> whole<00:00:24.990> lot<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.170> fun<00:00:25.350> but

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
which is which is a whole lot of fun but

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.839 
which is which is a whole lot of fun but
luckily<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.800> didn't<00:00:26.070> get<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.189> loss<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> I've

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
luckily I didn't get a loss for it I've

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.880 
luckily I didn't get a loss for it I've
decided<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.420> what<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:27.630> gonna<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.500> I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
decided that what I'm gonna do is if I

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.380 
decided that what I'm gonna do is if I
get<00:00:29.039> disconnected<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> game<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.179> gives

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
get disconnected in a game and it gives

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.420 
get disconnected in a game and it gives
me<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> loss<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.650> goes<00:00:31.769> down<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> game

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
me the loss then it goes down as a game

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.970 
me the loss then it goes down as a game
played<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.090> I'm<00:00:33.930> gonna<00:00:34.170> count<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.530> towards

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
played so I'm gonna count that towards

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.350 
played so I'm gonna count that towards
the<00:00:35.070> games<00:00:35.250> played<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:36.210> I've

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
chemistry in there i think i think was

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.279 
chemistry in there i think i think was
his<00:00:54.120> life<00:00:54.300> back<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:54.629> i'm<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.809> too<00:00:54.960> sure<00:00:54.989> but

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
his life back but i'm not too sure but

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.110 
his life back but i'm not too sure but
there<00:00:55.469> i<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> goal<00:00:56.190> true<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> Samoan<00:00:57.030> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880

scored<00:01:33.090> another<00:01:33.270> goal<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.750> PVR<00:01:34.110> didn't

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
scored another goal now my PVR didn't

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.679 
scored another goal now my PVR didn't
pick<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.890> which<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.430> am<00:01:35.759> worrying

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
pick it up which is really am worrying

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.090 
pick it up which is really am worrying
because<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.170> PVR<00:01:37.470> has<00:01:37.590> been<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:37.920> bit

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
because the PVR has been a little bit

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
because the PVR has been a little bit
weird<00:01:38.400> lately<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.750> kicked<00:01:39.960> off<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
weird lately but I got kicked off the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
weird lately but I got kicked off the
server<00:01:40.409> straight<00:01:40.920> afterwards<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> went<00:01:41.700> on

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
server straight afterwards and I went on

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.460 
server straight afterwards and I went on
to<00:01:41.970> Twitter<00:01:42.210> i<00:01:42.270> searched<00:01:42.630> fifa<00:01:43.079> ultimate<00:01:43.200> team

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
to Twitter i searched fifa ultimate team

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.310 
to Twitter i searched fifa ultimate team
servers<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.630> seemed<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.020> lot<00:01:46.200> of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
servers and and it seemed a lot of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.749 
servers and and it seemed a lot of
people<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.649> kicked<00:01:46.890> off<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> exact

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
people got kicked off at that exact

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.819 
people got kicked off at that exact
moment<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.360> nepenthez<00:01:48.960> did<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.380> well<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.799> i

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
moment i know nepenthez did as well so i

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.319 
moment i know nepenthez did as well so i
figured<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.399> down<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.790> servers<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
figured it was down to the servers and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.639 
figured it was down to the servers and
not<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:51.570> connection<00:01:51.990> which<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:52.350> ok<00:01:52.619> with

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
not my connection which I was ok with

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.920 
not my connection which I was ok with
and<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> did<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> last<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.689> even

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and but I did get the last for it even

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630 
and but I did get the last for it even
though<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.470> losing<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.950> wouldn't<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.460> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
though I was losing I wouldn't really I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.219 
though I was losing I wouldn't really I
don't<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.119> having<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> loss<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
don't like having the loss for it but I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.929 
don't like having the loss for it but I
think<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.530> will<00:01:58.829> quantify<00:01:59.159> all<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
think that will quantify all this at the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.310 
think that will quantify all this at the
end<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> series<00:02:00.420> anyway<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:00.990> Boyle

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
end of the series anyway because Boyle

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
end of the series anyway because Boyle
is<00:02:01.469> doing<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.799> lot<00:02:02.040> better<00:02:02.100> than<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.610> am<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.000> I

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
is doing a lot better than I am and I

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.510 
is doing a lot better than I am and I
don't<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.170> think<00:02:04.409> I'm<00:02:04.649> gonna<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.250> don't

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
don't really think I'm gonna I don't

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.740 
don't really think I'm gonna I don't
really<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:05.969> gonna<00:02:06.090> win<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> doesn't

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
really think I'm gonna win it doesn't

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.999 
really think I'm gonna win it doesn't
really<00:02:06.840> look<00:02:07.020> likely<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.530> came<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.799> against

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
really look likely but I came up against

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.979 
really look likely but I came up against
this<00:02:08.160> dude<00:02:08.340> next<00:02:08.520> who<00:02:08.640> had<00:02:08.759> 68<00:02:09.179> chemistry<00:02:09.720> like

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this dude next who had 68 chemistry like

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.869 
this dude next who had 68 chemistry like
he<00:02:10.470> had<00:02:10.649> everything<00:02:10.920> right<00:02:11.280> I'm<00:02:11.400> surprises

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
he had everything right I'm surprises

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.500 
he had everything right I'm surprises
chemistry<00:02:12.209> was<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.480> low<00:02:12.660> obviously<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.260> two

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
chemistry was so low obviously the two

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.789 
chemistry was so low obviously the two
Ron's<00:02:13.659> guys<00:02:13.870> are<00:02:14.049> going<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.379> lot<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.680> do

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
Ron's guys are going to have a lot to do

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.320 
Ron's guys are going to have a lot to do
with<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.099> but<00:02:15.310> still<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:15.730> was<00:02:15.849> weird<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
with that but still it was weird and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.089 
with that but still it was weird and
again<00:02:16.629> we<00:02:16.810> get<00:02:16.930> another<00:02:17.230> disconnection<00:02:17.980> now<00:02:18.069> I

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
again we get another disconnection now I

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.589 
again we get another disconnection now I
know<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.430> must<00:02:18.640> be<00:02:18.760> incredibly<00:02:19.209> frustrating

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
know this must be incredibly frustrating

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.600 
know this must be incredibly frustrating
for<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.230> watching<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:20.769> one<00:02:21.310> thing<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.549> will

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
for you watching but one thing I will

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.039 
for you watching but one thing I will
say<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.879> that<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.120> didn't<00:02:22.390> get<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> loss<00:02:22.689> for<00:02:22.930> this

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
say is that I didn't get a loss for this

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.259 
say is that I didn't get a loss for this
game<00:02:23.230> either<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.799> did<00:02:24.549> get<00:02:24.730> kicked<00:02:24.970> off<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
game either I did get kicked off the

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.910 
game either I did get kicked off the
servers<00:02:25.659> though<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.230> wasn't<00:02:26.409> able<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.799> play

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
servers though and I wasn't able to play

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.130 
servers though and I wasn't able to play
again<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.670> had<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.209> split<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.750> into<00:02:29.019> two

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
again so I I had to split this into two

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.380 
again so I I had to split this into two
separate<00:02:29.620> days<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:30.220> gameplay<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
separate days of gameplay and the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.940 
separate days of gameplay and the
service<00:02:31.720> have<00:02:31.840> been<00:02:31.989> down<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.170> lot<00:02:32.470> lately<00:02:32.680> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
service have been down a lot lately and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.319 
service have been down a lot lately and
it's<00:02:33.129> really<00:02:33.280> annoying<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:33.849> this<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.269> the

how<00:04:52.690> like<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.560> know<00:04:53.680> when<00:04:53.800> FIFA<00:04:53.980> get<00:04:54.250> goes<00:04:54.490> bad

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
how like you know when FIFA get goes bad

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.950 
how like you know when FIFA get goes bad
it's<00:04:55.150> kind<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.390> like<00:04:55.480> when<00:04:55.600> you're<00:04:55.720> on<00:04:55.810> call

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960

the duty you're playing bad so you

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.350 
the duty you're playing bad so you
change<00:04:57.430> your<00:04:57.580> class<00:04:57.760> in<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.090> middle<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.300> a

a<00:05:25.390> really<00:05:25.660> unfortunate<00:05:25.900> game<00:05:26.620> for<00:05:26.830> me<00:05:26.919> because

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
a really unfortunate game for me because

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.370 
a really unfortunate game for me because
like<00:05:27.460> had<00:05:28.060> I<00:05:28.090> got<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.510> little<00:05:28.750> bit<00:05:28.960> more<00:05:29.110> pace

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
like had I got that little bit more pace

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.840 
like had I got that little bit more pace
injection<00:05:29.919> you<00:05:30.010> know<00:05:30.100> I've<00:05:30.250> got<00:05:30.400> a<00:05:30.430> su<00:05:30.700> and

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
injection you know I've got a su and

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.040 
injection you know I've got a su and
I've<00:05:30.910> got<00:05:31.030> zarate<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.630> that's<00:05:31.780> pretty<00:05:31.930> much

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
I've got zarate and that's pretty much

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.300 
I've got zarate and that's pretty much
it<00:05:32.169> for<00:05:32.320> me<00:05:32.560> like<00:05:32.740> I<00:05:32.830> don't<00:05:32.890> have<00:05:33.040> anything

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
it for me like I don't have anything

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.830 
it for me like I don't have anything
else<00:05:33.550> but<00:05:33.669> I<00:05:33.729> think<00:05:33.970> if<00:05:34.090> i<00:05:34.180> had<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.360> little<00:05:34.660> bit

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
else but I think if i had a little bit

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.090 
else but I think if i had a little bit
more<00:05:34.990> pace<00:05:35.229> i<00:05:35.410> could<00:05:35.620> have<00:05:35.710> done<00:05:35.740> something

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
more pace i could have done something

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.590 
more pace i could have done something
with<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.460> game<00:05:36.610> i<00:05:36.640> wasn't<00:05:37.150> finishing<00:05:37.479> my

its<00:05:46.090> way<00:05:46.180> into<00:05:46.270> zarate<00:05:46.780> who<00:05:47.020> built<00:05:47.229> it<00:05:47.350> into

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
its way into zarate who built it into

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.469 
its way into zarate who built it into
the<00:05:47.680> net<00:05:47.830> i<00:05:48.040> had<00:05:48.370> numerous<00:05:48.880> chances<00:05:49.120> that<00:05:49.419> i

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
the net i had numerous chances that i

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.000 
the net i had numerous chances that i
just<00:05:49.570> didn't<00:05:50.020> take<00:05:50.169> because<00:05:50.380> quite<00:05:50.620> frankly<00:05:50.680> I

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
just didn't take because quite frankly I

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.090 
just didn't take because quite frankly I
wasn't<00:05:51.280> really<00:05:51.640> playing<00:05:51.790> that<00:05:52.090> good<00:05:52.330> and

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
wasn't really playing that good and

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.440 
wasn't really playing that good and
that's<00:05:54.100> how<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.280> game<00:05:54.460> ended<00:05:54.790> at<00:05:54.910> 21<00:05:55.270> but<00:05:55.419> I

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
that's how the game ended at 21 but I

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.490 
that's how the game ended at 21 but I
think<00:05:55.690> if<00:05:55.810> you<00:05:55.900> have<00:05:55.990> a<00:05:56.020> look<00:05:56.169> at<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.350> match

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
think if you have a look at the match

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.719 
think if you have a look at the match
details<00:05:56.740> you'll<00:05:57.070> understand<00:05:57.490> where<00:05:57.640> I'm

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
details you'll understand where I'm

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.190 
details you'll understand where I'm
coming<00:05:57.760> from<00:05:58.030> where<00:05:58.330> i<00:05:58.360> think<00:05:58.450> i<00:05:58.720> was<00:05:58.810> a<00:05:58.870> little

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
coming from where i think i was a little

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.780 
coming from where i think i was a little
bit<00:05:59.410> hard<00:05:59.590> done<00:05:59.800> by<00:05:59.830> it's<00:06:00.490> kind<00:06:00.729> of

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
bit hard done by it's kind of

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.890 
bit hard done by it's kind of
frustrating<00:06:00.940> playing<00:06:01.479> with<00:06:01.600> this<00:06:01.720> team

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
frustrating playing with this team

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.390 
frustrating playing with this team

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
because i often feel like the game is

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.100 
because i often feel like the game is
fucking<00:06:03.729> me<00:06:04.000> over<00:06:04.030> but<00:06:04.390> then<00:06:04.540> i<00:06:04.630> understand
