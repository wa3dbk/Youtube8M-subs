00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:07.110
 continuing the theme of driving pleasure combined with low emissions of 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.179
 co2 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.070
 let's try 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.419
 the alpha 159 equipped with the new 1750 turbo engine 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.720
 direct injection petrol 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.150
 chez with sheets 189 large says 2 measured in the site in the community 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.039
 European standardized for all cars is positioned tim this area 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.380
 of the diagram two times time flows the time needed to scroll 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.879
 our test path 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.010
 compared to all the other parties we have found 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.450
 so how do you see an excellent location because on the lower part 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.870
 the respect to the row in the chianti thanks in fact has the exceptional qualities. 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 engine to the weight reduction of the car this was achieved 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.520
 result that I told you that there will be the car we will try in the 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.160
 understanding and a toy runway 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.880
 if with its 75 kilometers to date it represents the most trolling round 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 extended worldwide motorists 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.680
 for all modern engines this 1750 turbo petrol mounted on the alfa 159 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.210
 it is the most modern indeed in the latest arrival 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.930
 let's open up that poverty to see the technology of this engine 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.990
 here in the street computer reported hotmail the original heat of the whole engine yes 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.320
 see he has an engine 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.499
 a supercharged fact here you see the group trouble part 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.479
 and is a supercharged petrol direct injection direct injection 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.799
 grace drawn from the chin that operates in the chamber due to the evaporation of the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.179
 fuel injected directly into the room goes perfectly with the 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.640
 needs of the supercharged engine 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.990
 and therefore this falls into what is the category of engines as I told you 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.660
 Modern petrol turbo downtime starts live let's see some in 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.859
 details 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:22.009
 and this is the overhead part in which the components of were inserted 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.379
 direct direction hunger for you pump 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.229
 hey solenoids to make the variable phasing therefore a single body 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.489
 which collects all these earth elements to achieve the objectives of 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.609
 weight see lay-out 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.679
 here you see the components of the direct injection with injectors 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.340
 to many out to get an optimal spray 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.769
 feast of must pointed ears wing 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.249
 benefited from many studies of many earth experiments 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:55.429
 improve the performance of the ducts to the maximum 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.719
 which detail suction duct 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.139
 the exhaust valve is a hydraulic tappet which you said one of the 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.529
 examples of fulvio dynamic spelling alerts that show how the 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:12.619
 duct has been made so as to favor the field deaths to which it gave 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.729
 the air speed who enters the site as a deadline 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.319
 first act of zabotto 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.589
 it speeds up the combustion and therefore at the end a million the ventimiglia 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.369
 and in fact the combustion chamber as you see 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:29.759
 presents a whole TV series 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.309
 appendices earth well 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.370
 reduce the compressive force in fact the ailments engine 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.060
 compression ratio 9, 5 who has a very high value for an engine 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.769
 melted 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.340
 but on the other hand it is a value which then improves all the conditions of 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.849
 engine operation 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.339
 damn guns with the hyena chamber 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.679
 the fuel is injected with homogeneous definition 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:59.699
 the exhaust manifold of new element that has been subjected to 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.929
 long optimization studies 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.100
 so as to get the good guys and the bad guys 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.390
 claro the optimal leini steady behavior of the single scrollable e 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.850
 transient optimal behaviors of psychological films 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:20.269
 fifa see again. a wilfrid study and computational dynamics the fact 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.409
 precisely to define this sporting geometry 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.659
 engine that starts the 200 horsepower and 5500 rpm sync 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.249
 and 360 - - 1400 rounds 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:37.879
 these two numbers give an elasticity of five, 54 that the affective value 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:42.129
 other than we have adults found in the engines we examined 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.830
 with a specific power of 114, 8 riders bologna trophy 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.809
 that you can easily 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.359
 compare to the competition and tell me that this is a decidedly photo engine 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.830
 but the last data it gives him 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.900
 the sports size of this 1007 50 is the product between the piemme and the 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.999
 average piston speed at maximum power 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.330
 I sell 272 mood then 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.520
 near the formula 1 engines a decade ago 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.449
 livescore 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.309
 six 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.800
 engine performance is a classic test 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.050
 acceleration 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.339
 thanks Rome 100 kilometers per hour 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.339
 with the departure 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.930
 180 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.740
 davarda 100 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.650
 monza 8 27 seconds forever as the best actor 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:57.710
 and now let's try dexter acceleration back to speed 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.479
 maxim 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.490
 let's start from a standstill with the use of weather debris to the end to see 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.389
 all the power editing
