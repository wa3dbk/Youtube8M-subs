00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.480 
little palette and I think they did a
really<00:00:27.599> nice<00:00:27.810> job<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.439> packaging<00:00:29.039> here

reasonably well I pulled back here so

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
reasonably well I pulled back here so
you<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> light<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.740> more<00:01:19.970> so

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you get the light a little bit more so

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.399 
you get the light a little bit more so

as you can see they all have a quite a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.730 
as you can see they all have a quite a
bit<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> shimmer<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.270> would<00:01:24.479> say<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
bit of shimmer but I would say that this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
bit of shimmer but I would say that this
green<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.060> which<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.479> intended<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.020> be

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
green here is which is intended to be

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.740 
green here is which is intended to be
kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> main<00:01:28.979> lid<00:01:29.280> shade<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.820> definitely

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
kind of the main lid shade is definitely

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
kind of the main lid shade is definitely
the<00:01:30.930> most<00:01:31.170> sparkly<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.400> has<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> few

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the most sparkly it actually has a few

the most sparkly it actually has a few
sort<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> glitter<00:01:34.290> particles<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.430> it's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
sort of glitter particles in it and it's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.149 
sort of glitter particles in it and it's
the<00:01:35.640> most<00:01:35.820> highly<00:01:36.150> reflective<00:01:36.450> whereas<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the most highly reflective whereas you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.590 
the most highly reflective whereas you
know<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.970> almost<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.479> a

crazy about I always thought the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.770 
crazy about I always thought the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
pigmentation was a bit lacking with

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.960 
pigmentation was a bit lacking with
these<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:07.439> they've<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:07.979> improved<00:02:08.220> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
these I think they've really improved a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.390 
these I think they've really improved a
lot<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.390> their<00:02:09.720> formula<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.560> wouldn't<00:02:10.860> say<00:02:10.950> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
lot on their formula I wouldn't say that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
lot on their formula I wouldn't say that
they<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.580> absolutely<00:02:12.239> amazed

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319

best in terms of the quality of the
pigmentation<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.510> mean<00:02:42.659> I<00:02:42.840> really<00:02:43.139> was<00:02:43.319> able<00:02:43.499> to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
pigmentation I mean I really was able to

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.580 
pigmentation I mean I really was able to
just<00:02:44.219> kind<00:02:44.939> of<00:02:44.969> swipe<00:02:45.239> those<00:02:45.510> once<00:02:46.109> or<00:02:46.469> twice

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
just kind of swipe those once or twice

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.879 
just kind of swipe those once or twice
and<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.159> really<00:02:47.579> really<00:02:47.730> nice<00:02:47.969> opaque<00:02:48.419> color

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
and get really really nice opaque color

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.849 
and get really really nice opaque color
the<00:02:49.889> royal<00:02:50.159> blue<00:02:50.719> took<00:02:51.719> a<00:02:51.750> lot<00:02:52.109> more<00:02:52.319> building

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
the royal blue took a lot more building

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.830 
the royal blue took a lot more building
up<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:54.510> get<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.989> nice<00:02:55.489> rich<00:02:56.489> color<00:02:56.540> although<00:02:57.540> I

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
up to get a nice rich color although I

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.899 
up to get a nice rich color although I
was<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.799> course<00:02:58.949> able<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.370> build<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.669> up<00:02:59.730> to

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
was of course able to build it up to

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.750 
was of course able to build it up to
really<00:03:00.389> really<00:03:00.510> nice<00:03:00.719> finish<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:02.370> um

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
really really nice finish and this um

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
really really nice finish and this um
kind<00:03:03.359> of<00:03:03.419> bright<00:03:03.780> emerald<00:03:04.019> green<00:03:04.469> here<00:03:04.709> was

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
kind of bright emerald green here was

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
kind of bright emerald green here was
the<00:03:05.280> most<00:03:05.639> difficult<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:08.069> get<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.699> kind<00:03:08.939> of

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
the most difficult to get this kind of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.270 
the most difficult to get this kind of
color<00:03:09.239> payoff<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.829> did<00:03:10.980> have<00:03:11.129> to

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
color payoff for I really did have to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.300 
color payoff for I really did have to
spend<00:03:11.549> some<00:03:11.760> time<00:03:12.000> building<00:03:12.449> it<00:03:12.599> up<00:03:12.980> but<00:03:13.980> again

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
spend some time building it up but again

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.280 
spend some time building it up but again
ultimately<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.849> was<00:03:15.030> able<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.329> achieve<00:03:15.629> fairly

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
ultimately I was able to achieve fairly

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.740 
ultimately I was able to achieve fairly
nice<00:03:16.439> results<00:03:16.919> and<00:03:17.069> actually<00:03:17.609> I<00:03:17.849> feel<00:03:18.479> like<00:03:18.569> if

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
nice results and actually I feel like if

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.099 
nice results and actually I feel like if
you<00:03:18.870> use<00:03:19.109> this<00:03:19.290> color<00:03:19.530> sheer<00:03:20.239> as<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.629> sort<00:03:22.079> of

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
you use this color sheer as it sort of

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.259 
you use this color sheer as it sort of
immediately<00:03:22.709> applies<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.400> does<00:03:23.579> also<00:03:23.819> look

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
immediately applies it does also look

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.460 
immediately applies it does also look
kind<00:03:24.509> of<00:03:24.599> nice<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:25.049> want<00:03:25.259> to<00:03:25.319> really

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
kind of nice if you want to really

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.559 
kind of nice if you want to really
settle<00:03:25.919> a<00:03:26.280> bit<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.299> green<00:03:28.879> so<00:03:29.879> overall<00:03:30.419> in

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
settle a bit of green so overall in

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.270 
settle a bit of green so overall in
terms<00:03:30.689> of<00:03:30.900> pigmentation<00:03:31.409> in<00:03:31.889> terms<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.159> the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
terms of pigmentation in terms of the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.039 
terms of pigmentation in terms of the
texture<00:03:32.759> of<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.030> shadows<00:03:33.329> as<00:03:33.540> well<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.750> was

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
texture of the shadows as well I was

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.020 
texture of the shadows as well I was
really<00:03:34.319> pleased<00:03:34.979> you<00:03:35.699> know<00:03:35.759> they<00:03:35.879> weren't

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
really pleased you know they weren't

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.330 
really pleased you know they weren't
chalky<00:03:36.419> or<00:03:36.870> powdery<00:03:37.650> at<00:03:37.799> all<00:03:37.919> they're<00:03:38.159> much

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
chalky or powdery at all they're much

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.599 
chalky or powdery at all they're much
more<00:03:38.459> creamy<00:03:38.849> than<00:03:39.180> um<00:03:40.159> loyal<00:03:41.159> eyeshadows<00:03:41.579> are

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
more creamy than um loyal eyeshadows are

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.330 
more creamy than um loyal eyeshadows are
used<00:03:41.879> before<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.269> been<00:03:42.389> kind<00:03:42.569> of<00:03:42.629> hard<00:03:43.340> like

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
used before have been kind of hard like

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.949 
used before have been kind of hard like
you<00:03:44.639> know<00:03:44.729> just<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.090> regular<00:03:45.509> permanent<00:03:45.689> line

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
you know just the regular permanent line

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.110 
you know just the regular permanent line
I<00:03:46.139> shadows<00:03:46.560> but<00:03:46.829> these<00:03:47.009> were<00:03:47.250> much<00:03:47.519> nicer<00:03:47.729> I

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
I shadows but these were much nicer I

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.240 
I shadows but these were much nicer I
will<00:03:48.780> say<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.259> these<00:03:49.500> were<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.949> found<00:03:50.099> a

will say that these were I found a

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.309 
will say that these were I found a
little<00:03:50.430> bit<00:03:50.609> more<00:03:50.759> difficult<00:03:50.939> to<00:03:51.239> blend<00:03:51.810> then

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
little bit more difficult to blend then

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.159 
little bit more difficult to blend then
say<00:03:52.889> you<00:03:53.790> know<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:53.909> high-end<00:03:54.419> shadow<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:55.049> an

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
say you know a high-end shadow like an

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.309 
say you know a high-end shadow like an
urban<00:03:55.439> decay<00:03:55.739> or<00:03:55.769> two<00:03:56.129> faced<00:03:56.340> shadow<00:03:57.319> but

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
urban decay or two faced shadow but

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
know it's a bit too much for me it's a

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.879 
know it's a bit too much for me it's a
bit<00:04:47.849> too<00:04:48.000> much<00:04:48.180> color<00:04:48.419> usually<00:04:48.840> if<00:04:49.319> I<00:04:49.409> go<00:04:49.620> for<00:04:49.860> a

shade<00:04:54.389> in<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.870> same<00:04:55.080> color<00:04:55.530> family

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
shade in the same color family

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.920 
shade in the same color family
personally<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.330> don't<00:04:57.389> think<00:04:57.509> I<00:04:57.659> would<00:04:57.780> wear

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
personally I don't think I would wear

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.249 
personally I don't think I would wear
emerald<00:04:58.379> green<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:59.180> you<00:05:00.180> know<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.539> know

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
emerald green and you know you know

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.519 
emerald green and you know you know
super<00:05:02.009> shimmery<00:05:02.219> royal<00:05:02.580> blue<00:05:03.050> at<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.289> same

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
super shimmery royal blue at the same

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.249 
super shimmery royal blue at the same
time<00:05:05.060> so<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.090> think<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.539> probably<00:05:06.750> for<00:05:07.139> me<00:05:07.229> I

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
time so I think I probably for me I

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.740 
time so I think I probably for me I
would<00:05:07.500> just<00:05:07.529> use<00:05:08.039> these<00:05:08.310> shadows<00:05:09.210> separately

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
would just use these shadows separately

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.309 
would just use these shadows separately
in<00:05:09.960> separate<00:05:10.259> looks<00:05:11.449> but<00:05:12.449> they<00:05:12.599> do<00:05:12.659> have<00:05:12.990> you

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
in separate looks but they do have you

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.869 
in separate looks but they do have you
know<00:05:13.349> on<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.830> back<00:05:14.009> a<00:05:14.039> nice<00:05:14.279> little<00:05:14.460> diagram

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
know on the back a nice little diagram

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.429 
know on the back a nice little diagram
that<00:05:15.000> gives<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.240> advice<00:05:15.389> and<00:05:15.779> if<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.110> want<00:05:16.289> to

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:16.439 
that gives you advice and if you want to

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.830 
that gives you advice and if you want to
wear<00:05:16.590> them<00:05:16.800> together<00:05:17.300> definitely<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.330> lot<00:05:18.689> of

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
wear them together definitely a lot of

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.869 
wear them together definitely a lot of
the<00:05:18.990> other<00:05:19.169> collections<00:05:19.800> have<00:05:20.129> neutrals<00:05:20.729> in

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
the other collections have neutrals in

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.550 
the other collections have neutrals in
them<00:05:21.120> they<00:05:21.719> would<00:05:21.870> be<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:21.990> lot<00:05:22.169> more<00:05:22.199> wearable

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
them they would be a lot more wearable

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.559 
them they would be a lot more wearable
for<00:05:23.009> those<00:05:23.159> of<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.460> guys<00:05:23.610> who<00:05:23.669> aren't<00:05:24.060> super

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
for those of you guys who aren't super

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.170 
for those of you guys who aren't super
crazy<00:05:24.750> about<00:05:25.050> really<00:05:25.409> bright<00:05:25.590> colors<00:05:26.150> also<00:05:27.150> I

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
crazy about really bright colors also I

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.959 
crazy about really bright colors also I
found<00:05:27.419> with<00:05:27.569> this<00:05:27.810> shade<00:05:28.580> what<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.610> really

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
found with this shade what I really

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.899 
found with this shade what I really
think<00:05:30.000> is<00:05:30.419> nice<00:05:30.659> because<00:05:31.440> this<00:05:31.909> shimmery

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
think is nice because this shimmery

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.939 
think is nice because this shimmery
prank<00:05:33.240> shade<00:05:33.479> is<00:05:33.659> so<00:05:33.930> opaque<00:05:34.409> I<00:05:34.620> think<00:05:34.800> that's

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
prank shade is so opaque I think that's

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.719 
prank shade is so opaque I think that's
absolutely<00:05:35.099> great<00:05:35.610> to<00:05:35.789> use<00:05:36.060> as<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.779> lid<00:05:37.259> color

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
absolutely great to use as a lid color

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.950 
absolutely great to use as a lid color
so<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:38.789> would<00:05:38.940> sort<00:05:39.120> of<00:05:39.240> put<00:05:39.389> this<00:05:39.509> on<00:05:39.659> the<00:05:39.750> lid

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
so I would sort of put this on the lid

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.860 
so I would sort of put this on the lid
and<00:05:40.169> maybe<00:05:40.349> use<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.949> dark<00:05:41.639> brown<00:05:41.909> from<00:05:42.479> another

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
and maybe use a dark brown from another

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.559 
and maybe use a dark brown from another
pallet<00:05:43.379> in<00:05:44.279> the<00:05:44.430> outer<00:05:44.610> corner<00:05:44.940> increase<00:05:45.330> and

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
pallet in the outer corner increase and

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.850 
pallet in the outer corner increase and
that<00:05:45.599> looks<00:05:45.870> really<00:05:46.319> really<00:05:46.529> pretty<00:05:46.710> it

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
that looks really really pretty it

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.040 
that looks really really pretty it
catches<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.279> light<00:05:47.430> really<00:05:47.909> nicely<00:05:48.210> really

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050
