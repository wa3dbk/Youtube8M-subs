00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
at what we're doing in class and you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.970 
at what we're doing in class and you
know<00:00:49.110> today<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:50.010> learned<00:00:50.250> about<00:00:51.980> doing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
know today we learned about doing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
know today we learned about doing
perspective<00:00:53.789> drawings<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.449> i<00:00:54.510> should<00:00:54.719> say

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
perspective drawings or i should say

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.389 
perspective drawings or i should say
last<00:00:55.199> class<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.770> learned<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:56.039> doing

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
last class you learned about doing

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.750 
last class you learned about doing
perspective<00:00:56.910> drawings<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.579> what<00:00:59.579> i'm<00:00:59.670> going

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
perspective drawings so what i'm going

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
perspective drawings so what i'm going
to<00:00:59.820> do<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.210> series<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> videos<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> will

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
to do is a series of videos that will

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
to do is a series of videos that will
take<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> step<00:01:02.160> by<00:01:02.190> step<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.149> create

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
take you step by step on how to create

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080 
take you step by step on how to create
perspective<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> know<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> foot<00:01:05.700> like

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
perspective and you know the foot like

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.429 
perspective and you know the foot like
the<00:01:06.270> certain<00:01:06.570> elements<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.320> i'll

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the certain elements of it and then i'll

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.670 
the certain elements of it and then i'll
get<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> more<00:01:07.860> advanced<00:01:08.189> stuff<00:01:08.369> too<00:01:08.700> so

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
get to more advanced stuff too so

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.050 
get to more advanced stuff too so
remember<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.430> class<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.850> need<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
remember this like in class you need a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.240 
remember this like in class you need a
ruler<00:01:12.600> i'm<00:01:12.810> using<00:01:13.320> an<00:01:13.439> architecture<00:01:14.010> scale

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
ruler i'm using an architecture scale

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.149 
ruler i'm using an architecture scale
right<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> ruler<00:01:15.840> will<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.979> then

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
right here but a ruler will do and then

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.190 
right here but a ruler will do and then
i<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.880> pencil<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:18.869> eraser

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
i have a pencil and you have your eraser

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
i have a pencil and you have your eraser
and<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> course<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.830> your<00:01:19.860> paper<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and of course you have your paper and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.170 
and of course you have your paper and
remember<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.400> perspective<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:24.060> you're

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
remember with perspective what you're

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.960 
remember with perspective what you're
going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.490> always<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
going to want to do is always have a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
going to want to do is always have a
vanishing<00:01:27.570> point<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.020> remember<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
vanishing point and remember that is the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
vanishing point and remember that is the
point<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.520> everything<00:01:30.060> seems<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.420> be

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
point which everything seems to be

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.620 
point which everything seems to be
vanishing<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.380> right<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.939> let's<00:01:33.150> say<00:01:33.420> it's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
vanishing to right so let's say it's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.370 
vanishing to right so let's say it's
right<00:01:34.189> here<00:01:35.299> that<00:01:36.299> means<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
right here that means that is going to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.109 
right here that means that is going to
be<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> line<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.100> no<00:01:38.310> matter<00:01:38.460> where<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.759> are

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
be the line that no matter where you are

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.520 
be the line that no matter where you are
remember<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.689> shape<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.049> draw<00:01:40.290> you're

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
remember what shape you draw you're

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.760 
remember what shape you draw you're
going<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.299> lines<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:43.290> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
going to have all of the lines go to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.910 
going to have all of the lines go to
this<00:01:43.890> point<00:01:44.250> ok<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.200> side<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.740> on

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
this point ok now what side of that's on

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.660 
this point ok now what side of that's on
so<00:01:47.220> let's<00:01:47.759> say<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> square<00:01:49.710> let's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
so let's say we just do a square let's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.420 
so let's say we just do a square let's
start<00:01:50.909> simple

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.670 

okay<00:01:55.930> you're<00:01:56.930> going<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.140> do<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.440> you're<00:01:57.560> going

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
okay you're going to do is you're going

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.700 
okay you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:57.800> look<00:01:58.190> at<00:01:58.370> sea<00:01:58.820> has<00:01:58.970> four<00:01:59.330> corners<00:01:59.750> each<00:02:00.470> of

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
to look at sea has four corners each of

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.080 
to look at sea has four corners each of
those<00:02:00.800> corners<00:02:01.340> you're<00:02:01.520> going<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.730> line<00:02:01.910> up

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
those corners you're going to line up

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.210 
those corners you're going to line up
with<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.570> vanishing<00:02:03.140> point<00:02:03.170> like<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.590> and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
with the vanishing point like this and

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:16.640 
with the vanishing point like this and
then<00:02:04.910> you're<00:02:05.000> going<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.150> draw<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:06.580> line

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.000 

that<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.489> all<00:02:17.700> there<00:02:18.329> is<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.689> it<00:02:18.720> super<00:02:19.680> super

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that is all there is to it super super

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.319 
that is all there is to it super super
easy<00:02:20.269> let's<00:02:21.269> try<00:02:21.420> another<00:02:21.569> one<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:27.000> try<00:02:27.209> and

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
easy let's try another one just try and

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.770 
easy let's try another one just try and
go<00:02:27.450> right

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.440 

so<00:02:30.380> we're<00:02:30.500> going<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.680> go<00:02:30.770> each<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.450> each

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
so we're going to go each one each

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.910 
so we're going to go each one each
corner<00:02:34.840> now<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:36.080> do<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.290> one<00:02:36.500> if<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.709> want

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
corner now I can do this one if I want

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.860 
corner now I can do this one if I want
to<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.430> spoil<00:02:37.850> I'll<00:02:38.030> do<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.270> on<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.510> one<00:02:38.720> too<00:02:38.810> so

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
to I spoil I'll do it on this one too so

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.449 
to I spoil I'll do it on this one too so
you<00:02:39.080> can<00:02:39.230> see<00:02:39.410> what<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.590> looks<00:02:39.620> like<00:02:42.310> see<00:02:43.310> now

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
you can see what it looks like see now

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.920 
you can see what it looks like see now
it<00:02:43.580> looks<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:43.819> three<00:02:44.120> dimensional<00:02:44.600> almost

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
it looks like three dimensional almost

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.080 
it looks like three dimensional almost
like<00:02:45.050> it's<00:02:45.200> see-through<00:02:45.380> right<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.880> is

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
like it's see-through right but that is

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.720 
like it's see-through right but that is
the<00:02:47.120> set<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.870> basics<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.730> perspective

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
the set is the basics of perspective

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.520 
the set is the basics of perspective
this<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.390> easiest<00:02:50.750> way<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.050> kind<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.410> get

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
this is the easiest way to kind of get

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.100 
this is the easiest way to kind of get
used<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:52.489> do<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:53.180> know<00:02:53.209> you<00:02:53.360> can<00:02:53.630> do<00:02:54.080> it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
used to do it you know you can do it

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.390 
used to do it you know you can do it
with<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> lot<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.590> shapes<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.220> don't<00:02:55.340> have

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
with a lot of shapes so you don't have

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.550 
with a lot of shapes so you don't have
to<00:02:55.580> do<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:55.910> ask<00:02:56.060> where<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.569> mean<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.380> do

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
to do just ask where I mean you can do

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.520 
to do just ask where I mean you can do
really<00:02:58.000> complex<00:03:00.130> shapes<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.520> let's<00:03:02.209> say

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
really complex shapes like let's say

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.570 
really complex shapes like let's say
that<00:03:04.180> well<00:03:05.180> could<00:03:05.660> take<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:07.280> whoop<00:03:08.030> whoop

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
that well could take this to whoop whoop

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.559 
that well could take this to whoop whoop
alright<00:03:10.580> do<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.630> here's<00:03:12.620> another<00:03:12.709> one

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
alright do that and here's another one

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.190 
alright do that and here's another one
here's<00:03:14.569> another<00:03:14.930> one<00:03:16.209> whoa<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.810> if<00:03:21.080> you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
here's another one whoa and if you

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.110 
here's another one whoa and if you
wanted<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.650> again<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.190> could<00:03:22.310> go<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.030> do

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
wanted to again you could go and do

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.520 
wanted to again you could go and do
these<00:03:23.239> back<00:03:23.510> one's<00:03:23.540> i'm<00:03:23.930> not<00:03:24.080> going<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.350> i<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
these back one's i'm not going to i just

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.440 
these back one's i'm not going to i just
want<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:24.860> keep<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.430> like<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:26.180> guys<00:03:26.269> see

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
want to keep it like that you guys see

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.340 
want to keep it like that you guys see
how<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.660> works<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:26.930> makes<00:03:27.019> it<00:03:27.200> look<00:03:27.319> like

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
how that works and makes it look like

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.620 
how that works and makes it look like
it's<00:03:27.470> black<00:03:28.069> coming<00:03:28.550> out<00:03:28.670> at<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.910> again<00:03:29.330> they

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
it's black coming out at you again they

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.360 
it's black coming out at you again they
all<00:03:29.660> go<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.319> vanishing<00:03:30.920> point<00:03:31.160> right

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
all go to that vanishing point right

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.449 
all go to that vanishing point right
here<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:32.390> great<00:03:33.260> way<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.500> practice<00:03:33.769> again<00:03:34.280> is

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
here so great way to practice again is

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:42.160 
here so great way to practice again is
to<00:03:34.489> just<00:03:34.820> take<00:03:35.120> random<00:03:35.600> shapes<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:42.049> know

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
to just take random shapes and you know

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.940 
to just take random shapes and you know
just<00:03:42.489> again<00:03:43.600> connect<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.630> corner<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.920> the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
just again connect the corner to the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.250 
just again connect the corner to the
vanishing<00:03:46.310> point<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:47.090> doesn't<00:03:47.870> matter<00:03:48.079> where

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
vanishing point it doesn't matter where

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.630 
vanishing point it doesn't matter where
it<00:03:48.350> is<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.650> can<00:03:48.739> be<00:03:48.829> anywhere<00:03:51.310> it's<00:03:52.310> advantage

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
it is it can be anywhere it's advantage

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.880 
it is it can be anywhere it's advantage
to<00:03:52.730> port<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.090> down<00:03:53.269> here<00:03:53.600> then<00:03:53.989> all<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.320> your

create kind of a neat effect mm-hmm and

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.260 
create kind of a neat effect mm-hmm and
let's<00:04:06.910> connect<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.030> one<00:04:08.209> here

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.750 

there<00:04:11.900> there's<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.590> basics<00:04:13.100> right<00:04:13.520> there

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
there there's the basics right there

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.190 
there there's the basics right there
basics<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.660> perspective<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:17.120> again<00:04:17.450> just<00:04:17.480> just

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
basics of perspective so again just just

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.110 
basics of perspective so again just just
you<00:04:18.620> know<00:04:18.709> try<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.010> out<00:04:19.160> experiment<00:04:19.760> you<00:04:19.910> just

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
you know try it out experiment you just

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.460 
you know try it out experiment you just
take<00:04:20.300> a<00:04:20.330> random<00:04:20.540> sheet<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:20.930> paper<00:04:21.020> maybe<00:04:21.290> you

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
take a random sheet of paper maybe you

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
right look at that look at that J looks

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.520 
right look at that look at that J looks
crazy<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:09.030> see<00:05:09.330> how<00:05:09.540> when<00:05:09.900> you're<00:05:10.020> moving<00:05:10.170> on

either<00:05:10.980> side<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.580> vanishing<00:05:11.970> point<00:05:13.970> your

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
either side of the vanishing point your

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:23.510 
either side of the vanishing point your
lines<00:05:15.210> change<00:05:15.360> direction

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.430 

just<00:05:24.180> connect<00:05:24.569> Connect<00:05:24.900> connect<00:05:25.169> connect

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
just connect Connect connect connect

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.230 
just connect Connect connect connect
connect<00:05:25.740> all<00:05:26.729> right<00:05:26.849> see<00:05:27.750> how<00:05:27.810> that's<00:05:28.020> working

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
connect all right see how that's working

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.200 
connect all right see how that's working
it's<00:05:30.240> quite<00:05:30.780> easy<00:05:31.550> once<00:05:32.550> you<00:05:32.639> get<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:32.849> hang<00:05:32.970> of

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
it's quite easy once you get the hang of

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:41.510 
it's quite easy once you get the hang of
it<00:05:38.930> that<00:05:39.930> looks<00:05:40.379> pretty<00:05:40.530> good<00:05:40.710> I<00:05:40.830> think<00:05:41.039> that's

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
it that looks pretty good I think that's

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.300 
it that looks pretty good I think that's
a<00:05:41.789> probably<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.360> best<00:05:42.539> thing<00:05:42.659> about<00:05:42.780> it<00:05:43.310> which

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
a probably the best thing about it which

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.619 
a probably the best thing about it which
you<00:05:44.400> can<00:05:44.520> just<00:05:44.699> keep<00:05:44.819> going<00:05:45.150> that<00:05:45.270> way<00:05:45.419> that's

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
you can just keep going that way that's

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.480 
you can just keep going that way that's
again<00:05:46.110> really<00:05:46.530> good<00:05:46.650> way<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.830> practice<00:05:46.979> is

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
again really good way to practice is

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.950 
again really good way to practice is
just<00:05:47.699> to<00:05:47.819> do<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:47.970> this<00:05:48.150> way<00:05:48.360> it's<00:05:48.750> pretty

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
just to do it this way it's pretty

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.499 
just to do it this way it's pretty
pretty<00:05:49.560> simple<00:05:49.949> technique<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:50.819> I'll<00:05:51.060> move<00:05:51.389> on

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
pretty simple technique so I'll move on

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.899 
pretty simple technique so I'll move on
to<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.810> next<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:52.710> next<00:05:52.740> phase<00:05:53.220> but<00:05:53.550> that's

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
to the next the next phase but that's

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.540 
to the next the next phase but that's
the<00:05:54.300> one<00:05:54.900> point<00:05:55.289> perspective<00:05:55.590> which<00:05:56.310> means

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
the one point perspective which means

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.580 
the one point perspective which means
there's<00:05:56.729> one<00:05:57.000> point<00:05:57.330> and<00:05:57.539> everything<00:05:58.199> goes<00:05:58.380> to

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
there's one point and everything goes to

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.490 
there's one point and everything goes to
that<00:05:58.710> one<00:05:58.979> point<00:05:59.449> next<00:06:00.449> I<00:06:00.659> will<00:06:01.020> give<00:06:01.319> you<00:06:01.470> a

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
that one point next I will give you a

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.309 
that one point next I will give you a
more<00:06:01.830> in-depth<00:06:02.220> look<00:06:02.310> at<00:06:02.900> two<00:06:03.900> point

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
more in-depth look at two point

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.880 
more in-depth look at two point
perspective<00:06:04.460> stay<00:06:05.460> tuned<00:06:05.639> for<00:06:05.849> that
