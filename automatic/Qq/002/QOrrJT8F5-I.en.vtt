00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
I remember watching one guest come right

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.520 
I remember watching one guest come right
out<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> lodge<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.970> he<00:01:30.210> actually<00:01:30.630> he<00:01:31.380> was

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
out to the lodge and he actually he was

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
out to the lodge and he actually he was
so<00:01:31.740> excited<00:01:32.220> he<00:01:32.250> started<00:01:32.820> hyperventilating

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so excited he started hyperventilating

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
so excited he started hyperventilating
and<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.290> his<00:01:34.500> knees<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.770> front<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and was like on his knees in front of a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
and was like on his knees in front of a
window<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.670> gripping<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> window<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
window like gripping the window so and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.050 
window like gripping the window so and
trying<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> breathe<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.579> he<00:01:38.670> didn't<00:01:38.909> want

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
trying to breathe because he didn't want

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
trying to breathe because he didn't want
to<00:01:39.119> miss<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> experience<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.290> he<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.799> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
to miss the experience but he was so so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.840 
to miss the experience but he was so so
I<00:01:44.780> think<00:01:45.780> probably<00:01:45.990> inventory<00:01:46.800> under<00:01:46.980> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
I think probably inventory under the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.160 
I think probably inventory under the
polar<00:01:48.120> bears<00:01:48.270> were<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.600> exciting<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.080> we

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
polar bears were so exciting that we

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.420 
polar bears were so exciting that we
probably<00:01:49.320> didn't<00:01:49.620> even<00:01:49.740> pay<00:01:49.890> attention<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
probably didn't even pay attention to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.700 
probably didn't even pay attention to
like<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.730> Arctic<00:01:50.940> hares<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.530> we<00:01:52.530> grew<00:01:52.680> up

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
like the Arctic hares and we grew up

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.440 
like the Arctic hares and we grew up
always<00:01:52.860> trying<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> catch<00:01:53.430> six<00:01:53.670> six<00:01:53.880> that's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
always trying to catch six six that's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.969 
always trying to catch six six that's
not<00:01:54.690> as<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> big<00:01:54.960> deal<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.260> used<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> even<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> six

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
not as a big deal we used to even a six

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.149 
not as a big deal we used to even a six
six<00:01:56.130> old<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:56.520> I'm<00:01:56.610> out<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> our<00:01:56.940> hand

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.230 

while<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.310> most<00:02:03.549> children<00:02:04.030> learn<00:02:04.210> about

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
while the most children learn about

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.969 
while the most children learn about
other<00:02:04.689> cultures<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.380> languages<00:02:05.770> through
