that I was surprised of is with the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.120 
that I was surprised of is with the

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
pedal is very close to the sidewall so

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.850 
pedal is very close to the sidewall so
you<00:04:04.400> do<00:04:04.790> kind<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.090> rub<00:04:05.330> your<00:04:05.600> foot<00:04:05.900> up<00:04:06.350> against

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860
