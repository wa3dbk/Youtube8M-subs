place and to secure it it has a built in
a<00:00:47.190> key<00:00:47.340> lock<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.510> our

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
a key lock to all right we have our

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.819 
a key lock to all right we have our
first<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:49.050> installed<00:00:49.410> give<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.739> idea

and install the second one let's give an
idea<00:00:53.430> how<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.879> gets<00:00:54.059> installed<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
idea how it gets installed on the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.990 
idea how it gets installed on the
vehicle<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> long<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> they

in case so I do is loosen this bolt up a
little<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.469> sort<00:01:01.949> slides<00:01:02.250> over<00:01:03.049> okay

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
little bit just sort slides over okay

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
little bit just sort slides over okay
and<00:01:04.320> slide<00:01:04.559> over<00:01:04.589> your<00:01:04.769> rail<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.240> push

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
it together and then just thread it back

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
it together and then just thread it back
together<00:01:07.970> just<00:01:08.970> enough<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> hold<00:01:09.390> everything

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
together just enough to hold everything

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.210 
together just enough to hold everything
in<00:01:09.869> place<00:01:09.930> don't<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.799> real<00:01:10.979> tight

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
in place don't have to be real tight

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.560 
in place don't have to be real tight
because<00:01:11.250> you'll<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> adjust<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> front

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
because you'll have to adjust it front

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
to rear as necessary and so have it even

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
to rear as necessary and so have it even
on<00:01:14.909> both<00:01:14.970> sides<00:01:15.150> once<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.380> side
