 x 415 radio and let's see how 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.300
 our initial configuration for the 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.840
 vertical paramento first let's 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.570
 our eyes from our phone 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.789
 how to turn on our bluetooth and what 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.220

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.699
 in control of x 4 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.110
 we do not select 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.980
 and let's hope that we bond 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.980
 where to link 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.829
 and it is not ours that is already 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.829

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.480
 how to write the letter 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.760
 We will also find that we can 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.360
 find by 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.060
 letters for a direct access to our 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.380
 contacts let's review our 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.620
 configuration to see if we can 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.680
 also transmit 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.570
 in the wings 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.610
 we see that our iphone is connected 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.590
 only by phone we will activate 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.830
 the audio box 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.620

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.790

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 let's find something on youtube 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.399
 and we are going to select 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.399
 but so that we 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.840
 but all the content 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.650
 now 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.610
