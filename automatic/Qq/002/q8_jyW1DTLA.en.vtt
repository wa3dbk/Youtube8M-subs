00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
because it shows map weirdness and me

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.209 
because it shows map weirdness and me
making<00:00:54.899> smart<00:00:55.230> decisions<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.190> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
making smart decisions like this one I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
making smart decisions like this one I
can<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.730> confused<00:00:56.850> pick<00:00:57.780> him<00:00:57.870> up

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
can just got confused pick him up

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
can just got confused pick him up
through<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> door<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.980> seen<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> steamy

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
through the door and I seen a steamy

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
through the door and I seen a steamy
spoiling<00:01:00.149> through<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> back<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.809> instead<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
spoiling through the back so instead of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
spoiling through the back so instead of
challenging<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.829> head<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.699> able<00:01:02.940> to
