in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.340> desert<00:01:29.610> quite<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.140> run<00:01:31.590> my

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
in the desert quite a bit so I run my

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.760 
in the desert quite a bit so I run my
air<00:01:31.920> conditioner<00:01:32.430> runs<00:01:32.700> off<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> 100<00:01:33.509> watts

which<00:01:34.770> my<00:01:35.130> power<00:01:35.430> inverter<00:01:35.880> will<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.840> out

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
which my power inverter will put out

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.980 
which my power inverter will put out
very<00:01:37.680> easily<00:01:38.000> it's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.119> thousand<00:01:39.630> watt<00:01:39.750> power

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
very easily it's a thousand watt power
