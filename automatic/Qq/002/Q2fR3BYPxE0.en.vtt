00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
hey what's up guys it's xjawz and this

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.380 
hey what's up guys it's xjawz and this
is<00:00:18.860> a<00:00:18.890> dual<00:00:19.160> commentary<00:00:19.580> I<00:00:19.849> guess<00:00:20.090> on<00:00:20.360> a

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
is a dual commentary I guess on a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.570 
is a dual commentary I guess on a
sabotage<00:00:21.110> match<00:00:21.320> I<00:00:21.500> got<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:22.279> I've<00:00:22.369> never

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
sabotage match I got and I've never

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.760 
sabotage match I got and I've never
uploaded<00:00:23.000> a<00:00:23.060> sabotage<00:00:23.480> before<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.110> here's<00:00:24.619> my

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
uploaded a sabotage before and here's my

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.069 
uploaded a sabotage before and here's my
friend<00:00:25.040> Ryan<00:00:25.220> he's<00:00:25.640> gonna<00:00:25.759> explain<00:00:26.390> what

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
friend Ryan he's gonna explain what

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
sabotage is where you are there's a

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.430 
sabotage is where you are there's a
neutral<00:00:44.600> bomb<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:44.960> middle<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.350> both

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
neutral bomb in the middle and both

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.020 
neutral bomb in the middle and both
teams<00:00:45.649> of<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.950> Tramp<00:00:46.160> planet<00:00:46.550> on<00:00:46.730> the

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
teams of the Tramp planet on the

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.799 
teams of the Tramp planet on the
opposing<00:00:48.429> targets<00:00:49.429> and<00:00:49.730> I'm<00:00:50.390> gonna<00:00:50.600> be<00:00:50.690> using

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
opposing targets and I'm gonna be using

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.529 
opposing targets and I'm gonna be using
the<00:00:51.050> FAL<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.800> foul<00:00:52.129> I<00:00:52.429> believe<00:00:52.489> Ryan<00:00:53.300> with

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
the FAL the foul I believe Ryan with

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.270 
the FAL the foul I believe Ryan with
supreme<00:00:53.780> that's<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.649> correct<00:00:54.980> pronunciation

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
supreme that's the correct pronunciation

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.259 
supreme that's the correct pronunciation
on<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:55.879> yeah<00:00:56.659> actually<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.499> foul<00:00:58.269> just

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
on that yeah actually the foul just

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.180 
on that yeah actually the foul just
checking<00:00:59.449> yes<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:00.499> I'm<00:01:00.589> using<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.920> foul<00:01:01.129> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
checking yes so I'm using the foul the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.610 
checking yes so I'm using the foul the
holographic<00:01:01.909> sight<00:01:02.120> which<00:01:03.109> is<00:01:03.140> more<00:01:03.440> or<00:01:03.499> less

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
holographic sight which is more or less

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.700 
holographic sight which is more or less
the<00:01:04.540> they're<00:01:05.540> called<00:01:05.750> ADA<00:01:05.930> 4<00:01:06.050> equivalent<00:01:06.500> of<00:01:06.620> a

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
the they're called ADA 4 equivalent of a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.710 
the they're called ADA 4 equivalent of a
g3<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:10.090> actually<00:01:11.090> this<00:01:11.180> is<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.330> holographic

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
g3 and actually this is a holographic

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.200 
g3 and actually this is a holographic
sight<00:01:12.140> they're<00:01:12.500> very<00:01:12.710> similar<00:01:12.979> but<00:01:13.370> this<00:01:14.030> is<00:01:14.180> a

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
sight they're very similar but this is a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.560 
sight they're very similar but this is a
holographic<00:01:14.690> sight<00:01:15.670> yeah<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:17.120> was<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.360> kill

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
holographic sight yeah that was to kill

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.830 
holographic sight yeah that was to kill
spikey<00:01:18.020> Ryan<00:01:18.579> but<00:01:19.579> this<00:01:20.329> is<00:01:20.420> basically<00:01:20.719> the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
spikey Ryan but this is basically the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.480 
spikey Ryan but this is basically the
equivalent<00:01:21.079> of<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.409> g3<00:01:21.799> even<00:01:21.979> called<00:01:22.159> it<00:01:22.280> for

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
equivalent of the g3 even called it for

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.359 
equivalent of the g3 even called it for
a<00:01:22.520> single<00:01:22.909> shot<00:01:23.090> two<00:01:23.899> shot<00:01:24.140> kills<00:01:24.409> you<00:01:25.159> can't

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
a single shot two shot kills you can't

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.520 
a single shot two shot kills you can't
even<00:01:25.490> get<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:25.610> headshot<00:01:25.850> with<00:01:26.090> this<00:01:26.240> gun<00:01:26.530> like

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
even get a headshot with this gun like

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.469 
even get a headshot with this gun like
you<00:01:27.649> can't<00:01:27.860> one<00:01:28.219> shot<00:01:28.670> headshot<00:01:29.149> which<00:01:29.360> is

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
you can't one shot headshot which is

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.660 
you can't one shot headshot which is
pretty<00:01:29.659> dumb<00:01:29.840> but<00:01:30.280> as<00:01:31.280> you're<00:01:31.399> gonna<00:01:31.490> see<00:01:31.579> I

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
pretty dumb but as you're gonna see I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.100 
pretty dumb but as you're gonna see I
don't<00:01:31.939> really<00:01:32.060> have<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.240> trigger<00:01:32.509> finger<00:01:32.659> do<00:01:33.079> I

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
don't really have a trigger finger do I

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.740 
don't really have a trigger finger do I
Ryan<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:34.549> not<00:01:34.729> have<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.880> trigger<00:01:35.240> finger

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
Ryan you not have a trigger finger

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.929 
Ryan you not have a trigger finger
yeah<00:01:36.740> I'm<00:01:36.920> not<00:01:37.100> really<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.369> fast<00:01:37.700> on<00:01:37.880> the

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
yeah I'm not really a fast on the

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.120 
yeah I'm not really a fast on the
trigger<00:01:38.149> so<00:01:38.659> pretty<00:01:39.469> much<00:01:39.590> anybody<00:01:39.799> can<00:01:40.009> use

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
trigger so pretty much anybody can use

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.560 
trigger so pretty much anybody can use
this<00:01:40.250> gun<00:01:40.430> but<00:01:40.640> still<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:40.939> don't<00:01:41.090> recommend<00:01:41.509> you

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
this gun but still I don't recommend you

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.139 
this gun but still I don't recommend you
use<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:41.869> because<00:01:41.960> it's<00:01:42.170> not<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.320> great<00:01:43.149> but

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
use it because it's not that great but

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.349 
use it because it's not that great but
yeah<00:01:45.079> no<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:45.859> not<00:01:45.979> overrated<00:01:46.579> in<00:01:46.969> fact<00:01:47.180> it's

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
yeah no it's not overrated in fact it's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.279 
yeah no it's not overrated in fact it's
underrated<00:01:47.719> nobody<00:01:48.109> uses<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.469> gun<00:01:48.680> Ryan<00:01:48.920> I

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
underrated nobody uses this gun Ryan I

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.749 
underrated nobody uses this gun Ryan I
so<00:01:51.289> it's<00:01:51.409> not<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.890> worst<00:01:52.100> gun<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.609> game

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
so it's not the worst gun in the game

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.550 
so it's not the worst gun in the game
but<00:01:52.969> I<00:01:53.299> don't<00:01:53.780> think<00:01:53.899> really<00:01:54.140> enough<00:01:54.409> people

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
but I don't think really enough people

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.010 
but I don't think really enough people
use<00:01:54.799> this<00:01:54.950> alright<00:01:55.960> yeah<00:01:56.960> predator<00:01:57.380> missile

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
use this alright yeah predator missile

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.870 
use this alright yeah predator missile
yep<00:02:00.020> pretty<00:02:00.229> missile<00:02:00.649> fails<00:02:00.920> no<00:02:01.340> kills<00:02:01.640> off

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
yep pretty missile fails no kills off

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.539 
yep pretty missile fails no kills off
the<00:02:02.030> predator<00:02:02.950> kills<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.250> predator

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
the predator kills of the predator

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.380 
the predator kills of the predator
missile<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:06.640> yeah<00:02:07.640> hopefully<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.119> Harrier

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
missile and yeah hopefully the Harrier

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.830 
missile and yeah hopefully the Harrier
strikes<00:02:08.660> better<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:10.150> think<00:02:11.150> I'm<00:02:11.510> about<00:02:11.720> to

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
strikes better and I think I'm about to

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.480 
strikes better and I think I'm about to
get<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.020> Harrier<00:02:12.290> strike<00:02:12.530> after<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.010> fail<00:02:13.250> I

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
get the Harrier strike after that fail I

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
effective the first time I believe it

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.580

shot down right there

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.340 
shot down right there
and<00:04:05.640> here<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.000> got<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.329> bomb<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.780> even<00:04:07.230> though

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
and here I got the bomb and even though

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.199 
and here I got the bomb and even though
I<00:04:07.380> am<00:04:07.560> using<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.920> FAL<00:04:08.280> I'm<00:04:08.430> gonna<00:04:08.640> push<00:04:08.820> up<00:04:09.000> and

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
I am using the FAL I'm gonna push up and

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.599 
I am using the FAL I'm gonna push up and

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
try and get this bottom right there I

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.460

almost<00:04:11.730> got<00:04:11.910> killed<00:04:12.060> by<00:04:12.180> Mario<00:04:12.450> Dom<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:13.200> not

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
almost got killed by Mario Dom I do not

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.009 
almost got killed by Mario Dom I do not
think<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:14.100> know<00:04:14.450> other<00:04:15.450> people<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.810> said<00:04:15.959> this

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
think I know other people have said this

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.150 
think I know other people have said this
before<00:04:16.140> but<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.470> don't<00:04:16.650> even<00:04:16.739> think<00:04:16.979> I've<00:04:17.070> been

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
before but I don't even think I've been

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.710 
before but I don't even think I've been
killed<00:04:17.400> by<00:04:17.489> martyrdom<00:04:17.850> once<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.329> entire

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
killed by martyrdom once this entire

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.670 
killed by martyrdom once this entire
game<00:04:20.720> actually<00:04:21.720> think<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.109> was<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.410> second

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
game actually think that was a second

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.400 
game actually think that was a second
death<00:04:23.160> of<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.460> match<00:04:23.640> I'm<00:04:23.970> not<00:04:24.200> I'm<00:04:25.200> not<00:04:25.380> a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
death of the match I'm not I'm not a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.480 
death of the match I'm not I'm not a
hundred<00:04:25.560> percent<00:04:25.680> sure<00:04:25.919> but<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.190> think<00:04:26.430> I've

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
hundred percent sure but I think I've

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.409 
hundred percent sure but I think I've
died<00:04:26.640> twice<00:04:26.669> already

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
died twice already

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.529 
died twice already

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.379 
dition I believe I don't know I don't
know<00:04:38.039> exactly<00:04:38.400> how<00:04:38.490> well<00:04:38.789> it<00:04:38.940> would<00:04:39.060> work<00:04:39.120> if

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
know exactly how well it would work if

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.480 
know exactly how well it would work if
it<00:04:39.539> was<00:04:39.630> closed<00:04:39.900> either<00:04:40.110> but<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.070> don't<00:04:41.370> like

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
it was closed either but I don't like

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
that so that's pretty much the whole
