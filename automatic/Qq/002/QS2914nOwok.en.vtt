we<00:02:09.770> may<00:02:09.979> actually<00:02:10.220> get<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:11.060> token<00:02:20.650> 37<00:02:21.650> seconds

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
we may actually get a token 37 seconds

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.729 
we may actually get a token 37 seconds
the<00:02:22.160> pressures<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:23.380> No<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.410> we're<00:02:27.560> going<00:02:27.680> to

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
the pressures on No so we're going to

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.410 
the pressures on No so we're going to
get<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.920> token<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.580> that's<00:02:28.819> how<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.090> earn

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
get a token and that's how you earn

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
get a token and that's how you earn
tokens<00:02:29.720> without<00:02:30.290> having<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.799> buy<00:02:30.980> anything

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
tokens without having to buy anything

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.390 
tokens without having to buy anything
through<00:02:31.670> in-app<00:02:31.970> purchase<00:02:32.569> tap<00:02:33.170> ok<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.010> again

through in-app purchase tap ok and again

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.150 
through in-app purchase tap ok and again
the<00:02:34.790> hunt<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.239> on<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:36.140> we<00:02:36.319> can<00:02:36.500> actually<00:02:36.680> pull

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
the hunt is on so we can actually pull

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.759 
the hunt is on so we can actually pull
the<00:02:37.310> eggs<00:02:37.549> as<00:02:37.790> fast<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:38.239> we<00:02:38.269> can<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.620> can

the eggs as fast as we can and you can

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.009 
the eggs as fast as we can and you can
see<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:39.980> timers<00:02:40.580> there<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.269> trapping

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
see the timers there and it's trapping

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.830 
see the timers there and it's trapping
down<00:02:42.500> there<00:02:43.160> are<00:02:43.370> time<00:02:43.700> bonuses<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.510> find

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
down there are time bonuses you can find

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.820 
down there are time bonuses you can find
but<00:02:45.110> you're<00:02:45.230> going<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:45.799> some

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
good eyes again take a look at this and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.729 
good eyes again take a look at this and
see<00:02:49.370> now<00:02:50.060> I'll<00:02:50.239> show<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.630> what<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.200> look<00:02:51.440> want

see now I'll show you what the look want
what<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.250> reveal<00:02:53.120> does<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:54.410> actually<00:02:54.650> also

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
what the reveal does it actually also

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.520 
what the reveal does it actually also
shows<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.489> where<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.880> time<00:02:56.180> powerup<00:02:57.080> is

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
shows you where the time powerup is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.530 
shows you where the time powerup is
which<00:02:57.920> gave<00:02:58.190> us<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.430> little<00:02:58.580> extra<00:02:58.760> time<00:02:59.209> so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
which gave us a little extra time so

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.620 
which gave us a little extra time so
that<00:03:00.140> was<00:03:00.260> well<00:03:00.500> worth<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.739> three<00:03:01.459> tokens<00:03:02.209> but

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
that was well worth the three tokens but

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.750 
that was well worth the three tokens but
now<00:03:02.810> I'm<00:03:02.959> out<00:03:03.079> of<00:03:03.230> tokens<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.459> I'm<00:03:04.519> gonna<00:03:04.640> have

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
now I'm out of tokens so I'm gonna have

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.180 
now I'm out of tokens so I'm gonna have
to<00:03:04.910> operate<00:03:05.390> without<00:03:05.630> any<00:03:06.140> tokens<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.829> just

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
to operate without any tokens and just

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.390 
to operate without any tokens and just
my<00:03:07.489> eyeballs<00:03:08.200> it's<00:03:09.200> never<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.709> same<00:03:09.739> game

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
my eyeballs it's never the same game

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.849 
my eyeballs it's never the same game
twice<00:03:10.670> that's<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.870> cool<00:03:12.049> thing<00:03:12.079> about<00:03:12.380> the

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
twice that's the cool thing about the

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.310 
twice that's the cool thing about the
game<00:03:13.130> board<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.820> think<00:03:14.480> I'm<00:03:14.630> gonna<00:03:14.720> beat<00:03:15.079> my

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
game board I think I'm gonna beat my

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.880 
game board I think I'm gonna beat my
other<00:03:15.650> score<00:03:16.840> almost<00:03:17.840> out<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.079> time<00:03:18.410> it's

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
other score almost out of time it's

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.770 
other score almost out of time it's
dwindling<00:03:19.220> quickly

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.820 

more<00:03:25.770> time<00:03:26.069> more<00:03:26.610> time<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:28.110> we're<00:03:28.260> doing<00:03:28.410> quite

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
more time more time so we're doing quite

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.730 
more time more time so we're doing quite
well<00:03:29.300> x<00:03:30.300> popping<00:03:30.810> up<00:03:30.930> everywhere<00:03:31.260> we<00:03:31.590> could

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
well x popping up everywhere we could

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:41.990 
well x popping up everywhere we could
only<00:03:31.860> find<00:03:31.980> some<00:03:32.520> tokens<00:03:40.220> that's<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.520> looking

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
only find some tokens that's it looking

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.840 
only find some tokens that's it looking
like<00:03:42.030> we're<00:03:42.360> out<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.510> time<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.400> did<00:03:47.610> pretty

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
like we're out of time so we did pretty

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.900 
like we're out of time so we did pretty
good<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.930> got<00:03:49.110> one<00:03:49.380> token<00:03:49.770> increased<00:03:50.700> our

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
good you got one token increased our

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.910 
good you got one token increased our
score<00:03:51.450> because<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.780> says<00:03:52.020> new<00:03:52.260> high<00:03:52.410> score<00:03:52.770> we

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
score because it says new high score we

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.210 
score because it says new high score we
found<00:03:53.069> 30<00:03:53.520> eggs<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.720> replay<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.470> check

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
found 30 eggs you can replay this check

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.949

and you can see there it's blue so
there's<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.130> variety<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.790> egg<00:04:06.090> themes<00:04:06.570> tap<00:04:07.560> on

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
there's a variety of egg themes tap on

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.500 
there's a variety of egg themes tap on
here<00:04:08.190> again<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.760> you're<00:04:08.850> going<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.120> find<00:04:09.360> that
