00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
pull this we going without a little

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.109 
pull this we going without a little
you'll<00:01:28.350> notice<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.159> CPU<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> intel

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you'll notice there is the CPU the intel

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.440 
you'll notice there is the CPU the intel
core<00:01:30.390> duo<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.930> core<00:01:31.200> two<00:01:31.590> duo<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.939> remove<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
core duo or core two duo and remove it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.920 
core duo or core two duo and remove it
by<00:01:33.630> loosening<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.740> retaining<00:01:35.189> screw

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
by loosening one little retaining screw

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.539 
by loosening one little retaining screw
next<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.110> lift<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.530> cpu<00:01:38.130> from<00:01:38.400> your

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
next you can lift out the cpu from your

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
next you can lift out the cpu from your
system<00:01:39.350> lucy<00:01:40.350> bottom<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.070> intel

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
system lucy bottom this is the intel

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.770 
system lucy bottom this is the intel
core<00:01:42.710> 2<00:01:43.710> duo<00:01:43.770> chip

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.620 

very<00:01:50.780> very<00:01:51.050> nice<00:01:51.290> chip<00:01:52.870> so<00:01:53.870> there<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.200> go

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
very very nice chip so there you go

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.760 
very very nice chip so there you go
intel<00:01:56.630> core<00:01:56.870> 2<00:01:57.020> duo<00:01:57.050> so<00:01:57.380> what<00:01:57.500> we're<00:01:57.590> going<00:01:57.680> to

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
intel core 2 duo so what we're going to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.700 
intel core 2 duo so what we're going to
want<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.920> do<00:01:58.070> see<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:58.970> has<00:01:59.210> some<00:01:59.660> thermal<00:02:00.380> pad

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
want to do see that has some thermal pad

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.240 
want to do see that has some thermal pad
stuff<00:02:01.040> on<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:02.440> it's<00:02:03.440> not<00:02:03.530> very<00:02:03.620> nice<00:02:03.950> but

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
stuff on it it's not very nice but

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.060 
stuff on it it's not very nice but
that's<00:02:04.400> okay<00:02:05.590> we<00:02:06.590> install<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.790> chip<00:02:09.070> make

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
that's okay we install the chip make

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.270 
that's okay we install the chip make
sure<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.310> do<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:11.560> no<00:02:12.560> force<00:02:12.980> should<00:02:13.160> be

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
sure you do that no force should be

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.770 
sure you do that no force should be
applied<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.730> should<00:02:13.850> simply<00:02:14.150> drop<00:02:14.390> right<00:02:14.600> in

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
applied it should simply drop right in

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.500 
applied it should simply drop right in
and<00:02:15.560> then<00:02:15.710> tighten<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.250> screw<00:02:16.430> up<00:02:16.730> let's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
and then tighten that screw up let's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.980 
and then tighten that screw up let's
talk<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.900> now<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.310> next<00:02:19.340> step<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.330> get<00:02:20.840> your

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
talk it now the next step is to get your

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.570 
talk it now the next step is to get your
rubbing<00:02:21.260> alcohol<00:02:21.410> I'm<00:02:21.800> sorry<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.340> can't

rubbing alcohol I'm sorry that you can't

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.400 
rubbing alcohol I'm sorry that you can't
see<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:22.940> I'm<00:02:23.270> sure<00:02:23.540> that's<00:02:23.720> not<00:02:23.810> important

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
see it but I'm sure that's not important

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.750 
see it but I'm sure that's not important
just<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:26.450> know<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:27.040> shake<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.070> with<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.760 
the dye don't want to put new thermal
compound<00:02:43.780> over<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.990> old<00:02:45.140> crap<00:02:45.440> that's

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
compound over the old crap that's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.130 
compound over the old crap that's
correct<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.459> be<00:02:47.290> very<00:02:48.290> careful<00:02:48.650> cleaning<00:02:49.190> that

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
correct so be very careful cleaning that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.979 
correct so be very careful cleaning that
look<00:02:51.140> at<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.470> heat<00:02:51.890> sink<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.209> processor

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
look at the heat sink of the processor

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.050 
look at the heat sink of the processor
you're<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.130> want<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.280> remove<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.820> as

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
you're going to want to remove it as

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.199 
you're going to want to remove it as
well<00:02:56.300> so<00:02:57.340> once<00:02:58.340> we're<00:02:58.489> done<00:02:58.580> with<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.790> we

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
well so once we're done with that we

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.350 
well so once we're done with that we
will<00:02:59.239> continue<00:02:59.840> with<00:02:59.930> our<00:02:59.989> finished
