00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.529
 Of course, at the very beginning of a bus production is the order of each bus 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.980
 is an individual execution according to the wishes of the travel company 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.369
 out 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:17.109
 this is about the bus Thuringia the motorization design and equipment and 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.880
 many many details and so no bus is the other just the order 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 recorded is the bus can produce 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.129
 the production of the Oker Rossel unmarried in Mannheim there are the individual parts 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.990
 first of all in such grid boxes 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.990
 some are already prefabricated components 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.660
 From this at first sight confusing in the tangle of parts 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.450
 is going to an exact plan 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.860
 the production order at first the chassis of the bus together 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.300
 And so that everything fits properly, this happens on a chasm but on 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.160
 Device the idea is named after the famous Manhattan skyline 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 Here all parts are exactly aligned and welded 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.280
 every work step is documented in the production order and 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.170
 Petroplus vegetables through 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.319
 Confirmed with a stamp that guarantees quality from the beginning 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.600
 after the first hour of work, the chassis of the bus has contours 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510
 to get 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.450
 the next position here will be the first knots which will reinforce 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690
 attached with point welding equipment 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.870
 In addition, the contracts and the Moto partition are used as the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.360
 Name implies 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.580
 the engine from the cabin tract 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.280
 now the chassis is made with a template is measured on the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.670
 specified dimensions were met 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520
 minor adjustments are regulated 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 the flex 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.380
 next step is the sidewall fabrication 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.690
 also here put put the exact measurements 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.110
 and how the chassis gets out of a jumble of 4chan gates after a short time 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.980
 put a page 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.900
 As soon as this is done the control on dimensional stability is done here 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.459
 for example the entrance to the back pages for checked 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.459
 everything fits 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.509
 they question the two sides front rear and roof in this way 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.339
 finished 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.649
 they must be connected to a unity 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.649
 this happens in the so-called home 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.200
 here the components are welded afterwards until the first time 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 the outline of a bus recognizable 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.449
 other areas are used, for example, the front entry levels 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.139
 and checked again next to the measurements 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.929
 This is done with two templates one for the windshield's attacks 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.139
 the front door 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.319
 only so is guaranteed that disc and set for later exactly and the 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.319
 Gaps are correct 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.200
 it continues with the fairing, the sheets speak for the sides and 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.619
 the roof will be cut and shredded 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:17.439
 Carefully placed in the frame you carry them to the production line 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.999
 this prevents the sheets from clicking 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:27.139
 in the meantime, the frame is covered with double-sided adhesive tape 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.510
 then a working platform transports the sides to the correct height 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.499
 arrived at the top it is hung by 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:38.349
 Transport Frame then removes pages that understood 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.999
 the high train Spain is important so that the hang up since the plates stuck with 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.489
 the tape is connected and later no waves arise 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.489
 In addition, the sheets are spot welded 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.009
 similarly one goes with the umbrella organization 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.849
 The transport frame affects the height driven the pitch pulled out of the frame 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.119
 and upset 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:07.599
 the bodyshell is almost fierce from the assembly hall now it comes to the KTL 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.079
 the catholic pop painting 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.169
 Everything is prepared for the bus beard in the lab 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.289
 while the Catholic top nation has the advantage of the water associations paint 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.869
 evenly and safely into every corner of the body shell 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.060
 freshly washed, the bus sinks slowly into the baptismal font 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.409
 between the bus and the baptismal font with a maximum voltage of 400 volts 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.909
 In addition to water dissolved color particles are now from the big rain 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.909
 The bus full bath takes about twelve minutes 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.479
 after an hour at 180 degrees in dry open Borussia is not 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.159
 finished 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.169
 before it goes to the rail loading 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.379
 she still holds some plastic trim parts 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.819
 after that the final assembly is waiting for our bus over 200 kilometers from Taiwan 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.819
 away 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.909
 the body shell arrived in Poland overnight after the train 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.689
 already done priming 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.689
 will be the first to be complained of 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.449
 For this purpose, various preparatory work must be carried out in the 25,000 square meter hall 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.400
 respectively 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.470
 First, the bus is thoroughly cleaned 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.889
 Reason for the painting themed 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.029
 Then all welds with a duration elastic type sealant 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.849
 protected against corrosion 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.969
 And finally, the so-called flap assembly that is the bus 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.969
 receives all suitcases and engine compartment fold 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.409
 the DEG paint job starts with a Jetpack Sea filler then the first 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.800
 Paint applied 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.969
 at the entrance to the paint booth 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.039
 the bus goes through a June Simon loop 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.039
 they provide the static discharge 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.349
 Now the laser position will be measured accurately and then the painting will start 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:00.969
 he offered with work 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.489
 swept for the metals now a layer of clear coat is applied 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:09.109
 In total, with all Lazio processes about 200 kilograms of paint 

00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:10.080
 applied 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.250
 Of this, almost 100 kilos remain after drying 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:22.329
 the customer should paint special paint Dunja for five days 

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:24.360
 it can take longer 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.430
 then a so-called motif painting is made this will be the 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.719
 Colors in small quantities put together certain recipes 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.719
 even the finest airbrush technology is used here 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:40.019
 These motifs are made by specially qualified paint professionals 

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:40.719
 upset
