you know her child was a really great
boy<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.179> I<00:00:57.109> think<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.859> there's<00:00:58.579> there's<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
boy and I think this there's there's a

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.029 
boy and I think this there's there's a
heck<00:00:59.059> of<00:00:59.179> a<00:00:59.269> lot<00:00:59.389> of<00:00:59.569> courage<00:00:59.960> behind<00:01:00.649> that<00:01:00.889> and

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
heck of a lot of courage behind that and

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.949 
heck of a lot of courage behind that and
strength<00:01:01.339> in<00:01:01.549> that<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.179> the<00:01:02.269> combination<00:01:02.839> of

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:02.959 
strength in that so the combination of

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.439 
strength in that so the combination of
fragility<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.180> vulnerability<00:01:05.180> in<00:01:05.299> her

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
fragility and vulnerability in her

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.649 
fragility and vulnerability in her
combined<00:01:05.960> with<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.409> strength<00:01:07.420> was<00:01:08.420> just

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
combined with the strength was just

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.760 
combined with the strength was just
fascinating

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.160

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
at a gentle connection that is formed

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.229 
at a gentle connection that is formed
between<00:01:59.259> them<00:01:59.709> which<00:02:00.130> isn't<00:02:00.340> salacious<00:02:01.000> you

between them which isn't salacious you

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.399 
know there's no nudity you know there's
actually<00:02:03.280> very<00:02:03.610> little<00:02:04.030> kissing<00:02:04.539> even<00:02:04.869> but

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
actually very little kissing even but

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.929 
actually very little kissing even but
you<00:02:05.530> don't<00:02:05.739> doubt<00:02:05.920> for<00:02:06.159> one<00:02:06.219> second<00:02:06.789> that

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
you don't doubt for one second that

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.089 
you don't doubt for one second that
those<00:02:07.149> two<00:02:07.390> people<00:02:07.599> are<00:02:08.530> supposed<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.950> be

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
those two people are supposed to be

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.330 
those two people are supposed to be
together<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:11.319> very<00:02:11.379> clever<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.069> story

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
together and it's very clever the story

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.210 
together and it's very clever the story
and<00:02:12.670> in<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.360> in<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.379> sense<00:02:14.709> because<00:02:14.920> you

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
and in in in in that sense because you

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.720 
and in in in in that sense because you
least<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.790> really<00:02:16.000> don't<00:02:16.180> expect<00:02:16.540> it

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.619 

I<00:02:19.819> think<00:02:20.690> Jason<00:02:20.900> as<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.409> filmmaker<00:02:22.099> is<00:02:22.510> well<00:02:23.510> not

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
I think Jason as a filmmaker is well not

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.020 
I think Jason as a filmmaker is well not
only<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.959> he<00:02:24.110> incredibly<00:02:24.739> skilled<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.730> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
only is he incredibly skilled and a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.479 
only is he incredibly skilled and a
wonderful<00:02:26.510> storyteller<00:02:27.190> but<00:02:28.190> he<00:02:28.310> isn't

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
wonderful storyteller but he isn't

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.449 
wonderful storyteller but he isn't
afraid<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:29.030> just<00:02:29.750> try<00:02:29.959> something<00:02:30.620> new<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.069> mean

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
afraid to just try something new I mean

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.800 
afraid to just try something new I mean
all<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.760> his<00:02:32.060> films<00:02:32.360> have<00:02:32.450> been<00:02:32.599> very

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
all of his films have been very

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.479 
all of his films have been very
different<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.409> one<00:02:33.890> thing<00:02:34.099> that<00:02:34.250> we've<00:02:34.370> been

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
different and one thing that we've been

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.979 
different and one thing that we've been
hearing<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.879> lot<00:02:35.000> actually<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.420> last<00:02:35.569> 24<00:02:35.959> hours

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
hearing a lot actually the last 24 hours

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.229 
hearing a lot actually the last 24 hours
is<00:02:36.230> wow<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.769> very<00:02:37.310> different<00:02:37.670> film<00:02:37.879> for

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
is wow this is a very different film for

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.880 
is wow this is a very different film for
you<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.660> why<00:02:38.959> did<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.260> make<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.650> choice

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
you and why did you make this choice

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.860 
you and why did you make this choice
Jason<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:41.000> really<00:02:41.299> odd<00:02:41.450> because<00:02:41.629> I

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
Jason and it's really odd because I

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.330 
Jason and it's really odd because I
don't<00:02:42.080> think<00:02:42.260> he's<00:02:42.379> even<00:02:42.530> particularly<00:02:43.250> aware

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
don't think he's even particularly aware

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.460 
don't think he's even particularly aware
that<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.819> was<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.030> he<00:02:44.629> wasn't<00:02:44.930> really<00:02:45.080> making<00:02:45.260> a

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
that it was a he wasn't really making a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.080 
that it was a he wasn't really making a
specific<00:02:46.010> choice<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.430> don't<00:02:46.610> think<00:02:46.819> it<00:02:46.970> was

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
specific choice I don't think it was

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.789 
specific choice I don't think it was
just<00:02:47.360> something<00:02:47.900> different<00:02:48.470> another

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
just something different another

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.160 
just something different another
different<00:02:49.310> story<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:49.819> tell<00:02:49.849> and<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:51.049> know

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
different story to tell and you know

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.809 
different story to tell and you know
that's<00:02:51.319> what<00:02:51.500> makes<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.860> great<00:02:51.950> filmmaker<00:02:52.340> is

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
that's what makes a great filmmaker is

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.880 
that's what makes a great filmmaker is
someone<00:02:53.180> who's<00:02:53.360> prepared<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.900> try<00:02:54.500> something

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
someone who's prepared to try something

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.460 
someone who's prepared to try something
new<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.220> take<00:02:55.400> those<00:02:55.549> risks<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.019> writing

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
new and take those risks so the writing

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.069 
new and take those risks so the writing
for<00:02:57.650> me<00:02:57.799> I<00:02:57.980> think<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:59.150> most<00:02:59.180> striking

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
for me I think the the most striking

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.039 
for me I think the the most striking
thing<00:03:00.349> about<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.950> writing<00:03:01.640> was<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.720> was

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
thing about the writing was that it was

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.780 
thing about the writing was that it was
very<00:03:03.319> close<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.890> book<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:04.310> often<00:03:04.549> with<00:03:04.670> an

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
very close to the book and often with an

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.300 
very close to the book and often with an
adaptation<00:03:04.940> that<00:03:05.420> doesn't<00:03:05.870> happen<00:03:06.190> but<00:03:07.190> he

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
adaptation that doesn't happen but he

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.220 
adaptation that doesn't happen but he
was<00:03:07.430> very<00:03:07.609> respectful<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.810> original

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
was very respectful of the original

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.960 
was very respectful of the original
story<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:11.000> Joyce<00:03:11.450> maynard's

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
story and of Joyce maynard's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.020 
story and of Joyce maynard's
writing<00:03:13.970> style<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:15.370> what<00:03:16.370> happened<00:03:16.819> in<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
writing style and what happened in the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.630 
writing style and what happened in the
film<00:03:17.209> actually<00:03:17.720> was<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.549> although<00:03:19.549> you

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
film actually was that although you

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.069 
film actually was that although you
don't<00:03:19.760> really<00:03:19.970> notice<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.540> there<00:03:20.780> isn't<00:03:20.900> that

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
don't really notice it there isn't that

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.800 
don't really notice it there isn't that
much<00:03:21.470> dialogue<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:22.459> mean<00:03:22.879> there<00:03:23.030> isn't<00:03:23.329> as<00:03:23.540> much

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
much dialogue I mean there isn't as much

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.750 
much dialogue I mean there isn't as much
dialogue<00:03:24.560> as<00:03:24.709> there<00:03:24.919> might<00:03:25.220> have<00:03:25.250> been<00:03:25.430> in<00:03:25.669> a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
dialogue as there might have been in a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.039 
dialogue as there might have been in a
lot<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:25.970> Jason's<00:03:26.419> previous<00:03:26.840> films

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
lot of Jason's previous films

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.809 
lot of Jason's previous films
particularly<00:03:27.440> Juna<00:03:28.010> which<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.280> all<00:03:28.489> about

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
particularly Juna which is all about

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.349 
particularly Juna which is all about
conversation<00:03:29.889> but<00:03:30.889> this<00:03:31.040> film<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:32.000> know<00:03:32.150> the

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
conversation but this film you know the

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.720 
conversation but this film you know the
the<00:03:33.319> looks<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.799> pauses<00:03:34.340> were<00:03:34.549> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
the looks and the pauses were the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.170 
the looks and the pauses were the
dialogue<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.980> camera<00:03:37.310> angles<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
dialogue and the camera angles and the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.789 
dialogue and the camera angles and the
way<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.599> sweat<00:03:38.840> runs<00:03:39.049> down<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.470> side<00:03:39.620> of

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
way the sweat runs down the side of

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.680 
way the sweat runs down the side of
someone's<00:03:40.190> face<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.940> know<00:03:41.060> those<00:03:41.329> moments

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
someone's face you know those moments

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.650 
someone's face you know those moments
were<00:03:42.590> where<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.519> lot<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.150> story<00:03:44.419> is

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
were where a lot of the story is

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.870 
were where a lot of the story is
actually<00:03:45.079> told<00:03:45.349> and<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:46.130> think<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.549> he<00:03:46.669> did
