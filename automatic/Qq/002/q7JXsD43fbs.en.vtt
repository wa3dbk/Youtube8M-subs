00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.160
 Item No .: SCP-666-J 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 Object class: Euclid 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 Special Containment Procedures: D-Class and Gerald are the only ones that are allowed to get on 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.000
 Any car that Dr. Gerald happens to be driving. Prepare a number of equivalent body bags 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 For the number of passengers on any vehicle it happens to drive, minus the same. in addition to, 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.610
 Medical teams must be on standby if Dr. Gerald will travel through a populated area, 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.970
 Or any form of environment that may be hazardous (eg, nuclear power plant, chemical refining 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.140
 the plant). 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.519
 Description: All individuals who climb any car or form of transportation that Dr 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.930
 Gerald himself is in control in any way confirmed to die. Experiments have shown that 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 Even those who run away from the vehicles he was driving are doomed. And generally hit by another 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.010
 The car moves in minutes. Dr. Gerald himself, strangely, always remains whatever it is 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.949
 The horror that puts the car through. 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.860
 In addition, all things that may be dangerous seem to become more serious if it is 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.960
 They guard a car in the general vicinity. Knives penetrate more than their sharpness 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.420
 Which agree that oil tankers are usually benign becoming mobile bombs that will explode with 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.390
 The touch and buildings lose no importance of hardness, and pedestrians seem to lose everything 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.030
 Forms of self-preservation, throwing themselves in his way. The mere biking can catch up 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.970
 Destruction of Typhoon T3. 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.790
 Add 666-1: Dr. Gerald never comes within 25 meters of the SCP-462. 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:02:34.200
 Plans are being made to build: the addition of a 666-2 car that can contain SCP-682 long enough 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:59.749
 For Dr. Gerald to actually pay.
