00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.400 
someone out of it earn something
and<00:00:10.820> auto<00:00:10.969> rotation<00:00:11.299> is<00:00:11.540> the<00:00:11.690> emergency

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
and auto rotation is the emergency

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.289 
and auto rotation is the emergency

something mechanical or more
specifically<00:00:21.310> an<00:00:21.460> engine<00:00:21.699> failure<00:00:22.710> myth

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
specifically an engine failure myth

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.799 
specifically an engine failure myth
engine<00:00:24.099> quits<00:00:24.609> you<00:00:25.000> know<00:00:25.090> we<00:00:25.210> have<00:00:25.359> no<00:00:25.390> way<00:00:25.750> to

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:25.809 
engine quits you know we have no way to

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.679 
engine quits you know we have no way to
produce<00:00:26.050> any<00:00:26.349> more<00:00:26.500> thrust<00:00:27.269> stops<00:00:28.269> the<00:00:28.390> blades

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
produce any more thrust stops the blades

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.599 
produce any more thrust stops the blades
and<00:00:28.929> we<00:00:28.989> drop<00:00:29.169> like<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.410> rock<00:00:29.529> that's<00:00:30.039> pretty

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
and we drop like a rock that's pretty

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.360 
and we drop like a rock that's pretty
bad<00:00:30.789> so<00:00:31.539> we<00:00:31.839> want<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.140> do<00:00:32.259> is<00:00:32.500> immediately

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
bad so we want to do is immediately

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.450 
bad so we want to do is immediately
abundant<00:00:33.879> in<00:00:33.970> failure<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.480> decrease<00:00:35.460> throttle

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
abundant in failure is decrease throttle

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.740 
abundant in failure is decrease throttle
that<00:00:36.790> takes<00:00:37.000> all<00:00:37.149> the<00:00:37.180> pitch<00:00:37.420> out<00:00:37.629> of<00:00:37.659> the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
that takes all the pitch out of the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.020 
that takes all the pitch out of the
blades<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.350> allows<00:00:38.559> them<00:00:38.800> to<00:00:38.829> spin<00:00:39.550> freely<00:00:39.760> as

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
blades and allows them to spin freely as

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.330 
blades and allows them to spin freely as
when<00:00:40.210> coming<00:00:40.479> down

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
when coming down

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.460 
when coming down
the<00:00:41.700> upper<00:00:42.240> force<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> wind<00:00:42.900> keeps<00:00:43.290> them

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
the upper force the wind keeps them

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.560 
the upper force the wind keeps them
moving

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
moving

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.930 
moving
you<00:00:44.780> think<00:00:44.960> about<00:00:45.050> it<00:00:45.230> like<00:00:45.350> that<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:45.940> that's

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
you think about it like that and that's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.460 
you think about it like that and that's
what<00:00:47.060> keeps<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.360> blades<00:00:47.600> going<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.320> it's

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
what keeps the blades going and it's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.470 
what keeps the blades going and it's
going<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:48.650> be<00:00:48.739> paramount<00:00:49.100> once<00:00:50.059> we<00:00:50.210> get<00:00:50.270> closer

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
going to be paramount once we get closer

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.069 
going to be paramount once we get closer
to<00:00:50.630> the<00:00:50.690> ground

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.350 

on

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.220 

governor

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
governor

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.229 
governor
so<00:01:03.860> as<00:01:04.339> we're<00:01:04.550> getting<00:01:04.729> close<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.120> ground

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
so as we're getting close to the ground

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.899 
so as we're getting close to the ground
next<00:01:06.020> big<00:01:06.200> important<00:01:06.890> thing<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.370> to<00:01:07.400> uh<00:01:07.610> keep

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
next big important thing is to uh keep

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.399 
next big important thing is to uh keep
the<00:01:08.060> aircraft<00:01:08.150> level<00:01:08.780> upon<00:01:09.200> touchdown

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the aircraft level upon touchdown

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.529 
the aircraft level upon touchdown
if<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.100> level<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.729> risk<00:01:11.999> flipping<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
if it's not level we risk flipping the

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.719 
if it's not level we risk flipping the
helicopter<00:01:13.289> and<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:13.979> equally<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.460> bad

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
helicopter and that's equally as bad

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.489 
helicopter and that's equally as bad
because<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.869> haven't<00:01:16.140> gotten<00:01:16.259> ground

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
because really haven't gotten ground

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.210 
because really haven't gotten ground
safe

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
safe

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.920 
safe
so<00:01:19.080> throttle<00:01:20.080> down<00:01:20.230> and<00:01:20.620> keep<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:21.010> level<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
so throttle down and keep it level the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.450 
so throttle down and keep it level the
rest<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.980> procedures<00:01:24.520> are

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.320 

important<00:01:28.450> but<00:01:28.780> nevertheless<00:01:30.000> those<00:01:31.000> two<00:01:31.210> or

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
important but nevertheless those two or

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.970 
important but nevertheless those two or
more

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
more

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.900 
more
so<00:01:33.980> just<00:01:34.190> right<00:01:34.340> here<00:01:34.490> we'll<00:01:34.670> go<00:01:34.760> ahead<00:01:34.820> and

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
so just right here we'll go ahead and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.940 
so just right here we'll go ahead and
kill<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.240> engine<00:01:35.480> and<00:01:35.630> I'll<00:01:36.410> demonstrate<00:01:36.620> an

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
kill the engine and I'll demonstrate an

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.200 
kill the engine and I'll demonstrate an
auto<00:01:37.070> rotation<00:01:37.370> and<00:01:37.640> try<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:37.820> talk<00:01:38.090> you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
auto rotation and try to talk you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.290 
auto rotation and try to talk you
through<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.570> best<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:38.960> can<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.880> one

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.850 

so<00:01:44.870> all<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.170> sudden<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.500> engine<00:01:45.530> dies

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
so all of a sudden the engine dies

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.790 
so all of a sudden the engine dies
immediately<00:01:46.520> throttle<00:01:47.270> down<00:01:47.390> at<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.530> point

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
immediately throttle down at this point

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.500 
immediately throttle down at this point
we<00:01:48.950> want<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.190> keep<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.490> aircraft<00:01:49.790> anywhere

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
we want to keep the aircraft anywhere

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.770 
we want to keep the aircraft anywhere
between<00:01:50.660> 60<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.230> 90<00:01:51.560> knots<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:52.160> speed<00:01:53.590> and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
between 60 and 90 knots of speed and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.910 
between 60 and 90 knots of speed and
right<00:01:56.780> now<00:01:56.930> we're<00:01:57.110> looking<00:01:57.290> for<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.500> nice<00:01:57.680> place

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
right now we're looking for a nice place

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.490 
right now we're looking for a nice place
to<00:01:57.950> put<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.220> down<00:01:59.050> thankfully<00:02:00.050> we<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.350> this

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
to put it down thankfully we have this

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.670 
to put it down thankfully we have this
little<00:02:00.830> airstrip<00:02:01.220> right<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.700> our<00:02:02.350> two<00:02:03.350> o'clock

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
little airstrip right to our two o'clock

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.470 
little airstrip right to our two o'clock
and<00:02:03.890> we<00:02:03.980> try<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.190> put<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.490> down<00:02:04.610> right<00:02:04.910> there

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
and we try to put it down right there

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.380 
and we try to put it down right there
just<00:02:05.900> beyond

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.120 

the<00:02:09.869> closer<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.319> get<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> ground<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> more

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
the closer we get the ground the more

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.740 
the closer we get the ground the more
we're<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.670> drawing<00:02:11.880> from<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
we're going to be drawing from the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.210 
we're going to be drawing from the
blades<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.819> kind<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.000> lucky<00:02:16.220> you're
