00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.480 
frankly the sex toy industry is not
catered<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.050> men<00:01:56.229> very<00:01:56.530> well<00:01:56.619> I'm<00:01:57.100> gonna<00:01:57.280> say

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
catered to men very well I'm gonna say

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.980 
catered to men very well I'm gonna say
that<00:01:57.790> seems<00:01:58.090> like<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.390> would<00:01:58.420> be<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.690> biggest

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
that seems like it would be the biggest

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.760 
that seems like it would be the biggest
waste<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.860> time<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.570> amount<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:02.229> energy<00:02:02.680> that

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
waste of time the amount of energy that

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.380 
waste of time the amount of energy that
would<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.130> go<00:02:03.250> whoo<00:02:03.430> into<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:04.119> just

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
would have to go whoo into that is just
