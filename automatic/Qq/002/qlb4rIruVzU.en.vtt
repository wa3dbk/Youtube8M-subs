to establish myself in a emerging

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.370 
to establish myself in a emerging
markets<00:01:12.830> such<00:01:12.920> as<00:01:12.979> Jordan<00:01:13.430> came<00:01:13.909> as<00:01:14.659> a<00:01:14.990> very

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
markets such as Jordan came as a very

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.500 
markets such as Jordan came as a very
big<00:01:15.500> opportunity<00:01:15.620> for<00:01:16.010> me<00:01:16.190> personally<00:01:16.510> to

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
big opportunity for me personally to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.969 
big opportunity for me personally to
grow<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:17.900> develop<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.320> actually<00:01:18.590> solve<00:01:18.830> all

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
grow and develop and actually solve all

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.070 
grow and develop and actually solve all
the<00:01:19.220> puzzles<00:01:19.369> that<00:01:19.760> were<00:01:20.659> around<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.960> region

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
the puzzles that were around the region

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.420 
the puzzles that were around the region
there<00:01:21.290> are<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.380> lot<00:01:21.470> of<00:01:21.500> challenges<00:01:21.799> but<00:01:22.100> I

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
there are a lot of challenges but I

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.310 
there are a lot of challenges but I
think<00:01:22.700> that's<00:01:22.850> what<00:01:23.030> excites<00:01:23.180> me<00:01:23.540> most<00:01:23.690> when

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
think that's what excites me most when

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.380 
think that's what excites me most when
when<00:01:25.010> when<00:01:25.250> looking<00:01:25.490> at<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.670> region<00:01:26.030> first

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
when when looking at the region first

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.570 
when when looking at the region first
and<00:01:26.510> foremost<00:01:26.690> so<00:01:26.960> maybe<00:01:27.440> London<00:01:27.979> today<00:01:28.280> is

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
and foremost so maybe London today is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.420 
and foremost so maybe London today is
becoming<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:30.140> hub<00:01:30.560> for<00:01:30.830> globalization

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
becoming the the hub for globalization

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.179 
becoming the the hub for globalization
but<00:01:32.390> i<00:01:32.420> think<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.649> Gateway<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
but i think the the the Gateway to the

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.380 
but i think the the the Gateway to the
Middle<00:01:34.430> East<00:01:34.549> is<00:01:34.759> definitely<00:01:35.090> Jordan<00:01:35.329> in

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
Middle East is definitely Jordan in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.969 
Middle East is definitely Jordan in
terms<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.689> tech<00:01:35.840> sector<00:01:36.020> you've<00:01:36.799> seen
