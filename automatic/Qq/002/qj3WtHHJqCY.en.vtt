only<00:01:16.049> thing<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.860> very<00:01:17.759> strange

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
only thing that's really very strange

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240 
only thing that's really very strange
about<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> only<00:01:20.009> time

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
about it is that this is the only time

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
about it is that this is the only time
we<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.580> them<00:01:20.790> kind<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> wasted<00:01:21.900> opportunity

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
we see them kind of a wasted opportunity

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
we see them kind of a wasted opportunity
in<00:01:22.590> my<00:01:22.740> opinion<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.400> holy-shit<00:01:24.210> ballots<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
in my opinion it holy-shit ballots of

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.399 
in my opinion it holy-shit ballots of
leg-up<00:01:25.200> badass<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.810> yeah<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.020> fight<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
leg-up badass and yeah this fight is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
leg-up badass and yeah this fight is
actually<00:01:28.710> pretty<00:01:28.890> hard<00:01:29.630> but<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:30.780> mostly

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
actually pretty hard but that's mostly

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.039 
actually pretty hard but that's mostly
because<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:31.920> bad<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.750> due<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
because I'm really bad at it due to the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.840 
because I'm really bad at it due to the
nature<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.799> game<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> gameboy

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
nature of this game and all the gameboy

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.630 
nature of this game and all the gameboy
games<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.420> we've<00:01:36.750> seen<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.079> far<00:01:37.490> there<00:01:38.490> really

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
games as we've seen so far there really

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640 
games as we've seen so far there really
is<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.090> much<00:01:39.509> incentive<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.380> better

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
is not that much incentive to get better

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.350 
is not that much incentive to get better
at<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:42.560> if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.579> hammer<00:01:44.939> away<00:01:45.210> at

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
at it because if you just hammer away at

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.810 
at it because if you just hammer away at
him<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:46.049> very<00:01:46.439> easily<00:01:46.619> damage<00:01:47.310> race<00:01:47.579> him

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
him you can very easily damage race him

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.810 
him you can very easily damage race him
as<00:01:47.970> he<00:01:48.509> doesn't<00:01:48.869> deal<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.259> very<00:01:49.890> large<00:01:50.610> amount

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
as he doesn't deal a very large amount

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.260 
as he doesn't deal a very large amount
of<00:01:51.119> damage<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:52.200> he<00:01:52.500> would<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:53.460> Punk<00:01:53.820> did<00:01:54.030> for

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
of damage if he would like Punk did for

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.240 
of damage if he would like Punk did for
example<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> same<00:01:55.290> place<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.829> tattiyum

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
example in the same place in tattiyum

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.160 
example in the same place in tattiyum
then<00:01:56.880> I've<00:01:57.030> been<00:01:57.329> far<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:57.719> trouble<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
then I've been far more trouble and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.289 
then I've been far more trouble and
would<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.670> practiced

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
would actually have to have practiced

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.760 
would actually have to have practiced
but<00:02:00.990> well<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
but well it is as it is and we get a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.210 
but well it is as it is and we get a
very<00:02:05.250> very<00:02:05.909> nice<00:02:06.180> weapon<00:02:06.659> from<00:02:07.079> him<00:02:07.380> this

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
very very nice weapon from him this

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.080 
very very nice weapon from him this
weapon<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.420> good<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.470> will

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
weapon is actually so good that I will

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.030 
weapon is actually so good that I will
pretty<00:02:11.209> much<00:02:11.390> default<00:02:12.019> to<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.319> for<00:02:12.650> most<00:02:12.860> of

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
pretty much default to it for most of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.699 
pretty much default to it for most of
the<00:02:13.160> time<00:02:13.370> afterwards<00:02:14.030> as<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:15.019> is<00:02:15.140> also<00:02:15.410> very

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
the time afterwards as it is also very

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.880 
the time afterwards as it is also very
very<00:02:16.069> fun<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.580> use<00:02:17.110> which<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.260> great

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
very fun to use which is great

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.009 
very fun to use which is great
first<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.970> all<00:02:20.090> though<00:02:20.269> we<00:02:20.420> get<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.599> forced

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
first of all though we get a forced

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.500 
first of all though we get a forced
tutorial<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.920> we're<00:02:22.849> going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.060> see<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:23.390> a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
tutorial on it we're going to see in a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.050 
tutorial on it we're going to see in a
second<00:02:23.930> because<00:02:24.019> for<00:02:24.470> now<00:02:24.940> everything<00:02:25.940> is

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
second because for now everything is

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.970 
second because for now everything is
collapsing<00:02:26.269> behind<00:02:26.989> us<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.470> pretty<00:02:27.830> much

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
collapsing behind us and pretty much

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.610 
collapsing behind us and pretty much
took<00:02:28.190> out<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.549> tank<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:29.720> also<00:02:29.930> already

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
took out the tank and we also already

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.229 
took out the tank and we also already
know<00:02:30.830> how<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.099> deal<00:02:31.340> with<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.640> missiles<00:02:32.060> which

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
know how to deal with the missiles which

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.720 
know how to deal with the missiles which
is<00:02:32.390> very<00:02:32.569> nice<00:02:32.900> now<00:02:33.709> however<00:02:34.010> they<00:02:34.370> are<00:02:34.430> placed

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
is very nice now however they are placed

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.520 
is very nice now however they are placed
in<00:02:34.879> a<00:02:34.970> way<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.299> we<00:02:35.420> can<00:02:35.599> only<00:02:35.900> reach<00:02:36.260> them

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
in a way that we can only reach them

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
in a way that we can only reach them
with<00:02:36.650> ballad<00:02:37.010> cracker<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.879> course<00:02:38.180> we<00:02:38.330> can

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
with ballad cracker of course we can

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.150 
with ballad cracker of course we can
also<00:02:38.690> use<00:02:38.930> Pharaoh<00:02:39.200> shall<00:02:39.470> pervious<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.980> fun

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
also use Pharaoh shall pervious the fun

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.850 
also use Pharaoh shall pervious the fun
in<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.340> as<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.209> can<00:02:41.390> already<00:02:41.690> tell<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.650> can

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
in that as you can already tell you can

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.339 
in that as you can already tell you can
fire<00:02:43.099> it<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.400> every<00:02:43.790> direction<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.900> it

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
fire it in every direction and it

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.440 
fire it in every direction and it
explodes<00:02:45.799> afterwards<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:47.239> really

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
explodes afterwards and it really

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.120 
explodes afterwards and it really
doesn't<00:02:47.660> deal<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.470> costs<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.069> much

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
doesn't deal that it costs that much

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.520 
doesn't deal that it costs that much
weapon<00:02:49.640> energy<00:02:49.849> making<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.870> pretty<00:02:51.110> much<00:02:51.260> one

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
weapon energy making it pretty much one

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.550 
weapon energy making it pretty much one
of<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.890> best<00:02:52.280> weapons<00:02:52.640> ever<00:02:53.150> made<00:02:53.480> which<00:02:54.230> is

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
of the best weapons ever made which is

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.580 
of the best weapons ever made which is
just<00:02:55.160> fine<00:02:55.430> by<00:02:55.640> me<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.180> as<00:02:56.900> we<00:02:57.079> are<00:02:57.110> also<00:02:57.319> going

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
just fine by me and as we are also going

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.789 
just fine by me and as we are also going
to<00:02:57.739> see<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.340> endgame<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.299> bottom<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.930> really

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
to see the endgame of bottom is really

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.190 
to see the endgame of bottom is really
really<00:03:01.069> long<00:03:01.489> meaning<00:03:02.329> that<00:03:02.660> we<00:03:02.870> will<00:03:03.019> get

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
really long meaning that we will get

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.229 
really long meaning that we will get
plenty<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.739> time<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:03.980> play<00:03:04.220> around<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.700> all

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
plenty of time to play around it all

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.770 
plenty of time to play around it all
very<00:03:05.690> fine<00:03:05.989> in<00:03:06.200> my<00:03:06.349> book<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:07.519> segment<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.269> not

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
very fine in my book this segment is not

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.170 
very fine in my book this segment is not
one<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.019> my<00:03:09.200> favorites<00:03:09.590> however<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.370> get<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
one of my favorites however I get the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.690 
one of my favorites however I get the
point<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.569> know<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:12.049> make<00:03:12.860> you<00:03:13.069> get<00:03:13.250> use<00:03:13.459> The

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
point you know to make you get use The

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.819 
point you know to make you get use The
Ballad<00:03:13.879> cracker<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.780> it's<00:03:15.170> also<00:03:15.440> pretty

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
Ballad cracker and it's also pretty

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.940 
Ballad cracker and it's also pretty
challenging<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.900> big<00:03:18.019> problem<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.470> have<00:03:18.650> of<00:03:18.829> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
challenging the big problem I have of it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.819 
challenging the big problem I have of it
is<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.310> if<00:03:19.579> you<00:03:19.639> run<00:03:20.060> out<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.269> pellet<00:03:20.829> ammo

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
is that if you run out of pellet ammo

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.979 
is that if you run out of pellet ammo
which<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.700> can<00:03:22.970> hand<00:03:23.209> even<00:03:23.389> though<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.720> is

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
which you can hand even though it is

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.800 
which you can hand even though it is
relatively<00:03:24.769> plentiful<00:03:25.100> then<00:03:26.090> you're<00:03:26.389> pretty

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
relatively plentiful then you're pretty

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.259 
relatively plentiful then you're pretty
much<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.170> out<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.530> luck<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.549> will<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:29.060> to

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
much it out of luck and you will have to

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.420 
much it out of luck and you will have to
die<00:03:29.450> which<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.470> never<00:03:30.859> fun

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
die which is never fun

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.610 
die which is never fun
as<00:03:31.489> said<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.180> can<00:03:32.450> also<00:03:32.630> use<00:03:32.930> Farrell<00:03:33.349> shot

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
as said you can also use Farrell shot

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.660 
as said you can also use Farrell shot
but<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.940> pretty<00:03:35.209> easy<00:03:35.299> to<00:03:35.540> die<00:03:35.810> here<00:03:36.200> also

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
but it is pretty easy to die here also

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.849 
but it is pretty easy to die here also
because<00:03:37.670> well<00:03:38.060> if<00:03:38.359> you<00:03:38.569> shoot<00:03:38.930> down<00:03:39.139> missiles

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
because well if you shoot down missiles

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.740 
because well if you shoot down missiles
below<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.489> then<00:03:40.849> you<00:03:40.940> will<00:03:41.060> die<00:03:41.239> if<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.569> can't

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
below you then you will die if you can't

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.190 
below you then you will die if you can't
hit<00:03:41.840> more<00:03:42.079> than<00:03:42.230> three<00:03:42.470> times<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.919> will<00:03:43.040> die

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
hit more than three times you will die

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.589 
hit more than three times you will die
fortunately<00:03:45.200> enough<00:03:45.380> if<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.650> do<00:03:45.799> game<00:03:46.010> over

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
fortunately enough if you do game over

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.970 
fortunately enough if you do game over
which<00:03:47.599> is<00:03:47.780> very<00:03:47.959> nice<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.230> them<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.799> will

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
which is very nice of them you will

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.680 
which is very nice of them you will
start<00:03:49.400> at<00:03:49.609> the<00:03:49.760> start<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.359> missile

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
start at the start of the missile

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.509 
start at the start of the missile
segment<00:03:51.139> and<00:03:51.260> not<00:03:51.440> at<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.650> very<00:03:51.980> start<00:03:52.099> of<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
segment and not at the very start of the

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.089 
segment and not at the very start of the
level<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:53.690> will<00:03:54.139> never<00:03:54.349> have<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.739> fight<00:03:54.950> the

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
level you will never have to fight the

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.530 
level you will never have to fight the
late<00:03:55.280> again

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
late again

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.050 
late again
which<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.620> very<00:03:57.680> very<00:03:58.130> convenient<00:03:58.790> and

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
which is very very convenient and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.830 
which is very very convenient and
something<00:03:59.480> they<00:03:59.660> do<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.870> lot<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.919> the<00:04:01.099> endgame

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
something they do a lot in the endgame

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.270 
something they do a lot in the endgame
which<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.079> one<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.590> biggest<00:04:03.799> reason<00:04:04.250> for

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
which is one of the biggest reason for

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.670 
which is one of the biggest reason for
via<00:04:04.639> like<00:04:04.849> bottom<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:05.480> much<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:05.959> very<00:04:06.319> very

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
via like bottom so much it is very very

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680 
via like bottom so much it is very very
accessible<00:04:07.069> in<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.430> very<00:04:07.700> good<00:04:07.880> game<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.269> will

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
accessible in a very good game and will

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.659 
accessible in a very good game and will
not<00:04:08.930> hesitate<00:04:09.139> to<00:04:09.440> point<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.919> out<00:04:10.069> more<00:04:10.459> and

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
not hesitate to point that out more and

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.330 
not hesitate to point that out more and
more<00:04:10.880> as<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.359> goes<00:04:11.569> on<00:04:11.810> because<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.799> just<00:04:13.099> so

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
more as it goes on because it is just so

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.250 
more as it goes on because it is just so
nice<00:04:13.549> of<00:04:13.790> them<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.359> rarely<00:04:14.599> see<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:15.049> done

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
nice of them and you rarely see it done

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.800 
nice of them and you rarely see it done
even<00:04:15.680> in<00:04:15.799> other<00:04:15.950> mainline<00:04:16.430> Megaman<00:04:16.910> games<00:04:17.090> for

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
even in other mainline Megaman games for

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.140 
even in other mainline Megaman games for
now<00:04:17.959> however<00:04:18.200> we're<00:04:18.530> back<00:04:18.739> upwards<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.700> space

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
now however we're back upwards in space

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.719 
now however we're back upwards in space
just<00:04:20.690> like<00:04:20.870> in<00:04:21.349> the<00:04:21.560> very<00:04:21.739> first<00:04:22.130> game<00:04:22.340> of

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
just like in the very first game of

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.870 
just like in the very first game of
Megaman<00:04:23.090> game<00:04:23.330> what<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.260> plot

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
Megaman game what a plot

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.180 
Megaman game what a plot
of<00:04:25.120> course<00:04:25.480> I<00:04:25.780> was<00:04:26.170> very<00:04:26.380> willing<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.920> talk

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
of course I was very willing to talk

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.980 
of course I was very willing to talk
over<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.550> but<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.850> does<00:04:28.030> look<00:04:28.240> pretty<00:04:28.450> awesome

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
over it but it does look pretty awesome

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.030 
over it but it does look pretty awesome

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
everything because well this game always

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.570 
everything because well this game always
does<00:04:34.470> too<00:04:35.470> bad<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:35.920> was<00:04:36.070> on<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.280> gameboy

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
does too bad that it was on a gameboy

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.100 
does too bad that it was on a gameboy
screen<00:04:36.820> really<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.450> can't<00:04:37.720> win<00:04:37.930> them

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.320 
screen really that you can't win them
all<00:04:38.200> but<00:04:39.160> now<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.790> last<00:04:40.000> opportunity

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
all but now this is the last opportunity

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.630 
all but now this is the last opportunity
we<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.260> spend<00:04:41.530> our<00:04:41.770> money<00:04:41.830> so<00:04:42.310> we<00:04:42.460> might

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
we have to spend our money so we might

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.420 
we have to spend our money so we might

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
from Mega Man 5 I don't know if I'm

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.460 
from Mega Man 5 I don't know if I'm
actually<00:04:52.180> going<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.660> use<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:53.140> or<00:04:53.260> not<00:04:53.290> but

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
actually going to use it or not but

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.490 
actually going to use it or not but
might<00:04:54.040> as<00:04:54.220> well<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.790> I<00:04:55.510> can<00:04:55.720> now<00:04:55.870> recharge<00:04:56.350> all

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
might as well and I can now recharge all

might as well and I can now recharge all
my<00:04:56.620> weapons<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.940> can't<00:04:58.510> because<00:04:58.840> it<00:04:58.990> is

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
my weapons and I can't because it is

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.070 
my weapons and I can't because it is
ridiculously<00:04:59.950> expensive<00:05:00.450> as<00:05:01.450> I<00:05:01.510> said<00:05:02.050> I

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
ridiculously expensive as I said I

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.260 
ridiculously expensive as I said I
really<00:05:02.170> never<00:05:02.740> got<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.340> inclusion<00:05:03.880> of<00:05:03.940> this

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
really never got the inclusion of this

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.480 
really never got the inclusion of this
one<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:05.290> especially<00:05:05.770> do<00:05:05.890> not<00:05:06.040> get<00:05:06.250> why<00:05:06.430> it

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
one and I especially do not get why it

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.740 
one and I especially do not get why it
is<00:05:06.670> so<00:05:07.150> expensive<00:05:08.070> but<00:05:09.070> yeah<00:05:09.430> I<00:05:09.730> will<00:05:10.240> just

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
is so expensive but yeah I will just

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.720 
is so expensive but yeah I will just
have<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:10.990> farm<00:05:11.320> or<00:05:11.620> maybe<00:05:11.860> just<00:05:12.220> kill<00:05:12.550> myself

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
have to farm or maybe just kill myself

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.790 
have to farm or maybe just kill myself
repeatedly<00:05:13.300> off<00:05:13.540> screen<00:05:13.870> because<00:05:14.200> I<00:05:14.440> said<00:05:14.740> you

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
repeatedly off screen because I said you

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.250 
repeatedly off screen because I said you
