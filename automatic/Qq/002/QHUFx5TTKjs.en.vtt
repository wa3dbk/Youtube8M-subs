the back bill I think he has like 90
speed<00:01:54.920> but<00:01:55.040> he's<00:01:55.130> feels<00:01:55.310> faster<00:01:55.700> than<00:01:55.820> that

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
speed but he's feels faster than that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.610 
speed but he's feels faster than that

TV that's going to ask you but some
people<00:03:44.580> see<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.730> as<00:03:44.819> there's<00:03:45.090> no<00:03:45.209> point<00:03:45.480> in

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
people see it as there's no point in

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.120 
people see it as there's no point in
driving<00:03:46.020> all<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.410> way<00:03:46.440> down<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.830> feeling

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
driving all the way down and feeling

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.710 
driving all the way down and feeling
kind<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.400> empty<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.120> guess<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:48.390> like<00:03:48.420> two

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
kind of empty so I guess it's like two

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.240 
kind of empty so I guess it's like two
sides<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.110> every<00:03:49.319> corner<00:03:49.530> whatever<00:03:49.800> compare
