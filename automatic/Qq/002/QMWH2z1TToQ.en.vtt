in this video were taken from a mix of

in this video were taken from a mix of
locking<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> champion<00:00:27.150> GG<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:29.039> looked<00:00:29.279> at

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
locking and champion GG and we looked at

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.860 
locking and champion GG and we looked at
ranked<00:00:30.000> solo<00:00:30.269> queue<00:00:30.630> statistics<00:00:31.260> only

anyways<00:00:33.870> our<00:00:34.079> first<00:00:34.350> change<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.250> pretty

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
anyways our first change was the pretty

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.479 
anyways our first change was the pretty
major<00:00:35.760> rise<00:00:36.390> overhaul<00:00:37.170> he<00:00:37.770> received<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.219> pretty

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
major rise overhaul he received a pretty

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
major rise overhaul he received a pretty
big<00:00:38.700> update<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.270> initially<00:00:39.809> pegged<00:00:40.110> to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
big update and was initially pegged to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.990 
big update and was initially pegged to
make<00:00:40.680> him<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> little<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.340> stronger<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
make him a little bit stronger at the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.270 
make him a little bit stronger at the
highest<00:00:42.180> level<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.260> much<00:00:43.590> more<00:00:43.800> difficult<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
highest level but much more difficult to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.850 
highest level but much more difficult to
play<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.850> lane<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.239> overall<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.050> initially

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
play and lane with overall I initially

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.229 
play and lane with overall I initially
thought<00:00:46.890> he<00:00:47.129> would<00:00:47.280> actually<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.789> pretty<00:00:47.940> good

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
thought he would actually be pretty good

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
thought he would actually be pretty good
after<00:00:48.510> testing<00:00:48.870> him<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
after testing him out with the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.060 
after testing him out with the
stipulation<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.910> he<00:00:51.660> had<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> couple<00:00:52.829> bugs

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
stipulation that he had a couple bugs

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610 
stipulation that he had a couple bugs
this<00:00:53.370> kit<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.730> needed<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.120> fixed<00:00:54.320> but<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
this kit that needed to be fixed but it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.279 
this kit that needed to be fixed but it
turned<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:57.149> end<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.510> being<00:00:58.109> not

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
turned out that this end up being not

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
turned out that this end up being not
really<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> case<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.250> his<00:00:59.399> win<00:00:59.579> rate<00:00:59.609> dropped

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
really the case in his win rate dropped

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.720 
really the case in his win rate dropped
by<00:01:00.449> about<00:01:00.480> seven<00:01:01.199> percent<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:02.309> whether<00:01:02.489> this

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
by about seven percent now whether this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.660 
by about seven percent now whether this
is<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.420> cause<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.080> bugs<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.890> being<00:01:05.129> fixed<00:01:05.549> or

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
is a cause of bugs not being fixed or

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.030 
is a cause of bugs not being fixed or
him<00:01:06.180> actually<00:01:06.390> being<00:01:06.750> bad<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
him actually being bad is kind of a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
him actually being bad is kind of a
toss-up<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.580> most<00:01:08.880> likely<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.049> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
toss-up it's most likely a little bit of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.170 
toss-up it's most likely a little bit of
both<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:11.100> looks<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.400> he<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.700> has<00:01:11.909> become

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
both it looks like he really has become

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
both it looks like he really has become
much<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.720> difficult<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.200> play<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.710> as

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
much more difficult to play and as

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.980 
much more difficult to play and as
changes<00:01:14.549> overall<00:01:15.060> I've<00:01:15.210> heard<00:01:15.450> him<00:01:15.540> by<00:01:15.720> quite

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
changes overall I've heard him by quite

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
changes overall I've heard him by quite
a<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.110> I'd<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.460> receive<00:01:17.700> some

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
a bit I'd like to see and receive some

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
a bit I'd like to see and receive some
more<00:01:18.030> utility<00:01:18.509> based<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.080> quality<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> life

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
more utility based and quality of life

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
more utility based and quality of life
changes<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.460> make<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.450> we'll<00:01:21.630> see

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
changes to make up for it but we'll see

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.960 
changes to make up for it but we'll see
what<00:01:22.200> happens<00:01:22.350> since<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.640> his<00:01:23.759> kid

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
what happens since I think his kid

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.609 
what happens since I think his kid
overall<00:01:24.390> actually<00:01:24.869> does<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.590> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
overall actually does have a lot of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.740 
overall actually does have a lot of
inherent<00:01:25.830> power<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> already<00:01:29.479> next<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.600> was

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
inherent power in it already next up was

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.390 
inherent power in it already next up was
the<00:01:30.810> change<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.320> blitz<00:01:31.530> cranks<00:01:31.829> overdrive

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the change to blitz cranks overdrive

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.980 
the change to blitz cranks overdrive
that<00:01:32.430> buffed<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> pretty<00:01:33.479> decent<00:01:33.810> way

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
that buffed it in a pretty decent way

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.390 
that buffed it in a pretty decent way
and<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.380> looked<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> buff<00:01:35.040> paid<00:01:35.310> off

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and it looked like the buff paid off

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.100 
and it looked like the buff paid off
pretty<00:01:35.670> well<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.090> his<00:01:36.240> win<00:01:36.450> rate<00:01:36.479> rose<00:01:36.900> by

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
pretty well as his win rate rose by

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
pretty well as his win rate rose by
about<00:01:37.140> two<00:01:37.619> percent<00:01:37.829> putting<00:01:38.460> him<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
about two percent putting him in a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
about two percent putting him in a
pretty<00:01:38.939> nice<00:01:39.119> spot<00:01:39.479> he's<00:01:40.110> dropped<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:40.590> from

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
pretty nice spot he's dropped a lot from

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.859 
pretty nice spot he's dropped a lot from
is<00:01:40.950> still<00:01:41.189> crazy<00:01:41.430> high<00:01:41.729> 55-percent<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.750> few

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
is still crazy high 55-percent a few

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
is still crazy high 55-percent a few
patches<00:01:43.110> ago<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> looks<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.579> this

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
patches ago but it looks like with this

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
patches ago but it looks like with this
change<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> nerfs<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> him<00:01:45.840> are<00:01:45.990> finally

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
change of the nerfs to him are finally

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.109 
change of the nerfs to him are finally
starting<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.920> settle<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> balanced

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
starting to settle out to a balanced

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.399 
starting to settle out to a balanced
state<00:01:49.970> next<00:01:50.970> up<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.270> dr.<00:01:51.750> mundo<00:01:52.140> whose

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
state next up we have dr. mundo whose

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
state next up we have dr. mundo whose
cleaver<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:52.920> changed<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> refund<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> cost

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
cleaver was changed to refund the cost

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.539 
cleaver was changed to refund the cost
after<00:01:54.840> killing<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.350> unit<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.890> personally

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
after killing a unit I personally

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.100 
after killing a unit I personally
thought<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.270> change<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.750> really

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
thought that this change would be really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.050 
thought that this change would be really
significant<00:01:58.740> since<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> fixes<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> huge

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
significant since it fixes a huge

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.209 
significant since it fixes a huge
problem<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.780> his<00:02:00.899> laning<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.920> looks<00:02:02.100> like

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
problem in his laning and it looks like

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.679 
problem in his laning and it looks like
I<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.460> probably<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:03.060> since<00:02:03.360> his<00:02:03.479> win<00:02:03.659> rate

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
I was probably right since his win rate

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.590 
I was probably right since his win rate
did<00:02:04.049> rise<00:02:04.290> by<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.590> three<00:02:05.100> percent<00:02:05.600> he's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
did rise by about three percent he's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
did rise by about three percent he's
still<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> negatives<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.740> forty-eight

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
still in the negatives at forty-eight

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.520 
still in the negatives at forty-eight
percent<00:02:08.489> win<00:02:08.970> rate<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.390> i<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:09.869> his<00:02:09.989> kit<00:02:10.379> is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
percent win rate but i think his kit is

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.830 
percent win rate but i think his kit is
a<00:02:10.590> lot<00:02:11.160> better<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.760> whole<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.480> he

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
a lot better as a whole now and he

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.670 
a lot better as a whole now and he
definitely<00:02:13.020> has

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
definitely has

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.720 
definitely has
angel<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.129> some<00:02:14.340> play<00:02:14.519> at<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
angel to see some play at the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.429 
angel to see some play at the
competitive<00:02:15.239> level<00:02:17.780> next<00:02:18.780> up<00:02:19.049> we<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
competitive level next up we have the

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.770 
competitive level next up we have the
jinx<00:02:20.159> nerf<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:20.909> one<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> think<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.480> really

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
jinx nerf and this one I think is really

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.179 
jinx nerf and this one I think is really
interesting<00:02:21.810> because<00:02:22.200> there<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.829> quite<00:02:23.129> a

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
interesting because there was quite a

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.130 
interesting because there was quite a
fuss<00:02:23.519> around<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.000> change<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.930> was

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
fuss around the change and it was

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.220 
fuss around the change and it was
originally<00:02:25.739> thought<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> pretty

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
originally thought to be a pretty

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.959 
originally thought to be a pretty
significant<00:02:28.230> change<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:29.280> her<00:02:29.400> win<00:02:29.579> read<00:02:29.760> only

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
significant change but her win read only

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.140 
significant change but her win read only
dropped<00:02:30.480> by<00:02:30.750> half<00:02:31.139> a<00:02:31.409> percent<00:02:31.950> which<00:02:32.579> really

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
dropped by half a percent which really

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.509 
dropped by half a percent which really
isn't<00:02:33.420> significant<00:02:34.079> at<00:02:34.260> all<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.739> be<00:02:34.769> honest<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
isn't significant at all to be honest I

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.190 
isn't significant at all to be honest I
think<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.060> thing<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.299> happened<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.049> that

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
think the thing that happened is that

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.170 
think the thing that happened is that
our<00:02:37.349> ultimate<00:02:37.769> was<00:02:37.980> never<00:02:38.310> really<00:02:38.670> her<00:02:38.969> main

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
our ultimate was never really her main

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.479 
our ultimate was never really her main
strength<00:02:39.659> her<00:02:40.200> main<00:02:40.379> strength<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.859> having<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
strength her main strength is having the

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.580 
strength her main strength is having the
area<00:02:41.909> of<00:02:42.030> effect<00:02:42.150> damage<00:02:42.629> on<00:02:43.260> her<00:02:43.379> auto

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
area of effect damage on her auto

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.110 
area of effect damage on her auto
attacks<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.250> well<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.549> having<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.909> lot<00:02:45.090> of

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
attacks as well as having a lot of

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.330 
attacks as well as having a lot of
utility<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.750> her<00:02:45.840> kit<00:02:46.079> inherently<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
utility in her kit inherently the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.039 
utility in her kit inherently the
ultimate<00:02:47.730> was<00:02:47.879> kind<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:48.689> a<00:02:48.810> bonus

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
ultimate was kind of just a bonus

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.170 
ultimate was kind of just a bonus
feature<00:02:49.379> that<00:02:49.650> helped<00:02:49.950> out<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.099> bit<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.579> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
feature that helped out a bit and the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.240 
feature that helped out a bit and the
thing<00:02:51.389> is<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:52.169> the<00:02:52.349> change<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:53.099> only

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
thing is is that the change really only

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.550 
thing is is that the change really only
hurts<00:02:53.639> her<00:02:53.790> ultimate<00:02:54.239> sin<00:02:54.450> Lane<00:02:54.720> since<00:02:55.379> in

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
hurts her ultimate sin Lane since in

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.170 
hurts her ultimate sin Lane since in
teamfights<00:02:55.769> who<00:02:56.099> would<00:02:56.340> usually<00:02:56.579> be<00:02:56.760> able<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
teamfights who would usually be able to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.209 
teamfights who would usually be able to
get<00:02:57.329> off<00:02:57.450> long<00:02:57.720> range<00:02:58.019> Ultimates<00:02:58.439> anyways<00:02:58.919> and

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
get off long range Ultimates anyways and

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.190 
get off long range Ultimates anyways and
the<00:02:59.819> thing<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.269> her<00:03:00.450> laning<00:03:00.750> phase<00:03:00.900> was

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the thing is that her laning phase was

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.229 
the thing is that her laning phase was
never<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:01.919> great<00:03:02.280> anyways<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.000> she's

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
never really great anyways and she's

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.929 
never really great anyways and she's
still<00:03:03.959> succeeded<00:03:04.560> despite<00:03:04.709> bad<00:03:05.219> so<00:03:05.790> this

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
still succeeded despite bad so this

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.849 
still succeeded despite bad so this
change<00:03:06.239> doesn't<00:03:06.689> really<00:03:06.870> affect<00:03:07.319> how<00:03:07.560> she's

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
change doesn't really affect how she's

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.800 
change doesn't really affect how she's
going<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.159> win<00:03:08.400> games<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.909> overall<00:03:09.659> has

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
going to win games and overall has

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.170 
going to win games and overall has
proven<00:03:10.169> to<00:03:10.469> be<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.620> much<00:03:11.010> smaller<00:03:11.400> nerf<00:03:11.760> than<00:03:12.030> it

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
proven to be a much smaller nerf than it

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.879

sustain it fixed a major problem that he

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.059 
sustain it fixed a major problem that he
had<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.540> jungle<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.229> as<00:03:22.530> such<00:03:22.769> as<00:03:22.919> win

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069

had in the jungle and as such as win
rate<00:03:23.220> has<00:03:23.370> risen<00:03:23.579> by<00:03:23.879> about<00:03:23.909> two<00:03:24.299> percent<00:03:24.510> it's

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
rate has risen by about two percent it's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.080 
rate has risen by about two percent it's
still<00:03:25.590> fairly<00:03:25.979> low<00:03:26.370> though<00:03:26.579> but<00:03:26.879> that's

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
still fairly low though but that's

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.550 
still fairly low though but that's
mainly<00:03:27.299> due<00:03:27.599> to<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.810> fact<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.109> kha'zix

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
mainly due to the fact that kha'zix

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.990 
mainly due to the fact that kha'zix
doesn't<00:03:28.889> really<00:03:29.040> benefit<00:03:29.430> from<00:03:29.459> building

doesn't really benefit from building
cinderhulk<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.139> we<00:03:31.260> asked<00:03:31.409> to<00:03:31.470> take<00:03:31.680> some

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
cinderhulk and so we asked to take some

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.219 
cinderhulk and so we asked to take some
sub<00:03:32.310> optimal<00:03:32.879> build<00:03:33.150> paths<00:03:33.419> for<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> jungle

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.759 
champion it's going to be interesting to
see<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.299> direction<00:03:36.689> kha'zix<00:03:37.319> takes<00:03:37.590> at<00:03:37.739> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
see the direction kha'zix takes at the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.679 
see the direction kha'zix takes at the
competitive<00:03:38.099> level<00:03:38.609> since<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.299> least<00:03:39.449> think

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
competitive level since I at least think

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.300 
competitive level since I at least think
he's<00:03:39.840> actually<00:03:40.019> pretty<00:03:40.530> strong<00:03:40.889> now<00:03:43.189> next<00:03:44.189> up

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
he's actually pretty strong now next up

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.099 
he's actually pretty strong now next up
we<00:03:44.459> have<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.639> mordekaiser<00:03:45.299> change<00:03:45.689> which<00:03:45.930> was

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
we have the mordekaiser change which was

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.679 
we have the mordekaiser change which was
a<00:03:46.139> major<00:03:46.500> quality<00:03:47.189> of<00:03:47.370> life<00:03:47.639> buff<00:03:47.909> to<00:03:48.120> his<00:03:48.239> w

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
a major quality of life buff to his w

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.050 
a major quality of life buff to his w
after<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.680> his<00:03:49.889> win<00:03:50.069> rate<00:03:50.099> actually<00:03:50.639> rose<00:03:50.849> by

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
after this his win rate actually rose by

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.879 
after this his win rate actually rose by
about<00:03:51.090> three<00:03:51.599> percent<00:03:51.810> which<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.439> pretty<00:03:52.709> big

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
about three percent which is pretty big

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.830 
about three percent which is pretty big
it<00:03:53.159> helps<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.819> fluidity<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.299> his<00:03:54.479> kit<00:03:54.689> by<00:03:54.810> a

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
it helps the fluidity of his kit by a

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.839 
it helps the fluidity of his kit by a
lot<00:03:55.199> actually<00:03:55.439> which<00:03:55.889> I<00:03:55.979> guess<00:03:56.250> was<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.489> major

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
lot actually which I guess was a major

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.789 
lot actually which I guess was a major
problem<00:03:57.239> for<00:03:57.389> him<00:03:57.479> before<00:03:57.840> now<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.500> actually

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
problem for him before now I actually

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.890 
problem for him before now I actually
feel<00:03:59.099> really<00:03:59.310> bad<00:03:59.579> about<00:03:59.609> this<00:04:00.000> one<00:04:00.180> because<00:04:00.419> i

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
feel really bad about this one because i

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.390 
feel really bad about this one because i
thought<00:04:01.109> this<00:04:01.290> change<00:04:01.590> would<00:04:01.769> be<00:04:01.919> minor<00:04:02.159> in

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
thought this change would be minor in

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.759 
thought this change would be minor in
insignificant<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.870> didn't<00:04:04.199> actually<00:04:04.290> cover

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
insignificant so I didn't actually cover

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.369 
insignificant so I didn't actually cover
it<00:04:04.949> in<00:04:05.069> my<00:04:05.189> patch<00:04:05.430> rundown<00:04:05.699> so<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.329> I<00:04:06.720> apologize

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
it in my patch rundown so I I apologize

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.559 
it in my patch rundown so I I apologize
for<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.879> fortunately<00:04:08.879> I<00:04:08.909> was<00:04:09.209> wrong<00:04:09.359> though

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
for that fortunately I was wrong though

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.449 
for that fortunately I was wrong though
since<00:04:09.840> Mordekaiser<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.530> an<00:04:10.650> awesome<00:04:11.040> champion

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
since Mordekaiser is an awesome champion

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.839 
since Mordekaiser is an awesome champion
and<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:11.699> think<00:04:11.909> he's<00:04:12.000> now<00:04:12.150> pretty<00:04:12.479> strong<00:04:13.849> after

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
and I think he's now pretty strong after

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.339 
and I think he's now pretty strong after
that<00:04:14.970> we<00:04:15.150> have<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.269> cylon<00:04:15.720> nerve<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.169> looks

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
that we have the cylon nerve it looks

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.899 
that we have the cylon nerve it looks
like<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.590> hit<00:04:16.650> him<00:04:16.709> decently<00:04:16.979> hard<00:04:17.430> as<00:04:17.579> his<00:04:17.699> win

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
like it hit him decently hard as his win

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.279 
like it hit him decently hard as his win
rate<00:04:17.940> dropped<00:04:18.389> by<00:04:18.570> about<00:04:18.599> three<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.139> four

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
rate dropped by about three to four

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.170 
rate dropped by about three to four
percent<00:04:19.440> or<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:19.829> he's<00:04:20.489> definitely<00:04:20.759> still

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
percent or so he's definitely still

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.209 
percent or so he's definitely still
viable<00:04:21.419> but<00:04:22.019> he<00:04:22.109> has<00:04:22.229> been<00:04:22.440> quite<00:04:22.800> clearly

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
viable but he has been quite clearly

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.279 
viable but he has been quite clearly
dethroned<00:04:23.820> from<00:04:24.029> the<00:04:24.150> god<00:04:24.450> tier<00:04:24.779> top<00:04:25.050> lane

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
the nerf has heard I'm quite a bit next

the nerf has heard I'm quite a bit next
up<00:04:33.570> we<00:04:33.750> have<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.960> Yasuo<00:04:34.620> change<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.220> initially

up we have the Yasuo change I initially

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.010 
up we have the Yasuo change I initially
thought<00:04:35.639> this<00:04:36.000> would<00:04:36.180> be<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.330> really<00:04:36.449> small

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
thought this would be a really small

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.659 
thought this would be a really small
buff<00:04:37.289> but<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.830> lot<00:04:38.009> of<00:04:38.039> people<00:04:38.130> said<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.550> was<00:04:38.580> a

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
buff but a lot of people said it was a

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.640 
buff but a lot of people said it was a
nerf<00:04:38.910> in<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.570> end<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.840> looks<00:04:39.990> like<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:40.320> was<00:04:40.440> a

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
nerf in the end it looks like it was a

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.680 
nerf in the end it looks like it was a

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
about one percent this overall win rate

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.070 
about one percent this overall win rate
was<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.639> really<00:04:50.940> changed<00:04:51.240> at<00:04:51.330> all<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.660> so

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
was and really changed at all and so

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.840 
was and really changed at all and so
it's<00:04:52.229> interesting<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.800> see<00:04:52.979> how<00:04:53.220> this<00:04:53.490> change

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
it's interesting to see how this change

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.790 
it's interesting to see how this change
impacted<00:04:54.539> Yasuo<00:04:54.900> depending<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.560> where<00:04:55.710> you

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
impacted Yasuo depending on where you

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.740 
impacted Yasuo depending on where you
actually<00:04:55.919> land<00:04:56.310> with<00:04:56.490> him<00:04:56.639> however<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.600> do

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
actually land with him however I do

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.600 
actually land with him however I do
think<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:58.139> looking<00:04:58.560> back<00:04:58.620> on<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.979> overall<00:04:59.370> it

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
think that looking back on it overall it

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.540 
think that looking back on it overall it
seems<00:04:59.639> that<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.180> was<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:01.010> somewhat<00:05:02.010> small<00:05:02.310> nerf

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
seems that it was a somewhat small nerf

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.080 
seems that it was a somewhat small nerf
and<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:05.220> last<00:05:05.400> change<00:05:05.639> I<00:05:05.699> want<00:05:05.789> to<00:05:05.910> talk<00:05:06.060> about
