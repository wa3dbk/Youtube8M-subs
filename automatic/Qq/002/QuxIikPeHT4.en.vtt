00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.090 

here's<00:00:00.840> something<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.260> finally<00:00:01.589> figured<00:00:01.920> out

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
here's something I finally figured out

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.949 
here's something I finally figured out
out<00:00:02.310> of<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.429> know<00:00:02.550> if<00:00:02.610> anybody<00:00:03.030> had<00:00:03.449> ever<00:00:03.720> had

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
out of a know if anybody had ever had

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.990 
out of a know if anybody had ever had
the<00:00:04.049> situation<00:00:04.680> let's<00:00:05.430> just<00:00:05.640> say<00:00:05.790> we're

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
the situation let's just say we're

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.880 
the situation let's just say we're
making<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.420> ring<00:00:06.629> here<00:00:06.899> we<00:00:07.109> got<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:07.440> far<00:00:07.649> with

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
making a ring here we got this far with

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.610 
making a ring here we got this far with
it<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.550> we're<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.820> connect<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:09.620> right

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
it and we're going to connect this right

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.690 
it and we're going to connect this right
here<00:00:11.360> we'll<00:00:12.360> go<00:00:12.509> from<00:00:12.660> there<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.200> there<00:00:13.700> and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
here we'll go from there and there and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.599 
here we'll go from there and there and
we're<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.059> gonna<00:00:15.299> want<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.870> make<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.609> like

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
we're just gonna want to make it like

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.099 
we're just gonna want to make it like
that<00:00:19.490> and<00:00:20.490> then<00:00:20.850> let's<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.300> mirror<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.960> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
that and then let's just mirror it to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.630 
that and then let's just mirror it to
the<00:00:22.199> other<00:00:22.320> side<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:22.949> sake<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.279> discussion

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the other side for sake of discussion

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.750 
the other side for sake of discussion
right<00:00:24.330> now<00:00:26.779> all<00:00:27.779> right<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.460> it<00:00:29.460> looks<00:00:29.670> pretty

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
right now all right now it looks pretty

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.420 
right now all right now it looks pretty
good<00:00:30.320> let's<00:00:31.320> extrude<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.309> we

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
good let's extrude it and see what we

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.700 
good let's extrude it and see what we
get<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.980> doesn't<00:00:35.520> matter<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:35.969> point

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
get here it doesn't matter at this point

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.600 
get here it doesn't matter at this point
now<00:00:37.710> even<00:00:38.309> though<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.670> put<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.030> together

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
now even though we put this together

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.340 
now even though we put this together
when<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.700> go<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> mill<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.180> you're<00:00:42.840> actually

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
when you go to mill it you're actually

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.650 
when you go to mill it you're actually
gonna<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.160> little<00:00:44.550> crease<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:45.149> there

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.270 

and<00:00:49.940> let's<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.030> why<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.860> how<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.039> can

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and let's see why that is and how we can

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.279 
and let's see why that is and how we can
get<00:00:53.399> around<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> undo<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.079> now<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.170> we

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
get around that so undo that now if we

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.610 
get around that so undo that now if we
look<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.680> curve<00:00:59.270> right<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.530> put<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
look at this curve right here put the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.390 
look at this curve right here put the
analyse<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:03.320> go<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> curvature<00:01:05.159> graph

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
analyse on go with the curvature graph

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.440 
analyse on go with the curvature graph
on<00:01:06.650> well<00:01:07.650> first<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> all<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.640> sorry<00:01:09.090> let's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
on well first of all I'm sorry let's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.289 
on well first of all I'm sorry let's
just<00:01:09.810> join<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:11.360> these<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.630> here

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
just join all these these right here

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.830 
just join all these these right here
yeah<00:01:15.330> let's<00:01:15.810> join<00:01:17.360> I'm<00:01:18.360> sorry<00:01:18.630> about<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
yeah let's join I'm sorry about that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770 
yeah let's join I'm sorry about that
there<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.759> let's<00:01:20.909> turn<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.240> curvature

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
there we go now let's turn on curvature

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.040 
there we go now let's turn on curvature
graph<00:01:22.020> on

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.190 

take<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> look<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.190> got<00:01:26.990> now<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
take a look what we got now as you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.280 
take a look what we got now as you
notice<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.590> area<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.160> here<00:01:29.900> this<00:01:30.900> gap

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
notice this area right here this gap

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.370 
notice this area right here this gap
right<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:32.660> that's<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.900> reason<00:01:34.260> we're

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
right there that's the reason we're

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.040 
right there that's the reason we're
having<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.890> issue<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.300> smoothness<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
having that issue with the smoothness of

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.440 
having that issue with the smoothness of
our<00:01:37.170> surface<00:01:37.580> here's<00:01:38.580> one<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.300> we<00:01:39.420> might

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
our surface here's one way that we might

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.650 
our surface here's one way that we might
be<00:01:39.660> able<00:01:39.870> to<00:01:40.050> correct<00:01:40.230> that<00:01:41.150> if<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.450> into

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
be able to correct that if we go into

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.350 
be able to correct that if we go into
the<00:01:43.320> curve<00:01:43.650> tools<00:01:46.100> let's<00:01:47.100> rebuild<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.850> curve

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the curve tools let's rebuild this curve

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.700 
the curve tools let's rebuild this curve
right<00:01:48.690> here<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.670> bring<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.660> down<00:01:51.690> it's<00:01:52.440> not<00:01:52.650> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
right here and bring it down it's not a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.510 
right here and bring it down it's not a
couple<00:01:53.190> hit<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.520> preview<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:56.160> sake<00:01:56.370> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
couple hit to preview and for sake of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.290 
couple hit to preview and for sake of
this<00:01:56.610> demonstration<00:01:56.910> let's<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.960> say<00:01:58.110> okay

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
this demonstration let's just say okay

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.110 
this demonstration let's just say okay
so<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.750> much<00:02:00.960> smoother<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:02.120> let's

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
so you see it's much smoother now let's

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.370 
so you see it's much smoother now let's
go<00:02:03.300> with<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> fair<00:02:03.810> curve<00:02:04.880> hit<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:07.320> I

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
go with the fair curve hit that and I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.730 
go with the fair curve hit that and I
use<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.890> tolerance<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.490> 0.5<00:02:10.220> anomie<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:12.590> as<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
use a tolerance of 0.5 anomie and as you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.510 
use a tolerance of 0.5 anomie and as you
can<00:02:13.890> see<00:02:13.950> right<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:15.710> much<00:02:16.710> smoother<00:02:17.280> now

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
can see right there much smoother now

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.370 
can see right there much smoother now
let's<00:02:17.790> extrude<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.390> out<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.870> see<00:02:19.140> what<00:02:19.260> that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
let's extrude that out and see what that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:28.830 
let's extrude that out and see what that
looks<00:02:19.440> like

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.260 

now<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.099> see<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:32.849> perfectly<00:02:33.849> smooth

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
now as you see that perfectly smooth

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.960 
now as you see that perfectly smooth
ring<00:02:35.050> now<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:37.239> do<00:02:37.360> one<00:02:37.510> more<00:02:37.660> example<00:02:37.720> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
ring now but do one more example and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.660 
ring now but do one more example and
show<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.300> more<00:02:40.330> time<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:45.190> as

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
show you one more time on that and as

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
show you one more time on that and as
you<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.849> see<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:48.130> see<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.580> seam<00:02:48.910> right<00:02:48.940> there

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
you can see you see the seam right there

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.460 
you can see you see the seam right there
on<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.250> render<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:52.360> opposed<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.200> view

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
on the render as opposed to this view

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.910 
on the render as opposed to this view
right<00:02:53.739> here<00:02:54.720> no<00:02:55.720> seam<00:02:56.140> I'm<00:02:56.440> gonna<00:02:56.590> show<00:02:56.830> you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
right here no seam I'm gonna show you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.350 
right here no seam I'm gonna show you
another<00:02:57.160> model<00:02:57.640> real<00:02:57.819> quick<00:02:59.850> okay<00:03:00.850> now<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.060> drew

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
another model real quick okay now I drew

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.699 
another model real quick okay now I drew
these<00:03:02.040> curves<00:03:03.040> right<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.650> looks

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
these curves right here and it looks

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.050 
these curves right here and it looks
pretty<00:03:06.010> good<00:03:06.160> right<00:03:06.220> here<00:03:06.610> looks<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:06.880> it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
pretty good right here looks like it

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.300 
pretty good right here looks like it
might<00:03:07.209> be<00:03:07.330> pretty<00:03:07.510> nice<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.590> let's<00:03:08.709> see<00:03:09.040> once

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
might be pretty nice but let's see once

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.729 
might be pretty nice but let's see once
I<00:03:09.489> extruded<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.150> out<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:12.340> can<00:03:12.549> see<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:14.380> seam

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
I extruded it out you can see the seam

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.220 
I extruded it out you can see the seam
right<00:03:14.769> there<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:16.420> it's<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.810> little<00:03:16.989> choppy

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
right there and it's a little choppy

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.949 
right there and it's a little choppy
there<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.980> could<00:03:18.220> be<00:03:18.400> maybe<00:03:18.730> smoother<00:03:19.299> so

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
there it could be maybe smoother so

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.690 
there it could be maybe smoother so
let's<00:03:20.110> look<00:03:20.230> at<00:03:20.410> take<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> look<00:03:20.890> at<00:03:20.980> how<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.160> fix

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
let's look at take a look at how to fix

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.479 
let's look at take a look at how to fix
that<00:03:21.940> problem<00:03:22.410> once<00:03:23.410> again<00:03:23.709> go<00:03:23.860> back<00:03:24.069> onto<00:03:24.280> our

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
that problem once again go back onto our

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.370 
that problem once again go back onto our
curve<00:03:25.239> graph<00:03:26.220> select<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.959> can<00:03:29.140> see

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
curve graph select this and you can see

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.039 
curve graph select this and you can see
our<00:03:29.920> gap<00:03:30.310> right<00:03:30.610> there<00:03:30.670> that's<00:03:31.360> no<00:03:31.569> good<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:31.840> a

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
our gap right there that's no good for a

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.900 
our gap right there that's no good for a
smooth<00:03:32.380> surface<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.130> that's<00:03:33.340> pretty<00:03:33.609> jagged

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
smooth surface and that's pretty jagged

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.120 
smooth surface and that's pretty jagged
II<00:03:34.150> -<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.650> let's<00:03:35.799> rebuild<00:03:36.190> this<00:03:36.400> curve<00:03:38.130> and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
II - so let's rebuild this curve and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.900 
II - so let's rebuild this curve and
stick<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.700> down<00:03:39.880> maybe<00:03:40.570> 12<00:03:41.470> get<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:41.980> preview<00:03:42.280> you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
stick it down maybe 12 get a preview you

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.520 
stick it down maybe 12 get a preview you
can<00:03:42.940> see<00:03:43.120> how<00:03:43.359> it<00:03:43.480> changed<00:03:43.900> here<00:03:44.079> maybe<00:03:44.260> go<00:03:44.500> up

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
can see how it changed here maybe go up

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.750 
can see how it changed here maybe go up
to<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.769> 13<00:03:45.959> all<00:03:46.959> right<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.560> have<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> live<00:03:48.609> with<00:03:48.640> a

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
to a 13 all right I have to live with a

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.970 
to a 13 all right I have to live with a
little<00:03:48.940> bit<00:03:49.209> let's<00:03:49.600> see<00:03:49.810> what<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:49.959> was<00:03:51.510> 15

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
little bit let's see what that was 15

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.740 
little bit let's see what that was 15
you<00:03:53.980> could<00:03:54.190> maybe<00:03:54.400> do<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.790> there<00:03:55.030> -<00:03:55.299> let's<00:03:55.630> just

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
you could maybe do it there - let's just

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.790 
you could maybe do it there - let's just
say<00:03:55.930> okay<00:03:57.269> no<00:03:58.530> fair<00:03:59.530> your<00:03:59.799> curve

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.050 

and<00:04:03.250> there<00:04:03.790> was<00:04:04.270> a<00:04:04.300> tolerance<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.810> 50<00:04:06.060> turn

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
and there was a tolerance of 50 turn

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.830 
and there was a tolerance of 50 turn
that<00:04:07.240> off

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
that off

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.339 
that off
let's<00:04:08.410> mirror<00:04:08.770> that

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.210 

now<00:04:14.749> let's<00:04:15.749> do<00:04:16.019> our<00:04:16.049> extrude<00:04:17.690> whoops<00:04:19.039> to<00:04:20.039> our

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
now let's do our extrude whoops to our

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.200 
now let's do our extrude whoops to our
extrude

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.270 

now<00:04:25.840> as<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.289> can<00:04:26.470> see<00:04:27.780> no<00:04:28.780> scene<00:04:29.199> there's<00:04:30.070> our

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
now as you can see no scene there's our

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.420 
now as you can see no scene there's our
original<00:04:31.560> there<00:04:32.560> seemed<00:04:32.949> a<00:04:34.830> much<00:04:35.830> smoother

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
original there seemed a much smoother

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.840 
original there seemed a much smoother
model<00:04:38.009> so<00:04:39.009> that's<00:04:39.190> something<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.520> think<00:04:39.580> about

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
model so that's something to think about

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.840 
model so that's something to think about
when<00:04:40.180> designing<00:04:40.919> give<00:04:41.919> it<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.130> little<00:04:42.310> insight

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
when designing give it a little insight

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.120 
when designing give it a little insight
there
